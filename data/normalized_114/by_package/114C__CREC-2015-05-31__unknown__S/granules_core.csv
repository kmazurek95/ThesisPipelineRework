CREC-2015-05-31-pt1-PgS3324,CREC-2015-05-31,114,NATIONAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 85 (Sunday, May 31, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S3324] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL SECURITY LEGISLATION Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are here facing yet another manufactured crisis with the vitally important PATRIOT Act provision set to expire in a matter of hours. In fact, we have less than 8 hours before the expiration of this critical national security program. That is what we are faced with. Tonight's deadline is certainly no surprise. As the junior Senator from Utah, a Republican, noted: ``We've known for four years that this deadline was approaching.'' Like so many other occasions in which brinksmanship has pushed the Senate and our Nation to the precipice, the dilemma we now face was completely avoidable. The job of the leader is to have a plan. In this case, it is clear the majority leader simply didn't have a plan. The majority leader had 5 months to introduce a bill from committee that would reform and extend the expiring PATRIOT Act provisions, but instead he bypassed the committees altogether and brought this to the floor unilaterally, with no committee hearing--none. The majority leader recently said no more rule XIVs, but that pledge has not lasted very long, has it. The majority leader had, I repeat, 5 months. In fact, my friend, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee and a dean of the Senate, said this could have passed so easily in the last 2 years. The majority leader had 5 months during the time he has been the majority leader to coordinate with the House, which passed FISA reform weeks ago, but instead he went it alone. In fact, it is as if the House and Senate Republican leaders appear to be on different pages. Everyone saw this coming. Weeks ago, it was clear the Senate didn't have adequate time to consider trade legislation, surveillance legislation, and, of course, the highway bill before the Memorial Day recess. I said that and others said that. Listen to what one Republican Congressman said. His name is Reid Ribble. He could have handled it better by being more prepared in advance for it. They ran out the clock basically by working on trade first; he probably should have ran the clock out on [surveillance] instead. I don't know what his strategy is here. I'm a little bit flummoxed. I say to my friend, Congressman Ribble, that he is not the only one who is flummoxed; so are we. The Senate majority leader set up a collision course with no plan on how to resolve it. It seems the only plan the majority leader had on FISA was to jam it through last Friday night; this, despite the fact that an overwhelming majority of House Members oppose an extension, the President opposes an extension, and a dozen Senate Republicans oppose an extension and so voted last Friday. Is it any wonder, then, that even the majority leader's own Republican Senators felt it necessary to take matters into their own hands? The majority leader was also caught off guard by a Member of his own Republican conference last week who refused to allow the Senate to extend the provisions for a program that the Second Circuit has determined is illegal. But, again, the junior Senator from Kentucky did not hide his thoughts. He was on the floor for 10 hours or so. I disagree with the junior Senator from Kentucky, but we are not in the mess today because of the junior Senator of Kentucky; we are in the mess we are today because of the majority leader. The majority leader should have seen this coming. Everyone else did, even those in his own party. Meanwhile, the Republican leader has repeatedly lectured this body as to how it should function, but his actions have helped the Senate to not function. We can do without more lectures and defiant statements. We can do with more strategy, planning, and open lines of communication because it is the majority leader's job to have a plan and to prioritize what must get done over what he would like to get done. In this case, my friend from Kentucky simply did not have a plan, and that is why we are here staring down the barrel of yet another unnecessary manufactured crisis that threatens our national security. We heard what the head of the CIA said today on a Sunday show. He said he is afraid something will happen when this act expires. That is not just my assessment of the situation. This is from the head of the CIA. Senate Republicans even feel the same way. The Republican junior Senator from Montana said yesterday: We could have done this a week ago. And this is the nature of Washington, D.C., always managing by crisis. Fortunately, there is a clear way out: pass the USA FREEDOM Act, which the House overwhelmingly passed with 338 votes on a totally bipartisan basis. All we need are a few more Republican Senators to vote with Democrats and the bill will pass. Just three, maybe four, maybe five--but a few Senators is all we need to bring this unnecessary crisis to a screaming halt. I am confident we can pass this bill if the majority leader will bring it to the floor for a fair vote. Now, procedurally, it is going to be extremely difficult to not have this bill--this law expire. This is not a bill; this is a law that is expiring. Any other course than just passing this bill would require the House to act before midnight. They are not here, so it is not going to happen. There is not a quorum of House Members, and there are House Members who will object to a unanimous consent request anyway. Passing the USA FREEDOM Act is the only way I can foresee where the PATRIOT Act provisions do not expire.

Mr. President, we are here facing yet another manufactured crisis with the vitally important PATRIOT Act provision set to expire in a matter of hours. In fact, we have less than 8 hours before the expiration of this critical national security program. That is what we are faced with. Tonight's deadline is certainly no surprise. As the junior Senator from Utah, a Republican, noted: ``We've known for four years that this deadline was approaching.'' Like so many other occasions in which brinksmanship has pushed the Senate and our Nation to the precipice, the dilemma we now face was completely avoidable. The job of the leader is to have a plan. In this case, it is clear the majority leader simply didn't have a plan. The majority leader had 5 months to introduce a bill from committee that would reform and extend the expiring PATRIOT Act provisions, but instead he bypassed the committees altogether and brought this to the floor unilaterally, with no committee hearing--none. The majority leader recently said no more rule XIVs, but that pledge has not lasted very long, has it. The majority leader had, I repeat, 5 months. In fact, my friend, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee and a dean of the Senate, said this could have passed so easily in the last 2 years. The majority leader had 5 months during the time he has been the majority leader to coordinate with the House, which passed FISA reform weeks ago, but instead he went it alone. In fact, it is as if the House and Senate Republican leaders appear to be on different pages. Everyone saw this coming. Weeks ago, it was clear the Senate didn't have adequate time to consider trade legislation, surveillance legislation, and, of course, the highway bill before the Memorial Day recess. I said that and others said that. Listen to what one Republican Congressman said. His name is Reid Ribble. He could have handled it better by being more prepared in advance for it. They ran out the clock basically by working on trade first; he probably should have ran the clock out on [surveillance] instead. I don't know what his strategy is here. I'm a little bit flummoxed. I say to my friend, Congressman Ribble, that he is not the only one who is flummoxed; so are we. The Senate majority leader set up a collision course with no plan on how to resolve it. It seems the only plan the majority leader had on FISA was to jam it through last Friday night; this, despite the fact that an overwhelming majority of House Members oppose an extension, the President opposes an extension, and a dozen Senate Republicans oppose an extension and so voted last Friday. Is it any wonder, then, that even the majority leader's own Republican Senators felt it necessary to take matters into their own hands? The majority leader was also caught off guard by a Member of his own Republican conference last week who refused to allow the Senate to extend the provisions for a program that the Second Circuit has determined is illegal. But, again, the junior Senator from Kentucky did not hide his thoughts. He was on the floor for 10 hours or so. I disagree with the junior Senator from Kentucky, but we are not in the mess today because of the junior Senator of Kentucky; we are in the mess we are today because of the majority leader. The majority leader should have seen this coming. Everyone else did, even those in his own party. Meanwhile, the Republican leader has repeatedly lectured this body as to how it should function, but his actions have helped the Senate to not function. We can do without more lectures and defiant statements. We can do with more strategy, planning, and open lines of communication because it is the majority leader's job to have a plan and to prioritize what must get done over what he would like to get done. In this case, my friend from Kentucky simply did not have a plan, and that is why we are here staring down the barrel of yet another unnecessary manufactured crisis that threatens our national security. We heard what the head of the CIA said today on a Sunday show. He said he is afraid something will happen when this act expires. That is not just my assessment of the situation. This is from the head of the CIA. Senate Republicans even feel the same way. The Republican junior Senator from Montana said yesterday: We could have done this a week ago. And this is the nature of Washington, D.C., always managing by crisis. Fortunately, there is a clear way out: pass the USA FREEDOM Act, which the House overwhelmingly passed with 338 votes on a totally bipartisan basis. All we need are a few more Republican Senators to vote with Democrats and the bill will pass. Just three, maybe four, maybe five--but a few Senators is all we need to bring this unnecessary crisis to a screaming halt. I am confident we can pass this bill if the majority leader will bring it to the floor for a fair vote. Now, procedurally, it is going to be extremely difficult to not have this bill--this law expire. This is not a bill; this is a law that is expiring. Any other course than just passing this bill would require the House to act before midnight. They are not here, so it is not going to happen. There is not a quorum of House Members, and there are House Members who will object to a unanimous consent request anyway. Passing the USA FREEDOM Act is the only way I can foresee where the PATRIOT Act provisions do not expire. Now is the time for the majority leader to do what is right for the privacy and security of all Americans.

Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 2048, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 87, H.R. 2048, a bill to reform the authorities of the Federal Government to require the production of certain business records, conduct electronic surveillance, use pen registers and trap and trace devices, and use other forms of information gathering for foreign intelligence, counterterrorism, and criminal purposes, and for other purposes. The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader. Mr. LEAHY. I ask, through the Chair, if the Democratic leader will yield to me for a comment. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the Senator for a comment. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was struck by what the Democratic leader said. He laid out the history of this. We are here in a manufactured, unnecessary crisis. It is a manufactured, unnecessary crisis Last year, by an overwhelming majority, the Senate voted to make improvements to the PATRIOT Act. The legislation made reforms to the provisions that have now been declared illegal. We did that but could not get past a filibuster. We had 58 votes. Normally, you think of 51 votes being enough to pass a bill. The Democratic leader will recall how hard he worked to try to get that bill through. The Republican leader said: No, we will wait until next year. Well, next year came. We have wasted so much time. There has not been a single public hearing. There has not been any action on an alternative to the USA FREEDOM Act. But, I say to my friend from Nevada, he is absolutely right when he says the House passed the USA FREEDOM Act by a 4 to 1 margin. It was an overwhelming vote, Republicans and Democrats together, to get rid of the illegal parts of the PATRIOT Act, to pass an improvement. We ought to just take up the USA FREEDOM Act and pass it. If we were allowed to have a straight up-or-down vote in this body, I guarantee you, a majority of Senators--both parties--would vote for it. So I just wanted to say that while the leader was on the floor. I now ask for recognition in my own right. [[Page S3325]] The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, before I begin my comments on the USA FREEDOM Act, I am going to speak for a moment on a personal matter. Remembering Beau Biden Mr. President, Marcelle and I have known Beau Biden since he was a child. I am the longest serving Member of this Senate. When I came here, there was one Senator who was one term senior to me; that was Joe Biden. I knew of the tragedy his family had gone through, and I cherished the times, with his office right near mine, when his sons Beau and Hunter would be there with him. I watched them grow up. I saw Beau Biden become the epitome of what a State's attorney general should be. That is a model all attorneys general throughout the country could have followed. Progressive, worried about improving the law, improving peoples' lives--he did that. I know how much we appreciated it when we would see him and Hallie at an event, when Marcelle and I would get a chance to talk with them. It was like picking up a conversation that had ended just a few minutes before. I remember one thing especially about Beau. I was in Iraq during the war. It was a day when it was well over 100 degrees outside. I was being brought to a place where there was going to be a briefing, being zipped into this building. There were a number of soldiers wearing T- shirts, shorts, and sidearms playing ball outside in this 110-, 120- degree heat. As I went to the door, one of them turned around and gave me a big wave with his arm blocking his face. I was not sure who it was. I kind of waved back. Pretty soon, he came to the door. It was Beau Biden. I remember we gave each other a big hug. He was there as a captain in the Delaware Reserves. He was decorated for his service. We talked about what he was doing. He was praising the men and women who worked there. Nothing about anything he might be doing; he was praising everybody else. It was such a refreshing moment being with him, and it was so typical of who he was as a person. I told him that I have a procedure that if I am in another country and I am with our military, that if there are Vermonters there, I always take their names and I ask them if they have family back home in Vermont. Most of them do. I get their phone number, and as soon as I get back, I call their mother or their father, their husband or their wife, brother or sister, whoever it might be, and say: I saw a member of your family; here is what they are doing; they look well, and all that. So I told Beau, I said: Look, I have known you since you were a youngster. I will call your father as soon as I can and tell him you are behaving yourself, and you are doing a good job. We laughed at that. Shortly thereafter, I got on the phone we had available to us to go through the Whitehouse switchboard to reach the Vice President. Then I started to talk about the procedure I have, and Joe Biden started to laugh. He said: I just got an email from Beau that he had seen you there and that I should be expecting a call from you. We talked about what a great job Beau was doing. You could hear the pride in his father's voice. You could hear his pride. It was a pride that was deserved. I remember Joe saying, when we were first here in the Senate--the two of us--he would be going home every night on the train. Why? Not as much even that the kids needed him, but he needed them. Finally, when he met Jill, the boys were telling him: You should marry her. So I grieve for them. Marcelle and I sat there and cried last night when we heard the news. I think, what a wonderful family. I think about a life cut too short--far too short. Mr. President, I can and will say more later. Mr. President, on the matter the distinguished Democratic leader was talking about, the USA FREEDOM Act, let's just take it up and pass it. Opponents of this bipartisan, commonsense legislation have run out of excuses. I see this as a manufactured crisis, and it is. This matter should have been taken up and voted on up or down a month ago. There is only one viable and responsible path remaining: Pass the USA FREEDOM Act that passed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives. Pass it and send it to the President's desk and he will sign it. If we do not pass it, then those parts of the PATRIOT Act that most of us agree on are going to expire at midnight. The irony of it is that the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 is a carefully crafted, bipartisan compromise that both protects Americans' privacy and keeps this country safe. Before they were talking about, we are going to keep the country safe but Americans' privacy--not so much. This is a bill that does both. The legislation would end the NSA's bulk collection of Americans' phone records. It adds significant new reforms to limit government surveillance. It increases transparency and also promotes greater accountability and oversight--something the original PATRIOT Act did not have. The bill is the product of countless hours of painstaking negotiations with key Members--both Republicans and Democrats--in the House and the Senate, men and women I respect so much because they want to do what is best for the country. We have negotiated with the NSA, the FBI, the Justice Department, privacy and civil liberties groups, the technology industry, and other key stakeholders. We brought everybody together. When we began, we wondered if that would be possible. We did it. That is why the USA FREEDOM Act has such strong support, including from groups as diverse as the National Rifle Association and the Center for American Progress. This broad consensus is what we saw by the overwhelming support it received in the House. They passed the USA FREEDOM Act by a vote of 338 to 88. Some in this country say that no branch of government could have a vote that strong to say the Sun rises in the east. Certainly there has been no major piece of legislation in years where we have seen a vote such as that--338 to 88. But now a minority in the Senate has now twice blocked the USA FREEDOM Act from even getting a debate on the Senate floor. We were sent here not to vote maybe but to vote yes or no. Last November, even though we had had all kinds of committee hearings on this, we heard complaints that there had not been enough of a committee process on the bill and that the Senate should wait to address Section 215 under the new Republican leadership. So the Republican leader led a successful filibuster against a bill which still had a majority of Members in this body voting for it. But what has happened in this Congress? Not a single public hearing on this issue; no committee process. And then last weekend, the Senate was blocked from even debating the House-passed bill and considering amendments. Opponents of reform have failed to introduce any legislative alternative to the bipartisan USA FREEDOM Act, the bill which reforms many problems of the PATRIOT Act. They have come up with no legislative alternative other than a clean extension, which we know has no chance of becoming law. Of course, it makes no difference because at midnight it stops being the law. The time for excuses and inaction has passed. The American people and the intelligence community professionals who strive to protect them deserve better. We have a few hours remaining to work things out and pass the USA FREEDOM Act, but there is no room for error. There is very little time. Again, I said it is a manufactured crisis. The deadline to act is midnight tonight. The House will not return to the Capitol until tomorrow, after the deadline has passed. We could talk about passing a 100-year extension if we wanted; it makes no difference because the time will have passed. So if the Senate does not pass the House-passed USA FREEDOM Act or if we amend it in any way, the authorities are going to expire. I have said repeatedly--and my cosponsor of the USA FREEDOM Act, Senator Lee, agrees with me--that we would like to have a debate on our bill and consider amendments. Because opponents of reform have run out the clock and jammed the Senate, we are not left with very much time. Let's get this done today. If we pass the USA FREEDOM Act, the President could sign it tonight and the intelligence community could move forward [[Page S3326]] with the certainty it needs to protect the American people. Some may argue that if you had a short-term extension--which, of course, we do not have--they have said: Well, maybe we could work out some kind of a compromise bill. But let there be no misunderstanding: The USA FREEDOM Act is a solid, carefully negotiated compromise. For all those Senators on either side of the aisle who have not spent the hours and hours and hours, as Senator Lee and I and our staffs have spent, maybe they do not know the work that went into this--again, how you get groups from the left to the right supporting it. It would be irresponsible to kick the can down the road once again, relying on the false hope that the House will agree to pass a short- term extension--something they said they will not do--and that we will somehow be able to agree on a half-baked alternative that has yet to be introduced in either body and most assuredly would not pass the House. So do not be fooled or tempted by the promise of a short-term extension. That would guarantee nothing. Well, wait a minute. I take that back. Passing a short-term extension does guarantee something: It guarantees the expiration of these authorities at midnight tonight. It guarantees more uncertainty, more litigation, more risk for the intelligence community, and a repeat of the chaotic brinksmanship later on down the road with another manufactured crisis. I know there are some who worry that the bill does not go far enough when it comes to reform. Well, then where were they in coming up with a better idea? If this passes, the USA FREEDOM Act would be the most significant set of reforms to government surveillance since the PATRIOT Act was enacted. The reason we are here to even debate it is that then- majority leader Dick Armey in the House and I put in sunset provisions. So we will have to show responsibility and vote, as the House did by a 4-to-1 margin. Our bill--Senator Lee's and my bill--would not just end the NSA's bulk collection under Section 215, it would add new transparency and oversight reforms to other surveillance authorities, and it would be a solid foundation upon which we could build our future reform efforts. I have been in the Senate for more than 40 years. I have learned that when there is a chance to make real progress, we ought to seize it. But I also know we cannot let this be the end of our fight for greater privacy protections, transparency, and accountability. I remain committed to fighting that fight on behalf of Vermonters and all Americans. So the choices before us this evening are clear: Either let these authorities expire completely or pass the USA FREEDOM Act. There is no more time for political maneuvering or fearmongering or scare tactics. It is time for us to do our jobs--to debate and then to vote. Don't duck the vote. Vote up or down on the bill the House gave us. Stand up and be counted either for or against it. As Senators, let's have the courage to do that. The USA FREEDOM Act is a reasonable, responsible way forward, and we should pass it tonight. But don't duck behind not doing anything and pretend that is a solution. I don't think there is a single American, Republican or Democrat, who would believe that was a responsible solution. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am back here during an unprecedented Sunday session hoping we can avoid a totally unnecessary disaster tonight; hoping we will do what is right for the country: Pass the USA FREEDOM Act today. Right now. I will let others speak to the merits of the USA FREEDOM Act. It is our best opportunity to protect the Nation while balancing between privacy and constitutional surveillance. I do support reforming the Patriot Act, but I do not support unilateral disarmament of our Nation's need to know what bad guys with predatory intent are planning against the United States of America. But my comments today are not about standing up for the USA FREEDOM Act. I am here to stand up for the men and women working for the NSA, FBI, and other intelligence agencies essential to protecting our country against terrorist attacks--whether it is a ``lone wolf'' or state sponsored. These dedicated, patriotic intelligence professionals want to operate under rule of law that is constitutional, legal, and authorized. They are ready to do their jobs, but Congress needs to do our job and pass a bill that is constitutional, legal, and authorized. Ever since Edward Snowden made his allegations, the men and women of our intelligence agencies have been vilified as if they were the enemy. They thought they were doing their jobs protecting us against the enemy. Let me tell you--the men and women of the NSA, FBI, and our other intelligence agencies are patriots who have been wrongly vilified by those who don't bother to inform themselves about our national security structures and the vital functions they perform. Now a special word about the NSA, which is headquartered in my home State of Maryland. The 30,000 men and women in the NSA serve in silence--without public accolades. They protect us from cyber attacks. They protect us against terrorist attacks. They support our warfighters. They are Ph.D.'s and scientists. They are linguists, cyber geeks, and whiz kids--the treasured human capital of this Nation. Remember that section 215 is such a small aspect of what the NSA, FBI, and other intelligence agencies do as they stand sentry in cyber space stopping attacks. People act like that is all NSA does. They haven't even bothered to educate themselves as to legality and constitutionality. Congress passed the Patriot Act. President George W. Bush told us it was constitutional. We need good intelligence. In a world of ISIL, Nusra Front, and al Qaeda, the NSA is our front line of defense and the people of NSA make up that front line. There is no evidence of abuse by NSA employees. The men and women of NSA have adhered to the law. They have submitted to oversight, audits, checks and balances, and reviews from Congress and the courts. The employees of NSA know that everything has to be constitutional, legal, and authorized. They thought they were implementing the law, but some in the media and even some in this body have made them feel like they were wrongdoers. I find this infuriating and insulting. Morale has been devastated at NSA. Families have been harassed for working at the NSA and their kids are bullied at school. They have also been devastated by actions of their own government. First, by sequester--then, by the government shutdown. Now, by Congress's failure to reform national security authorities that help them keep our country safe. It is wrong. I want people to remember that tonight as we discuss important reforms. Let us not let them down, once again, with our own failure to act. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is greatly disappointing that the Senate is in session today to reconsider a vote we took before the Memorial Day recess to extend the three expiring provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Instead of passing the USA FREEDOM Act a week ago and sending it to the President, we are now poised to take the measure up this coming week, after the FISA authorities have expired. The result is that our intelligence agencies will lose important tools to protect against terrorist attacks. This is a self-inflicted harm, and one that was totally unnecessary. As I did a week ago, I will vote to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the USA FREEDOM Act, and I intend to vote for the legislation through the upcoming procedural votes. The bill is not perfect, but it extends the business records, lone wolf, and roving wiretap provisions and it institutes some important reforms to FISA. Unfortunately, what we have on the floor of the Senate tonight is political gamesmanship at its worst. We should have had this debate weeks or months ago, not up against the deadline. Failing that, the majority should not have defeated this motion last week when it is prepared today to pass it. We should skip the unnecessary delay of voting separately on the motion to proceed, cloture on the bill, and on the bill itself. Clearly there are 60 votes in [[Page S3327]] this chamber to pass the USA FREEDOM Act, whether we do it today or if we do it next week. So the question comes: why not pass this bill today, reform the business records provision of FISA, and keep important intelligence authorities in effect? Unfortunately, the answer is that one Senator is holding this process hostage for his own political benefit. It is a travesty, and it is unconscionable. We remain a nation under threat of terrorism. Our allies remain under threat of terrorism. This is not hypothetical. The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-- ISIL--is seeking to recruit individuals to conduct attacks against the United States. Tens of thousands of foreign fighters have entered Iraq and Syria to join ISIL. There are hundreds of people inside the United States right now that ISIL is seeking to inspire, direct, and assist in carrying out an attack. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula--AQAP--is developing non-metallic, undetectable bombs for use on U.S. airliners and is teaching people how to make such devices themselves. These groups are competing to be worst of the worst in international terrorism and they are coming after us. We aren't sending thousands of troops to confront ISIL in Iraq and Syria or to stop AQAP in Yemen. We aren't going to diminish their threats through partnership with local governments. The only way we are going to stop attacks against the United States and our people is by collecting good intelligence. To me, that means we need to do everything lawful and effective in intelligence to identify and thwart those attacks. The roving wiretap provision is important. It says that the FBI doesn't have to stop surveillance against a terrorist or a foreign spy when he buys a new cell phone or changes his email account. Having to do so in today's world would be ridiculous. The ``lone wolf'' provision is important. To be clear--it hasn't been used. But to be equally clear, never before have we faced the exact threat that this provision was written to address: the threat of an individual, inside this country, plotting to kill Americans without traveling abroad and training with a terrorist group first. The business records provision is important. It includes both routine requests for records--hotel bills, car rentals, travel information-- that are regular parts of law enforcement and national security investigations. It also authorizes the NSA's phone metadata program. Under this provision, the NSA gets information about phone calls to include the numbers on either end of the line, the time, and the duration of the call. It does not include the words that are spoken as part of the phone conversation, the identities of the people involved, or their location. What it does is help the Intelligence Community know more about people for whom there is a ``reasonable articulable suspicion'' of being tied to terrorist groups. If there is a terrorist in Syria talking to Americans at home, we want to know that. If a phone number, for example, in Garland, TX, is in touch with an ISIL operations chief, we need to know. That information allows the FBI to go to a court for a probable cause warrant to conduct electronic and physical surveillance of a suspect. This program is conducted under strict oversight and operational limitations. The number of people at NSA with access to the data is small--it was 22 in 2013. They have to get approval each time they do a query of the phone records; today that approval comes from the FISA Court. The query only returns information on what numbers were called by, and called, the phone number in question, and then a second hop from that number. There were 288 phone numbers approved for queries in 2012, and those queries led to 12 probable cause warrants by the FBI. The program is overseen within the NSA by multiple officials, including the inspector general and the privacy and civil liberties officer. It is overseen by the Department of Justice, which reviews every single query, and by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. It is overseen by the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees of the House and the Senate, and it is overseen for compliance purposes by the FISA Court. So these are important tools that, because of Senate inaction and recalcitrance, will expire tonight. As a result, we make ourselves more vulnerable. I very much regret this situation that the Senate has created, and I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture and to quickly enact the USA FREEDOM Act. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). The Senator from Indiana is recognized. Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I also regret that we are where we are. Remembering Beau Biden I would also like to defer for just a moment, before I make my remarks that I came to the floor to make, to add my condolences to Vice President Biden, his wife, and his family. I just learned the tragic news this morning. Some may have known that Beau was dealing with a form of cancer. I did not know that. It came as a shock to hear that information. Having served with the current Vice President in the U.S. Senate and having gotten to know him and his family, establishing a relationship-- a professional relationship as well as a friendship--I still cannot begin to comprehend the grief that comes from the loss of a child. I know there are Members in this body who have experienced that. I am fortunate that Marsha and I have not experienced that. But any parent's perhaps deepest fear is that they will outlive their children. That is not the natural order of things. It is not how we think. And the grief that comes from the death of a child, the death of a son or a daughter, is truly deep and has significant impact. It was impossible not to feel the emotion and shed tears early this morning in our home in Indianapolis when we heard the news. Our condolences and deep sharing of grief that we can't even begin to fully comprehend because we haven't had to deal with it--all of that comes across. I think every Member of this body reaches out to them with our thoughts and our prayers as they go through this very tragic situation. Mr. President, I am a little surprised to hear the Senator from Vermont talking about how the Senate ought to just completely concede to whatever the House sends to the Senate. The fact is that we had a very significant discussion and debate on this issue all week before the Memorial Day break and it had gone on for months, if not years, before in the Intelligence Committee on which I serve and among Members generally. This is one of the most important pieces of legislation we will have to deal with. It was drafted and spawned as a result of 9/11 when the American people said: Are we doing everything we possibly can to prevent something such as this from happening again? Congress debated extensively the PATRIOT Act and the tools the intelligence community suggested we give them the authority to use to try to prevent that catastrophe from ever happening again and doing everything we could to prevent terrorist attacks. Along the way, there have been modifications, and there have been changes. Recently, there has been significant national debate over whether one of these many essential tools that help us gather the intelligence to try to prevent and to understand the nature of the threat should be used. There clearly is a difference of opinion among Members here in the Senate and even in the House of Representatives. Yes, the Senate did pass a reform measure that I think is flawed, personally. I think it diminishes--it doesn't eliminate, but it diminishes and some even believe it eliminates the usefulness of this particular program. We went back and forth on that for a significant part of the week before we adjourned. The Senator from Vermont comes to the floor and basically says: Look, the House passed this; so therefore we ought to just go ahead and pass it. He said there was no other alternative presented, but that is not the case. We had a procedural vote on the House bill, and we had a vote on the bill to extend this program, so we can come spend a little more time to try to figure out how best to deal with this issue. Neither of those passed, indicating that the Senate did not have the same consensus the House reached, which was a partial consensus. That is what the Senate is all about. We are not just a rubberstamp for the House. [[Page S3328]] What is really ironic is the fact that for 4 years, under Democratic leadership of this Senate, the House, under Republican leadership, sent us hundreds of pieces of legislation, and if we followed the admonition to us of the Senator from Vermont, we would have just rubberstamped those. The House passed it, so why wouldn't we go forward? I don't think that argument makes a lot of sense. Senators are here to address issues in the U.S. Senate. Are there many bills the House passes that I agree with? Yes. My party controls the House. Are there bills here that I don't agree with that they have passed? Yes. We, as Senators, use our prerogative in terms of where we stand, and ultimately we take a vote and we either win or we lose. Sometimes it coordinates with the House of Representatives and other times it doesn't, so then we go to conference and we pass an alternative. But to say there hasn't been debate relative to this program in the House-passed bill is simply not true. Unfortunately, there has been such a significant misrepresentation of what this program is and what this program isn't, and that has caused a lot of angst which we are trying to deal with. Much of the public--at least some portion of the public--is convinced that the government is listening to every phone call they make. It has been said on this floor that they are listening to all our phone calls, that they are collecting all kinds of data. They know everything about us. That is the furthest from the point of this program and the operation of this program that we can conceive of. Yet, a portion of the public has been led to believe that Big Government is in their bedroom, in their house, in their car, in their phone, and tracks them wherever they go; that they are collecting everything about people, including what they buy at Costco and the movies people rent through Netflix. Private industry does collect that kind of stuff, but it is not the government. It is not done under this program. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I can tell my colleagues that we have spent hundreds of hours dealing with this program to ensure that it doesn't violate anyone's privacy. It has more oversight through all three branches of government. The executive branch, the judicial branch, and the legislative branch oversee this program. There are six layers within NSA itself that it has to go through, that attorneys have to look at, that legal experts have to look at before they can even proceed to suspect and then take that suspicion to a court to have a judge say: Yes, you might have something here. It has been said and it is true that unless a person's phone number is in communication with a foreign phone number that is at least strongly suspected of belonging to a terrorist organization--and ultimately the court has to make that decision--a member of Al Qaeda, ISIS, or some group overseas that is attempting to do harm to the United States--why is this particular phone number--not the name of the person who owns the phone number--why is this particular phone number being called by someone in Yemen or being called by what we strongly suspect is a foreign operative through ISIS, Al Qaeda, Yemen, or other points where we know terrorist activity is rampant? There is a signal that comes up that matches phone numbers, and they say: We better look into this. But before they can look into it, it has to be vetted by a court. It has to be taken to a FISA Court or an intelligence court and judged by that court as something viable to pursue. At that point, it is similar to what a court would order if there were a warrant to go and find more information to see whether this suspicion actually is reality. We read about it every day and we watch it on television--``Law and Order'' and all the shows and so forth--about how law enforcement suspects that this particular activity is a criminal organization or this is a drug house or they have reason to believe the perpetrator of the crime is this individual. They can't go raiding their house. They can't go downloading information about them until they go to a court and receive approval from a judge saying: Yes, here you are, here is your warrant. You can go and check this out. Well, this intelligence program is based on the same principle; that is, nobody can collect any information on anybody unless that court approves that operation. Then it is turned over to the FBI, and they look to see if it is the real thing. It is a tool that has been of importance and has been a contribution to our ability to address the potential of terrorist threats and to thwart them before they happen. It has always been used as a way of proving the negative; that is, no, this is OK, we don't need to follow up on this. The best example is the Boston bombing. When the Tsarnaev brothers' phone was accessed and it was run against the numbers, there was some suspicion that additional terrorist activity would take place in New York. It was proven that was not the case because there were no connections made. So it became a valuable tool in that regard. Instead of shutting down New York, putting them on a high terrorist alert-- perhaps the Nation's largest economy in operation there--we were able to quickly determine that wasn't the case. In response to those who basically say this has never stopped a terrorist attack, two things: No. 1, this is one of the many methods we use to collect the threads of intelligence that come from different sources to try to put together a mosaic or a puzzle as to whether this is something we need to deal with and take seriously. It is a major piece of that puzzle we obtain from the 215 program, which is the collection of phone numbers. We do not collect the names of people who own those numbers. It is the collection of what is called metadata. It has been described as simply the same data that is on our telephone bills that the Supreme Court has said is not a breach of the Fourth Amendment. It is not privileged for privacy purposes. It shows the date the call was made, the duration of the call, the number that was called, and that is it. And those numbers are put into a system whereby we can check against that a number that suspiciously is talking to a foreign operative in a foreign country. That then automatically triggers that you better look at this--it is kind of a ping--you better look at this one. Nobody has access, at this point, to any content related to the name of the individual until it reaches a level of suspicion that is vetted through six layers of oversight and then is sent to a court that looks at it to say: We agree with you or we don't agree with you. And if we agree with you, then it is the FBI who is alerted that they better look into this. Now, there has never been a time since 9/11 when we have dealt with a higher threshold than we currently are dealing with. You hear about it every day. You read about it every day. ISIS has recruited more than 20,000, it is estimated--significantly more than that are those from 90 different foreign countries. It has made a direct threat toward the United States and its citizens. It is sponsoring and encouraging individuals to not only come over and train and join ISIS and then come back here and wreak havoc on the American people; it is also inspiring those, saying if you don't want to travel over here, just go out and kill somebody. Join the jihad from afar. You can be a part of what we are trying to accomplish simply by doing your own thing. We saw that happen down in Texas. We will see that in other places as people are inspired through ISIS, for whatever sick reason, to take up arms, to cause destruction, and to randomly kill and wreak havoc on the American public. It has been offered that the House fix--the reform, which did have bipartisan support and did pass the House without a lot of debate--is the solution to this problem. Some agree it goes too far; some agree it doesn't go far enough. But there are problems with that particular FREEDOM Act, which the Senator from Vermont says is the golden grail here and will solve all the problems. It is clear, and it is the testimony we have received from numerous officials in the counterterrorism business and in the intelligence business, that there are issues with this so-called FREEDOM Act fix that could render--well, No. 1, that do render the program less effective and could render it totally inoperative. The fact that the NSA has not yet been able to come up with a program [[Page S3329]] which would ensure that we could have the kind of collection we need in the timeframe we need it--some of this is urgent, some of this is pending, some of this is imminent, and it already goes through layers that delay coming to a conclusion and this adds more. Also, they have indicated the system is untested and exists in name only. We don't know how the new program would be implemented and we don't know how it would be operated. That is why many of us said: Look, for whatever reason, yes, we are at this point, and, yes, it expires at midnight. What we were trying to do before we left was get a short-term extension. We were negotiating. We think it should have been for a significant amount of time, until NSA could test out its program, but we were willing to go much less than that so we could have an opportunity to come back and debate this further and get to the bottom of some of the misrepresented information that has been sent out to the American people and have an opportunity to counter that and also work together to find ways, through working with the House of Representatives, to come up with a more effective bill that wouldn't put the country in more jeopardy or, as some experts have said, would undermine the entire program. We obviously will be less agile with the House bill. It requires an expansive regulatory system to amass the level of oversight over the current program. I think the real problem is it requires no data retention mandate. The USA FREEDOM Act does not require companies to hold the data sought by the government. Therefore, the USA FREEDOM Act could be operationally useless as companies update their business model in response to changes in technology or market demand. The telephone companies--all 1,400 of them--many don't want to go through the expensive process of the oversight they need to have in the process. They want to sell phones. And they are hearing a lot from customers who basically say: I don't want to buy your phone if it is going to be subject to them listening to everything I do and say--being collected. Well, first of all, that is factually wrong, but it is an error that has been said over and over on this floor by some Members. That is absolutely wrong. It is false. If we are going to go forward here, we need intellectual honesty about what the program is and what it isn't, and it shouldn't be labeled as something it isn't. I will address that at a later point in time. But the USA FREEDOM Act, by not allowing retention for a fixed period of time, also lessens our ability to make this program effective. So I have much more to say on this, and I know we are going into caucus as a party to see how we might go forward, given where we are. It was not necessary that we be here on a Sunday with the clock ticking toward midnight. We could have continued or we could have gone forward without getting to this particular point in time. But now we will have the opportunity--and, unfortunately, what it looks like is we will have the opportunity to debate this while the program expires. That is a bet I didn't want to take--the bet being that nothing will happen if we don't have this tool in the amount of time that is going to be taken to now address this. That is running a risk I am not sure Members want to take. I don't want to be part of somebody who says this isn't important enough; therefore, we will let it expire and we will not extend it for a day or an hour or a month or a sufficient amount of time to come to a reasonable conclusion as to how we retain this very important intelligence-gathering tool to keep us safe from terrorists. To go dark on this is a risk of Americans' lives. It is a risk that we are taking, and we are going to be responsible for our vote, whatever that vote is. I, personally, don't want the responsibility of saying: Oh, don't worry. Nothing is going to happen out there. The hundreds of hours that I spend in the Intelligence Committee tells me there is a lot that can happen out there. Members have every right, if they are not on that committee--every right to access what we access. We have invited people to come down and see it for themselves, so they at least understand what it is and what it isn't. To my knowledge, only two have taken us up on that. There may be more I have missed. But some of those who have stated this program in a totally false way have the siren song to the people out there who think Big Government is in their bedroom, Big Government is taking every piece of information they have about themselves, and Big Government is storing this and ``listening to all your phone calls.'' That is a bunch of hokum and it is wrong. And for those who refuse to stand up and acknowledge that--because they have had access to the program and refused to take that access-- have to bear the responsibility of sowing this wild theory and idea about Big Government in your bedroom and Big Government in your car and Big Government on your phone and Big Government collecting your emails and Big Government doing everything and storing it until the time that Big Government will come and take everything away from you. I didn't come here to do that and this Senate isn't here to do that and we will not do that. That is why this program has more oversight than any other program in the entire United States Government, and we will put more oversight on there if that is necessary. I will stay up all night and stand over at NSA and make sure they are not listening to your phone calls. But it is irresponsible misrepresentation-- irresponsible misrepresentation--to factually state a falsity and not tell the truth. It is time we told the truth and it is time we stood up to this thing and make sure we are doing everything we can to protect Americans from threats of a lot of people and a lot of organizations that want to kill us all, that would like to see our heads on the chopping block. This is real in our country, as people who are trained by ISIS not only flock back here from Syria, but they inspire people here to pick up weapons and do harm to the American people. I know the Senator from Arizona has a question. Mr. PAUL addressed the Chair. Mr. COATS. I have not yielded the floor. Mr. PAUL addressed the Chair. Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order, and I want to ask the Senator from Indiana a question. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has the floor. Mr. COATS. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Arizona for a question. Mr. McCAIN. Maybe the Senator from Kentucky should know the rules of the Senate, that the Senator from Indiana has the floor and the gentleman is open to respond to a question. My question to the Senator from Indiana--and I want to say that his words are powerful and accurate. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, how much time remains on the clock for the Republican side? Mr. McCAIN. I would ask the Senator from Indiana if he has seen-- Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, how much time is remaining? Mr. McCAIN. I ask for the regular order. The PRESIDING OFFICER. I think the Chair has made very clear that the Senator from Indiana has the floor. Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank you. I know the Senator from Kentucky understands that when a Senator has the floor, they are entitled to speak because he has used that rule himself. Mr. McCAIN. Twice the Senator from Kentucky has not observed the rules of the Senate. I would ask the Senator from Indiana, you have seen the events lately that are transpiring. ISIS has taken Palmyra. They are in the streets burning bodies, killing people, going to destroy 2,000-year-old antiquities, and at the same time Ramadi has fallen with thousands of innocent men, women, and children being massacred. At this time, isn't this program as critical as it has ever been since its inception, given the fact that the Middle East is literally on fire and we are losing everywhere? Mr. COATS. It is more essential than ever, in response to the question from the Senator from Arizona. It is more necessary than ever, as we have seen a higher threat level since 9/11. Of course, we didn't know what the threat was in 9/11, so I don't know how far we have to [[Page S3330]] go back. But our intelligence today, whether it is any aspect of any of our intelligence agencies, they are sounding the alarm that we need to be as vigilant as possible. We need to, within the law--and we are operating within the law--use every tool possible to try to stop an attack on the American people. What happened on 9/11 was a catastrophe that none of us could have comprehended. A 9/11 with the possession of nuclear, radioactive, biological or chemical weapons would make New York look like just a small incident. It would be 3 million people instead of 3,000 people. I think we have an obligation to do what we can without invading anyone's privacy. What we are trying to find is this balance between protecting privacy and protecting ourselves from terrorist attacks--protecting Americans from terrorist attacks. We have done this with this program. If what has been said about this program were true, if the falsehoods that have been said were true, I would be the first to line up and say: No, we can't breach the privacy of the American people by doing what they are doing. But the fact is none of it is true. There has not been one act of abuse of this program over the years it has been in place. It has more oversight and layers of oversight. As former Attorney General Mukasey said: For the government to violate and bypass this, it would make Watergate look like kindergarten activity. It would be a conspiracy that would include hundreds of people, and they would all have to swear that they would not breach their conspiratorial process here--a program that is overseen by the Judiciary Committee, by the Senate Intelligence Committee, the House Intelligence Committee, the body of the Senate has access to this and the body of the House--that is 535 people--by the executive branch, a program that was endorsed by Barack Obama, until he changed his mind, apparently, because the public was going the other way based on false information. People are out here basically making the accusations that they are making to try to take this program down and all we are trying to do is work with the House to find a reasonable way of keeping this tool alive--keeping Americans safe. Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a further question? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator suspend? Under the previous order, all time for debate has expired. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, my understanding is there is still 5 minutes remaining on the opposition side. I request that time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. McCAIN. I object. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, how can we have an objection when we already have a consent agreement that says we have 30 minutes of equally divided time and you still have 5 minutes remaining on the opposite side? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time was divided in the usual form, and the time for debate has expired. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, the time could not have been divided equally, because apparently somebody must have given one side more time than the other. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 5 minutes of time that was allotted to the Democratic side was unused, and it was equally divided at 23 minutes apiece. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I was here for 30 minutes of the Republican side speaking. I sat at my seat for 30 minutes. It was not 23 minutes of equally divided time. Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, regular order--obviously people don't know the rules of the Senate. Maybe they should learn them. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I request the remaining 5 minutes of time on the opposite side. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the Senator from Kentucky? Mr. McCAIN. I object. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I challenge the ruling of the Chair and request the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is not a sufficient second. Mr. PAUL. I request a live quorum call. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 minutes--the 5 minutes that was remaining on the opposition side. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, let us be very clear about why we are here this evening. We are here this evening because this is an important debate. This is a debate over the Bill of Rights. This is a debate over the Fourth Amendment. This is a debate over your right to be left alone. Justice Brandeis said that the right to be left alone is the most cherished of rights. The right to be left alone is the most prized to civilized men. Let us be clear. We are here tonight because the President continues to conduct an illegal program. The President has been rebuked by the court. In explicit terms, the President has been told that the program he is conducting is illegal. Now, the President opines on television. The President wants to blame--he says: Anybody but me. But you know what. The President started this program without congressional permission. Even the authors of the PATRIOT Act say that the PATRIOT Act in no way gives authority to the President to collect all of your phone records all of the time. If there ever was a general warrant, if there ever was a generalized collection of information from people about whom there is no suspicion, this is it. We are not collecting the information of spies. We are not collecting the information of terrorists. We are collecting all American citizens' records all of the time. This is what we fought the Revolution over. Are we going to so blithely give up our freedom? Are we going to so blithely go along and just say: Take it. Well, I am not going to take it anymore. I do not think the American people are going to take it anymore. Eighty percent of those under 40 say we have gone too far--that this whole collection of all of our records all the time is too much. The court has said: How can records be relevant to an investigation that has not started? The court has said that even under these lower standards, even under these standards of saying that it would be relevant, all of the stuff they are collecting is precisely irrelevant. Now people say: Well, they are not looking at it. They are not listening to it. It is the tip of the iceberg, what we are talking about here. Realize that they were dishonest about the program until we caught them. They kept saying over and over: We are not doing this. We are not collecting your records. They were. The head of the intelligence agency lied to the American people, and he still works there. We should be upset. We should be marching in the streets and saying: He has to go. We cannot allow this. We cannot allow the rule of law to be so trod upon that we live in an arbitrary governmental world where they collect anything they want anytime they want. This is the tip of the iceberg. They are collecting records through Executive order. They are collecting records through section 702. People say: How will we protect ourselves without these programs? What about using the Constitution? What about using judicial warrants? About the Tsarnaev boy, the Boston Bomber, they say: How will we look at his phone records? Get a warrant. Put his name on it. You can get a warrant. There is no reason in the world--the guy had already bombed us. Do you think anybody was going to turn down a warrant? We should have gotten a warrant before. Get warrants on people we have suspicion on. The Simpson guy that was shot in Garland had already been arrested. We had suspicion. Let's hire 1,000 more FBI agents. Let's hire people to do the investigation and quit wasting time on innocent American people. Let's be very clear why we are here: President Obama set up this program, the President Obama who once was against the PATRIOT Act. President Obama once said: You know what; we should have judges write warrants. [[Page S3331]] President Obama, who once believed in the Fourth Amendment, is the President who is now scooping up all of your records illegally. Then he feigns concern and says: Oh, we need to pass this new bill. He could stop it now. Why won't someone ask the President: Why do you continue? Why won't you stop this program now? The President has every ability to do it. We have every ability to keep our Nation safe. I intend to protect the Constitution. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 85 (Sunday, May 31, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S3324-S3331] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] USA FREEDOM ACT OF 2015--MOTION TO PROCEED The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 2048, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 87, H.R. 2048, a bill to reform the authorities of the Federal Government to require the production of certain business records, conduct electronic surveillance, use pen registers and trap and trace devices, and use other forms of information gathering for foreign intelligence, counterterrorism, and criminal purposes, and for other purposes. The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader. Mr. LEAHY. I ask, through the Chair, if the Democratic leader will yield to me for a comment. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the Senator for a comment. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was struck by what the Democratic leader said. He laid out the history of this. We are here in a manufactured, unnecessary crisis. It is a manufactured, unnecessary crisis Last year, by an overwhelming majority, the Senate voted to make improvements to the PATRIOT Act. The legislation made reforms to the provisions that have now been declared illegal. We did that but could not get past a filibuster. We had 58 votes. Normally, you think of 51 votes being enough to pass a bill. The Democratic leader will recall how hard he worked to try to get that bill through. The Republican leader said: No, we will wait until next year. Well, next year came. We have wasted so much time. There has not been a single public hearing. There has not been any action on an alternative to the USA FREEDOM Act. But, I say to my friend from Nevada, he is absolutely right when he says the House passed the USA FREEDOM Act by a 4 to 1 margin. It was an overwhelming vote, Republicans and Democrats together, to get rid of the illegal parts of the PATRIOT Act, to pass an improvement. We ought to just take up the USA FREEDOM Act and pass it. If we were allowed to have a straight up-or-down vote in this body, I guarantee you, a majority of Senators--both parties--would vote for it. So I just wanted to say that while the leader was on the floor. I now ask for recognition in my own right. [[Page S3325]] The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, before I begin my comments on the USA FREEDOM Act, I am going to speak for a moment on a personal matter. Remembering Beau Biden Mr. President, Marcelle and I have known Beau Biden since he was a child. I am the longest serving Member of this Senate. When I came here, there was one Senator who was one term senior to me; that was Joe Biden. I knew of the tragedy his family had gone through, and I cherished the times, with his office right near mine, when his sons Beau and Hunter would be there with him. I watched them grow up. I saw Beau Biden become the epitome of what a State's attorney general should be. That is a model all attorneys general throughout the country could have followed. Progressive, worried about improving the law, improving peoples' lives--he did that. I know how much we appreciated it when we would see him and Hallie at an event, when Marcelle and I would get a chance to talk with them. It was like picking up a conversation that had ended just a few minutes before. I remember one thing especially about Beau. I was in Iraq during the war. It was a day when it was well over 100 degrees outside. I was being brought to a place where there was going to be a briefing, being zipped into this building. There were a number of soldiers wearing T- shirts, shorts, and sidearms playing ball outside in this 110-, 120- degree heat. As I went to the door, one of them turned around and gave me a big wave with his arm blocking his face. I was not sure who it was. I kind of waved back. Pretty soon, he came to the door. It was Beau Biden. I remember we gave each other a big hug. He was there as a captain in the Delaware Reserves. He was decorated for his service. We talked about what he was doing. He was praising the men and women who worked there. Nothing about anything he might be doing; he was praising everybody else. It was such a refreshing moment being with him, and it was so typical of who he was as a person. I told him that I have a procedure that if I am in another country and I am with our military, that if there are Vermonters there, I always take their names and I ask them if they have family back home in Vermont. Most of them do. I get their phone number, and as soon as I get back, I call their mother or their father, their husband or their wife, brother or sister, whoever it might be, and say: I saw a member of your family; here is what they are doing; they look well, and all that. So I told Beau, I said: Look, I have known you since you were a youngster. I will call your father as soon as I can and tell him you are behaving yourself, and you are doing a good job. We laughed at that. Shortly thereafter, I got on the phone we had available to us to go through the Whitehouse switchboard to reach the Vice President. Then I started to talk about the procedure I have, and Joe Biden started to laugh. He said: I just got an email from Beau that he had seen you there and that I should be expecting a call from you. We talked about what a great job Beau was doing. You could hear the pride in his father's voice. You could hear his pride. It was a pride that was deserved. I remember Joe saying, when we were first here in the Senate--the two of us--he would be going home every night on the train. Why? Not as much even that the kids needed him, but he needed them. Finally, when he met Jill, the boys were telling him: You should marry her. So I grieve for them. Marcelle and I sat there and cried last night when we heard the news. I think, what a wonderful family. I think about a life cut too short--far too short. Mr. President, I can and will say more later. Mr. President, on the matter the distinguished Democratic leader was talking about, the USA FREEDOM Act, let's just take it up and pass it. Opponents of this bipartisan, commonsense legislation have run out of excuses. I see this as a manufactured crisis, and it is. This matter should have been taken up and voted on up or down a month ago. There is only one viable and responsible path remaining: Pass the USA FREEDOM Act that passed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives. Pass it and send it to the President's desk and he will sign it. If we do not pass it, then those parts of the PATRIOT Act that most of us agree on are going to expire at midnight. The irony of it is that the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 is a carefully crafted, bipartisan compromise that both protects Americans' privacy and keeps this country safe. Before they were talking about, we are going to keep the country safe but Americans' privacy--not so much. This is a bill that does both. The legislation would end the NSA's bulk collection of Americans' phone records. It adds significant new reforms to limit government surveillance. It increases transparency and also promotes greater accountability and oversight--something the original PATRIOT Act did not have. The bill is the product of countless hours of painstaking negotiations with key Members--both Republicans and Democrats--in the House and the Senate, men and women I respect so much because they want to do what is best for the country. We have negotiated with the NSA, the FBI, the Justice Department, privacy and civil liberties groups, the technology industry, and other key stakeholders. We brought everybody together. When we began, we wondered if that would be possible. We did it. That is why the USA FREEDOM Act has such strong support, including from groups as diverse as the National Rifle Association and the Center for American Progress. This broad consensus is what we saw by the overwhelming support it received in the House. They passed the USA FREEDOM Act by a vote of 338 to 88. Some in this country say that no branch of government could have a vote that strong to say the Sun rises in the east. Certainly there has been no major piece of legislation in years where we have seen a vote such as that--338 to 88. But now a minority in the Senate has now twice blocked the USA FREEDOM Act from even getting a debate on the Senate floor. We were sent here not to vote maybe but to vote yes or no. Last November, even though we had had all kinds of committee hearings on this, we heard complaints that there had not been enough of a committee process on the bill and that the Senate should wait to address Section 215 under the new Republican leadership. So the Republican leader led a successful filibuster against a bill which still had a majority of Members in this body voting for it. But what has happened in this Congress? Not a single public hearing on this issue; no committee process. And then last weekend, the Senate was blocked from even debating the House-passed bill and considering amendments. Opponents of reform have failed to introduce any legislative alternative to the bipartisan USA FREEDOM Act, the bill which reforms many problems of the PATRIOT Act. They have come up with no legislative alternative other than a clean extension, which we know has no chance of becoming law. Of course, it makes no difference because at midnight it stops being the law. The time for excuses and inaction has passed. The American people and the intelligence community professionals who strive to protect them deserve better. We have a few hours remaining to work things out and pass the USA FREEDOM Act, but there is no room for error. There is very little time. Again, I said it is a manufactured crisis. The deadline to act is midnight tonight. The House will not return to the Capitol until tomorrow, after the deadline has passed. We could talk about passing a 100-year extension if we wanted; it makes no difference because the time will have passed. So if the Senate does not pass the House-passed USA FREEDOM Act or if we amend it in any way, the authorities are going to expire. I have said repeatedly--and my cosponsor of the USA FREEDOM Act, Senator Lee, agrees with me--that we would like to have a debate on our bill and consider amendments. Because opponents of reform have run out the clock and jammed the Senate, we are not left with very much time. Let's get this done today. If we pass the USA FREEDOM Act, the President could sign it tonight and the intelligence community could move forward [[Page S3326]] with the certainty it needs to protect the American people. Some may argue that if you had a short-term extension--which, of course, we do not have--they have said: Well, maybe we could work out some kind of a compromise bill. But let there be no misunderstanding: The USA FREEDOM Act is a solid, carefully negotiated compromise. For all those Senators on either side of the aisle who have not spent the hours and hours and hours, as Senator Lee and I and our staffs have spent, maybe they do not know the work that went into this--again, how you get groups from the left to the right supporting it. It would be irresponsible to kick the can down the road once again, relying on the false hope that the House will agree to pass a short- term extension--something they said they will not do--and that we will somehow be able to agree on a half-baked alternative that has yet to be introduced in either body and most assuredly would not pass the House. So do not be fooled or tempted by the promise of a short-term extension. That would guarantee nothing. Well, wait a minute. I take that back. Passing a short-term extension does guarantee something: It guarantees the expiration of these authorities at midnight tonight. It guarantees more uncertainty, more litigation, more risk for the intelligence community, and a repeat of the chaotic brinksmanship later on down the road with another manufactured crisis. I know there are some who worry that the bill does not go far enough when it comes to reform. Well, then where were they in coming up with a better idea? If this passes, the USA FREEDOM Act would be the most significant set of reforms to government surveillance since the PATRIOT Act was enacted. The reason we are here to even debate it is that then- majority leader Dick Armey in the House and I put in sunset provisions. So we will have to show responsibility and vote, as the House did by a 4-to-1 margin. Our bill--Senator Lee's and my bill--would not just end the NSA's bulk collection under Section 215, it would add new transparency and oversight reforms to other surveillance authorities, and it would be a solid foundation upon which we could build our future reform efforts. I have been in the Senate for more than 40 years. I have learned that when there is a chance to make real progress, we ought to seize it. But I also know we cannot let this be the end of our fight for greater privacy protections, transparency, and accountability. I remain committed to fighting that fight on behalf of Vermonters and all Americans. So the choices before us this evening are clear: Either let these authorities expire completely or pass the USA FREEDOM Act. There is no more time for political maneuvering or fearmongering or scare tactics. It is time for us to do our jobs--to debate and then to vote. Don't duck the vote. Vote up or down on the bill the House gave us. Stand up and be counted either for or against it. As Senators, let's have the courage to do that. The USA FREEDOM Act is a reasonable, responsible way forward, and we should pass it tonight. But don't duck behind not doing anything and pretend that is a solution. I don't think there is a single American, Republican or Democrat, who would believe that was a responsible solution. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am back here during an unprecedented Sunday session hoping we can avoid a totally unnecessary disaster tonight; hoping we will do what is right for the country: Pass the USA FREEDOM Act today. Right now. I will let others speak to the merits of the USA FREEDOM Act. It is our best opportunity to protect the Nation while balancing between privacy and constitutional surveillance. I do support reforming the Patriot Act, but I do not support unilateral disarmament of our Nation's need to know what bad guys with predatory intent are planning against the United States of America. But my comments today are not about standing up for the USA FREEDOM Act. I am here to stand up for the men and women working for the NSA, FBI, and other intelligence agencies essential to protecting our country against terrorist attacks--whether it is a ``lone wolf'' or state sponsored. These dedicated, patriotic intelligence professionals want to operate under rule of law that is constitutional, legal, and authorized. They are ready to do their jobs, but Congress needs to do our job and pass a bill that is constitutional, legal, and authorized. Ever since Edward Snowden made his allegations, the men and women of our intelligence agencies have been vilified as if they were the enemy. They thought they were doing their jobs protecting us against the enemy. Let me tell you--the men and women of the NSA, FBI, and our other intelligence agencies are patriots who have been wrongly vilified by those who don't bother to inform themselves about our national security structures and the vital functions they perform. Now a special word about the NSA, which is headquartered in my home State of Maryland. The 30,000 men and women in the NSA serve in silence--without public accolades. They protect us from cyber attacks. They protect us against terrorist attacks. They support our warfighters. They are Ph.D.'s and scientists. They are linguists, cyber geeks, and whiz kids--the treasured human capital of this Nation. Remember that section 215 is such a small aspect of what the NSA, FBI, and other intelligence agencies do as they stand sentry in cyber space stopping attacks. People act like that is all NSA does. They haven't even bothered to educate themselves as to legality and constitutionality. Congress passed the Patriot Act. President George W. Bush told us it was constitutional. We need good intelligence. In a world of ISIL, Nusra Front, and al Qaeda, the NSA is our front line of defense and the people of NSA make up that front line. There is no evidence of abuse by NSA employees. The men and women of NSA have adhered to the law. They have submitted to oversight, audits, checks and balances, and reviews from Congress and the courts. The employees of NSA know that everything has to be constitutional, legal, and authorized. They thought they were implementing the law, but some in the media and even some in this body have made them feel like they were wrongdoers. I find this infuriating and insulting. Morale has been devastated at NSA. Families have been harassed for working at the NSA and their kids are bullied at school. They have also been devastated by actions of their own government. First, by sequester--then, by the government shutdown. Now, by Congress's failure to reform national security authorities that help them keep our country safe. It is wrong. I want people to remember that tonight as we discuss important reforms. Let us not let them down, once again, with our own failure to act. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is greatly disappointing that the Senate is in session today to reconsider a vote we took before the Memorial Day recess to extend the three expiring provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Instead of passing the USA FREEDOM Act a week ago and sending it to the President, we are now poised to take the measure up this coming week, after the FISA authorities have expired. The result is that our intelligence agencies will lose important tools to protect against terrorist attacks. This is a self-inflicted harm, and one that was totally unnecessary. As I did a week ago, I will vote to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the USA FREEDOM Act, and I intend to vote for the legislation through the upcoming procedural votes. The bill is not perfect, but it extends the business records, lone wolf, and roving wiretap provisions and it institutes some important reforms to FISA. Unfortunately, what we have on the floor of the Senate tonight is political gamesmanship at its worst. We should have had this debate weeks or months ago, not up against the deadline. Failing that, the majority should not have defeated this motion last week when it is prepared today to pass it. We should skip the unnecessary delay of voting separately on the motion to proceed, cloture on the bill, and on the bill itself. Clearly there are 60 votes in [[Page S3327]] this chamber to pass the USA FREEDOM Act, whether we do it today or if we do it next week. So the question comes: why not pass this bill today, reform the business records provision of FISA, and keep important intelligence authorities in effect? Unfortunately, the answer is that one Senator is holding this process hostage for his own political benefit. It is a travesty, and it is unconscionable. We remain a nation under threat of terrorism. Our allies remain under threat of terrorism. This is not hypothetical. The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-- ISIL--is seeking to recruit individuals to conduct attacks against the United States. Tens of thousands of foreign fighters have entered Iraq and Syria to join ISIL. There are hundreds of people inside the United States right now that ISIL is seeking to inspire, direct, and assist in carrying out an attack. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula--AQAP--is developing non-metallic, undetectable bombs for use on U.S. airliners and is teaching people how to make such devices themselves. These groups are competing to be worst of the worst in international terrorism and they are coming after us. We aren't sending thousands of troops to confront ISIL in Iraq and Syria or to stop AQAP in Yemen. We aren't going to diminish their threats through partnership with local governments. The only way we are going to stop attacks against the United States and our people is by collecting good intelligence. To me, that means we need to do everything lawful and effective in intelligence to identify and thwart those attacks. The roving wiretap provision is important. It says that the FBI doesn't have to stop surveillance against a terrorist or a foreign spy when he buys a new cell phone or changes his email account. Having to do so in today's world would be ridiculous. The ``lone wolf'' provision is important. To be clear--it hasn't been used. But to be equally clear, never before have we faced the exact threat that this provision was written to address: the threat of an individual, inside this country, plotting to kill Americans without traveling abroad and training with a terrorist group first. The business records provision is important. It includes both routine requests for records--hotel bills, car rentals, travel information-- that are regular parts of law enforcement and national security investigations. It also authorizes the NSA's phone metadata program. Under this provision, the NSA gets information about phone calls to include the numbers on either end of the line, the time, and the duration of the call. It does not include the words that are spoken as part of the phone conversation, the identities of the people involved, or their location. What it does is help the Intelligence Community know more about people for whom there is a ``reasonable articulable suspicion'' of being tied to terrorist groups. If there is a terrorist in Syria talking to Americans at home, we want to know that. If a phone number, for example, in Garland, TX, is in touch with an ISIL operations chief, we need to know. That information allows the FBI to go to a court for a probable cause warrant to conduct electronic and physical surveillance of a suspect. This program is conducted under strict oversight and operational limitations. The number of people at NSA with access to the data is small--it was 22 in 2013. They have to get approval each time they do a query of the phone records; today that approval comes from the FISA Court. The query only returns information on what numbers were called by, and called, the phone number in question, and then a second hop from that number. There were 288 phone numbers approved for queries in 2012, and those queries led to 12 probable cause warrants by the FBI. The program is overseen within the NSA by multiple officials, including the inspector general and the privacy and civil liberties officer. It is overseen by the Department of Justice, which reviews every single query, and by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. It is overseen by the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees of the House and the Senate, and it is overseen for compliance purposes by the FISA Court. So these are important tools that, because of Senate inaction and recalcitrance, will expire tonight. As a result, we make ourselves more vulnerable. I very much regret this situation that the Senate has created, and I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture and to quickly enact the USA FREEDOM Act. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). The Senator from Indiana is recognized. Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I also regret that we are where we are. Remembering Beau Biden I would also like to defer for just a moment, before I make my remarks that I came to the floor to make, to add my condolences to Vice President Biden, his wife, and his family. I just learned the tragic news this morning. Some may have known that Beau was dealing with a form of cancer. I did not know that. It came as a shock to hear that information. Having served with the current Vice President in the U.S. Senate and having gotten to know him and his family, establishing a relationship-- a professional relationship as well as a friendship--I still cannot begin to comprehend the grief that comes from the loss of a child. I know there are Members in this body who have experienced that. I am fortunate that Marsha and I have not experienced that. But any parent's perhaps deepest fear is that they will outlive their children. That is not the natural order of things. It is not how we think. And the grief that comes from the death of a child, the death of a son or a daughter, is truly deep and has significant impact. It was impossible not to feel the emotion and shed tears early this morning in our home in Indianapolis when we heard the news. Our condolences and deep sharing of grief that we can't even begin to fully comprehend because we haven't had to deal with it--all of that comes across. I think every Member of this body reaches out to them with our thoughts and our prayers as they go through this very tragic situation. Mr. President, I am a little surprised to hear the Senator from Vermont talking about how the Senate ought to just completely concede to whatever the House sends to the Senate. The fact is that we had a very significant discussion and debate on this issue all week before the Memorial Day break and it had gone on for months, if not years, before in the Intelligence Committee on which I serve and among Members generally. This is one of the most important pieces of legislation we will have to deal with. It was drafted and spawned as a result of 9/11 when the American people said: Are we doing everything we possibly can to prevent something such as this from happening again? Congress debated extensively the PATRIOT Act and the tools the intelligence community suggested we give them the authority to use to try to prevent that catastrophe from ever happening again and doing everything we could to prevent terrorist attacks. Along the way, there have been modifications, and there have been changes. Recently, there has been significant national debate over whether one of these many essential tools that help us gather the intelligence to try to prevent and to understand the nature of the threat should be used. There clearly is a difference of opinion among Members here in the Senate and even in the House of Representatives. Yes, the Senate did pass a reform measure that I think is flawed, personally. I think it diminishes--it doesn't eliminate, but it diminishes and some even believe it eliminates the usefulness of this particular program. We went back and forth on that for a significant part of the week before we adjourned. The Senator from Vermont comes to the floor and basically says: Look, the House passed this; so therefore we ought to just go ahead and pass it. He said there was no other alternative presented, but that is not the case. We had a procedural vote on the House bill, and we had a vote on the bill to extend this program, so we can come spend a little more time to try to figure out how best to deal with this issue. Neither of those passed, indicating that the Senate did not have the same consensus the House reached, which was a partial consensus. That is what the Senate is all about. We are not just a rubberstamp for the House. [[Page S3328]] What is really ironic is the fact that for 4 years, under Democratic leadership of this Senate, the House, under Republican leadership, sent us hundreds of pieces of legislation, and if we followed the admonition to us of the Senator from Vermont, we would have just rubberstamped those. The House passed it, so why wouldn't we go forward? I don't think that argument makes a lot of sense. Senators are here to address issues in the U.S. Senate. Are there many bills the House passes that I agree with? Yes. My party controls the House. Are there bills here that I don't agree with that they have passed? Yes. We, as Senators, use our prerogative in terms of where we stand, and ultimately we take a vote and we either win or we lose. Sometimes it coordinates with the House of Representatives and other times it doesn't, so then we go to conference and we pass an alternative. But to say there hasn't been debate relative to this program in the House-passed bill is simply not true. Unfortunately, there has been such a significant misrepresentation of what this program is and what this program isn't, and that has caused a lot of angst which we are trying to deal with. Much of the public--at least some portion of the public--is convinced that the government is listening to every phone call they make. It has been said on this floor that they are listening to all our phone calls, that they are collecting all kinds of data. They know everything about us. That is the furthest from the point of this program and the operation of this program that we can conceive of. Yet, a portion of the public has been led to believe that Big Government is in their bedroom, in their house, in their car, in their phone, and tracks them wherever they go; that they are collecting everything about people, including what they buy at Costco and the movies people rent through Netflix. Private industry does collect that kind of stuff, but it is not the government. It is not done under this program. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I can tell my colleagues that we have spent hundreds of hours dealing with this program to ensure that it doesn't violate anyone's privacy. It has more oversight through all three branches of government. The executive branch, the judicial branch, and the legislative branch oversee this program. There are six layers within NSA itself that it has to go through, that attorneys have to look at, that legal experts have to look at before they can even proceed to suspect and then take that suspicion to a court to have a judge say: Yes, you might have something here. It has been said and it is true that unless a person's phone number is in communication with a foreign phone number that is at least strongly suspected of belonging to a terrorist organization--and ultimately the court has to make that decision--a member of Al Qaeda, ISIS, or some group overseas that is attempting to do harm to the United States--why is this particular phone number--not the name of the person who owns the phone number--why is this particular phone number being called by someone in Yemen or being called by what we strongly suspect is a foreign operative through ISIS, Al Qaeda, Yemen, or other points where we know terrorist activity is rampant? There is a signal that comes up that matches phone numbers, and they say: We better look into this. But before they can look into it, it has to be vetted by a court. It has to be taken to a FISA Court or an intelligence court and judged by that court as something viable to pursue. At that point, it is similar to what a court would order if there were a warrant to go and find more information to see whether this suspicion actually is reality. We read about it every day and we watch it on television--``Law and Order'' and all the shows and so forth--about how law enforcement suspects that this particular activity is a criminal organization or this is a drug house or they have reason to believe the perpetrator of the crime is this individual. They can't go raiding their house. They can't go downloading information about them until they go to a court and receive approval from a judge saying: Yes, here you are, here is your warrant. You can go and check this out. Well, this intelligence program is based on the same principle; that is, nobody can collect any information on anybody unless that court approves that operation. Then it is turned over to the FBI, and they look to see if it is the real thing. It is a tool that has been of importance and has been a contribution to our ability to address the potential of terrorist threats and to thwart them before they happen. It has always been used as a way of proving the negative; that is, no, this is OK, we don't need to follow up on this. The best example is the Boston bombing. When the Tsarnaev brothers' phone was accessed and it was run against the numbers, there was some suspicion that additional terrorist activity would take place in New York. It was proven that was not the case because there were no connections made. So it became a valuable tool in that regard. Instead of shutting down New York, putting them on a high terrorist alert-- perhaps the Nation's largest economy in operation there--we were able to quickly determine that wasn't the case. In response to those who basically say this has never stopped a terrorist attack, two things: No. 1, this is one of the many methods we use to collect the threads of intelligence that come from different sources to try to put together a mosaic or a puzzle as to whether this is something we need to deal with and take seriously. It is a major piece of that puzzle we obtain from the 215 program, which is the collection of phone numbers. We do not collect the names of people who own those numbers. It is the collection of what is called metadata. It has been described as simply the same data that is on our telephone bills that the Supreme Court has said is not a breach of the Fourth Amendment. It is not privileged for privacy purposes. It shows the date the call was made, the duration of the call, the number that was called, and that is it. And those numbers are put into a system whereby we can check against that a number that suspiciously is talking to a foreign operative in a foreign country. That then automatically triggers that you better look at this--it is kind of a ping--you better look at this one. Nobody has access, at this point, to any content related to the name of the individual until it reaches a level of suspicion that is vetted through six layers of oversight and then is sent to a court that looks at it to say: We agree with you or we don't agree with you. And if we agree with you, then it is the FBI who is alerted that they better look into this. Now, there has never been a time since 9/11 when we have dealt with a higher threshold than we currently are dealing with. You hear about it every day. You read about it every day. ISIS has recruited more than 20,000, it is estimated--significantly more than that are those from 90 different foreign countries. It has made a direct threat toward the United States and its citizens. It is sponsoring and encouraging individuals to not only come over and train and join ISIS and then come back here and wreak havoc on the American people; it is also inspiring those, saying if you don't want to travel over here, just go out and kill somebody. Join the jihad from afar. You can be a part of what we are trying to accomplish simply by doing your own thing. We saw that happen down in Texas. We will see that in other places as people are inspired through ISIS, for whatever sick reason, to take up arms, to cause destruction, and to randomly kill and wreak havoc on the American public. It has been offered that the House fix--the reform, which did have bipartisan support and did pass the House without a lot of debate--is the solution to this problem. Some agree it goes too far; some agree it doesn't go far enough. But there are problems with that particular FREEDOM Act, which the Senator from Vermont says is the golden grail here and will solve all the problems. It is clear, and it is the testimony we have received from numerous officials in the counterterrorism business and in the intelligence business, that there are issues with this so-called FREEDOM Act fix that could render--well, No. 1, that do render the program less effective and could render it totally inoperative. The fact that the NSA has not yet been able to come up with a program [[Page S3329]] which would ensure that we could have the kind of collection we need in the timeframe we need it--some of this is urgent, some of this is pending, some of this is imminent, and it already goes through layers that delay coming to a conclusion and this adds more. Also, they have indicated the system is untested and exists in name only. We don't know how the new program would be implemented and we don't know how it would be operated. That is why many of us said: Look, for whatever reason, yes, we are at this point, and, yes, it expires at midnight. What we were trying to do before we left was get a short-term extension. We were negotiating. We think it should have been for a significant amount of time, until NSA could test out its program, but we were willing to go much less than that so we could have an opportunity to come back and debate this further and get to the bottom of some of the misrepresented information that has been sent out to the American people and have an opportunity to counter that and also work together to find ways, through working with the House of Representatives, to come up with a more effective bill that wouldn't put the country in more jeopardy or, as some experts have said, would undermine the entire program. We obviously will be less agile with the House bill. It requires an expansive regulatory system to amass the level of oversight over the current program. I think the real problem is it requires no data retention mandate. The USA FREEDOM Act does not require companies to hold the data sought by the government. Therefore, the USA FREEDOM Act could be operationally useless as companies update their business model in response to changes in technology or market demand. The telephone companies--all 1,400 of them--many don't want to go through the expensive process of the oversight they need to have in the process. They want to sell phones. And they are hearing a lot from customers who basically say: I don't want to buy your phone if it is going to be subject to them listening to everything I do and say--being collected. Well, first of all, that is factually wrong, but it is an error that has been said over and over on this floor by some Members. That is absolutely wrong. It is false. If we are going to go forward here, we need intellectual honesty about what the program is and what it isn't, and it shouldn't be labeled as something it isn't. I will address that at a later point in time. But the USA FREEDOM Act, by not allowing retention for a fixed period of time, also lessens our ability to make this program effective. So I have much more to say on this, and I know we are going into caucus as a party to see how we might go forward, given where we are. It was not necessary that we be here on a Sunday with the clock ticking toward midnight. We could have continued or we could have gone forward without getting to this particular point in time. But now we will have the opportunity--and, unfortunately, what it looks like is we will have the opportunity to debate this while the program expires. That is a bet I didn't want to take--the bet being that nothing will happen if we don't have this tool in the amount of time that is going to be taken to now address this. That is running a risk I am not sure Members want to take. I don't want to be part of somebody who says this isn't important enough; therefore, we will let it expire and we will not extend it for a day or an hour or a month or a sufficient amount of time to come to a reasonable conclusion as to how we retain this very important intelligence-gathering tool to keep us safe from terrorists. To go dark on this is a risk of Americans' lives. It is a risk that we are taking, and we are going to be responsible for our vote, whatever that vote is. I, personally, don't want the responsibility of saying: Oh, don't worry. Nothing is going to happen out there. The hundreds of hours that I spend in the Intelligence Committee tells me there is a lot that can happen out there. Members have every right, if they are not on that committee--every right to access what we access. We have invited people to come down and see it for themselves, so they at least understand what it is and what it isn't. To my knowledge, only two have taken us up on that. There may be more I have missed. But some of those who have stated this program in a totally false way have the siren song to the people out there who think Big Government is in their bedroom, Big Government is taking every piece of information they have about themselves, and Big Government is storing this and ``listening to all your phone calls.'' That is a bunch of hokum and it is wrong. And for those who refuse to stand up and acknowledge that--because they have had access to the program and refused to take that access-- have to bear the responsibility of sowing this wild theory and idea about Big Government in your bedroom and Big Government in your car and Big Government on your phone and Big Government collecting your emails and Big Government doing everything and storing it until the time that Big Government will come and take everything away from you. I didn't come here to do that and this Senate isn't here to do that and we will not do that. That is why this program has more oversight than any other program in the entire United States Government, and we will put more oversight on there if that is necessary. I will stay up all night and stand over at NSA and make sure they are not listening to your phone calls. But it is irresponsible misrepresentation-- irresponsible misrepresentation--to factually state a falsity and not tell the truth. It is time we told the truth and it is time we stood up to this thing and make sure we are doing everything we can to protect Americans from threats of a lot of people and a lot of organizations that want to kill us all, that would like to see our heads on the chopping block. This is real in our country, as people who are trained by ISIS not only flock back here from Syria, but they inspire people here to pick up weapons and do harm to the American people. I know the Senator from Arizona has a question. Mr. PAUL addressed the Chair. Mr. COATS. I have not yielded the floor. Mr. PAUL addressed the Chair. Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order, and I want to ask the Senator from Indiana a question. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has the floor. Mr. COATS. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Arizona for a question. Mr. McCAIN. Maybe the Senator from Kentucky should know the rules of the Senate, that the Senator from Indiana has the floor and the gentleman is open to respond to a question. My question to the Senator from Indiana--and I want to say that his words are powerful and accurate. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, how much time remains on the clock for the Republican side? Mr. McCAIN. I would ask the Senator from Indiana if he has seen-- Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, how much time is remaining? Mr. McCAIN. I ask for the regular order. The PRESIDING OFFICER. I think the Chair has made very clear that the Senator from Indiana has the floor. Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank you. I know the Senator from Kentucky understands that when a Senator has the floor, they are entitled to speak because he has used that rule himself. Mr. McCAIN. Twice the Senator from Kentucky has not observed the rules of the Senate. I would ask the Senator from Indiana, you have seen the events lately that are transpiring. ISIS has taken Palmyra. They are in the streets burning bodies, killing people, going to destroy 2,000-year-old antiquities, and at the same time Ramadi has fallen with thousands of innocent men, women, and children being massacred. At this time, isn't this program as critical as it has ever been since its inception, given the fact that the Middle East is literally on fire and we are losing everywhere? Mr. COATS. It is more essential than ever, in response to the question from the Senator from Arizona. It is more necessary than ever, as we have seen a higher threat level since 9/11. Of course, we didn't know what the threat was in 9/11, so I don't know how far we have to [[Page S3330]] go back. But our intelligence today, whether it is any aspect of any of our intelligence agencies, they are sounding the alarm that we need to be as vigilant as possible. We need to, within the law--and we are operating within the law--use every tool possible to try to stop an attack on the American people. What happened on 9/11 was a catastrophe that none of us could have comprehended. A 9/11 with the possession of nuclear, radioactive, biological or chemical weapons would make New York look like just a small incident. It would be 3 million people instead of 3,000 people. I think we have an obligation to do what we can without invading anyone's privacy. What we are trying to find is this balance between protecting privacy and protecting ourselves from terrorist attacks--protecting Americans from terrorist attacks. We have done this with this program. If what has been said about this program were true, if the falsehoods that have been said were true, I would be the first to line up and say: No, we can't breach the privacy of the American people by doing what they are doing. But the fact is none of it is true. There has not been one act of abuse of this program over the years it has been in place. It has more oversight and layers of oversight. As former Attorney General Mukasey said: For the government to violate and bypass this, it would make Watergate look like kindergarten activity. It would be a conspiracy that would include hundreds of people, and they would all have to swear that they would not breach their conspiratorial process here--a program that is overseen by the Judiciary Committee, by the Senate Intelligence Committee, the House Intelligence Committee, the body of the Senate has access to this and the body of the House--that is 535 people--by the executive branch, a program that was endorsed by Barack Obama, until he changed his mind, apparently, because the public was going the other way based on false information. People are out here basically making the accusations that they are making to try to take this program down and all we are trying to do is work with the House to find a reasonable way of keeping this tool alive--keeping Americans safe. Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a further question? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator suspend? Under the previous order, all time for debate has expired. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, my understanding is there is still 5 minutes remaining on the opposition side. I request that time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. McCAIN. I object. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, how can we have an objection when we already have a consent agreement that says we have 30 minutes of equally divided time and you still have 5 minutes remaining on the opposite side? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time was divided in the usual form, and the time for debate has expired. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, the time could not have been divided equally, because apparently somebody must have given one side more time than the other. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 5 minutes of time that was allotted to the Democratic side was unused, and it was equally divided at 23 minutes apiece. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I was here for 30 minutes of the Republican side speaking. I sat at my seat for 30 minutes. It was not 23 minutes of equally divided time. Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, regular order--obviously people don't know the rules of the Senate. Maybe they should learn them. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I request the remaining 5 minutes of time on the opposite side. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the Senator from Kentucky? Mr. McCAIN. I object. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I challenge the ruling of the Chair and request the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is not a sufficient second. Mr. PAUL. I request a live quorum call. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 minutes--the 5 minutes that was remaining on the opposition side. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, let us be very clear about why we are here this evening. We are here this evening because this is an important debate. This is a debate over the Bill of Rights. This is a debate over the Fourth Amendment. This is a debate over your right to be left alone. Justice Brandeis said that the right to be left alone is the most cherished of rights. The right to be left alone is the most prized to civilized men. Let us be clear. We are here tonight because the President continues to conduct an illegal program. The President has been rebuked by the court. In explicit terms, the President has been told that the program he is conducting is illegal. Now, the President opines on television. The President wants to blame--he says: Anybody but me. But you know what. The President started this program without congressional permission. Even the authors of the PATRIOT Act say that the PATRIOT Act in no way gives authority to the President to collect all of your phone records all of the time. If there ever was a general warrant, if there ever was a generalized collection of information from people about whom there is no suspicion, this is it. We are not collecting the information of spies. We are not collecting the information of terrorists. We are collecting all American citizens' records all of the time. This is what we fought the Revolution over. Are we going to so blithely give up our freedom? Are we going to so blithely go along and just say: Take it. Well, I am not going to take it anymore. I do not think the American people are going to take it anymore. Eighty percent of those under 40 say we have gone too far--that this whole collection of all of our records all the time is too much. The court has said: How can records be relevant to an investigation that has not started? The court has said that even under these lower standards, even under these standards of saying that it would be relevant, all of the stuff they are collecting is precisely irrelevant. Now people say: Well, they are not looking at it. They are not listening to it. It is the tip of the iceberg, what we are talking about here. Realize that they were dishonest about the program until we caught them. They kept saying over and over: We are not doing this. We are not collecting your records. They were. The head of the intelligence agency lied to the American people, and he still works there. We should be upset. We should be marching in the streets and saying: He has to go. We cannot allow this. We cannot allow the rule of law to be so trod upon that we live in an arbitrary governmental world where they collect anything they want anytime they want. This is the tip of the iceberg. They are collecting records through Executive order. They are collecting records through section 702. People say: How will we protect ourselves without these programs? What about using the Constitution? What about using judicial warrants? About the Tsarnaev boy, the Boston Bomber, they say: How will we look at his phone records? Get a warrant. Put his name on it. You can get a warrant. There is no reason in the world--the guy had already bombed us. Do you think anybody was going to turn down a warrant? We should have gotten a warrant before. Get warrants on people we have suspicion on. The Simpson guy that was shot in Garland had already been arrested. We had suspicion. Let's hire 1,000 more FBI agents. Let's hire people to do the investigation and quit wasting time on innocent American people. Let's be very clear why we are here: President Obama set up this program, the President Obama who once was against the PATRIOT Act. President Obama once said: You know what; we should have judges write warrants. [[Page S3331]] President Obama, who once believed in the Fourth Amendment, is the President who is now scooping up all of your records illegally. Then he feigns concern and says: Oh, we need to pass this new bill. He could stop it now. Why won't someone ask the President: Why do you continue? Why won't you stop this program now? The President has every ability to do it. We have every ability to keep our Nation safe. I intend to protect the Constitution. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 85 (Sunday, May 31, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 85 (Sunday, May 31, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S3324-S3331] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] USA FREEDOM ACT OF 2015--MOTION TO PROCEED The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 2048, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 87, H.R. 2048, a bill to reform the authorities of the Federal Government to require the production of certain business records, conduct electronic surveillance, use pen registers and trap and trace devices, and use other forms of information gathering for foreign intelligence, counterterrorism, and criminal purposes, and for other purposes. The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader. Mr. LEAHY. I ask, through the Chair, if the Democratic leader will yield to me for a comment. Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the Senator for a comment. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was struck by what the Democratic leader said. He laid out the history of this. We are here in a manufactured, unnecessary crisis. It is a manufactured, unnecessary crisis Last year, by an overwhelming majority, the Senate voted to make improvements to the PATRIOT Act. The legislation made reforms to the provisions that have now been declared illegal. We did that but could not get past a filibuster. We had 58 votes. Normally, you think of 51 votes being enough to pass a bill. The Democratic leader will recall how hard he worked to try to get that bill through. The Republican leader said: No, we will wait until next year. Well, next year came. We have wasted so much time. There has not been a single public hearing. There has not been any action on an alternative to the USA FREEDOM Act. But, I say to my friend from Nevada, he is absolutely right when he says the House passed the USA FREEDOM Act by a 4 to 1 margin. It was an overwhelming vote, Republicans and Democrats together, to get rid of the illegal parts of the PATRIOT Act, to pass an improvement. We ought to just take up the USA FREEDOM Act and pass it. If we were allowed to have a straight up-or-down vote in this body, I guarantee you, a majority of Senators--both parties--would vote for it. So I just wanted to say that while the leader was on the floor. I now ask for recognition in my own right. [[Page S3325]] The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, before I begin my comments on the USA FREEDOM Act, I am going to speak for a moment on a personal matter. Remembering Beau Biden Mr. President, Marcelle and I have known Beau Biden since he was a child. I am the longest serving Member of this Senate. When I came here, there was one Senator who was one term senior to me; that was Joe Biden. I knew of the tragedy his family had gone through, and I cherished the times, with his office right near mine, when his sons Beau and Hunter would be there with him. I watched them grow up. I saw Beau Biden become the epitome of what a State's attorney general should be. That is a model all attorneys general throughout the country could have followed. Progressive, worried about improving the law, improving peoples' lives--he did that. I know how much we appreciated it when we would see him and Hallie at an event, when Marcelle and I would get a chance to talk with them. It was like picking up a conversation that had ended just a few minutes before. I remember one thing especially about Beau. I was in Iraq during the war. It was a day when it was well over 100 degrees outside. I was being brought to a place where there was going to be a briefing, being zipped into this building. There were a number of soldiers wearing T- shirts, shorts, and sidearms playing ball outside in this 110-, 120- degree heat. As I went to the door, one of them turned around and gave me a big wave with his arm blocking his face. I was not sure who it was. I kind of waved back. Pretty soon, he came to the door. It was Beau Biden. I remember we gave each other a big hug. He was there as a captain in the Delaware Reserves. He was decorated for his service. We talked about what he was doing. He was praising the men and women who worked there. Nothing about anything he might be doing; he was praising everybody else. It was such a refreshing moment being with him, and it was so typical of who he was as a person. I told him that I have a procedure that if I am in another country and I am with our military, that if there are Vermonters there, I always take their names and I ask them if they have family back home in Vermont. Most of them do. I get their phone number, and as soon as I get back, I call their mother or their father, their husband or their wife, brother or sister, whoever it might be, and say: I saw a member of your family; here is what they are doing; they look well, and all that. So I told Beau, I said: Look, I have known you since you were a youngster. I will call your father as soon as I can and tell him you are behaving yourself, and you are doing a good job. We laughed at that. Shortly thereafter, I got on the phone we had available to us to go through the Whitehouse switchboard to reach the Vice President. Then I started to talk about the procedure I have, and Joe Biden started to laugh. He said: I just got an email from Beau that he had seen you there and that I should be expecting a call from you. We talked about what a great job Beau was doing. You could hear the pride in his father's voice. You could hear his pride. It was a pride that was deserved. I remember Joe saying, when we were first here in the Senate--the two of us--he would be going home every night on the train. Why? Not as much even that the kids needed him, but he needed them. Finally, when he met Jill, the boys were telling him: You should marry her. So I grieve for them. Marcelle and I sat there and cried last night when we heard the news. I think, what a wonderful family. I think about a life cut too short--far too short. Mr. President, I can and will say more later. Mr. President, on the matter the distinguished Democratic leader was talking about, the USA FREEDOM Act, let's just take it up and pass it. Opponents of this bipartisan, commonsense legislation have run out of excuses. I see this as a manufactured crisis, and it is. This matter should have been taken up and voted on up or down a month ago. There is only one viable and responsible path remaining: Pass the USA FREEDOM Act that passed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives. Pass it and send it to the President's desk and he will sign it. If we do not pass it, then those parts of the PATRIOT Act that most of us agree on are going to expire at midnight. The irony of it is that the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 is a carefully crafted, bipartisan compromise that both protects Americans' privacy and keeps this country safe. Before they were talking about, we are going to keep the country safe but Americans' privacy--not so much. This is a bill that does both. The legislation would end the NSA's bulk collection of Americans' phone records. It adds significant new reforms to limit government surveillance. It increases transparency and also promotes greater accountability and oversight--something the original PATRIOT Act did not have. The bill is the product of countless hours of painstaking negotiations with key Members--both Republicans and Democrats--in the House and the Senate, men and women I respect so much because they want to do what is best for the country. We have negotiated with the NSA, the FBI, the Justice Department, privacy and civil liberties groups, the technology industry, and other key stakeholders. We brought everybody together. When we began, we wondered if that would be possible. We did it. That is why the USA FREEDOM Act has such strong support, including from groups as diverse as the National Rifle Association and the Center for American Progress. This broad consensus is what we saw by the overwhelming support it received in the House. They passed the USA FREEDOM Act by a vote of 338 to 88. Some in this country say that no branch of government could have a vote that strong to say the Sun rises in the east. Certainly there has been no major piece of legislation in years where we have seen a vote such as that--338 to 88. But now a minority in the Senate has now twice blocked the USA FREEDOM Act from even getting a debate on the Senate floor. We were sent here not to vote maybe but to vote yes or no. Last November, even though we had had all kinds of committee hearings on this, we heard complaints that there had not been enough of a committee process on the bill and that the Senate should wait to address Section 215 under the new Republican leadership. So the Republican leader led a successful filibuster against a bill which still had a majority of Members in this body voting for it. But what has happened in this Congress? Not a single public hearing on this issue; no committee process. And then last weekend, the Senate was blocked from even debating the House-passed bill and considering amendments. Opponents of reform have failed to introduce any legislative alternative to the bipartisan USA FREEDOM Act, the bill which reforms many problems of the PATRIOT Act. They have come up with no legislative alternative other than a clean extension, which we know has no chance of becoming law. Of course, it makes no difference because at midnight it stops being the law. The time for excuses and inaction has passed. The American people and the intelligence community professionals who strive to protect them deserve better. We have a few hours remaining to work things out and pass the USA FREEDOM Act, but there is no room for error. There is very little time. Again, I said it is a manufactured crisis. The deadline to act is midnight tonight. The House will not return to the Capitol until tomorrow, after the deadline has passed. We could talk about passing a 100-year extension if we wanted; it makes no difference because the time will have passed. So if the Senate does not pass the House-passed USA FREEDOM Act or if we amend it in any way, the authorities are going to expire. I have said repeatedly--and my cosponsor of the USA FREEDOM Act, Senator Lee, agrees with me--that we would like to have a debate on our bill and consider amendments. Because opponents of reform have run out the clock and jammed the Senate, we are not left with very much time. Let's get this done today. If we pass the USA FREEDOM Act, the President could sign it tonight and the intelligence community could move forward [[Page S3326]] with the certainty it needs to protect the American people. Some may argue that if you had a short-term extension--which, of course, we do not have--they have said: Well, maybe we could work out some kind of a compromise bill. But let there be no misunderstanding: The USA FREEDOM Act is a solid, carefully negotiated compromise. For all those Senators on either side of the aisle who have not spent the hours and hours and hours, as Senator Lee and I and our staffs have spent, maybe they do not know the work that went into this--again, how you get groups from the left to the right supporting it. It would be irresponsible to kick the can down the road once again, relying on the false hope that the House will agree to pass a short- term extension--something they said they will not do--and that we will somehow be able to agree on a half-baked alternative that has yet to be introduced in either body and most assuredly would not pass the House. So do not be fooled or tempted by the promise of a short-term extension. That would guarantee nothing. Well, wait a minute. I take that back. Passing a short-term extension does guarantee something: It guarantees the expiration of these authorities at midnight tonight. It guarantees more uncertainty, more litigation, more risk for the intelligence community, and a repeat of the chaotic brinksmanship later on down the road with another manufactured crisis. I know there are some who worry that the bill does not go far enough when it comes to reform. Well, then where were they in coming up with a better idea? If this passes, the USA FREEDOM Act would be the most significant set of reforms to government surveillance since the PATRIOT Act was enacted. The reason we are here to even debate it is that then- majority leader Dick Armey in the House and I put in sunset provisions. So we will have to show responsibility and vote, as the House did by a 4-to-1 margin. Our bill--Senator Lee's and my bill--would not just end the NSA's bulk collection under Section 215, it would add new transparency and oversight reforms to other surveillance authorities, and it would be a solid foundation upon which we could build our future reform efforts. I have been in the Senate for more than 40 years. I have learned that when there is a chance to make real progress, we ought to seize it. But I also know we cannot let this be the end of our fight for greater privacy protections, transparency, and accountability. I remain committed to fighting that fight on behalf of Vermonters and all Americans. So the choices before us this evening are clear: Either let these authorities expire completely or pass the USA FREEDOM Act. There is no more time for political maneuvering or fearmongering or scare tactics. It is time for us to do our jobs--to debate and then to vote. Don't duck the vote. Vote up or down on the bill the House gave us. Stand up and be counted either for or against it. As Senators, let's have the courage to do that. The USA FREEDOM Act is a reasonable, responsible way forward, and we should pass it tonight. But don't duck behind not doing anything and pretend that is a solution. I don't think there is a single American, Republican or Democrat, who would believe that was a responsible solution. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am back here during an unprecedented Sunday session hoping we can avoid a totally unnecessary disaster tonight; hoping we will do what is right for the country: Pass the USA FREEDOM Act today. Right now. I will let others speak to the merits of the USA FREEDOM Act. It is our best opportunity to protect the Nation while balancing between privacy and constitutional surveillance. I do support reforming the Patriot Act, but I do not support unilateral disarmament of our Nation's need to know what bad guys with predatory intent are planning against the United States of America. But my comments today are not about standing up for the USA FREEDOM Act. I am here to stand up for the men and women working for the NSA, FBI, and other intelligence agencies essential to protecting our country against terrorist attacks--whether it is a ``lone wolf'' or state sponsored. These dedicated, patriotic intelligence professionals want to operate under rule of law that is constitutional, legal, and authorized. They are ready to do their jobs, but Congress needs to do our job and pass a bill that is constitutional, legal, and authorized. Ever since Edward Snowden made his allegations, the men and women of our intelligence agencies have been vilified as if they were the enemy. They thought they were doing their jobs protecting us against the enemy. Let me tell you--the men and women of the NSA, FBI, and our other intelligence agencies are patriots who have been wrongly vilified by those who don't bother to inform themselves about our national security structures and the vital functions they perform. Now a special word about the NSA, which is headquartered in my home State of Maryland. The 30,000 men and women in the NSA serve in silence--without public accolades. They protect us from cyber attacks. They protect us against terrorist attacks. They support our warfighters. They are Ph.D.'s and scientists. They are linguists, cyber geeks, and whiz kids--the treasured human capital of this Nation. Remember that section 215 is such a small aspect of what the NSA, FBI, and other intelligence agencies do as they stand sentry in cyber space stopping attacks. People act like that is all NSA does. They haven't even bothered to educate themselves as to legality and constitutionality. Congress passed the Patriot Act. President George W. Bush told us it was constitutional. We need good intelligence. In a world of ISIL, Nusra Front, and al Qaeda, the NSA is our front line of defense and the people of NSA make up that front line. There is no evidence of abuse by NSA employees. The men and women of NSA have adhered to the law. They have submitted to oversight, audits, checks and balances, and reviews from Congress and the courts. The employees of NSA know that everything has to be constitutional, legal, and authorized. They thought they were implementing the law, but some in the media and even some in this body have made them feel like they were wrongdoers. I find this infuriating and insulting. Morale has been devastated at NSA. Families have been harassed for working at the NSA and their kids are bullied at school. They have also been devastated by actions of their own government. First, by sequester--then, by the government shutdown. Now, by Congress's failure to reform national security authorities that help them keep our country safe. It is wrong. I want people to remember that tonight as we discuss important reforms. Let us not let them down, once again, with our own failure to act. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is greatly disappointing that the Senate is in session today to reconsider a vote we took before the Memorial Day recess to extend the three expiring provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Instead of passing the USA FREEDOM Act a week ago and sending it to the President, we are now poised to take the measure up this coming week, after the FISA authorities have expired. The result is that our intelligence agencies will lose important tools to protect against terrorist attacks. This is a self-inflicted harm, and one that was totally unnecessary. As I did a week ago, I will vote to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the USA FREEDOM Act, and I intend to vote for the legislation through the upcoming procedural votes. The bill is not perfect, but it extends the business records, lone wolf, and roving wiretap provisions and it institutes some important reforms to FISA. Unfortunately, what we have on the floor of the Senate tonight is political gamesmanship at its worst. We should have had this debate weeks or months ago, not up against the deadline. Failing that, the majority should not have defeated this motion last week when it is prepared today to pass it. We should skip the unnecessary delay of voting separately on the motion to proceed, cloture on the bill, and on the bill itself. Clearly there are 60 votes in [[Page S3327]] this chamber to pass the USA FREEDOM Act, whether we do it today or if we do it next week. So the question comes: why not pass this bill today, reform the business records provision of FISA, and keep important intelligence authorities in effect? Unfortunately, the answer is that one Senator is holding this process hostage for his own political benefit. It is a travesty, and it is unconscionable. We remain a nation under threat of terrorism. Our allies remain under threat of terrorism. This is not hypothetical. The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-- ISIL--is seeking to recruit individuals to conduct attacks against the United States. Tens of thousands of foreign fighters have entered Iraq and Syria to join ISIL. There are hundreds of people inside the United States right now that ISIL is seeking to inspire, direct, and assist in carrying out an attack. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula--AQAP--is developing non-metallic, undetectable bombs for use on U.S. airliners and is teaching people how to make such devices themselves. These groups are competing to be worst of the worst in international terrorism and they are coming after us. We aren't sending thousands of troops to confront ISIL in Iraq and Syria or to stop AQAP in Yemen. We aren't going to diminish their threats through partnership with local governments. The only way we are going to stop attacks against the United States and our people is by collecting good intelligence. To me, that means we need to do everything lawful and effective in intelligence to identify and thwart those attacks. The roving wiretap provision is important. It says that the FBI doesn't have to stop surveillance against a terrorist or a foreign spy when he buys a new cell phone or changes his email account. Having to do so in today's world would be ridiculous. The ``lone wolf'' provision is important. To be clear--it hasn't been used. But to be equally clear, never before have we faced the exact threat that this provision was written to address: the threat of an individual, inside this country, plotting to kill Americans without traveling abroad and training with a terrorist group first. The business records provision is important. It includes both routine requests for records--hotel bills, car rentals, travel information-- that are regular parts of law enforcement and national security investigations. It also authorizes the NSA's phone metadata program. Under this provision, the NSA gets information about phone calls to include the numbers on either end of the line, the time, and the duration of the call. It does not include the words that are spoken as part of the phone conversation, the identities of the people involved, or their location. What it does is help the Intelligence Community know more about people for whom there is a ``reasonable articulable suspicion'' of being tied to terrorist groups. If there is a terrorist in Syria talking to Americans at home, we want to know that. If a phone number, for example, in Garland, TX, is in touch with an ISIL operations chief, we need to know. That information allows the FBI to go to a court for a probable cause warrant to conduct electronic and physical surveillance of a suspect. This program is conducted under strict oversight and operational limitations. The number of people at NSA with access to the data is small--it was 22 in 2013. They have to get approval each time they do a query of the phone records; today that approval comes from the FISA Court. The query only returns information on what numbers were called by, and called, the phone number in question, and then a second hop from that number. There were 288 phone numbers approved for queries in 2012, and those queries led to 12 probable cause warrants by the FBI. The program is overseen within the NSA by multiple officials, including the inspector general and the privacy and civil liberties officer. It is overseen by the Department of Justice, which reviews every single query, and by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. It is overseen by the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees of the House and the Senate, and it is overseen for compliance purposes by the FISA Court. So these are important tools that, because of Senate inaction and recalcitrance, will expire tonight. As a result, we make ourselves more vulnerable. I very much regret this situation that the Senate has created, and I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture and to quickly enact the USA FREEDOM Act. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). The Senator from Indiana is recognized. Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I also regret that we are where we are. Remembering Beau Biden I would also like to defer for just a moment, before I make my remarks that I came to the floor to make, to add my condolences to Vice President Biden, his wife, and his family. I just learned the tragic news this morning. Some may have known that Beau was dealing with a form of cancer. I did not know that. It came as a shock to hear that information. Having served with the current Vice President in the U.S. Senate and having gotten to know him and his family, establishing a relationship-- a professional relationship as well as a friendship--I still cannot begin to comprehend the grief that comes from the loss of a child. I know there are Members in this body who have experienced that. I am fortunate that Marsha and I have not experienced that. But any parent's perhaps deepest fear is that they will outlive their children. That is not the natural order of things. It is not how we think. And the grief that comes from the death of a child, the death of a son or a daughter, is truly deep and has significant impact. It was impossible not to feel the emotion and shed tears early this morning in our home in Indianapolis when we heard the news. Our condolences and deep sharing of grief that we can't even begin to fully comprehend because we haven't had to deal with it--all of that comes across. I think every Member of this body reaches out to them with our thoughts and our prayers as they go through this very tragic situation. Mr. President, I am a little surprised to hear the Senator from Vermont talking about how the Senate ought to just completely concede to whatever the House sends to the Senate. The fact is that we had a very significant discussion and debate on this issue all week before the Memorial Day break and it had gone on for months, if not years, before in the Intelligence Committee on which I serve and among Members generally. This is one of the most important pieces of legislation we will have to deal with. It was drafted and spawned as a result of 9/11 when the American people said: Are we doing everything we possibly can to prevent something such as this from happening again? Congress debated extensively the PATRIOT Act and the tools the intelligence community suggested we give them the authority to use to try to prevent that catastrophe from ever happening again and doing everything we could to prevent terrorist attacks. Along the way, there have been modifications, and there have been changes. Recently, there has been significant national debate over whether one of these many essential tools that help us gather the intelligence to try to prevent and to understand the nature of the threat should be used. There clearly is a difference of opinion among Members here in the Senate and even in the House of Representatives. Yes, the Senate did pass a reform measure that I think is flawed, personally. I think it diminishes--it doesn't eliminate, but it diminishes and some even believe it eliminates the usefulness of this particular program. We went back and forth on that for a significant part of the week before we adjourned. The Senator from Vermont comes to the floor and basically says: Look, the House passed this; so therefore we ought to just go ahead and pass it. He said there was no other alternative presented, but that is not the case. We had a procedural vote on the House bill, and we had a vote on the bill to extend this program, so we can come spend a little more time to try to figure out how best to deal with this issue. Neither of those passed, indicating that the Senate did not have the same consensus the House reached, which was a partial consensus. That is what the Senate is all about. We are not just a rubberstamp for the House. [[Page S3328]] What is really ironic is the fact that for 4 years, under Democratic leadership of this Senate, the House, under Republican leadership, sent us hundreds of pieces of legislation, and if we followed the admonition to us of the Senator from Vermont, we would have just rubberstamped those. The House passed it, so why wouldn't we go forward? I don't think that argument makes a lot of sense. Senators are here to address issues in the U.S. Senate. Are there many bills the House passes that I agree with? Yes. My party controls the House. Are there bills here that I don't agree with that they have passed? Yes. We, as Senators, use our prerogative in terms of where we stand, and ultimately we take a vote and we either win or we lose. Sometimes it coordinates with the House of Representatives and other times it doesn't, so then we go to conference and we pass an alternative. But to say there hasn't been debate relative to this program in the House-passed bill is simply not true. Unfortunately, there has been such a significant misrepresentation of what this program is and what this program isn't, and that has caused a lot of angst which we are trying to deal with. Much of the public--at least some portion of the public--is convinced that the government is listening to every phone call they make. It has been said on this floor that they are listening to all our phone calls, that they are collecting all kinds of data. They know everything about us. That is the furthest from the point of this program and the operation of this program that we can conceive of. Yet, a portion of the public has been led to believe that Big Government is in their bedroom, in their house, in their car, in their phone, and tracks them wherever they go; that they are collecting everything about people, including what they buy at Costco and the movies people rent through Netflix. Private industry does collect that kind of stuff, but it is not the government. It is not done under this program. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I can tell my colleagues that we have spent hundreds of hours dealing with this program to ensure that it doesn't violate anyone's privacy. It has more oversight through all three branches of government. The executive branch, the judicial branch, and the legislative branch oversee this program. There are six layers within NSA itself that it has to go through, that attorneys have to look at, that legal experts have to look at before they can even proceed to suspect and then take that suspicion to a court to have a judge say: Yes, you might have something here. It has been said and it is true that unless a person's phone number is in communication with a foreign phone number that is at least strongly suspected of belonging to a terrorist organization--and ultimately the court has to make that decision--a member of Al Qaeda, ISIS, or some group overseas that is attempting to do harm to the United States--why is this particular phone number--not the name of the person who owns the phone number--why is this particular phone number being called by someone in Yemen or being called by what we strongly suspect is a foreign operative through ISIS, Al Qaeda, Yemen, or other points where we know terrorist activity is rampant? There is a signal that comes up that matches phone numbers, and they say: We better look into this. But before they can look into it, it has to be vetted by a court. It has to be taken to a FISA Court or an intelligence court and judged by that court as something viable to pursue. At that point, it is similar to what a court would order if there were a warrant to go and find more information to see whether this suspicion actually is reality. We read about it every day and we watch it on television--``Law and Order'' and all the shows and so forth--about how law enforcement suspects that this particular activity is a criminal organization or this is a drug house or they have reason to believe the perpetrator of the crime is this individual. They can't go raiding their house. They can't go downloading information about them until they go to a court and receive approval from a judge saying: Yes, here you are, here is your warrant. You can go and check this out. Well, this intelligence program is based on the same principle; that is, nobody can collect any information on anybody unless that court approves that operation. Then it is turned over to the FBI, and they look to see if it is the real thing. It is a tool that has been of importance and has been a contribution to our ability to address the potential of terrorist threats and to thwart them before they happen. It has always been used as a way of proving the negative; that is, no, this is OK, we don't need to follow up on this. The best example is the Boston bombing. When the Tsarnaev brothers' phone was accessed and it was run against the numbers, there was some suspicion that additional terrorist activity would take place in New York. It was proven that was not the case because there were no connections made. So it became a valuable tool in that regard. Instead of shutting down New York, putting them on a high terrorist alert-- perhaps the Nation's largest economy in operation there--we were able to quickly determine that wasn't the case. In response to those who basically say this has never stopped a terrorist attack, two things: No. 1, this is one of the many methods we use to collect the threads of intelligence that come from different sources to try to put together a mosaic or a puzzle as to whether this is something we need to deal with and take seriously. It is a major piece of that puzzle we obtain from the 215 program, which is the collection of phone numbers. We do not collect the names of people who own those numbers. It is the collection of what is called metadata. It has been described as simply the same data that is on our telephone bills that the Supreme Court has said is not a breach of the Fourth Amendment. It is not privileged for privacy purposes. It shows the date the call was made, the duration of the call, the number that was called, and that is it. And those numbers are put into a system whereby we can check against that a number that suspiciously is talking to a foreign operative in a foreign country. That then automatically triggers that you better look at this--it is kind of a ping--you better look at this one. Nobody has access, at this point, to any content related to the name of the individual until it reaches a level of suspicion that is vetted through six layers of oversight and then is sent to a court that looks at it to say: We agree with you or we don't agree with you. And if we agree with you, then it is the FBI who is alerted that they better look into this. Now, there has never been a time since 9/11 when we have dealt with a higher threshold than we currently are dealing with. You hear about it every day. You read about it every day. ISIS has recruited more than 20,000, it is estimated--significantly more than that are those from 90 different foreign countries. It has made a direct threat toward the United States and its citizens. It is sponsoring and encouraging individuals to not only come over and train and join ISIS and then come back here and wreak havoc on the American people; it is also inspiring those, saying if you don't want to travel over here, just go out and kill somebody. Join the jihad from afar. You can be a part of what we are trying to accomplish simply by doing your own thing. We saw that happen down in Texas. We will see that in other places as people are inspired through ISIS, for whatever sick reason, to take up arms, to cause destruction, and to randomly kill and wreak havoc on the American public. It has been offered that the House fix--the reform, which did have bipartisan support and did pass the House without a lot of debate--is the solution to this problem. Some agree it goes too far; some agree it doesn't go far enough. But there are problems with that particular FREEDOM Act, which the Senator from Vermont says is the golden grail here and will solve all the problems. It is clear, and it is the testimony we have received from numerous officials in the counterterrorism business and in the intelligence business, that there are issues with this so-called FREEDOM Act fix that could render--well, No. 1, that do render the program less effective and could render it totally inoperative. The fact that the NSA has not yet been able to come up with a program [[Page S3329]] which would ensure that we could have the kind of collection we need in the timeframe we need it--some of this is urgent, some of this is pending, some of this is imminent, and it already goes through layers that delay coming to a conclusion and this adds more. Also, they have indicated the system is untested and exists in name only. We don't know how the new program would be implemented and we don't know how it would be operated. That is why many of us said: Look, for whatever reason, yes, we are at this point, and, yes, it expires at midnight. What we were trying to do before we left was get a short-term extension. We were negotiating. We think it should have been for a significant amount of time, until NSA could test out its program, but we were willing to go much less than that so we could have an opportunity to come back and debate this further and get to the bottom of some of the misrepresented information that has been sent out to the American people and have an opportunity to counter that and also work together to find ways, through working with the House of Representatives, to come up with a more effective bill that wouldn't put the country in more jeopardy or, as some experts have said, would undermine the entire program. We obviously will be less agile with the House bill. It requires an expansive regulatory system to amass the level of oversight over the current program. I think the real problem is it requires no data retention mandate. The USA FREEDOM Act does not require companies to hold the data sought by the government. Therefore, the USA FREEDOM Act could be operationally useless as companies update their business model in response to changes in technology or market demand. The telephone companies--all 1,400 of them--many don't want to go through the expensive process of the oversight they need to have in the process. They want to sell phones. And they are hearing a lot from customers who basically say: I don't want to buy your phone if it is going to be subject to them listening to everything I do and say--being collected. Well, first of all, that is factually wrong, but it is an error that has been said over and over on this floor by some Members. That is absolutely wrong. It is false. If we are going to go forward here, we need intellectual honesty about what the program is and what it isn't, and it shouldn't be labeled as something it isn't. I will address that at a later point in time. But the USA FREEDOM Act, by not allowing retention for a fixed period of time, also lessens our ability to make this program effective. So I have much more to say on this, and I know we are going into caucus as a party to see how we might go forward, given where we are. It was not necessary that we be here on a Sunday with the clock ticking toward midnight. We could have continued or we could have gone forward without getting to this particular point in time. But now we will have the opportunity--and, unfortunately, what it looks like is we will have the opportunity to debate this while the program expires. That is a bet I didn't want to take--the bet being that nothing will happen if we don't have this tool in the amount of time that is going to be taken to now address this. That is running a risk I am not sure Members want to take. I don't want to be part of somebody who says this isn't important enough; therefore, we will let it expire and we will not extend it for a day or an hour or a month or a sufficient amount of time to come to a reasonable conclusion as to how we retain this very important intelligence-gathering tool to keep us safe from terrorists. To go dark on this is a risk of Americans' lives. It is a risk that we are taking, and we are going to be responsible for our vote, whatever that vote is. I, personally, don't want the responsibility of saying: Oh, don't worry. Nothing is going to happen out there. The hundreds of hours that I spend in the Intelligence Committee tells me there is a lot that can happen out there. Members have every right, if they are not on that committee--every right to access what we access. We have invited people to come down and see it for themselves, so they at least understand what it is and what it isn't. To my knowledge, only two have taken us up on that. There may be more I have missed. But some of those who have stated this program in a totally false way have the siren song to the people out there who think Big Government is in their bedroom, Big Government is taking every piece of information they have about themselves, and Big Government is storing this and ``listening to all your phone calls.'' That is a bunch of hokum and it is wrong. And for those who refuse to stand up and acknowledge that--because they have had access to the program and refused to take that access-- have to bear the responsibility of sowing this wild theory and idea about Big Government in your bedroom and Big Government in your car and Big Government on your phone and Big Government collecting your emails and Big Government doing everything and storing it until the time that Big Government will come and take everything away from you. I didn't come here to do that and this Senate isn't here to do that and we will not do that. That is why this program has more oversight than any other program in the entire United States Government, and we will put more oversight on there if that is necessary. I will stay up all night and stand over at NSA and make sure they are not listening to your phone calls. But it is irresponsible misrepresentation-- irresponsible misrepresentation--to factually state a falsity and not tell the truth. It is time we told the truth and it is time we stood up to this thing and make sure we are doing everything we can to protect Americans from threats of a lot of people and a lot of organizations that want to kill us all, that would like to see our heads on the chopping block. This is real in our country, as people who are trained by ISIS not only flock back here from Syria, but they inspire people here to pick up weapons and do harm to the American people. I know the Senator from Arizona has a question. Mr. PAUL addressed the Chair. Mr. COATS. I have not yielded the floor. Mr. PAUL addressed the Chair. Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order, and I want to ask the Senator from Indiana a question. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has the floor. Mr. COATS. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Arizona for a question. Mr. McCAIN. Maybe the Senator from Kentucky should know the rules of the Senate, that the Senator from Indiana has the floor and the gentleman is open to respond to a question. My question to the Senator from Indiana--and I want to say that his words are powerful and accurate. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, how much time remains on the clock for the Republican side? Mr. McCAIN. I would ask the Senator from Indiana if he has seen-- Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, how much time is remaining? Mr. McCAIN. I ask for the regular order. The PRESIDING OFFICER. I think the Chair has made very clear that the Senator from Indiana has the floor. Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank you. I know the Senator from Kentucky understands that when a Senator has the floor, they are entitled to speak because he has used that rule himself. Mr. McCAIN. Twice the Senator from Kentucky has not observed the rules of the Senate. I would ask the Senator from Indiana, you have seen the events lately that are transpiring. ISIS has taken Palmyra. They are in the streets burning bodies, killing people, going to destroy 2,000-year-old antiquities, and at the same time Ramadi has fallen with thousands of innocent men, women, and children being massacred. At this time, isn't this program as critical as it has ever been since its inception, given the fact that the Middle East is literally on fire and we are losing everywhere? Mr. COATS. It is more essential than ever, in response to the question from the Senator from Arizona. It is more necessary than ever, as we have seen a higher threat level since 9/11. Of course, we didn't know what the threat was in 9/11, so I don't know how far we have to [[Page S3330]] go back. But our intelligence today, whether it is any aspect of any of our intelligence agencies, they are sounding the alarm that we need to be as vigilant as possible. We need to, within the law--and we are operating within the law--use every tool possible to try to stop an attack on the American people. What happened on 9/11 was a catastrophe that none of us could have comprehended. A 9/11 with the possession of nuclear, radioactive, biological or chemical weapons would make New York look like just a small incident. It would be 3 million people instead of 3,000 people. I think we have an obligation to do what we can without invading anyone's privacy. What we are trying to find is this balance between protecting privacy and protecting ourselves from terrorist attacks--protecting Americans from terrorist attacks. We have done this with this program. If what has been said about this program were true, if the falsehoods that have been said were true, I would be the first to line up and say: No, we can't breach the privacy of the American people by doing what they are doing. But the fact is none of it is true. There has not been one act of abuse of this program over the years it has been in place. It has more oversight and layers of oversight. As former Attorney General Mukasey said: For the government to violate and bypass this, it would make Watergate look like kindergarten activity. It would be a conspiracy that would include hundreds of people, and they would all have to swear that they would not breach their conspiratorial process here--a program that is overseen by the Judiciary Committee, by the Senate Intelligence Committee, the House Intelligence Committee, the body of the Senate has access to this and the body of the House--that is 535 people--by the executive branch, a program that was endorsed by Barack Obama, until he changed his mind, apparently, because the public was going the other way based on false information. People are out here basically making the accusations that they are making to try to take this program down and all we are trying to do is work with the House to find a reasonable way of keeping this tool alive--keeping Americans safe. Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a further question? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator suspend? Under the previous order, all time for debate has expired. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, my understanding is there is still 5 minutes remaining on the opposition side. I request that time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. McCAIN. I object. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, how can we have an objection when we already have a consent agreement that says we have 30 minutes of equally divided time and you still have 5 minutes remaining on the opposite side? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time was divided in the usual form, and the time for debate has expired. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, the time could not have been divided equally, because apparently somebody must have given one side more time than the other. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 5 minutes of time that was allotted to the Democratic side was unused, and it was equally divided at 23 minutes apiece. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I was here for 30 minutes of the Republican side speaking. I sat at my seat for 30 minutes. It was not 23 minutes of equally divided time. Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, regular order--obviously people don't know the rules of the Senate. Maybe they should learn them. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I request the remaining 5 minutes of time on the opposite side. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the Senator from Kentucky? Mr. McCAIN. I object. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I challenge the ruling of the Chair and request the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is not a sufficient second. Mr. PAUL. I request a live quorum call. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 minutes--the 5 minutes that was remaining on the opposition side. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, let us be very clear about why we are here this evening. We are here this evening because this is an important debate. This is a debate over the Bill of Rights. This is a debate over the Fourth Amendment. This is a debate over your right to be left alone. Justice Brandeis said that the right to be left alone is the most cherished of rights. The right to be left alone is the most prized to civilized men. Let us be clear. We are here tonight because the President continues to conduct an illegal program. The President has been rebuked by the court. In explicit terms, the President has been told that the program he is conducting is illegal. Now, the President opines on television. The President wants to blame--he says: Anybody but me. But you know what. The President started this program without congressional permission. Even the authors of the PATRIOT Act say that the PATRIOT Act in no way gives authority to the President to collect all of your phone records all of the time. If there ever was a general warrant, if there ever was a generalized collection of information from people about whom there is no suspicion, this is it. We are not collecting the information of spies. We are not collecting the information of terrorists. We are collecting all American citizens' records all of the time. This is what we fought the Revolution over. Are we going to so blithely give up our freedom? Are we going to so blithely go along and just say: Take it. Well, I am not going to take it anymore. I do not think the American people are going to take it anymore. Eighty percent of those under 40 say we have gone too far--that this whole collection of all of our records all the time is too much. The court has said: How can records be relevant to an investigation that has not started? The court has said that even under these lower standards, even under these standards of saying that it would be relevant, all of the stuff they are collecting is precisely irrelevant. Now people say: Well, they are not looking at it. They are not listening to it. It is the tip of the iceberg, what we are talking about here. Realize that they were dishonest about the program until we caught them. They kept saying over and over: We are not doing this. We are not collecting your records. They were. The head of the intelligence agency lied to the American people, and he still works there. We should be upset. We should be marching in the streets and saying: He has to go. We cannot allow this. We cannot allow the rule of law to be so trod upon that we live in an arbitrary governmental world where they collect anything they want anytime they want. This is the tip of the iceberg. They are collecting records through Executive order. They are collecting records through section 702. People say: How will we protect ourselves without these programs? What about using the Constitution? What about using judicial warrants? About the Tsarnaev boy, the Boston Bomber, they say: How will we look at his phone records? Get a warrant. Put his name on it. You can get a warrant. There is no reason in the world--the guy had already bombed us. Do you think anybody was going to turn down a warrant? We should have gotten a warrant before. Get warrants on people we have suspicion on. The Simpson guy that was shot in Garland had already been arrested. We had suspicion. Let's hire 1,000 more FBI agents. Let's hire people to do the investigation and quit wasting time on innocent American people. Let's be very clear why we are here: President Obama set up this program, the President Obama who once was against the PATRIOT Act. President Obama once said: You know what; we should have judges write warrants. [[Page S3331]] President Obama, who once believed in the Fourth Amendment, is the President who is now scooping up all of your records illegally. Then he feigns concern and says: Oh, we need to pass this new bill. He could stop it now. Why won't someone ask the President: Why do you continue? Why won't you stop this program now? The President has every ability to do it. We have every ability to keep our Nation safe. I intend to protect the Constitution. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. ____________________",package_114_92.csv,52735,52735,52800,"[congressional record volume 161, number 85 (sunday, may 31, 2015)] [senate] [pages s3324-s3331] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] usa freedom act of 2015--motion to proceed the president pro tempore. under the previous order, the senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to h.r. 2048, which the clerk will report. the senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: motion to proceed to calendar no. 87, h.r. 2048, a bill to reform the authorities of the federal government to require the production of certain business records, conduct electronic surveillance, use pen registers and trap and trace devices, and use other forms of information gathering for foreign intelligence, counterterrorism, and criminal purposes, and for other purposes. the president pro tempore. the minority leader. mr. leahy. i ask, through the chair, if the democratic leader will yield to me for a comment. mr. reid. mr. president, i am happy to yield to the senator for a comment. mr. leahy. mr. president, i was struck by what the democratic leader said. he laid out the history of this. we are here in a manufactured, unnecessary crisis. it is a manufactured, unnecessary crisis last year, by an overwhelming majority, the senate voted to make improvements to the patriot act. the legislation made reforms to the provisions that have now been declared illegal. we did that but could not get past a filibuster. we had 58 votes. normally, you think of 51 votes being enough to pass a bill. the democratic leader will recall how hard he worked to try to get that bill through. the republican leader said: no, we will wait until next year. well, next year came. we have wasted so much time. there has not been a single public hearing. there has not been any action on an alternative to the usa freedom act. but, i say to my friend from nevada, he is absolutely right when he says the house passed the usa freedom act by a 4 to 1 margin. it was an overwhelming vote, republicans and democrats together, to get rid of the illegal parts of the patriot act, to pass an improvement. we ought to just take up the usa freedom act and pass it. if we were allowed to have a straight up-or-down vote in this body, i guarantee you, a majority of senators--both parties--would vote for it. so i just wanted to say that while the leader was on the floor. i now ask for recognition in my own right. [[page s3325]] the president pro tempore. the senator from vermont. mr. leahy. mr. president, before i begin my comments on the usa freedom act, i am going to speak for a moment on a personal matter. remembering beau biden mr. president, marcelle and i have known beau biden since he was a child. i am the longest serving member of this senate. when i came here, there was one senator who was one term senior to me; that was joe biden. i knew of the tragedy his family had gone through, and i cherished the times, with his office right near mine, when his sons beau and hunter would be there with him. i watched them grow up. i saw beau biden become the epitome of what a state's attorney general should be. that is a model all attorneys general throughout the country could have followed. progressive, worried about improving the law, improving peoples' lives--he did that. i know how much we appreciated it when we would see him and hallie at an event, when marcelle and i would get a chance to talk with them. it was like picking up a conversation that had ended just a few minutes before. i remember one thing especially about beau. i was in iraq during the war. it was a day when it was well over 100 degrees outside. i was being brought to a place where there was going to be a briefing, being zipped into this building. there were a number of soldiers wearing t- shirts, shorts, and sidearms playing ball outside in this 110-, 120- degree heat. as i went to the door, one of them turned around and gave me a big wave with his arm blocking his face. i was not sure who it was. i kind of waved back. pretty soon, he came to the door. it was beau biden. i remember we gave each other a big hug. he was there as a captain in the delaware reserves. he was decorated for his service. we talked about what he was doing. he was praising the men and women who worked there. nothing about anything he might be doing; he was praising everybody else. it was such a refreshing moment being with him, and it was so typical of who he was as a person. i told him that i have a procedure that if i am in another country and i am with our military, that if there are vermonters there, i always take their names and i ask them if they have family back home in vermont. most of them do. i get their phone number, and as soon as i get back, i call their mother or their father, their husband or their wife, brother or sister, whoever it might be, and say: i saw a member of your family; here is what they are doing; they look well, and all that. so i told beau, i said: look, i have known you since you were a youngster. i will call your father as soon as i can and tell him you are behaving yourself, and you are doing a good job. we laughed at that. shortly thereafter, i got on the phone we had available to us to go through the whitehouse switchboard to reach the vice president. then i started to talk about the procedure i have, and joe biden started to laugh. he said: i just got an email from beau that he had seen you there and that i should be expecting a call from you. we talked about what a great job beau was doing. you could hear the pride in his father's voice. you could hear his pride. it was a pride that was deserved. i remember joe saying, when we were first here in the senate--the two of us--he would be going home every night on the train. why? not as much even that the kids needed him, but he needed them. finally, when he met jill, the boys were telling him: you should marry her. so i grieve for them. marcelle and i sat there and cried last night when we heard the news. i think, what a wonderful family. i think about a life cut too short--far too short. mr. president, i can and will say more later. mr. president, on the matter the distinguished democratic leader was talking about, the usa freedom act, let's just take it up and pass it. opponents of this bipartisan, commonsense legislation have run out of excuses. i see this as a manufactured crisis, and it is. this matter should have been taken up and voted on up or down a month ago. there is only one viable and responsible path remaining: pass the usa freedom act that passed overwhelmingly in the house of representatives. pass it and send it to the president's desk and he will sign it. if we do not pass it, then those parts of the patriot act that most of us agree on are going to expire at midnight. the irony of it is that the usa freedom act of 2015 is a carefully crafted, bipartisan compromise that both protects americans' privacy and keeps this country safe. before they were talking about, we are going to keep the country safe but americans' privacy--not so much. this is a bill that does both. the legislation would end the nsa's bulk collection of americans' phone records. it adds significant new reforms to limit government surveillance. it increases transparency and also promotes greater accountability and oversight--something the original patriot act did not have. the bill is the product of countless hours of painstaking negotiations with key members--both republicans and democrats--in the house and the senate, men and women i respect so much because they want to do what is best for the country. we have negotiated with the nsa, the fbi, the justice department, privacy and civil liberties groups, the technology industry, and other key stakeholders. we brought everybody together. when we began, we wondered if that would be possible. we did it. that is why the usa freedom act has such strong support, including from groups as diverse as the national rifle association and the center for american progress. this broad consensus is what we saw by the overwhelming support it received in the house. they passed the usa freedom act by a vote of 338 to 88. some in this country say that no branch of government could have a vote that strong to say the sun rises in the east. certainly there has been no major piece of legislation in years where we have seen a vote such as that--338 to 88. but now a minority in the senate has now twice blocked the usa freedom act from even getting a debate on the senate floor. we were sent here not to vote maybe but to vote yes or no. last november, even though we had had all kinds of committee hearings on this, we heard complaints that there had not been enough of a committee process on the bill and that the senate should wait to address section 215 under the new republican leadership. so the republican leader led a successful filibuster against a bill which still had a majority of members in this body voting for it. but what has happened in this congress? not a single public hearing on this issue; no committee process. and then last weekend, the senate was blocked from even debating the house-passed bill and considering amendments. opponents of reform have failed to introduce any legislative alternative to the bipartisan usa freedom act, the bill which reforms many problems of the patriot act. they have come up with no legislative alternative other than a clean extension, which we know has no chance of becoming law. of course, it makes no difference because at midnight it stops being the law. the time for excuses and inaction has passed. the american people and the intelligence community professionals who strive to protect them deserve better. we have a few hours remaining to work things out and pass the usa freedom act, but there is no room for error. there is very little time. again, i said it is a manufactured crisis. the deadline to act is midnight tonight. the house will not return to the capitol until tomorrow, after the deadline has passed. we could talk about passing a 100-year extension if we wanted; it makes no difference because the time will have passed. so if the senate does not pass the house-passed usa freedom act or if we amend it in any way, the authorities are going to expire. i have said repeatedly--and my cosponsor of the usa freedom act, senator lee, agrees with me--that we would like to have a debate on our bill and consider amendments. because opponents of reform have run out the clock and jammed the senate, we are not left with very much time. let's get this done today. if we pass the usa freedom act, the president could sign it tonight and the intelligence community could move forward [[page s3326]] with the certainty it needs to protect the american people. some may argue that if you had a short-term extension--which, of course, we do not have--they have said: well, maybe we could work out some kind of a compromise bill. but let there be no misunderstanding: the usa freedom act is a solid, carefully negotiated compromise. for all those senators on either side of the aisle who have not spent the hours and hours and hours, as senator lee and i and our staffs have spent, maybe they do not know the work that went into this--again, how you get groups from the left to the right supporting it. it would be irresponsible to kick the can down the road once again, relying on the false hope that the house will agree to pass a short- term extension--something they said they will not do--and that we will somehow be able to agree on a half-baked alternative that has yet to be introduced in either body and most assuredly would not pass the house. so do not be fooled or tempted by the promise of a short-term extension. that would guarantee nothing. well, wait a minute. i take that back. passing a short-term extension does guarantee something: it guarantees the expiration of these authorities at midnight tonight. it guarantees more uncertainty, more litigation, more risk for the intelligence community, and a repeat of the chaotic brinksmanship later on down the road with another manufactured crisis. i know there are some who worry that the bill does not go far enough when it comes to reform. well, then where were they in coming up with a better idea? if this passes, the usa freedom act would be the most significant set of reforms to government surveillance since the patriot act was enacted. the reason we are here to even debate it is that then- majority leader dick armey in the house and i put in sunset provisions. so we will have to show responsibility and vote, as the house did by a 4-to-1 margin. our bill--senator lee's and my bill--would not just end the nsa's bulk collection under section 215, it would add new transparency and oversight reforms to other surveillance authorities, and it would be a solid foundation upon which we could build our future reform efforts. i have been in the senate for more than 40 years. i have learned that when there is a chance to make real progress, we ought to seize it. but i also know we cannot let this be the end of our fight for greater privacy protections, transparency, and accountability. i remain committed to fighting that fight on behalf of vermonters and all americans. so the choices before us this evening are clear: either let these authorities expire completely or pass the usa freedom act. there is no more time for political maneuvering or fearmongering or scare tactics. it is time for us to do our jobs--to debate and then to vote. don't duck the vote. vote up or down on the bill the house gave us. stand up and be counted either for or against it. as senators, let's have the courage to do that. the usa freedom act is a reasonable, responsible way forward, and we should pass it tonight. but don't duck behind not doing anything and pretend that is a solution. i don't think there is a single american, republican or democrat, who would believe that was a responsible solution. mr. president, i yield the floor. ms. mikulski. mr. president, i am back here during an unprecedented sunday session hoping we can avoid a totally unnecessary disaster tonight; hoping we will do what is right for the country: pass the usa freedom act today. right now. i will let others speak to the merits of the usa freedom act. it is our best opportunity to protect the nation while balancing between privacy and constitutional surveillance. i do support reforming the patriot act, but i do not support unilateral disarmament of our nation's need to know what bad guys with predatory intent are planning against the united states of america. but my comments today are not about standing up for the usa freedom act. i am here to stand up for the men and women working for the nsa, fbi, and other intelligence agencies essential to protecting our country against terrorist attacks--whether it is a ``lone wolf'' or state sponsored. these dedicated, patriotic intelligence professionals want to operate under rule of law that is constitutional, legal, and authorized. they are ready to do their jobs, but congress needs to do our job and pass a bill that is constitutional, legal, and authorized. ever since edward snowden made his allegations, the men and women of our intelligence agencies have been vilified as if they were the enemy. they thought they were doing their jobs protecting us against the enemy. let me tell you--the men and women of the nsa, fbi, and our other intelligence agencies are patriots who have been wrongly vilified by those who don't bother to inform themselves about our national security structures and the vital functions they perform. now a special word about the nsa, which is headquartered in my home state of maryland. the 30,000 men and women in the nsa serve in silence--without public accolades. they protect us from cyber attacks. they protect us against terrorist attacks. they support our warfighters. they are ph.d.'s and scientists. they are linguists, cyber geeks, and whiz kids--the treasured human capital of this nation. remember that section 215 is such a small aspect of what the nsa, fbi, and other intelligence agencies do as they stand sentry in cyber space stopping attacks. people act like that is all nsa does. they haven't even bothered to educate themselves as to legality and constitutionality. congress passed the patriot act. president george w. bush told us it was constitutional. we need good intelligence. in a world of isil, nusra front, and al qaeda, the nsa is our front line of defense and the people of nsa make up that front line. there is no evidence of abuse by nsa employees. the men and women of nsa have adhered to the law. they have submitted to oversight, audits, checks and balances, and reviews from congress and the courts. the employees of nsa know that everything has to be constitutional, legal, and authorized. they thought they were implementing the law, but some in the media and even some in this body have made them feel like they were wrongdoers. i find this infuriating and insulting. morale has been devastated at nsa. families have been harassed for working at the nsa and their kids are bullied at school. they have also been devastated by actions of their own government. first, by sequester--then, by the government shutdown. now, by congress's failure to reform national security authorities that help them keep our country safe. it is wrong. i want people to remember that tonight as we discuss important reforms. let us not let them down, once again, with our own failure to act. mrs. feinstein. mr. president, it is greatly disappointing that the senate is in session today to reconsider a vote we took before the memorial day recess to extend the three expiring provisions of the foreign intelligence surveillance act. instead of passing the usa freedom act a week ago and sending it to the president, we are now poised to take the measure up this coming week, after the fisa authorities have expired. the result is that our intelligence agencies will lose important tools to protect against terrorist attacks. this is a self-inflicted harm, and one that was totally unnecessary. as i did a week ago, i will vote to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the usa freedom act, and i intend to vote for the legislation through the upcoming procedural votes. the bill is not perfect, but it extends the business records, lone wolf, and roving wiretap provisions and it institutes some important reforms to fisa. unfortunately, what we have on the floor of the senate tonight is political gamesmanship at its worst. we should have had this debate weeks or months ago, not up against the deadline. failing that, the majority should not have defeated this motion last week when it is prepared today to pass it. we should skip the unnecessary delay of voting separately on the motion to proceed, cloture on the bill, and on the bill itself. clearly there are 60 votes in [[page s3327]] this chamber to pass the usa freedom act, whether we do it today or if we do it next week. so the question comes: why not pass this bill today, reform the business records provision of fisa, and keep important intelligence authorities in effect? unfortunately, the answer is that one senator is holding this process hostage for his own political benefit. it is a travesty, and it is unconscionable. we remain a nation under threat of terrorism. our allies remain under threat of terrorism. this is not hypothetical. the islamic state in iraq and the levant-- isil--is seeking to recruit individuals to conduct attacks against the united states. tens of thousands of foreign fighters have entered iraq and syria to join isil. there are hundreds of people inside the united states right now that isil is seeking to inspire, direct, and assist in carrying out an attack. al qaeda in the arabian peninsula--aqap--is developing non-metallic, undetectable bombs for use on u.s. airliners and is teaching people how to make such devices themselves. these groups are competing to be worst of the worst in international terrorism and they are coming after us. we aren't sending thousands of troops to confront isil in iraq and syria or to stop aqap in yemen. we aren't going to diminish their threats through partnership with local governments. the only way we are going to stop attacks against the united states and our people is by collecting good intelligence. to me, that means we need to do everything lawful and effective in intelligence to identify and thwart those attacks. the roving wiretap provision is important. it says that the fbi doesn't have to stop surveillance against a terrorist or a foreign spy when he buys a new cell phone or changes his email account. having to do so in today's world would be ridiculous. the ``lone wolf'' provision is important. to be clear--it hasn't been used. but to be equally clear, never before have we faced the exact threat that this provision was written to address: the threat of an individual, inside this country, plotting to kill americans without traveling abroad and training with a terrorist group first. the business records provision is important. it includes both routine requests for records--hotel bills, car rentals, travel information-- that are regular parts of law enforcement and national security investigations. it also authorizes the nsa's phone metadata program. under this provision, the nsa gets information about phone calls to include the numbers on either end of the line, the time, and the duration of the call. it does not include the words that are spoken as part of the phone conversation, the identities of the people involved, or their location. what it does is help the intelligence community know more about people for whom there is a ``reasonable articulable suspicion'' of being tied to terrorist groups. if there is a terrorist in syria talking to americans at home, we want to know that. if a phone number, for example, in garland, tx, is in touch with an isil operations chief, we need to know. that information allows the fbi to go to a court for a probable cause warrant to conduct electronic and physical surveillance of a suspect. this program is conducted under strict oversight and operational limitations. the number of people at nsa with access to the data is small--it was 22 in 2013. they have to get approval each time they do a query of the phone records; today that approval comes from the fisa court. the query only returns information on what numbers were called by, and called, the phone number in question, and then a second hop from that number. there were 288 phone numbers approved for queries in 2012, and those queries led to 12 probable cause warrants by the fbi. the program is overseen within the nsa by multiple officials, including the inspector general and the privacy and civil liberties officer. it is overseen by the department of justice, which reviews every single query, and by the office of the director of national intelligence. it is overseen by the intelligence and judiciary committees of the house and the senate, and it is overseen for compliance purposes by the fisa court. so these are important tools that, because of senate inaction and recalcitrance, will expire tonight. as a result, we make ourselves more vulnerable. i very much regret this situation that the senate has created, and i urge my colleagues to vote for cloture and to quickly enact the usa freedom act. the presiding officer (mr. grassley). the senator from indiana is recognized. mr. coats. mr. president, i also regret that we are where we are. remembering beau biden i would also like to defer for just a moment, before i make my remarks that i came to the floor to make, to add my condolences to vice president biden, his wife, and his family. i just learned the tragic news this morning. some may have known that beau was dealing with a form of cancer. i did not know that. it came as a shock to hear that information. having served with the current vice president in the u.s. senate and having gotten to know him and his family, establishing a relationship-- a professional relationship as well as a friendship--i still cannot begin to comprehend the grief that comes from the loss of a child. i know there are members in this body who have experienced that. i am fortunate that marsha and i have not experienced that. but any parent's perhaps deepest fear is that they will outlive their children. that is not the natural order of things. it is not how we think. and the grief that comes from the death of a child, the death of a son or a daughter, is truly deep and has significant impact. it was impossible not to feel the emotion and shed tears early this morning in our home in indianapolis when we heard the news. our condolences and deep sharing of grief that we can't even begin to fully comprehend because we haven't had to deal with it--all of that comes across. i think every member of this body reaches out to them with our thoughts and our prayers as they go through this very tragic situation. mr. president, i am a little surprised to hear the senator from vermont talking about how the senate ought to just completely concede to whatever the house sends to the senate. the fact is that we had a very significant discussion and debate on this issue all week before the memorial day break and it had gone on for months, if not years, before in the intelligence committee on which i serve and among members generally. this is one of the most important pieces of legislation we will have to deal with. it was drafted and spawned as a result of 9/11 when the american people said: are we doing everything we possibly can to prevent something such as this from happening again? congress debated extensively the patriot act and the tools the intelligence community suggested we give them the authority to use to try to prevent that catastrophe from ever happening again and doing everything we could to prevent terrorist attacks. along the way, there have been modifications, and there have been changes. recently, there has been significant national debate over whether one of these many essential tools that help us gather the intelligence to try to prevent and to understand the nature of the threat should be used. there clearly is a difference of opinion among members here in the senate and even in the house of representatives. yes, the senate did pass a reform measure that i think is flawed, personally. i think it diminishes--it doesn't eliminate, but it diminishes and some even believe it eliminates the usefulness of this particular program. we went back and forth on that for a significant part of the week before we adjourned. the senator from vermont comes to the floor and basically says: look, the house passed this; so therefore we ought to just go ahead and pass it. he said there was no other alternative presented, but that is not the case. we had a procedural vote on the house bill, and we had a vote on the bill to extend this program, so we can come spend a little more time to try to figure out how best to deal with this issue. neither of those passed, indicating that the senate did not have the same consensus the house reached, which was a partial consensus. that is what the senate is all about. we are not just a rubberstamp for the house. [[page s3328]] what is really ironic is the fact that for 4 years, under democratic leadership of this senate, the house, under republican leadership, sent us hundreds of pieces of legislation, and if we followed the admonition to us of the senator from vermont, we would have just rubberstamped those. the house passed it, so why wouldn't we go forward? i don't think that argument makes a lot of sense. senators are here to address issues in the u.s. senate. are there many bills the house passes that i agree with? yes. my party controls the house. are there bills here that i don't agree with that they have passed? yes. we, as senators, use our prerogative in terms of where we stand, and ultimately we take a vote and we either win or we lose. sometimes it coordinates with the house of representatives and other times it doesn't, so then we go to conference and we pass an alternative. but to say there hasn't been debate relative to this program in the house-passed bill is simply not true. unfortunately, there has been such a significant misrepresentation of what this program is and what this program isn't, and that has caused a lot of angst which we are trying to deal with. much of the public--at least some portion of the public--is convinced that the government is listening to every phone call they make. it has been said on this floor that they are listening to all our phone calls, that they are collecting all kinds of data. they know everything about us. that is the furthest from the point of this program and the operation of this program that we can conceive of. yet, a portion of the public has been led to believe that big government is in their bedroom, in their house, in their car, in their phone, and tracks them wherever they go; that they are collecting everything about people, including what they buy at costco and the movies people rent through netflix. private industry does collect that kind of stuff, but it is not the government. it is not done under this program. as a member of the intelligence committee, i can tell my colleagues that we have spent hundreds of hours dealing with this program to ensure that it doesn't violate anyone's privacy. it has more oversight through all three branches of government. the executive branch, the judicial branch, and the legislative branch oversee this program. there are six layers within nsa itself that it has to go through, that attorneys have to look at, that legal experts have to look at before they can even proceed to suspect and then take that suspicion to a court to have a judge say: yes, you might have something here. it has been said and it is true that unless a person's phone number is in communication with a foreign phone number that is at least strongly suspected of belonging to a terrorist organization--and ultimately the court has to make that decision--a member of al qaeda, isis, or some group overseas that is attempting to do harm to the united states--why is this particular phone number--not the name of the person who owns the phone number--why is this particular phone number being called by someone in yemen or being called by what we strongly suspect is a foreign operative through isis, al qaeda, yemen, or other points where we know terrorist activity is rampant? there is a signal that comes up that matches phone numbers, and they say: we better look into this. but before they can look into it, it has to be vetted by a court. it has to be taken to a fisa court or an intelligence court and judged by that court as something viable to pursue. at that point, it is similar to what a court would order if there were a warrant to go and find more information to see whether this suspicion actually is reality. we read about it every day and we watch it on television--``law and order'' and all the shows and so forth--about how law enforcement suspects that this particular activity is a criminal organization or this is a drug house or they have reason to believe the perpetrator of the crime is this individual. they can't go raiding their house. they can't go downloading information about them until they go to a court and receive approval from a judge saying: yes, here you are, here is your warrant. you can go and check this out. well, this intelligence program is based on the same principle; that is, nobody can collect any information on anybody unless that court approves that operation. then it is turned over to the fbi, and they look to see if it is the real thing. it is a tool that has been of importance and has been a contribution to our ability to address the potential of terrorist threats and to thwart them before they happen. it has always been used as a way of proving the negative; that is, no, this is ok, we don't need to follow up on this. the best example is the boston bombing. when the tsarnaev brothers' phone was accessed and it was run against the numbers, there was some suspicion that additional terrorist activity would take place in new york. it was proven that was not the case because there were no connections made. so it became a valuable tool in that regard. instead of shutting down new york, putting them on a high terrorist alert-- perhaps the nation's largest economy in operation there--we were able to quickly determine that wasn't the case. in response to those who basically say this has never stopped a terrorist attack, two things: no. 1, this is one of the many methods we use to collect the threads of intelligence that come from different sources to try to put together a mosaic or a puzzle as to whether this is something we need to deal with and take seriously. it is a major piece of that puzzle we obtain from the 215 program, which is the collection of phone numbers. we do not collect the names of people who own those numbers. it is the collection of what is called metadata. it has been described as simply the same data that is on our telephone bills that the supreme court has said is not a breach of the fourth amendment. it is not privileged for privacy purposes. it shows the date the call was made, the duration of the call, the number that was called, and that is it. and those numbers are put into a system whereby we can check against that a number that suspiciously is talking to a foreign operative in a foreign country. that then automatically triggers that you better look at this--it is kind of a ping--you better look at this one. nobody has access, at this point, to any content related to the name of the individual until it reaches a level of suspicion that is vetted through six layers of oversight and then is sent to a court that looks at it to say: we agree with you or we don't agree with you. and if we agree with you, then it is the fbi who is alerted that they better look into this. now, there has never been a time since 9/11 when we have dealt with a higher threshold than we currently are dealing with. you hear about it every day. you read about it every day. isis has recruited more than 20,000, it is estimated--significantly more than that are those from 90 different foreign countries. it has made a direct threat toward the united states and its citizens. it is sponsoring and encouraging individuals to not only come over and train and join isis and then come back here and wreak havoc on the american people; it is also inspiring those, saying if you don't want to travel over here, just go out and kill somebody. join the jihad from afar. you can be a part of what we are trying to accomplish simply by doing your own thing. we saw that happen down in texas. we will see that in other places as people are inspired through isis, for whatever sick reason, to take up arms, to cause destruction, and to randomly kill and wreak havoc on the american public. it has been offered that the house fix--the reform, which did have bipartisan support and did pass the house without a lot of debate--is the solution to this problem. some agree it goes too far; some agree it doesn't go far enough. but there are problems with that particular freedom act, which the senator from vermont says is the golden grail here and will solve all the problems. it is clear, and it is the testimony we have received from numerous officials in the counterterrorism business and in the intelligence business, that there are issues with this so-called freedom act fix that could render--well, no. 1, that do render the program less effective and could render it totally inoperative. the fact that the nsa has not yet been able to come up with a program [[page s3329]] which would ensure that we could have the kind of collection we need in the timeframe we need it--some of this is urgent, some of this is pending, some of this is imminent, and it already goes through layers that delay coming to a conclusion and this adds more. also, they have indicated the system is untested and exists in name only. we don't know how the new program would be implemented and we don't know how it would be operated. that is why many of us said: look, for whatever reason, yes, we are at this point, and, yes, it expires at midnight. what we were trying to do before we left was get a short-term extension. we were negotiating. we think it should have been for a significant amount of time, until nsa could test out its program, but we were willing to go much less than that so we could have an opportunity to come back and debate this further and get to the bottom of some of the misrepresented information that has been sent out to the american people and have an opportunity to counter that and also work together to find ways, through working with the house of representatives, to come up with a more effective bill that wouldn't put the country in more jeopardy or, as some experts have said, would undermine the entire program. we obviously will be less agile with the house bill. it requires an expansive regulatory system to amass the level of oversight over the current program. i think the real problem is it requires no data retention mandate. the usa freedom act does not require companies to hold the data sought by the government. therefore, the usa freedom act could be operationally useless as companies update their business model in response to changes in technology or market demand. the telephone companies--all 1,400 of them--many don't want to go through the expensive process of the oversight they need to have in the process. they want to sell phones. and they are hearing a lot from customers who basically say: i don't want to buy your phone if it is going to be subject to them listening to everything i do and say--being collected. well, first of all, that is factually wrong, but it is an error that has been said over and over on this floor by some members. that is absolutely wrong. it is false. if we are going to go forward here, we need intellectual honesty about what the program is and what it isn't, and it shouldn't be labeled as something it isn't. i will address that at a later point in time. but the usa freedom act, by not allowing retention for a fixed period of time, also lessens our ability to make this program effective. so i have much more to say on this, and i know we are going into caucus as a party to see how we might go forward, given where we are. it was not necessary that we be here on a sunday with the clock ticking toward midnight. we could have continued or we could have gone forward without getting to this particular point in time. but now we will have the opportunity--and, unfortunately, what it looks like is we will have the opportunity to debate this while the program expires. that is a bet i didn't want to take--the bet being that nothing will happen if we don't have this tool in the amount of time that is going to be taken to now address this. that is running a risk i am not sure members want to take. i don't want to be part of somebody who says this isn't important enough; therefore, we will let it expire and we will not extend it for a day or an hour or a month or a sufficient amount of time to come to a reasonable conclusion as to how we retain this very important intelligence-gathering tool to keep us safe from terrorists. to go dark on this is a risk of americans' lives. it is a risk that we are taking, and we are going to be responsible for our vote, whatever that vote is. i, personally, don't want the responsibility of saying: oh, don't worry. nothing is going to happen out there. the hundreds of hours that i spend in the intelligence committee tells me there is a lot that can happen out there. members have every right, if they are not on that committee--every right to access what we access. we have invited people to come down and see it for themselves, so they at least understand what it is and what it isn't. to my knowledge, only two have taken us up on that. there may be more i have missed. but some of those who have stated this program in a totally false way have the siren song to the people out there who think big government is in their bedroom, big government is taking every piece of information they have about themselves, and big government is storing this and ``listening to all your phone calls.'' that is a bunch of hokum and it is wrong. and for those who refuse to stand up and acknowledge that--because they have had access to the program and refused to take that access-- have to bear the responsibility of sowing this wild theory and idea about big government in your bedroom and big government in your car and big government on your phone and big government collecting your emails and big government doing everything and storing it until the time that big government will come and take everything away from you. i didn't come here to do that and this senate isn't here to do that and we will not do that. that is why this program has more oversight than any other program in the entire united states government, and we will put more oversight on there if that is necessary. i will stay up all night and stand over at nsa and make sure they are not listening to your phone calls. but it is irresponsible misrepresentation-- irresponsible misrepresentation--to factually state a falsity and not tell the truth. it is time we told the truth and it is time we stood up to this thing and make sure we are doing everything we can to protect americans from threats of a lot of people and a lot of organizations that want to kill us all, that would like to see our heads on the chopping block. this is real in our country, as people who are trained by isis not only flock back here from syria, but they inspire people here to pick up weapons and do harm to the american people. i know the senator from arizona has a question. mr. paul addressed the chair. mr. coats. i have not yielded the floor. mr. paul addressed the chair. mr. mccain. mr. president, i ask for the regular order, and i want to ask the senator from indiana a question. the presiding officer. the senator from indiana has the floor. mr. coats. i would be happy to yield to the senator from arizona for a question. mr. mccain. maybe the senator from kentucky should know the rules of the senate, that the senator from indiana has the floor and the gentleman is open to respond to a question. my question to the senator from indiana--and i want to say that his words are powerful and accurate. mr. paul. mr. president, how much time remains on the clock for the republican side? mr. mccain. i would ask the senator from indiana if he has seen-- mr. paul. mr. president, how much time is remaining? mr. mccain. i ask for the regular order. the presiding officer. i think the chair has made very clear that the senator from indiana has the floor. mr. coats. mr. president, i thank you. i know the senator from kentucky understands that when a senator has the floor, they are entitled to speak because he has used that rule himself. mr. mccain. twice the senator from kentucky has not observed the rules of the senate. i would ask the senator from indiana, you have seen the events lately that are transpiring. isis has taken palmyra. they are in the streets burning bodies, killing people, going to destroy 2,000-year-old antiquities, and at the same time ramadi has fallen with thousands of innocent men, women, and children being massacred. at this time, isn't this program as critical as it has ever been since its inception, given the fact that the middle east is literally on fire and we are losing everywhere? mr. coats. it is more essential than ever, in response to the question from the senator from arizona. it is more necessary than ever, as we have seen a higher threat level since 9/11. of course, we didn't know what the threat was in 9/11, so i don't know how far we have to [[page s3330]] go back. but our intelligence today, whether it is any aspect of any of our intelligence agencies, they are sounding the alarm that we need to be as vigilant as possible. we need to, within the law--and we are operating within the law--use every tool possible to try to stop an attack on the american people. what happened on 9/11 was a catastrophe that none of us could have comprehended. a 9/11 with the possession of nuclear, radioactive, biological or chemical weapons would make new york look like just a small incident. it would be 3 million people instead of 3,000 people. i think we have an obligation to do what we can without invading anyone's privacy. what we are trying to find is this balance between protecting privacy and protecting ourselves from terrorist attacks--protecting americans from terrorist attacks. we have done this with this program. if what has been said about this program were true, if the falsehoods that have been said were true, i would be the first to line up and say: no, we can't breach the privacy of the american people by doing what they are doing. but the fact is none of it is true. there has not been one act of abuse of this program over the years it has been in place. it has more oversight and layers of oversight. as former attorney general mukasey said: for the government to violate and bypass this, it would make watergate look like kindergarten activity. it would be a conspiracy that would include hundreds of people, and they would all have to swear that they would not breach their conspiratorial process here--a program that is overseen by the judiciary committee, by the senate intelligence committee, the house intelligence committee, the body of the senate has access to this and the body of the house--that is 535 people--by the executive branch, a program that was endorsed by barack obama, until he changed his mind, apparently, because the public was going the other way based on false information. people are out here basically making the accusations that they are making to try to take this program down and all we are trying to do is work with the house to find a reasonable way of keeping this tool alive--keeping americans safe. mr. mccain. will the senator yield for a further question? the presiding officer. would the senator suspend? under the previous order, all time for debate has expired. mr. paul. mr. president, my understanding is there is still 5 minutes remaining on the opposition side. i request that time. the presiding officer. is there objection? mr. mccain. i object. mr. paul. mr. president, how can we have an objection when we already have a consent agreement that says we have 30 minutes of equally divided time and you still have 5 minutes remaining on the opposite side? the presiding officer. the time was divided in the usual form, and the time for debate has expired. mr. paul. mr. president, the time could not have been divided equally, because apparently somebody must have given one side more time than the other. the presiding officer. the 5 minutes of time that was allotted to the democratic side was unused, and it was equally divided at 23 minutes apiece. mr. paul. mr. president, i was here for 30 minutes of the republican side speaking. i sat at my seat for 30 minutes. it was not 23 minutes of equally divided time. mr. mccain. mr. president, regular order--obviously people don't know the rules of the senate. maybe they should learn them. mr. paul. mr. president, i request the remaining 5 minutes of time on the opposite side. the presiding officer. is there objection to the request of the senator from kentucky? mr. mccain. i object. mr. paul. mr. president, i challenge the ruling of the chair and request the yeas and nays. the presiding officer. is there a sufficient second? there is not a sufficient second. mr. paul. i request a live quorum call. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. paul. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. paul. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 minutes--the 5 minutes that was remaining on the opposition side. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. paul. mr. president, let us be very clear about why we are here this evening. we are here this evening because this is an important debate. this is a debate over the bill of rights. this is a debate over the fourth amendment. this is a debate over your right to be left alone. justice brandeis said that the right to be left alone is the most cherished of rights. the right to be left alone is the most prized to civilized men. let us be clear. we are here tonight because the president continues to conduct an illegal program. the president has been rebuked by the court. in explicit terms, the president has been told that the program he is conducting is illegal. now, the president opines on television. the president wants to blame--he says: anybody but me. but you know what. the president started this program without congressional permission. even the authors of the patriot act say that the patriot act in no way gives authority to the president to collect all of your phone records all of the time. if there ever was a general warrant, if there ever was a generalized collection of information from people about whom there is no suspicion, this is it. we are not collecting the information of spies. we are not collecting the information of terrorists. we are collecting all american citizens' records all of the time. this is what we fought the revolution over. are we going to so blithely give up our freedom? are we going to so blithely go along and just say: take it. well, i am not going to take it anymore. i do not think the american people are going to take it anymore. eighty percent of those under 40 say we have gone too far--that this whole collection of all of our records all the time is too much. the court has said: how can records be relevant to an investigation that has not started? the court has said that even under these lower standards, even under these standards of saying that it would be relevant, all of the stuff they are collecting is precisely irrelevant. now people say: well, they are not looking at it. they are not listening to it. it is the tip of the iceberg, what we are talking about here. realize that they were dishonest about the program until we caught them. they kept saying over and over: we are not doing this. we are not collecting your records. they were. the head of the intelligence agency lied to the american people, and he still works there. we should be upset. we should be marching in the streets and saying: he has to go. we cannot allow this. we cannot allow the rule of law to be so trod upon that we live in an arbitrary governmental world where they collect anything they want anytime they want. this is the tip of the iceberg. they are collecting records through executive order. they are collecting records through section 702. people say: how will we protect ourselves without these programs? what about using the constitution? what about using judicial warrants? about the tsarnaev boy, the boston bomber, they say: how will we look at his phone records? get a warrant. put his name on it. you can get a warrant. there is no reason in the world--the guy had already bombed us. do you think anybody was going to turn down a warrant? we should have gotten a warrant before. get warrants on people we have suspicion on. the simpson guy that was shot in garland had already been arrested. we had suspicion. let's hire 1,000 more fbi agents. let's hire people to do the investigation and quit wasting time on innocent american people. let's be very clear why we are here: president obama set up this program, the president obama who once was against the patriot act. president obama once said: you know what; we should have judges write warrants. [[page s3331]] president obama, who once believed in the fourth amendment, is the president who is now scooping up all of your records illegally. then he feigns concern and says: oh, we need to pass this new bill. he could stop it now. why won't someone ask the president: why do you continue? why won't you stop this program now? the president has every ability to do it. we have every ability to keep our nation safe. i intend to protect the constitution. the presiding officer. the senator's time has expired. ____________________",52735

CREC-2015-05-31-pt1-PgS3331-2,CREC-2015-05-31,114,USA FREEDOM ACT OF 2015--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 85 (Sunday, May 31, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S3331-S3340] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] USA FREEDOM ACT OF 2015--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, before the recess, I tried to get a short-term extension of three provisions that will expire at midnight tonight: section 215, business records; section 206, roving wiretap authority; and the ``lone wolf'' provision. Unfortunately, those efforts were unsuccessful. ``Lone wolf'' and roving wiretap are not--I repeat, not--the subject of controversy with the House bill. So I would propose that we extend at least the ``lone wolf'' and the roving wiretap authorities while we continue to litigate the differing views on section 215. More specifically, I would propose that we extend those two provisions-- ``lone wolf'' and roving wiretaps--for up to 2 weeks. Unanimous Consent Request Mr. President, having said that, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of a bill, which is at the desk, to extend the expiring provisions relating to ``lone wolf'' and roving wiretaps for 2 weeks, and that the bill be read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Kentucky. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, one of the promises that was given when the PATRIOT Act was originally passed was that, in exchange for allowing a less than constitutional standard, we would only use the actions against---- The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. PAUL. Terrorists and against foreigners. We found that 99 percent of the time, section 213 is used for domestic crime. I believe that no section of the PATRIOT Act should be passed unless our targets are terrorists--not Americans. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, regular order. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky---- Mr. COTTON. Regular order. Mr. PAUL. I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last week, I proposed giving the Intelligence Committee the time it would need to work toward the kind of bipartisan legislative compromise Americans deserve--a compromise that would preserve important counterterrorism tools necessary to protect American lives. That effort was blocked. Just now, I proposed an even narrower extension that would have only extended some of the least controversial--least controversial--but still critical tools to ensure they do not lapse as Senators work toward a more comprehensive legislative outcome. But even that very narrow offer was blocked. I think it should be worrying for our country because the nature of the threat we face is very serious. It is aggressive, it is sophisticated, it is geographically dispersed, and it is not--not--going away. As the LA Times reported, ``the Obama administration has dramatically stepped up warnings of potential terrorist attacks on American soil after several years of relative calm.'' The paper reported that this is occurring in the wake of ``FBI arrests of at least 30 Americans on terrorism-related charges this year in an array of `lone wolf' plots.'' So these aren't theoretical threats. They are not theoretical threats. They are with us every day. We have to face up to them. We shouldn't be disarming unilaterally as our enemies grow more sophisticated and aggressive, and we certainly should not be doing so based on a campaign of demagoguery and disinformation launched in the wake of the unlawful actions of Edward Snowden, who was last seen in Russia. The opponents of this program have not been able to provide any-- any--examples of the NSA abusing the authorities provided under section 215. And the record will show that, in fact, there has not been one documented instance of abuse of it. I think it is also important to remember that the contents of calls are not captured. That is the general view, but it is an incorrect one. I will say it again: The contents of calls are not captured. I say this to the American people: If you have been told that, that is not correct. That is what I mean about a campaign of disinformation. The only things in question are the number dialed, the number from which the call was made, the length of the call, and the date. That is it. That is it. Detailed oversight procedures have been put in place, too, in order to protect the privacy of Americans. Now, I believe this is a program that strikes a critical balance between privacy on the one hand and national security on the other. That doesn't mean the Senate still shouldn't have the opportunity to make some changes to it. That is precisely the outcome I had been hoping to facilitate by seeking several short-term extensions. And considering all that has come to light about the House-passed bill in recent weeks, I believe this was more than reasonable. The administration's inability to answer even the most basic questions about the alternate bulk data system it would have to build under that legislation is, to say the least, pretty troubling--pretty troubling. And that is not just my view. That is the view of many in this body, including colleagues who have been favorably predisposed to the House bill. In particular, I know Senators from both parties have been disturbed by the administration's continuing inability to guarantee whether the new system would work as well as the current one or whether there would even be any data available to analyze. While the administration has let it be known that this nonexistent system could only be built in time if telephone providers cooperated in building it, providers have made it abundantly clear that they are not going to commit to retaining the data. They are not going to commit to retaining the data for any period of time unless legally required to do so, and there is no such requirement in the House-passed bill--none at all. Here is how one provider put it: ``[We are] not prepared to commit to voluntarily retain documents for any particular period of time pursuant to the proposed USA Freedom Act if not required by law''--if not required by law. Now, these are just a few of the reasons I thought it prudent to try to give the Senate more space to advance better legislation through committee consideration and regular order, with input from both sides. But, my colleagues, it is now clear that will not be possible in the face of a determined opposition from those who simply wish to end the counterterrorism program altogether. No time to try to improve the House-passed bill will be allowed because some would like to end the program altogether. So this is where we find ourselves. This is the reality. So it essentially leaves us with two options. Option one is to allow the program to expire altogether without attempting to replace it. That would mean disarming completely and arbitrarily, based on a campaign of disinformation, in the face of growing, aggressive, and sophisticated threats--growing, aggressive, and sophisticated threats. That is a totally unacceptable outcome--a completely and totally unacceptable outcome. So we won't be doing that. [[Page S3332]] So we are left with option two, the House-passed bill. It is certainly not ideal. But along with votes on some modest amendments that attempt to ensure the program can actually work as promised, it is now the only realistic way forward. So I remain determined to continue working toward the best outcome for the American people possible under the circumstances. This is where we are, colleagues. We have the House-passed bill with some serious flaws and an inability to get a short-term extension to try to improve the House-passed bill in the way we normally do this-- through some kind of consultative process. So bearing that in mind, I move to proceed to the motion to reconsider vote No. 194, the vote by which cloture was not invoked on the motion to proceed to H.R. 2048. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The motion was agreed to. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 2048. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The motion was agreed to. Cloture Motion The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: Cloture Motion We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to proceed to H.R. 2048, an act to reform the authorities of the Federal Government to require the production of certain business records, conduct electronic surveillance, use pen registers and trap and trace devices, and use other forms of information gathering for foreign intelligence, counterterrorism, and criminal purposes, and for other purposes. Mitch McConnell, Lamar Alexander, Michael B. Enzi, David Vitter, John Cornyn, Johnny Isakson, Lisa Murkowski, John Barrasso, Richard Burr, Pat Roberts, Roy Blunt, Bob Corker, Orrin G. Hatch, Jerry Moran, Patrick J. Toomey, Mike Lee, Ted Cruz. The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the motion to proceed to H.R. 2048, an act to reform the authorities of the Federal Government to require the production of certain business records, conduct electronic surveillance, use pen registers and trap and trace devices, and use other forms of information gathering for foreign intelligence, counterterrorism, and criminal purposes, and for other purposes, shall be brought to a close, upon reconsideration? The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Enzi), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Graham), and the Senator from Nebraska (Mr. Sasse). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Menendez), the Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray), and the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Barrasso). Are there any Senators in the Chamber wishing to vote or to change their vote? The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 77, nays 17, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 196 Leg.] YEAS--77 Alexander Ayotte Baldwin Bennet Blumenthal Booker Boozman Boxer Brown Burr Cantwell Capito Cardin Carper Casey Cassidy Cochran Coons Corker Cornyn Cruz Daines Donnelly Durbin Feinstein Flake Franken Gardner Gillibrand Hatch Heinrich Heitkamp Heller Hirono Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kaine King Kirk Klobuchar Lankford Leahy Lee Manchin Markey McCain McCaskill McConnell Merkley Mikulski Murkowski Murphy Nelson Perdue Peters Portman Reed Reid Rounds Sanders Schumer Scott Shaheen Stabenow Sullivan Tester Tillis Toomey Udall Vitter Warner Warren Whitehouse Wicker Wyden NAYS--17 Barrasso Blunt Coats Collins Cotton Crapo Ernst Fischer Grassley Moran Paul Risch Roberts Rubio Sessions Shelby Thune NOT VOTING--6 Enzi Graham Menendez Murray Sasse Schatz The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 77, the nays are 17. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the affirmative, upon reconsideration, the motion is agreed to. The Senator from Kentucky. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, could we have order? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Mr. PAUL. Will the Chair inform me when I have 5 minutes remaining? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, tonight begins the process of ending bulk collection. The bill will ultimately pass. We always look for silver linings. I think the bill may be replacing one form of bulk collection with another, but the government, after this bill passes, will no longer collect our phone records. My concern is that the phone companies still may do the same thing. Currently, my understanding is the NSA is at the phone company sucking up the phone records and sending them to Utah. My concern is---- The PRESIDING OFFICER. Order in the Senate, please. The Senator deserves to be heard. Mr. PAUL. My concern is that under the new program, the records will still be sucked up into NSA computers, but the computers will be at the phone company, not in Utah. So the question is, Will it be a distinction without a difference? The question also will be, Will this be individualized? One of the issues about the Fourth Amendment that was the biggest part of the Fourth Amendment for our Founding Fathers was that a warrant should be individualized. General warrants were what we fought the Revolution over. James Otis fought a famous case in the 1760s, and he fought against the British soldiers writing their own warrants. What is interesting is that part of the PATRIOT Act allows our police to write their own warrants. We have something called national security letters. These have been done by the hundreds of thousands. Interestingly, when the President was in the Senate, he was opposed to national security letters and said that they should have judicial warrants. Now, it is interesting that in this bill that will pass, it is supported by the President, supported by the Director of National Intelligence, and now supported in a wide bipartisan fashion. It concerns me whether or not---- The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Will the Senator please suspend. The Senate will be in order. Please take your conversations out of the well, out of the Chamber. The Senator deserves to be heard. Mr. PAUL. It concerns me that the President, who supports the bulk data collection and has been performing it illegally for 6 years, now supports this bill. The devil is in the details. The question is, Will the new bill still allow bulk collection by the phone companies? Will they be able to put into the search engine not an individual about whom we have suspicion but an entire corporation? This is what was revealed when we saw the warrant that had Tsarnaev's name on it. The Director of National Intelligence came before the American people, came before Congress and swore under oath that they weren't doing this. Part of my problem with the intelligence-gathering in our country is it is hard for me to have trust. It is hard for me to have trust in the people to whom we are giving great power. They also insist we won't be able to catch terrorists. They insist the bulk collection allowed them to catch terrorists. But then it turned out, when it was investigated, when we looked at the classified documents, when the President's bipartisan privacy and civil liberties commission looked at this, when his review board looked at this, and then when the Department of Justice inspector general looked at this, [[Page S3333]] they all found that there was no unique data, there was no great discovery, there was no great breaking up of a terrorist ring. People have brought up the Boston Bomber, the Tsarnaev boy. They say: Well, we need this. We need the PATRIOT Act after the bombing to get his phone records. That is the most absurd thing I have ever heard. He has already committed a bombing. In fact, I think he was dead at that point, and they are saying we couldn't get a warrant to look at his phone records? It is absolutely absurd. I had a meeting with somebody from the intelligence community about 6 months ago, and I asked them this question: How do we get more information about terrorists--with a warrant with their name on it, where we can go as deep into the details as we want, or this metadata collection that uses a less-than-constitutional standard? And he said: Without question, we get more information with a warrant than we do through the metadata. When someone commits an act of atrocity, there is no question we would get a warrant, but I would go even further. I would say that I want to get more warrants on people before they blow up things. I would say that we need more money spent on FBI agents analyzing data and trying to find out whom we have suspicion about so we can investigate their records. I think we spend so much money on people about whom there is no suspicion that we don't have enough time and money left to go after the people who would actually harm us. The people who argue that the world will end at midnight tonight---- The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will please suspend. Order in the Chamber. Please take your conversations off the floor. Mr. PAUL. The people who argue that the world will end and that we will be overrun by jihadists tonight are trying to use fear. They want to take just a little bit of our liberty, but they get it by making us afraid. They want us to fear and give up our liberty. They tell us that if we have nothing to hide, we have nothing to fear. That is a far cry from the standard we were founded upon--innocent until proven guilty. One of the objections I tried to bring forward earlier but was interrupted repeatedly was that the PATRIOT Act was originally intended to go after foreigners and terrorists. We allowed a less-than- constitutional standard. We didn't ask for probable cause; we just said it had to be relevant, the information had to be relevant to an investigation about terrorists. But here is the problem, and this is one of the big problems I have with the PATRIOT Act. We now use parts of the PATRIOT Act to arrest people for domestic crime. Section 213, sneak-and-peek, where the government can come into your house, place listening devices, never announce they were ever in your house, and then leave and monitor your behavior and never let you know they were there, is being used 99.5 percent of the time for domestic crime. So, little by little, we have allowed our freedom to slip away. We allowed the Fourth Amendment to be diminished. We allowed the narrowing loss of something called probable cause. People say: Well, how would we get terrorists with that? The vast majority of warrants are approved in our country--the vast majority of warrants that are Fourth Amendment warrants where we individualized and put a name on it and asked probable cause. If tonight the police are looking for a rapist or a murderer, they will go to the house, and if they suspect the person is inside but nothing is imminently happening, they will stand on the curb and they almost always get a warrant. Do you think there is a judge in this land who would not grant a warrant--particularly after the Boston bombing--to look at the Tsarnaev brothers' records? There is not a judge in the land who would say no. I would venture to say that in advance there is not much chance that a judge would say no if you went to them and said: The Russians have given us indication and evidence that he has been radicalized and has associated overseas with people who are training to attack us. There is no reason why the Constitution can't be used. But we just have to not let those who are in power make us cower in fear. They use fear to take your freedom, and we have to be very, very careful of this. Now, some are saying I am misrepresenting this, that I am saying the government is listening to your phone calls. I am saying they are collecting your phone records. There are programs, though, in which there may be looking at content--emails, for example. The current law says that after 6 months even the content of your email has no protection. We have a very good piece of legislation to try to fix that. But realize that those who are loud, those who are really wanting you to give up your freedom, don't believe the Fourth Amendment protects your records at all. And this is a big debate. We went to the court. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals--the highest court in the land just below the Supreme Court--said that what they are doing is illegal, but we don't yet have a ruling on whether it is constitutional. One of my fears about the bill we are going to pass--the sort of in- between step some think may be better--is that it could moot the case. This means the court case will never get heard by the Supreme Court. I have a court case against the NSA. There is another district court that has ruled against the NSA. We now have an appellate ruling against the NSA. The court may well look at the activity of the Senate and say: Well, you guys have fixed the problem. We don't need to look at it anymore. It is no longer relevant. My other concern about this new bill that is going to pass is that the same people will judge it who judged the previous system. These people are called the rubberstamp courtroom, also known as FISA. Realize that the FISA Court is the court that said the collection of all Americans' records is relevant. The appellate court basically laughed at this notion and said that it sort of destroys any meaning to the word ``relevant'' if you collect everybody's records. It is not even a modifier. Instead of saying ``relevant,'' they should have said ``You can have everyone's records all the time.'' One of my other concerns about the in-between solution we are going to choose is that some are conjecturing--and you have to be suspicious of a government that often lies about their purpose--some are conjecturing that they are going to collect more phone data under the new system. One of the complaints last week, as there was discussion about this--in the newspaper, it was reported that really they were only collecting about 20 to 30 percent of your cell phone data. They were trying to collect all of your land line data, but they weren't for some reason collecting all of your cell phone data. One of my concerns is that as we go to this new system, they may actually be better at collecting our phone records and they may well be able to collect all of our cell phone data. Unless we go to a system where we individualize the warrants, unless we go to a system where a person's name is on the warrant, I am going to be very, very concerned. Now, we will present amendments on this bill. We tried to negotiate to be allowed to present amendments, but there wasn't a lot of negotiating that went on in the last week--in fact, there was none. We will still try. We will put amendments forward, and we will try to get amendments to make the bulk collection less bad when it does occur. One of the things we would like to do is to say that when they search the phone records, they can't put the name of a corporation in there; they would have to put in an individual's name. It is kind of tricky, the way these things are worded. The wording of this bill will say they can only put a U.S. person into the selector term to search all phone records. The problem is that they define ``U.S. person'' as also meaning corporation or association or grouping. So there is a little bit of looseness to the language. So if we are still going to allow corporations, what is to stop them from going back and putting AT&T or Verizon in the selection? Once again they will be looking at all the phone records, and all we will have done is transferred the phone records from government control in Utah to phone company control in another location. Will we be trading bulk collection in Utah for bulk collection under the phone companies? There are good people who believe this bill will reform, and I think they [[Page S3334]] are well-intended. I think they are good people who really think that we will end bulk collection and that it won't happen. My fear, though, is of the people who interpret this work at a place known as the rubberstamp factory over at FISA. It is a secret court, and it is a court in which 99.5 percent of the time they approve warrants. Warrants are simply rubberstamped over there. In fact, they approved that ``relevant'' meant all of your records. So my question is, If they put AT&T as a selector item, will we have the same thing, just in a different location? I have several amendments I am interested in if we are able to amend the bill. One is that the search would have to be an individual. That is more consistent with the Fourth Amendment. Another one would change the standard to the constitutional standard, which would be that there would have to be probable cause, which is a higher standard than simply saying it is relevant. Then we would actually be sending a new signal to the FISA Court. Another amendment I have, which I think would go a long way toward making the PATRIOT Act less bad--I think is the best way to put it-- would be to say that any information gathered under a less-than- constitutional standard could only be used for foreigners and terrorists. See, that was the promise. At the time, there were people who opposed the PATRIOT Act--not enough, but there were a few--and when they opposed the PATRIOT Act, they said their fear was that it would be used against American citizens. They said: No, no, we are only going after terrorists. But the law allows them to do it, and we now have sections of the PATRIOT Act which 99.5 percent of the time are being used for domestic crime. We have also seen that the Drug Enforcement Agency--it is alleged--is using information gathered under the PATRIOT Act to then go back and recreate cases against people for domestic crime. The question we have to ask ourselves is, Are we so frightened that we are willing to give up our freedom? Are we really willing to trade liberty for security? I think the U.S. Court of Appeals had some great points that they made when they ruled against the government, and I think what is important to know is that the President has continued to do this illegally. You have seen him on television. The President has been saying: Well, Congress is just getting in the way. If Congress would just do their job and get rid of this, everything would be OK. But the truth is that Congress never authorized this. Even the authors of the PATRIOT Act said this was not something Congress ever even contemplated. The court is now saying that as well. This was done by the executive branch--admittedly, both a Republican executive branch and a Democratic executive branch--but this wasn't created by Congress. So when the President says ``Well, Congress should just do this,'' the question that has never been asked by anyone in the media is ``Why doesn't he stop it?'' Everybody who has given advice has said he would, and he will come out and say he believes in a balanced solution, but he really is just abdicating the solution and has never discontinued the program, even when he has been told explicitly by the court that the program is an illegal program. This is what the U.S. court of appeals said in the case ACLU v. Clapper: We agree with the appellants that such an expansive concept of ``relevance'' is unprecedented and unwarranted. . . . The records demanded are not those of suspects under investigation, or of people or businesses that have contact with such subjects, or of people or businesses that have contact with others who are in contact with the subjects. So even two steps removed, we are gathering records that are completely irrelevant to the investigation. We are gathering up the phone records of innocent Americans. The other side will say: Well, we are not looking at them. So I have been thinking about this. Our Founders objected to the British soldiers writing warrants. They objected to them coming into their house and grabbing their papers. Do you think our Framers would have been happy if the British Government said: OK, we are just breaking your door down, we are just getting your papers, but we are not going to look at them. Do you think that would have changed the mindset of the Framers? So the fact that they say they are not looking at our records--is that any comfort or should it be any comfort? The act of violation is in taking your records. The act of violation is in allowing the police or a form of the police--the FBI--to write warrants that are not signed by a judge. The court goes on to say: ``The interpretation that the government asks us to adopt defies any limiting principle.'' The idea of a limiting principle when the court looks at things is that, the way I see it, is the difference between something being arbitrary, where there is no sort of principle that confines what would happen--if you have a law that has no limiting principle, it is essentially arbitrary. This is what Hayek wrote about in ``The Road to Serfdom.'' Hayek talked about the difference between the rule of law and having an arbitrary interpretation of the law. The danger of having an arbitrary interpretation of the law and the danger of having general warrants is that they have been used in the past with bias. People have brought their own bias into this. In the sixties, the bias was against civil rights activists and against Vietnam war activists. In the forties, the bias was in incarcerating and interring Japanese Americans. But what was consistent in all of these circumstances was that there was a generalization--a generalization based on the color of your skin, whether you were Asian American or African American, and also about the shade of your ideology. There is a danger in allowing the government to generalize without suspicion and to disobey the Fourth Amendment, and the danger comes that the government could one day generalize and bias could enter into things. We have on our records right now laws that allow an American citizen to be detained. It is not specifically a part of the PATRIOT Act, but it is along the same lines as this, that you are getting rid of the due process amendments and the ability of the Bill of Rights to protect an individual. When we allow an individual to be detained without a trial, what happens is that there is the possibility that someone could decide we don't like ``those'' people. And when you say that could never happen, think about the times in our history when it has. Richard Jewell, everybody said he was the Olympic Bomber. He was convicted on TV. Within hours, people said: Richard Jewell is guilty. Think about if he had been a Black man in 1920 in the South what may have happened to him. Think about the possibility for bias entering into our government. Think about what Madison said about government is--Madison said that we restrain government because we are worried that government may not be comprised of angels. If government were comprised of angels, we would not have to worry about restraining government. Patrick Henry said that the Constitution was about restraining government, not the people. It is not enough for people to say: Oh, I am a good man or I am a good person or the NSA would never do this. The other problem that makes us doubtful is that the NSA has not been honest with us. If they want to develop trust again, the President should have immediately let the person who lied to us go, the Director of National Intelligence. The appeals court concluded by saying that the government's bulk collection of telephone metadata exceeds the scope of what Congress has authorized and therefore violates section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. Some will try to argue that this debate was not worth the time we took on it. I could not disagree more. I am like everybody else. You know, I prize my time with my family and being at home on the weekends. I wish we would have done this in a more sensitive way, where we would have had more time and had an open amendment process. But we waited until the end. We waited until the final deadline. This is a characteristic of government. It is a flaw in government, frankly. We lurch from deadline to deadline. People wonder why Congress is so unpopular. It is because we go from deadline to deadline and then it is: Hurry up. We have no time to debate. We just must pass it as is. [[Page S3335]] The biggest debate against amendments is--and it finally convinced people who did not like this. They so much dislike amendments and slowing down the process, they are just going to take it. Even though they don't like it, they are going to pass what the House passed. It is unlikely any amendments will pass. But the thing is, we need to get away from lurching from deadline to deadline. What happens, with budget or spending or any of these bills, is we are presented with thousand-page bills with only hours to go. About a year ago this came up. At that time, we were presented with a 1,000-page bill with 2 hours to go. I read the Senate rules. It said: We are supposed to be presented with the bill for 48 hours in advance. So I raised my hand and made a motion. The motion I made was: Guys, we are breaking the rules here. Men and women, we are breaking the rules here. So they just voted to amend the rules for that bill and ignore the rules. This is why the American people are so frustrated. People here in town think I am making a huge mistake. Some of them, I think, secretly want there to be an attack on the United States so they can blame it on me. One of the people in the media the other day came up to me and said: Oh, when there is a great attack, are you going to feel guilty that you caused this great attack? The people who attack us are responsible for attacks on us. Do we blame the police chief for the attack by the Boston Bombers? The thing is, is that there can be attacks even if we use the Constitution. But there have been attacks while collecting your bulk data. So the ones who say: Well, when an attack occurs, it is going to be all your fault, are any of them willing to accept the blame? We have bulk collection now. Are any of them willing to accept the blame for the Boston bombing, for the recent shooting in Garland? No, but they will be the first to point fingers and say: Oh, yes, it is all your fault. We never should have given up on this great program. I am completely convinced that we can obey the Constitution, use the Fourth Amendment as intended, spirited letter of the law, and catch terrorists. When we look objectively at this program, when they analyzed the classified information, they found that there was no unique data. We had to fight them tooth and nail because they started out saying that 52 cases were cracked by the bulk data program. But then when the President's own bipartisan commission looked at it, it turned out that none of that was true. This gets back to the trust issue. If we are going to be lied to by the Director of National Intelligence, it is hard for us to believe them when they come forward and they say: Oh, this is protecting us. We have to have it. But what we are hearing is information from someone who really did not think it was a big deal to lie to us about whether the program even existed. Mark my words, the battle is not over. There are some--and I talked with one of the, I would say, smarter people in Silicon Valley, somebody who knows this from an intimate level, how things work, and how the codes and programs work. He maintains that the bulk collection of phone data is the tip of the iceberg, that there is more information in other data pools that are classified. Some of this is done through an Executive order called 12333. I am not sure I know everything in it. I have had no briefings on it. So anything I will tell you is from the newspaper alone. But the thing is, is that I would like to know: Are we also collecting your credit card information? Are we collecting your texts? Are we collecting your emails? They have already told us the Fourth Amendment does not protect your emails, even the content, after 6 months. In fact, really they have told you, the Fourth Amendment does not apply to your records at all. So be very careful about the people who say: Trust us. We will never violate your freedom. We will never take advantage of things. The President's Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board's conclusion was that: Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act has shown minimal value in safeguarding the Nation from terrorism. We have not identified any single instance involving a threat to the United States in which the program made a concrete difference in the outcome. The President's privacy board went on to say: The government's collection of a person's entire telephone calling history has a significant and detrimental effect on individual privacy. When they talked about whether the phone records were relevant to an investigation, the President's Commission said this: First, the telephone records acquired under the program have no connection to any specific FBI investigation at the time of their collection. Second, because the records are collected in bulk, potentially encompassing all telephone calling records across the Nation, they cannot be regarded as relevant to any FBI investigation. Here is the continuing danger to us, though: It is, I think, maybe a minor success that we are going to prevent the government from collecting these records. But realize that the interpretation of this will still occur in secret in the FISA Court. This is the FISA Court that said that collecting everyone's records was relevant. It completely destroys the notion that the word ``relevant'' has any meaning at all. This will be the question: Whether we can trust the FISA Court to make an interpretation that is at a higher degree of discernment than the one in which they said ``relevant'' can mean anything. The original USA FREEDOM Act, as passed originally by the House committee, was a better bill. It was gradually watered down until even the Director of National Intelligence, the one who lied about the program, now supports it, which gives me some misgivings. But the records that will be collected--the question is, How will we have an interpretation by the FISA Court? The original bill had an advocate. I thought this was a good part of the original bill. There would be a judicial advocate who would argue on the side of those who were having their records taken. So there would be an adversarial court, lawyers on both sides. Many people who write about jurisprudence and trying to find justice say that one of the essential functions of a court system, in order to find justice, is that there has to be a lawyer on both sides. There has to be an advocate on both sides. The truth is not always easy to find. The truth is presentation of facts by one side, presentation of contrary facts by the other side, and someone has to figure out which facts are more believable or which facts trump other facts. So I think a judicial advocate would have been good. They are still going to have it. They call it by a different name now, but it will be optional at the discretion of the FISA Court. So the court that ruled that all of your records are relevant now will have a choice as to whether to give you an advocate. That does not give me a great deal of comfort. There are other ways we could do this. We occasionally do look at terrorism cases in regular Federal court. When names come up that could jeopardize someone's safety at our intelligence agency or a secret, Federal courts can go into secret session. I have heard the Senator from Oregon often mention this. I think it is a great point that no one wants to reveal the names of anyone or the code or the secrets of how we do this. But if we are talking about constitutional principles, we want to do it in the open. Laws should not be discussed in secret. As we move forward, the PATRIOT Act will expire tonight. It will only be temporary. They will ultimately get their way. But I think the majority of the American people actually do believe the government has gone too far. In Washington, it is the opposite, but I think Washington is out of touch. There will be 80 votes, you know, to say: Continue the PATRIOT Act--maybe more. But if you go into the general public, if you get outside the beltway and visit America, you find it is completely the opposite. There was a poll a couple of weeks ago that said: Over 80 percent of people under age 40--over 80 percent of them--think that the government collecting your phone records is wrong and should not occur. So I think really this will be useful. People say: You are destroying yourself. You should have never done this. The American people will not side with you. People wished me harm and wished that this would be unsuccessful. But you know what, I came here to defend the Bill of Rights and to defend the [[Page S3336]] Constitution, popular or not. But I frankly think that the Bill of Rights and the Constitution are very popular, very important, and I will continue, as long as I have breath and as long as I am here to defend them. I yield back the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I just want to make sure, having worked with Senator Paul for many, many months now, that I especially appreciate his efforts in the last few days in this week to try to accommodate this body with respect to amendments. My colleague has said repeatedly that he was very interested in a short list of amendments, that he hoped to have some modest time that would be available for these amendments. He and I have worked together on a number of them. I think it is a reflection, as people think about this debate and on a topic that is of such enormous importance, that my colleague from Kentucky, especially with respect to this amendment issue, has tried continually to be reasonable and to be accommodating to this body. Until just a few hours ago, I was at home in Oregon having townhall meetings, flew all night to be here for this extremely important session. Of course, the topic we discussed this evening was front and center in terms of my constituents. The message from Oregonians at these townhall meetings was very clear. The people whom I have the honor to represent in the Senate want policies that advance their security and protect their liberties. The program we have been talking about tonight in the Senate really does not deliver either. It does not make us safer. It chips away at our liberties. I am going to spend a little bit of time this evening making the case for those kinds of arguments and laying out the challenge for the days ahead. Now, with respect to this safety issue, all of us understand-- particularly the Presiding Officer, who has been on the Intelligence Committee, as I have, for over 14 years--that it is a dangerous world. Anyone who serves on the Intelligence Committee knows that beyond any kind of debate. So we want policies that really deliver both security and liberty. This is what the President's own experts had to say with respect to this program that involves collecting millions and millions of phone records on law-abiding Americans. This was a group that was appointed and spent a considerable amount of time looking at the bulk phone records collection program. They issued a report, and will I just paraphrase what is the central finding, on page 104 of their report: As to information contributed to terrorist investigations by the use of section 215 telephony metadata--that is the collecting all of these millions and millions of phone records--these experts say that ``could readily have been obtained in a timely manner using conventional Section 215 orders.'' Now, the reason that is important is it spells out and recognizes that those who signed this report are individuals with some of the most pristine antiterror credentials in this country--Mike Morell, for example, the former Acting Director of the CIA; Richard Clarke, who held an extremely important position in two administrations and served with both Republicans and Democrats. Both of them are signatories to this important report. Beyond that--and it has not received much attention--the reality is that our government, on top of everything else, has emergency authorities so that when those who are charged with protecting our country believe there is a threat to the Nation, they are allowed to issue an emergency authorization to get the information they need right away, and then they can go back and get the warrant approved after the fact. Nobody is talking about eliminating that emergency authority. So what we have is a program that the most authoritative antiterror experts in the country believe does not make our Nation any safer. I read the most significant finding in their report. On top of that, as I just indicated, emergency authorities are still preserved. In fact, I have indicated to our President and to those who work in the intelligence agencies that if at any point the executive branch and, particularly, the intelligence agencies feel that their emergency authorities are inadequate to protect the country, I personally would be willing to support efforts to ensure that those emergency capabilities are reformed and our country can take the steps it needs when it is necessary. On top of this question, with respect to the issue of our safety, I want to talk about what I heard at some length earlier today with respect to how the program worked. I heard a number of Senators say that nobody in government is listening to these calls. That was repeated a number of times on the floor of this body. When the government, under this program, knows whom you called, when you called, and where you called from, in many instances the government doesn't need to be listening. If the government knows, under this program, that a person called a psychiatrist 3 times in 36 hours--twice after midnight--that is a lot of private and personal information. The government doesn't need to be listening to that call. So as to this notion that some who have wanted to make sure that our country would have both security and liberty are saying that it is a fantasy that the government is listening to calls, I could tell you that those who have been trying to reform the program have said, in effect, that the government doesn't need to listen to those calls. If the government has that amount of private and personal information, the government knows a lot about you, and it really doesn't need to listen. Certainly, if you are talking about a land line, then the government knows where you are calling from if they have a phone book. So with respect to this question of the government listening, I want it particularly understood that a program such as this, when the government has this kind of information, I believe, represents a threat to our liberty. The reason why I think so is that hardly a week goes by when databases aren't violated. No. 1, we see that reported regularly in the press. No. 2, we have known about unfortunate times in our history--J. Edgar Hoover comes to mind--when this kind of information could be used. And, No. 3, I have been very concerned, given what our former colleague, Senator Udall, and I had to do with respect to bulk phone record collection of email. We battled to end this. Of course, this was email that could be read by government agencies. We battled with various intelligence leaders saying that we felt this was a violation of people's rights and it wasn't effective. They asserted for months and months that it was. Finally, one day they woke up and said the program wasn't needed any more. None of this would have even happened had not Senator Udall and I made that case repeatedly. The intelligence leadership knew that we were not going to give it up, but that is what goes on if there isn't a check on some of these kinds of procedures. Senator Paul made mention of the fact that the intelligence leadership has not exactly been straight with the American people on these issues. I emphasize that we are not talking about the thousands and thousands of law-abiding patriotic, dedicated, wonderful people who work in the intelligence field. Day in and day out they do so much for our country. We are so appreciative of all they do. They are the ones who do the hard work, for example, to capture Bin Laden and day in and day out to make us safer. But the intelligence leadership, on the other hand, as noted by our colleague from Kentucky, has not always been straight with the American people. I spent many months trying to decipher what the former NSA Director meant when he said the government doesn't collect any dossiers on millions of Americans. I pointed out I had been on the Intelligence Committee for a long time and I had never heard the term ``dossier'' used. So I tried to learn more about it, used private opportunities and public opportunities, and just couldn't get the information. So, finally, I said: I have to ask this question in public. On the Intelligence Committee you don't get but perhaps 20 or 25 minutes a year to ask questions in public, to hold intelligence leaders accountable [[Page S3337]] on policy matters--not secret operations, because secret operations have to stay secret, but policy matters. So, after being stonewalled for many months--many months--I finally said I have to ask this question in public. So to make sure no one would feel ambushed, I sent the question to the Director of National Intelligence, Mr. Clapper. I sent it a day ahead of time. Then I didn't hear anything about its being inappropriate or in violation of classification rules. So I asked in public: Does the government collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans? I was told no, and that answer was obviously false. I tried to get it corrected, and we still couldn't get it corrected. Of course, then Mr. Snowden spoke out publicly and pointed that out. Since that time, the Director of National Intelligence and his representatives have given these five different explanations for why that answer was given. So that is why you have to ask the hard questions. You have to ask the hard questions about these issues. I see my friend and colleague Senator Heinrich has joined us tonight. I am so pleased that he has joined the Intelligence Committee. Senator Heinrich is one of those Senators who subscribes to that view that I just mentioned--that it is our job to ask the hard questions. It may be uncomfortable. It is not designed in any way to convey disrespect. We see it as our job to ask the hard questions. I would be interested in my colleague's thoughts with respect to this issue and to have him be given a chance to participate in this colloquy. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HEINRICH. First, I thank my friend from Oregon and I recognize the substantial leadership he has shown on this issue over the years. Long before I came to the Intelligence Committee and long before Edward Snowden began to steal documents, Senator Wyden, along with Senator Mark Udall and others, were doing everything they could--without disclosing classified information--to shine a light on the fact that the U.S. Government was collecting massive volumes of data on millions of law-abiding American citizens. My friend from Oregon deserves our thanks for that leadership. Now, after the bulk call data collection program was revealed to the public, the government, frankly, defended it and defended it vigorously. It took a number of months for the intelligence community and the rest of the administration to take a deep breath and really assess whether bulk metadata collection was necessary, whether it was effective, and to consider whether there were other less intrusive, more constitutionally grounded ways to accomplish these same goals. Starting with the President's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies, the administration began to agree that ``some of the authorities that were expanded or created in the aftermath of September 11 unduly sacrifice fundamental interests in individual liberty, personal privacy, and democratic governance.'' And they recommended changing those authorities in order to ``strike a better balance between the competing interests and providing for the common defense and securing `the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.' '' Following that, multiple efforts have been made to update and reform FISA and to update and reform the USA PATRIOT Act. None of those have been successful. But now we are forced to come to a resolution through a combination of, frankly, procrastination, and, I think, misguided hope that the American people would look the other way while the government continued to vacuum up and store their personal information and data as part of a program that even the intelligence community acknowledges can be accomplished through less intrusive means. I will be honest. The current USA FREEDOM Act isn't what I consider perfect. For example, I prefer that it include strong reform of section 702 collection, but I accept that circumstances require us to be pragmatic, require us to govern and move forward and to work with one another in both parties to find compromise. That is what the USA FREEDOM Act is. It is a product of bipartisan compromise. That is why it passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 338 to 88. And let's be blunt, many of those who voted against it didn't do so because they support bulk collection. They did so because they want to see section 215 wither and die in its entirety. That is the political reality we face today, and we need to accept it rather than demanding a continuation of a program that the appeals court has determined is illegal. Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague for his statements and would just want to explore this a little bit further. I hope that those who are following this debate understand that my colleague from New Mexico is a real rising star in the Senate. He and I would like the USA FREEDOM Act to go further, and we both worked together on legislation that would make additional reforms. Certainly, our colleagues on the Intelligence Committee and here in the Senate can expect to see us continuing to work together to advance these additional reforms over the coming months and years. For now, the two of us are saying we ought to support the USA FREEDOM Act and then move on--move on to other critical areas. I particularly want to see closed what is called the backdoor search loophole, which my colleague from New Mexico talked about. What this means, colleagues, is that when you are engaged in a lawful search of someone who is a threat overseas, pursuant to section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, very often law-abiding Americans can get swept up in this search and have their emails looked at. This is a problem today, and my view is it is likely to be a growing concern in the future because, increasingly, communications systems around the world are becoming globally integrated, so the amount of emails that are reviewed of Americans is likely to grow. But we can't get that change here tonight. So, as my colleague from New Mexico has mentioned, the USA FREEDOM Act would make several worthwhile reforms, such as increasing transparency, reducing the government's reliance on secret laws. But from my perspective, the centerpiece of it is ending the bulk collection of Americans' information under the PATRIOT Act. I have been trying to close this particular loophole for close to a decade now. Some of our colleagues have said the bulk collection has never been abused; that no one's rights have been violated. My own view is--and I will ask what my colleague thinks--that vacuuming up all this information, particularly when databases get violated all the time--we have seen historically instances where there has been improper conduct by the government. I believe dragnet surveillance violates the rights of millions of our people every day. Vacuuming up the private phone records of millions of Americans with no connection to wrongdoing is simply a violation of their rights. And vacuuming up Americans' email records, which I pointed out before my colleague came to the floor--which he and our former colleague Senator Udall and I battled--is surely a violation of the rights of Americans as well. Colleagues, that wouldn't have been pointed out at all--it wouldn't have been pointed out at all--unless Senator Udall and I, with the help of our friend from New Mexico, hadn't been pushing back on it. Finally, one day the government said: Well, we will get rid of it because it wasn't effective. They got rid of it because they saw they were going to get hard questions, the kinds of questions my friend from New Mexico has been asking. Now, with respect to the legality of this program, I know my colleague and I actually filed a legal brief, along with our former colleague Mark Udall, when the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was examining that program. In our brief, it was argued that we were able to debunk many of the claims that had been made about the effectiveness of the program. I think it would be helpful if my colleague from New Mexico laid out some of that analysis here tonight. I would ask the Senator from New Mexico to begin, and I would encourage him to start by addressing the claim that the bulk collection of Americans' phone records is essential for stopping terrorist attacks. My question to my colleague is, Is there any evidence, any [[Page S3338]] real concrete evidence, to support that claim? Mr. HEINRICH. I thank my friend from Oregon and begin by saying that despite what we may have heard from talking heads on the Sunday shows and on the cable news networks, the answer is no. There is simply no evidence to support those claims. When this mass surveillance was first revealed to the public 2 years ago, the executive branch initially responded to questions like this by claiming that various post-9/11 authorities had resulted in the thwarting of approximately ``54 terrorist events in the U.S. homeland and abroad.'' Now, a number of us, including my friend from Oregon and my former colleague from Colorado, Senator Udall, began to pull on that thread to really parse down and see just what the executive branch was talking about. First, of those 54 terrorist events, it turned out that only 13 were actually focused in the United States. But more importantly, those numbers conflated multiple different programs, including authorities under section 215 and different authorities under section 702. On June 19, 2013, my colleague from Oregon and Senator Udall pointed out that ``it appears that the bulk phone records collection program under section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act played little or no role in most of these disruptions. Saying that `these programs' have disrupted `dozens of potential terrorist plots' is misleading if the bulk phone records collection program is actually providing little or no unique value.'' Of the original 54 instances the executive branch pointed to, every one of them crumbled under scrutiny. None of them actually justified the continued existence of the bulk collection program. Let me take a moment, with the indulgence of our colleagues, and read what was written by Judge Leon of the District Court for the District of Columbia, when he ruled in the Klayman v. Obama case. This is a little long, but I think it is important this be part of the official record of this debate. Judge Leon writes: [T]he Government does not cite a single instance in which analysis of the NSA's bulk metadata collection actually stopped an imminent attack, or otherwise aided the Government in achieving any objective that was time-sensitive in nature. In fact, none of the three ``recent episodes'' cited by the Government that supposedly ``illustrate the role that telephony metadata analysis can play in preventing and protecting against terrorist attack'' involved any apparent urgency. He continues to write that: []In the first example, the FBI learned of a terrorist plot still ``in its early stages'' and investigated that plot before turning to the metadata ``to ensure that all potential connections were identified.'' []Assistant Director Holley does not say that the metadata revealed any new information-- much less time-sensitive information--that had not already come to light in the investigation up to that point. The judge continues: []In the second example, it appears that the metadata analysis was used only after the terrorist was arrested ``to establish [his] foreign ties and put them in context with his U.S. based planning efforts.'' []And in the third, the metadata analysis ``revealed a previously unknown number for [a] co-conspirator . . . and corroborated his connection to [the target of the investigation] as well as to other U.S.- based extremists.'' Continuing to quote Judge Leon: []Again, there is no indication that these revelations were immediately useful or that they prevented an impending attack. Assistant Director Holley even concedes that bulk metadata analysis only ``sometimes provides information earlier than the FBI's other investigative methods and techniques.'' Finally, Judge Leon writes: []Given the limited record before me at this point in the litigation--most notably, the utter lack of evidence that a terrorist attack has ever been prevented because of searching the NSA database was faster than other investigative tactics--I have serious doubts about the efficacy of the metadata collection program as a means of conducting time- sensitive investigations in cases involving imminent threats of terrorism. That is where the judge leaves off. And I will turn back to the Senator from Oregon to address the three cases we discussed in more detail in our amicus brief to the Second Circuit. Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague. The first of these examples--and they really are kind of overblown examples about the effectiveness of bulk collection--is the case of an individual named Najibullah Zazi. Mr. Zazi was a known terrorism suspect, and a number of people have suggested that bulk phone records collection was somehow essential to stopping him because a query of the bulk phone records database for numbers linked to Mr. Zazi returned a previously unknown number belonging to another terrorism suspect. However, since the government had already identified Zazi as a terrorism suspect prior to querying the bulk phone records database, it had all the evidence it needed to obtain the phone records of Zazi and his associates using an individualized section 215 order or other legal authorities. In the second case, some have pointed to Mr. Moalin, the San Diego man convicted of sending $8,500 to support al-Shabaab in Somalia. The intelligence community has indicated that information from the bulk phone records database ``established a connection between a phone number known to be used by an extremist overseas . . . and an unknown San Diego-based number'' that belonged to Mr. Moalin. Yet there are ample existing authorities under which the United States can conduct surveillance on a phone number known to be used by extremists overseas and other phone numbers in contact with that phone number. The argument that Mr. Moalin's case is an example of a unique value of bulk phone records collection is just not accurate. My view is this is yet another case that offers a misleading exaggeration with respect to the effectiveness of bulk phone records collection. Finally, several supporters of the bulk metadata program have claimed that ``[i]f we had had [the bulk phone-records] program in place at the time [of the September 11, 2001 attacks,] we would have been able to identify'' the phone number of one of the hijackers, Khalid al-Mihdhar. Just as in these other cases, however, the record indicates that Mr. Mihdhar's phone number could also have been obtained by the government using a variety of alternate means. Before September 11, the government was surveilling a safe house in Yemen but failed to realize that Mr. Mihdhar, who was in contact with the safe house, was actually inside the United States. The government could have used any number of authorities to determine whether anyone in our country was in contact with the safe house it was already targeting. It didn't need a record of every Americans' phone calls to establish that simple connection. Mr. HEINRICH. I wish to expound on that point a bit, about the many other ways the government can legitimately acquire phone records of terrorism suspects, because I think this is a very important point to understand the tools that already exist that have been very effective and have proven themselves over time. There are actually a number of legal authorities that can get the same information without the government collecting billions of call records--billions of call records that, in large part, belong to innocent Americans. For example, the Stored Communications Act permits the government to obtain precisely the same call records that are now acquired through bulk collection under section 215 when they are ``relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.'' Additionally, national security letters, which I point out do not require a court order, can also be used by the government to obtain call records for intelligence purposes. Further, the government can also acquire telephony metadata on a real-time basis by obtaining orders from either regular Federal courts or the FISC for the installation of pen registers or trap-and-trace devices. Finally, individualized orders for phone records, as opposed to orders authorizing broad bulk collection, can also be obtained under section 215. I think those of us early in this debate thought that was what was going to occur under the PATRIOT Act in the first place. But that is what the USA FREEDOM Act seeks to require while prohibiting the bulk collection of millions of personal records. It even includes emergency authorization authority for the government to get records prior to getting court approval, subject to later court approval, in an emergency. The government can use any of these authorities without any more evidence [[Page S3339]] than what is currently required to use the bulk phone records database, with less impact, I would point out, on the privacy interests of millions of innocent Americans. I think at this point the Senator from Oregon and I have laid out our case as to why this dragnet bulk surveillance program fails to make our country measurably safer and why it should end. I am pleased to say that a number of people have finally come around to our way of thinking on this. Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague. I will wrap up and then give the last word to my friend from New Mexico on the subject. He is absolutely right that some of the most authoritative leaders in our country-- experts on terror--have reached the same judgment we have. I made mention of the President's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies, and I really would encourage colleagues who are following this debate and citizens across the country--that report is available online, and it is available in our office. Page 104 of that report is very explicit. It says that the information that would otherwise be obtained in collecting all of these phone records-- millions of phone records of law-abiding Americans, people such as Mike Morell, former Acting Director of the CIA, and Richard Clark, who served in two administrations--they said it could have been obtained through conventional processes. This is a program that is not making us safer. And it is not my judgment that ought to be the last word; it should be that of people like those I just quoted. The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board's report on the telephone records program said pretty much the same thing: [T]he Section 215 program has shown minimal value in safeguarding the nation from terrorism. Based on the information provided to the Board, including classified briefings and documentation, we have not identified a single instance involving a threat to the United States in which the program made a concrete difference in the outcome of a counterterrorism investigation. I will close by way of saying--and I touched on this before my friend from New Mexico arrived--I would like to do a lot more than I believe is likely to happen here quickly in the Senate. I do want to see us finally throw in the dustbin of history this bulk phone records collection program because it doesn't make us safer and it compromises our liberty. But, as I indicated to my friend from New Mexico, I would also like to close this backdoor search loophole in the FISA Act, which is going to be a bigger problem in the days ahead given the evolution of communications systems and how they have become globally integrated. I will close by saying that one of the most important issues we are going to have to tackle in the days ahead is going to deal with encryption. Encryption, of course, is the encoding of data and messages so that they cannot be easily read. The reason this will be an enormously important issue--and my colleague and I have talked about this--is because of the NSA overreach, the collection of all these phone records of law-abiding people. A lot of our most innovative, cutting-edge companies have found their customers raising real questions about whether their products can be used safely, and a lot of the purchasers who buy their products around the world are saying: Maybe we shouldn't trust them. Maybe we should try to start taking control over their servers and have local storage requirements and that sort of thing. So what our companies did, because they saw the effect of the overreach by the NSA, was they started to use encryption to protect the data and messages of the consumers who buy their products. Most recently, the head of the FBI, Mr. Comey, rather than try to come back with a solution that protected both our privacy and our security, he said he was interested in requiring companies to build weaknesses into their products. Just think about that--requiring companies to build weaknesses into their products. So the government-- which, in effect, caused this problem with the overreach--in effect, rather than trying to find a solution that worked for both security and liberty, said: We will start talking about requiring companies to actually build weaknesses into their products. I and others have pointed out that once you do that, hang on to your hat. When the good guys have the keys, that is one thing, but when companies are required to build weaknesses into their products, the bad guys are going to get the keys in a hurry, too. And with all the cyber hacking and the risks we already have, we ought to be really careful about going where Mr. Comey, our FBI Director, has proposed to go. But that is not for tonight. Tonight is not an occasion where we will be able to, on a bipartisan basis, close the backdoor-search loophole or where we will be able to come up with a sensible policy with respect to encryption rather than requiring companies to actually build weaknesses in their products. We will not be able to do that tonight. But we will now have a chance here in the Senate to take steps that have been bipartisan both here in the Senate and in the other body, in the House of Representatives, to end the bulk phone records collection program because it doesn't make us safer and it threatens our liberties. I always like to close by thinking about Ben Franklin, who said that anybody who gives up their liberty to have security really doesn't deserve either. I am so pleased to have a chance to serve with my colleague from New Mexico on the Intelligence Committee, who is going to be a thoughtful advocate for these kinds of policies, in my view, for many years to come. I thank him for his involvement tonight and would be happy to give him the last word of our colloquy at this time. I yield to my colleague. Mr. HEINRICH. I thank my friend from Oregon. I think he could not have chosen a more appropriate way to end than to reference what Ben Franklin said so many years ago, that great quote that ``those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.'' While many reforms still lie in front of us, I think, as we move forward to approving the USA FREEDOM Act, we move a lot closer to the balance that Ben Franklin articulated so well over 200 years ago. I look forward to working with my colleague from Oregon and all of our colleagues in achieving that balance and standing up for our constituents. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we did not have to end up here, just hours away from the midnight expiration of three surveillance authorities, and having just moved to proceed to the USA FREEDOM Act. I have tried since last year to move legislation through the Senate to address these sunsets. In November, Senator Reid brought the USA FREEDOM Act to the floor but the Republican leadership of the Senate blocked debate on it. When they took over the Senate, they assured us that they would send bills--including this one--through appropriate committee process. There were promises that the new leadership would not fill the amendment tree, and would use a transparent legislative process. But not one of those promises has been fulfilled with respect to any legislation dealing with the upcoming sunsets. Once again this year, I proposed with Senator Lee a new version of the USA FREEDOM Act. That bill had significant process in the House, where it passed by an overwhelming margin earlier this month. And once again, the bipartisan coalition here in the Senate tried to get the bill passed. Two Fridays ago, the Senate Republican leadership did not allow us to debate the bill. Tonight, the Senate did the right thing by invoking cloture on the motion to proceed to the USA FREEDOM Act. I am glad to see several Republicans switched their votes. This is significant progress, but it is late in coming. We should have proceeded to this bill two Fridays ago. Had we done so, we could have stayed here to do our work, considered amendments, and passed the bill well in advance of tonight's sunset. Instead, we are hours away from expiration and just now considering legislation that many of us have been working on for years. Our intelligence community needs predictability and certainty, not a manufactured crisis. If all Senators cooperate, we can finish this bill tonight. We can consider a [[Page S3340]] handful of amendments under a time agreement, and pass this bill before midnight. That would be the responsible thing to do. Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Capito). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I know of no further debate on the motion. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to proceed. The motion was agreed to. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 85 (Sunday, May 31, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S3331-S3340] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] USA FREEDOM ACT OF 2015--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, before the recess, I tried to get a short-term extension of three provisions that will expire at midnight tonight: section 215, business records; section 206, roving wiretap authority; and the ``lone wolf'' provision. Unfortunately, those efforts were unsuccessful. ``Lone wolf'' and roving wiretap are not--I repeat, not--the subject of controversy with the House bill. So I would propose that we extend at least the ``lone wolf'' and the roving wiretap authorities while we continue to litigate the differing views on section 215. More specifically, I would propose that we extend those two provisions-- ``lone wolf'' and roving wiretaps--for up to 2 weeks. Unanimous Consent Request Mr. President, having said that, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of a bill, which is at the desk, to extend the expiring provisions relating to ``lone wolf'' and roving wiretaps for 2 weeks, and that the bill be read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Kentucky. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, one of the promises that was given when the PATRIOT Act was originally passed was that, in exchange for allowing a less than constitutional standard, we would only use the actions against---- The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. PAUL. Terrorists and against foreigners. We found that 99 percent of the time, section 213 is used for domestic crime. I believe that no section of the PATRIOT Act should be passed unless our targets are terrorists--not Americans. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, regular order. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky---- Mr. COTTON. Regular order. Mr. PAUL. I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last week, I proposed giving the Intelligence Committee the time it would need to work toward the kind of bipartisan legislative compromise Americans deserve--a compromise that would preserve important counterterrorism tools necessary to protect American lives. That effort was blocked. Just now, I proposed an even narrower extension that would have only extended some of the least controversial--least controversial--but still critical tools to ensure they do not lapse as Senators work toward a more comprehensive legislative outcome. But even that very narrow offer was blocked. I think it should be worrying for our country because the nature of the threat we face is very serious. It is aggressive, it is sophisticated, it is geographically dispersed, and it is not--not--going away. As the LA Times reported, ``the Obama administration has dramatically stepped up warnings of potential terrorist attacks on American soil after several years of relative calm.'' The paper reported that this is occurring in the wake of ``FBI arrests of at least 30 Americans on terrorism-related charges this year in an array of `lone wolf' plots.'' So these aren't theoretical threats. They are not theoretical threats. They are with us every day. We have to face up to them. We shouldn't be disarming unilaterally as our enemies grow more sophisticated and aggressive, and we certainly should not be doing so based on a campaign of demagoguery and disinformation launched in the wake of the unlawful actions of Edward Snowden, who was last seen in Russia. The opponents of this program have not been able to provide any-- any--examples of the NSA abusing the authorities provided under section 215. And the record will show that, in fact, there has not been one documented instance of abuse of it. I think it is also important to remember that the contents of calls are not captured. That is the general view, but it is an incorrect one. I will say it again: The contents of calls are not captured. I say this to the American people: If you have been told that, that is not correct. That is what I mean about a campaign of disinformation. The only things in question are the number dialed, the number from which the call was made, the length of the call, and the date. That is it. That is it. Detailed oversight procedures have been put in place, too, in order to protect the privacy of Americans. Now, I believe this is a program that strikes a critical balance between privacy on the one hand and national security on the other. That doesn't mean the Senate still shouldn't have the opportunity to make some changes to it. That is precisely the outcome I had been hoping to facilitate by seeking several short-term extensions. And considering all that has come to light about the House-passed bill in recent weeks, I believe this was more than reasonable. The administration's inability to answer even the most basic questions about the alternate bulk data system it would have to build under that legislation is, to say the least, pretty troubling--pretty troubling. And that is not just my view. That is the view of many in this body, including colleagues who have been favorably predisposed to the House bill. In particular, I know Senators from both parties have been disturbed by the administration's continuing inability to guarantee whether the new system would work as well as the current one or whether there would even be any data available to analyze. While the administration has let it be known that this nonexistent system could only be built in time if telephone providers cooperated in building it, providers have made it abundantly clear that they are not going to commit to retaining the data. They are not going to commit to retaining the data for any period of time unless legally required to do so, and there is no such requirement in the House-passed bill--none at all. Here is how one provider put it: ``[We are] not prepared to commit to voluntarily retain documents for any particular period of time pursuant to the proposed USA Freedom Act if not required by law''--if not required by law. Now, these are just a few of the reasons I thought it prudent to try to give the Senate more space to advance better legislation through committee consideration and regular order, with input from both sides. But, my colleagues, it is now clear that will not be possible in the face of a determined opposition from those who simply wish to end the counterterrorism program altogether. No time to try to improve the House-passed bill will be allowed because some would like to end the program altogether. So this is where we find ourselves. This is the reality. So it essentially leaves us with two options. Option one is to allow the program to expire altogether without attempting to replace it. That would mean disarming completely and arbitrarily, based on a campaign of disinformation, in the face of growing, aggressive, and sophisticated threats--growing, aggressive, and sophisticated threats. That is a totally unacceptable outcome--a completely and totally unacceptable outcome. So we won't be doing that. [[Page S3332]] So we are left with option two, the House-passed bill. It is certainly not ideal. But along with votes on some modest amendments that attempt to ensure the program can actually work as promised, it is now the only realistic way forward. So I remain determined to continue working toward the best outcome for the American people possible under the circumstances. This is where we are, colleagues. We have the House-passed bill with some serious flaws and an inability to get a short-term extension to try to improve the House-passed bill in the way we normally do this-- through some kind of consultative process. So bearing that in mind, I move to proceed to the motion to reconsider vote No. 194, the vote by which cloture was not invoked on the motion to proceed to H.R. 2048. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The motion was agreed to. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 2048. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The motion was agreed to. Cloture Motion The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: Cloture Motion We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to proceed to H.R. 2048, an act to reform the authorities of the Federal Government to require the production of certain business records, conduct electronic surveillance, use pen registers and trap and trace devices, and use other forms of information gathering for foreign intelligence, counterterrorism, and criminal purposes, and for other purposes. Mitch McConnell, Lamar Alexander, Michael B. Enzi, David Vitter, John Cornyn, Johnny Isakson, Lisa Murkowski, John Barrasso, Richard Burr, Pat Roberts, Roy Blunt, Bob Corker, Orrin G. Hatch, Jerry Moran, Patrick J. Toomey, Mike Lee, Ted Cruz. The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the motion to proceed to H.R. 2048, an act to reform the authorities of the Federal Government to require the production of certain business records, conduct electronic surveillance, use pen registers and trap and trace devices, and use other forms of information gathering for foreign intelligence, counterterrorism, and criminal purposes, and for other purposes, shall be brought to a close, upon reconsideration? The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Enzi), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Graham), and the Senator from Nebraska (Mr. Sasse). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Menendez), the Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray), and the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Barrasso). Are there any Senators in the Chamber wishing to vote or to change their vote? The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 77, nays 17, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 196 Leg.] YEAS--77 Alexander Ayotte Baldwin Bennet Blumenthal Booker Boozman Boxer Brown Burr Cantwell Capito Cardin Carper Casey Cassidy Cochran Coons Corker Cornyn Cruz Daines Donnelly Durbin Feinstein Flake Franken Gardner Gillibrand Hatch Heinrich Heitkamp Heller Hirono Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kaine King Kirk Klobuchar Lankford Leahy Lee Manchin Markey McCain McCaskill McConnell Merkley Mikulski Murkowski Murphy Nelson Perdue Peters Portman Reed Reid Rounds Sanders Schumer Scott Shaheen Stabenow Sullivan Tester Tillis Toomey Udall Vitter Warner Warren Whitehouse Wicker Wyden NAYS--17 Barrasso Blunt Coats Collins Cotton Crapo Ernst Fischer Grassley Moran Paul Risch Roberts Rubio Sessions Shelby Thune NOT VOTING--6 Enzi Graham Menendez Murray Sasse Schatz The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 77, the nays are 17. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the affirmative, upon reconsideration, the motion is agreed to. The Senator from Kentucky. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, could we have order? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Mr. PAUL. Will the Chair inform me when I have 5 minutes remaining? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, tonight begins the process of ending bulk collection. The bill will ultimately pass. We always look for silver linings. I think the bill may be replacing one form of bulk collection with another, but the government, after this bill passes, will no longer collect our phone records. My concern is that the phone companies still may do the same thing. Currently, my understanding is the NSA is at the phone company sucking up the phone records and sending them to Utah. My concern is---- The PRESIDING OFFICER. Order in the Senate, please. The Senator deserves to be heard. Mr. PAUL. My concern is that under the new program, the records will still be sucked up into NSA computers, but the computers will be at the phone company, not in Utah. So the question is, Will it be a distinction without a difference? The question also will be, Will this be individualized? One of the issues about the Fourth Amendment that was the biggest part of the Fourth Amendment for our Founding Fathers was that a warrant should be individualized. General warrants were what we fought the Revolution over. James Otis fought a famous case in the 1760s, and he fought against the British soldiers writing their own warrants. What is interesting is that part of the PATRIOT Act allows our police to write their own warrants. We have something called national security letters. These have been done by the hundreds of thousands. Interestingly, when the President was in the Senate, he was opposed to national security letters and said that they should have judicial warrants. Now, it is interesting that in this bill that will pass, it is supported by the President, supported by the Director of National Intelligence, and now supported in a wide bipartisan fashion. It concerns me whether or not---- The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Will the Senator please suspend. The Senate will be in order. Please take your conversations out of the well, out of the Chamber. The Senator deserves to be heard. Mr. PAUL. It concerns me that the President, who supports the bulk data collection and has been performing it illegally for 6 years, now supports this bill. The devil is in the details. The question is, Will the new bill still allow bulk collection by the phone companies? Will they be able to put into the search engine not an individual about whom we have suspicion but an entire corporation? This is what was revealed when we saw the warrant that had Tsarnaev's name on it. The Director of National Intelligence came before the American people, came before Congress and swore under oath that they weren't doing this. Part of my problem with the intelligence-gathering in our country is it is hard for me to have trust. It is hard for me to have trust in the people to whom we are giving great power. They also insist we won't be able to catch terrorists. They insist the bulk collection allowed them to catch terrorists. But then it turned out, when it was investigated, when we looked at the classified documents, when the President's bipartisan privacy and civil liberties commission looked at this, when his review board looked at this, and then when the Department of Justice inspector general looked at this, [[Page S3333]] they all found that there was no unique data, there was no great discovery, there was no great breaking up of a terrorist ring. People have brought up the Boston Bomber, the Tsarnaev boy. They say: Well, we need this. We need the PATRIOT Act after the bombing to get his phone records. That is the most absurd thing I have ever heard. He has already committed a bombing. In fact, I think he was dead at that point, and they are saying we couldn't get a warrant to look at his phone records? It is absolutely absurd. I had a meeting with somebody from the intelligence community about 6 months ago, and I asked them this question: How do we get more information about terrorists--with a warrant with their name on it, where we can go as deep into the details as we want, or this metadata collection that uses a less-than-constitutional standard? And he said: Without question, we get more information with a warrant than we do through the metadata. When someone commits an act of atrocity, there is no question we would get a warrant, but I would go even further. I would say that I want to get more warrants on people before they blow up things. I would say that we need more money spent on FBI agents analyzing data and trying to find out whom we have suspicion about so we can investigate their records. I think we spend so much money on people about whom there is no suspicion that we don't have enough time and money left to go after the people who would actually harm us. The people who argue that the world will end at midnight tonight---- The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will please suspend. Order in the Chamber. Please take your conversations off the floor. Mr. PAUL. The people who argue that the world will end and that we will be overrun by jihadists tonight are trying to use fear. They want to take just a little bit of our liberty, but they get it by making us afraid. They want us to fear and give up our liberty. They tell us that if we have nothing to hide, we have nothing to fear. That is a far cry from the standard we were founded upon--innocent until proven guilty. One of the objections I tried to bring forward earlier but was interrupted repeatedly was that the PATRIOT Act was originally intended to go after foreigners and terrorists. We allowed a less-than- constitutional standard. We didn't ask for probable cause; we just said it had to be relevant, the information had to be relevant to an investigation about terrorists. But here is the problem, and this is one of the big problems I have with the PATRIOT Act. We now use parts of the PATRIOT Act to arrest people for domestic crime. Section 213, sneak-and-peek, where the government can come into your house, place listening devices, never announce they were ever in your house, and then leave and monitor your behavior and never let you know they were there, is being used 99.5 percent of the time for domestic crime. So, little by little, we have allowed our freedom to slip away. We allowed the Fourth Amendment to be diminished. We allowed the narrowing loss of something called probable cause. People say: Well, how would we get terrorists with that? The vast majority of warrants are approved in our country--the vast majority of warrants that are Fourth Amendment warrants where we individualized and put a name on it and asked probable cause. If tonight the police are looking for a rapist or a murderer, they will go to the house, and if they suspect the person is inside but nothing is imminently happening, they will stand on the curb and they almost always get a warrant. Do you think there is a judge in this land who would not grant a warrant--particularly after the Boston bombing--to look at the Tsarnaev brothers' records? There is not a judge in the land who would say no. I would venture to say that in advance there is not much chance that a judge would say no if you went to them and said: The Russians have given us indication and evidence that he has been radicalized and has associated overseas with people who are training to attack us. There is no reason why the Constitution can't be used. But we just have to not let those who are in power make us cower in fear. They use fear to take your freedom, and we have to be very, very careful of this. Now, some are saying I am misrepresenting this, that I am saying the government is listening to your phone calls. I am saying they are collecting your phone records. There are programs, though, in which there may be looking at content--emails, for example. The current law says that after 6 months even the content of your email has no protection. We have a very good piece of legislation to try to fix that. But realize that those who are loud, those who are really wanting you to give up your freedom, don't believe the Fourth Amendment protects your records at all. And this is a big debate. We went to the court. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals--the highest court in the land just below the Supreme Court--said that what they are doing is illegal, but we don't yet have a ruling on whether it is constitutional. One of my fears about the bill we are going to pass--the sort of in- between step some think may be better--is that it could moot the case. This means the court case will never get heard by the Supreme Court. I have a court case against the NSA. There is another district court that has ruled against the NSA. We now have an appellate ruling against the NSA. The court may well look at the activity of the Senate and say: Well, you guys have fixed the problem. We don't need to look at it anymore. It is no longer relevant. My other concern about this new bill that is going to pass is that the same people will judge it who judged the previous system. These people are called the rubberstamp courtroom, also known as FISA. Realize that the FISA Court is the court that said the collection of all Americans' records is relevant. The appellate court basically laughed at this notion and said that it sort of destroys any meaning to the word ``relevant'' if you collect everybody's records. It is not even a modifier. Instead of saying ``relevant,'' they should have said ``You can have everyone's records all the time.'' One of my other concerns about the in-between solution we are going to choose is that some are conjecturing--and you have to be suspicious of a government that often lies about their purpose--some are conjecturing that they are going to collect more phone data under the new system. One of the complaints last week, as there was discussion about this--in the newspaper, it was reported that really they were only collecting about 20 to 30 percent of your cell phone data. They were trying to collect all of your land line data, but they weren't for some reason collecting all of your cell phone data. One of my concerns is that as we go to this new system, they may actually be better at collecting our phone records and they may well be able to collect all of our cell phone data. Unless we go to a system where we individualize the warrants, unless we go to a system where a person's name is on the warrant, I am going to be very, very concerned. Now, we will present amendments on this bill. We tried to negotiate to be allowed to present amendments, but there wasn't a lot of negotiating that went on in the last week--in fact, there was none. We will still try. We will put amendments forward, and we will try to get amendments to make the bulk collection less bad when it does occur. One of the things we would like to do is to say that when they search the phone records, they can't put the name of a corporation in there; they would have to put in an individual's name. It is kind of tricky, the way these things are worded. The wording of this bill will say they can only put a U.S. person into the selector term to search all phone records. The problem is that they define ``U.S. person'' as also meaning corporation or association or grouping. So there is a little bit of looseness to the language. So if we are still going to allow corporations, what is to stop them from going back and putting AT&T or Verizon in the selection? Once again they will be looking at all the phone records, and all we will have done is transferred the phone records from government control in Utah to phone company control in another location. Will we be trading bulk collection in Utah for bulk collection under the phone companies? There are good people who believe this bill will reform, and I think they [[Page S3334]] are well-intended. I think they are good people who really think that we will end bulk collection and that it won't happen. My fear, though, is of the people who interpret this work at a place known as the rubberstamp factory over at FISA. It is a secret court, and it is a court in which 99.5 percent of the time they approve warrants. Warrants are simply rubberstamped over there. In fact, they approved that ``relevant'' meant all of your records. So my question is, If they put AT&T as a selector item, will we have the same thing, just in a different location? I have several amendments I am interested in if we are able to amend the bill. One is that the search would have to be an individual. That is more consistent with the Fourth Amendment. Another one would change the standard to the constitutional standard, which would be that there would have to be probable cause, which is a higher standard than simply saying it is relevant. Then we would actually be sending a new signal to the FISA Court. Another amendment I have, which I think would go a long way toward making the PATRIOT Act less bad--I think is the best way to put it-- would be to say that any information gathered under a less-than- constitutional standard could only be used for foreigners and terrorists. See, that was the promise. At the time, there were people who opposed the PATRIOT Act--not enough, but there were a few--and when they opposed the PATRIOT Act, they said their fear was that it would be used against American citizens. They said: No, no, we are only going after terrorists. But the law allows them to do it, and we now have sections of the PATRIOT Act which 99.5 percent of the time are being used for domestic crime. We have also seen that the Drug Enforcement Agency--it is alleged--is using information gathered under the PATRIOT Act to then go back and recreate cases against people for domestic crime. The question we have to ask ourselves is, Are we so frightened that we are willing to give up our freedom? Are we really willing to trade liberty for security? I think the U.S. Court of Appeals had some great points that they made when they ruled against the government, and I think what is important to know is that the President has continued to do this illegally. You have seen him on television. The President has been saying: Well, Congress is just getting in the way. If Congress would just do their job and get rid of this, everything would be OK. But the truth is that Congress never authorized this. Even the authors of the PATRIOT Act said this was not something Congress ever even contemplated. The court is now saying that as well. This was done by the executive branch--admittedly, both a Republican executive branch and a Democratic executive branch--but this wasn't created by Congress. So when the President says ``Well, Congress should just do this,'' the question that has never been asked by anyone in the media is ``Why doesn't he stop it?'' Everybody who has given advice has said he would, and he will come out and say he believes in a balanced solution, but he really is just abdicating the solution and has never discontinued the program, even when he has been told explicitly by the court that the program is an illegal program. This is what the U.S. court of appeals said in the case ACLU v. Clapper: We agree with the appellants that such an expansive concept of ``relevance'' is unprecedented and unwarranted. . . . The records demanded are not those of suspects under investigation, or of people or businesses that have contact with such subjects, or of people or businesses that have contact with others who are in contact with the subjects. So even two steps removed, we are gathering records that are completely irrelevant to the investigation. We are gathering up the phone records of innocent Americans. The other side will say: Well, we are not looking at them. So I have been thinking about this. Our Founders objected to the British soldiers writing warrants. They objected to them coming into their house and grabbing their papers. Do you think our Framers would have been happy if the British Government said: OK, we are just breaking your door down, we are just getting your papers, but we are not going to look at them. Do you think that would have changed the mindset of the Framers? So the fact that they say they are not looking at our records--is that any comfort or should it be any comfort? The act of violation is in taking your records. The act of violation is in allowing the police or a form of the police--the FBI--to write warrants that are not signed by a judge. The court goes on to say: ``The interpretation that the government asks us to adopt defies any limiting principle.'' The idea of a limiting principle when the court looks at things is that, the way I see it, is the difference between something being arbitrary, where there is no sort of principle that confines what would happen--if you have a law that has no limiting principle, it is essentially arbitrary. This is what Hayek wrote about in ``The Road to Serfdom.'' Hayek talked about the difference between the rule of law and having an arbitrary interpretation of the law. The danger of having an arbitrary interpretation of the law and the danger of having general warrants is that they have been used in the past with bias. People have brought their own bias into this. In the sixties, the bias was against civil rights activists and against Vietnam war activists. In the forties, the bias was in incarcerating and interring Japanese Americans. But what was consistent in all of these circumstances was that there was a generalization--a generalization based on the color of your skin, whether you were Asian American or African American, and also about the shade of your ideology. There is a danger in allowing the government to generalize without suspicion and to disobey the Fourth Amendment, and the danger comes that the government could one day generalize and bias could enter into things. We have on our records right now laws that allow an American citizen to be detained. It is not specifically a part of the PATRIOT Act, but it is along the same lines as this, that you are getting rid of the due process amendments and the ability of the Bill of Rights to protect an individual. When we allow an individual to be detained without a trial, what happens is that there is the possibility that someone could decide we don't like ``those'' people. And when you say that could never happen, think about the times in our history when it has. Richard Jewell, everybody said he was the Olympic Bomber. He was convicted on TV. Within hours, people said: Richard Jewell is guilty. Think about if he had been a Black man in 1920 in the South what may have happened to him. Think about the possibility for bias entering into our government. Think about what Madison said about government is--Madison said that we restrain government because we are worried that government may not be comprised of angels. If government were comprised of angels, we would not have to worry about restraining government. Patrick Henry said that the Constitution was about restraining government, not the people. It is not enough for people to say: Oh, I am a good man or I am a good person or the NSA would never do this. The other problem that makes us doubtful is that the NSA has not been honest with us. If they want to develop trust again, the President should have immediately let the person who lied to us go, the Director of National Intelligence. The appeals court concluded by saying that the government's bulk collection of telephone metadata exceeds the scope of what Congress has authorized and therefore violates section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. Some will try to argue that this debate was not worth the time we took on it. I could not disagree more. I am like everybody else. You know, I prize my time with my family and being at home on the weekends. I wish we would have done this in a more sensitive way, where we would have had more time and had an open amendment process. But we waited until the end. We waited until the final deadline. This is a characteristic of government. It is a flaw in government, frankly. We lurch from deadline to deadline. People wonder why Congress is so unpopular. It is because we go from deadline to deadline and then it is: Hurry up. We have no time to debate. We just must pass it as is. [[Page S3335]] The biggest debate against amendments is--and it finally convinced people who did not like this. They so much dislike amendments and slowing down the process, they are just going to take it. Even though they don't like it, they are going to pass what the House passed. It is unlikely any amendments will pass. But the thing is, we need to get away from lurching from deadline to deadline. What happens, with budget or spending or any of these bills, is we are presented with thousand-page bills with only hours to go. About a year ago this came up. At that time, we were presented with a 1,000-page bill with 2 hours to go. I read the Senate rules. It said: We are supposed to be presented with the bill for 48 hours in advance. So I raised my hand and made a motion. The motion I made was: Guys, we are breaking the rules here. Men and women, we are breaking the rules here. So they just voted to amend the rules for that bill and ignore the rules. This is why the American people are so frustrated. People here in town think I am making a huge mistake. Some of them, I think, secretly want there to be an attack on the United States so they can blame it on me. One of the people in the media the other day came up to me and said: Oh, when there is a great attack, are you going to feel guilty that you caused this great attack? The people who attack us are responsible for attacks on us. Do we blame the police chief for the attack by the Boston Bombers? The thing is, is that there can be attacks even if we use the Constitution. But there have been attacks while collecting your bulk data. So the ones who say: Well, when an attack occurs, it is going to be all your fault, are any of them willing to accept the blame? We have bulk collection now. Are any of them willing to accept the blame for the Boston bombing, for the recent shooting in Garland? No, but they will be the first to point fingers and say: Oh, yes, it is all your fault. We never should have given up on this great program. I am completely convinced that we can obey the Constitution, use the Fourth Amendment as intended, spirited letter of the law, and catch terrorists. When we look objectively at this program, when they analyzed the classified information, they found that there was no unique data. We had to fight them tooth and nail because they started out saying that 52 cases were cracked by the bulk data program. But then when the President's own bipartisan commission looked at it, it turned out that none of that was true. This gets back to the trust issue. If we are going to be lied to by the Director of National Intelligence, it is hard for us to believe them when they come forward and they say: Oh, this is protecting us. We have to have it. But what we are hearing is information from someone who really did not think it was a big deal to lie to us about whether the program even existed. Mark my words, the battle is not over. There are some--and I talked with one of the, I would say, smarter people in Silicon Valley, somebody who knows this from an intimate level, how things work, and how the codes and programs work. He maintains that the bulk collection of phone data is the tip of the iceberg, that there is more information in other data pools that are classified. Some of this is done through an Executive order called 12333. I am not sure I know everything in it. I have had no briefings on it. So anything I will tell you is from the newspaper alone. But the thing is, is that I would like to know: Are we also collecting your credit card information? Are we collecting your texts? Are we collecting your emails? They have already told us the Fourth Amendment does not protect your emails, even the content, after 6 months. In fact, really they have told you, the Fourth Amendment does not apply to your records at all. So be very careful about the people who say: Trust us. We will never violate your freedom. We will never take advantage of things. The President's Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board's conclusion was that: Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act has shown minimal value in safeguarding the Nation from terrorism. We have not identified any single instance involving a threat to the United States in which the program made a concrete difference in the outcome. The President's privacy board went on to say: The government's collection of a person's entire telephone calling history has a significant and detrimental effect on individual privacy. When they talked about whether the phone records were relevant to an investigation, the President's Commission said this: First, the telephone records acquired under the program have no connection to any specific FBI investigation at the time of their collection. Second, because the records are collected in bulk, potentially encompassing all telephone calling records across the Nation, they cannot be regarded as relevant to any FBI investigation. Here is the continuing danger to us, though: It is, I think, maybe a minor success that we are going to prevent the government from collecting these records. But realize that the interpretation of this will still occur in secret in the FISA Court. This is the FISA Court that said that collecting everyone's records was relevant. It completely destroys the notion that the word ``relevant'' has any meaning at all. This will be the question: Whether we can trust the FISA Court to make an interpretation that is at a higher degree of discernment than the one in which they said ``relevant'' can mean anything. The original USA FREEDOM Act, as passed originally by the House committee, was a better bill. It was gradually watered down until even the Director of National Intelligence, the one who lied about the program, now supports it, which gives me some misgivings. But the records that will be collected--the question is, How will we have an interpretation by the FISA Court? The original bill had an advocate. I thought this was a good part of the original bill. There would be a judicial advocate who would argue on the side of those who were having their records taken. So there would be an adversarial court, lawyers on both sides. Many people who write about jurisprudence and trying to find justice say that one of the essential functions of a court system, in order to find justice, is that there has to be a lawyer on both sides. There has to be an advocate on both sides. The truth is not always easy to find. The truth is presentation of facts by one side, presentation of contrary facts by the other side, and someone has to figure out which facts are more believable or which facts trump other facts. So I think a judicial advocate would have been good. They are still going to have it. They call it by a different name now, but it will be optional at the discretion of the FISA Court. So the court that ruled that all of your records are relevant now will have a choice as to whether to give you an advocate. That does not give me a great deal of comfort. There are other ways we could do this. We occasionally do look at terrorism cases in regular Federal court. When names come up that could jeopardize someone's safety at our intelligence agency or a secret, Federal courts can go into secret session. I have heard the Senator from Oregon often mention this. I think it is a great point that no one wants to reveal the names of anyone or the code or the secrets of how we do this. But if we are talking about constitutional principles, we want to do it in the open. Laws should not be discussed in secret. As we move forward, the PATRIOT Act will expire tonight. It will only be temporary. They will ultimately get their way. But I think the majority of the American people actually do believe the government has gone too far. In Washington, it is the opposite, but I think Washington is out of touch. There will be 80 votes, you know, to say: Continue the PATRIOT Act--maybe more. But if you go into the general public, if you get outside the beltway and visit America, you find it is completely the opposite. There was a poll a couple of weeks ago that said: Over 80 percent of people under age 40--over 80 percent of them--think that the government collecting your phone records is wrong and should not occur. So I think really this will be useful. People say: You are destroying yourself. You should have never done this. The American people will not side with you. People wished me harm and wished that this would be unsuccessful. But you know what, I came here to defend the Bill of Rights and to defend the [[Page S3336]] Constitution, popular or not. But I frankly think that the Bill of Rights and the Constitution are very popular, very important, and I will continue, as long as I have breath and as long as I am here to defend them. I yield back the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I just want to make sure, having worked with Senator Paul for many, many months now, that I especially appreciate his efforts in the last few days in this week to try to accommodate this body with respect to amendments. My colleague has said repeatedly that he was very interested in a short list of amendments, that he hoped to have some modest time that would be available for these amendments. He and I have worked together on a number of them. I think it is a reflection, as people think about this debate and on a topic that is of such enormous importance, that my colleague from Kentucky, especially with respect to this amendment issue, has tried continually to be reasonable and to be accommodating to this body. Until just a few hours ago, I was at home in Oregon having townhall meetings, flew all night to be here for this extremely important session. Of course, the topic we discussed this evening was front and center in terms of my constituents. The message from Oregonians at these townhall meetings was very clear. The people whom I have the honor to represent in the Senate want policies that advance their security and protect their liberties. The program we have been talking about tonight in the Senate really does not deliver either. It does not make us safer. It chips away at our liberties. I am going to spend a little bit of time this evening making the case for those kinds of arguments and laying out the challenge for the days ahead. Now, with respect to this safety issue, all of us understand-- particularly the Presiding Officer, who has been on the Intelligence Committee, as I have, for over 14 years--that it is a dangerous world. Anyone who serves on the Intelligence Committee knows that beyond any kind of debate. So we want policies that really deliver both security and liberty. This is what the President's own experts had to say with respect to this program that involves collecting millions and millions of phone records on law-abiding Americans. This was a group that was appointed and spent a considerable amount of time looking at the bulk phone records collection program. They issued a report, and will I just paraphrase what is the central finding, on page 104 of their report: As to information contributed to terrorist investigations by the use of section 215 telephony metadata--that is the collecting all of these millions and millions of phone records--these experts say that ``could readily have been obtained in a timely manner using conventional Section 215 orders.'' Now, the reason that is important is it spells out and recognizes that those who signed this report are individuals with some of the most pristine antiterror credentials in this country--Mike Morell, for example, the former Acting Director of the CIA; Richard Clarke, who held an extremely important position in two administrations and served with both Republicans and Democrats. Both of them are signatories to this important report. Beyond that--and it has not received much attention--the reality is that our government, on top of everything else, has emergency authorities so that when those who are charged with protecting our country believe there is a threat to the Nation, they are allowed to issue an emergency authorization to get the information they need right away, and then they can go back and get the warrant approved after the fact. Nobody is talking about eliminating that emergency authority. So what we have is a program that the most authoritative antiterror experts in the country believe does not make our Nation any safer. I read the most significant finding in their report. On top of that, as I just indicated, emergency authorities are still preserved. In fact, I have indicated to our President and to those who work in the intelligence agencies that if at any point the executive branch and, particularly, the intelligence agencies feel that their emergency authorities are inadequate to protect the country, I personally would be willing to support efforts to ensure that those emergency capabilities are reformed and our country can take the steps it needs when it is necessary. On top of this question, with respect to the issue of our safety, I want to talk about what I heard at some length earlier today with respect to how the program worked. I heard a number of Senators say that nobody in government is listening to these calls. That was repeated a number of times on the floor of this body. When the government, under this program, knows whom you called, when you called, and where you called from, in many instances the government doesn't need to be listening. If the government knows, under this program, that a person called a psychiatrist 3 times in 36 hours--twice after midnight--that is a lot of private and personal information. The government doesn't need to be listening to that call. So as to this notion that some who have wanted to make sure that our country would have both security and liberty are saying that it is a fantasy that the government is listening to calls, I could tell you that those who have been trying to reform the program have said, in effect, that the government doesn't need to listen to those calls. If the government has that amount of private and personal information, the government knows a lot about you, and it really doesn't need to listen. Certainly, if you are talking about a land line, then the government knows where you are calling from if they have a phone book. So with respect to this question of the government listening, I want it particularly understood that a program such as this, when the government has this kind of information, I believe, represents a threat to our liberty. The reason why I think so is that hardly a week goes by when databases aren't violated. No. 1, we see that reported regularly in the press. No. 2, we have known about unfortunate times in our history--J. Edgar Hoover comes to mind--when this kind of information could be used. And, No. 3, I have been very concerned, given what our former colleague, Senator Udall, and I had to do with respect to bulk phone record collection of email. We battled to end this. Of course, this was email that could be read by government agencies. We battled with various intelligence leaders saying that we felt this was a violation of people's rights and it wasn't effective. They asserted for months and months that it was. Finally, one day they woke up and said the program wasn't needed any more. None of this would have even happened had not Senator Udall and I made that case repeatedly. The intelligence leadership knew that we were not going to give it up, but that is what goes on if there isn't a check on some of these kinds of procedures. Senator Paul made mention of the fact that the intelligence leadership has not exactly been straight with the American people on these issues. I emphasize that we are not talking about the thousands and thousands of law-abiding patriotic, dedicated, wonderful people who work in the intelligence field. Day in and day out they do so much for our country. We are so appreciative of all they do. They are the ones who do the hard work, for example, to capture Bin Laden and day in and day out to make us safer. But the intelligence leadership, on the other hand, as noted by our colleague from Kentucky, has not always been straight with the American people. I spent many months trying to decipher what the former NSA Director meant when he said the government doesn't collect any dossiers on millions of Americans. I pointed out I had been on the Intelligence Committee for a long time and I had never heard the term ``dossier'' used. So I tried to learn more about it, used private opportunities and public opportunities, and just couldn't get the information. So, finally, I said: I have to ask this question in public. On the Intelligence Committee you don't get but perhaps 20 or 25 minutes a year to ask questions in public, to hold intelligence leaders accountable [[Page S3337]] on policy matters--not secret operations, because secret operations have to stay secret, but policy matters. So, after being stonewalled for many months--many months--I finally said I have to ask this question in public. So to make sure no one would feel ambushed, I sent the question to the Director of National Intelligence, Mr. Clapper. I sent it a day ahead of time. Then I didn't hear anything about its being inappropriate or in violation of classification rules. So I asked in public: Does the government collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans? I was told no, and that answer was obviously false. I tried to get it corrected, and we still couldn't get it corrected. Of course, then Mr. Snowden spoke out publicly and pointed that out. Since that time, the Director of National Intelligence and his representatives have given these five different explanations for why that answer was given. So that is why you have to ask the hard questions. You have to ask the hard questions about these issues. I see my friend and colleague Senator Heinrich has joined us tonight. I am so pleased that he has joined the Intelligence Committee. Senator Heinrich is one of those Senators who subscribes to that view that I just mentioned--that it is our job to ask the hard questions. It may be uncomfortable. It is not designed in any way to convey disrespect. We see it as our job to ask the hard questions. I would be interested in my colleague's thoughts with respect to this issue and to have him be given a chance to participate in this colloquy. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HEINRICH. First, I thank my friend from Oregon and I recognize the substantial leadership he has shown on this issue over the years. Long before I came to the Intelligence Committee and long before Edward Snowden began to steal documents, Senator Wyden, along with Senator Mark Udall and others, were doing everything they could--without disclosing classified information--to shine a light on the fact that the U.S. Government was collecting massive volumes of data on millions of law-abiding American citizens. My friend from Oregon deserves our thanks for that leadership. Now, after the bulk call data collection program was revealed to the public, the government, frankly, defended it and defended it vigorously. It took a number of months for the intelligence community and the rest of the administration to take a deep breath and really assess whether bulk metadata collection was necessary, whether it was effective, and to consider whether there were other less intrusive, more constitutionally grounded ways to accomplish these same goals. Starting with the President's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies, the administration began to agree that ``some of the authorities that were expanded or created in the aftermath of September 11 unduly sacrifice fundamental interests in individual liberty, personal privacy, and democratic governance.'' And they recommended changing those authorities in order to ``strike a better balance between the competing interests and providing for the common defense and securing `the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.' '' Following that, multiple efforts have been made to update and reform FISA and to update and reform the USA PATRIOT Act. None of those have been successful. But now we are forced to come to a resolution through a combination of, frankly, procrastination, and, I think, misguided hope that the American people would look the other way while the government continued to vacuum up and store their personal information and data as part of a program that even the intelligence community acknowledges can be accomplished through less intrusive means. I will be honest. The current USA FREEDOM Act isn't what I consider perfect. For example, I prefer that it include strong reform of section 702 collection, but I accept that circumstances require us to be pragmatic, require us to govern and move forward and to work with one another in both parties to find compromise. That is what the USA FREEDOM Act is. It is a product of bipartisan compromise. That is why it passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 338 to 88. And let's be blunt, many of those who voted against it didn't do so because they support bulk collection. They did so because they want to see section 215 wither and die in its entirety. That is the political reality we face today, and we need to accept it rather than demanding a continuation of a program that the appeals court has determined is illegal. Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague for his statements and would just want to explore this a little bit further. I hope that those who are following this debate understand that my colleague from New Mexico is a real rising star in the Senate. He and I would like the USA FREEDOM Act to go further, and we both worked together on legislation that would make additional reforms. Certainly, our colleagues on the Intelligence Committee and here in the Senate can expect to see us continuing to work together to advance these additional reforms over the coming months and years. For now, the two of us are saying we ought to support the USA FREEDOM Act and then move on--move on to other critical areas. I particularly want to see closed what is called the backdoor search loophole, which my colleague from New Mexico talked about. What this means, colleagues, is that when you are engaged in a lawful search of someone who is a threat overseas, pursuant to section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, very often law-abiding Americans can get swept up in this search and have their emails looked at. This is a problem today, and my view is it is likely to be a growing concern in the future because, increasingly, communications systems around the world are becoming globally integrated, so the amount of emails that are reviewed of Americans is likely to grow. But we can't get that change here tonight. So, as my colleague from New Mexico has mentioned, the USA FREEDOM Act would make several worthwhile reforms, such as increasing transparency, reducing the government's reliance on secret laws. But from my perspective, the centerpiece of it is ending the bulk collection of Americans' information under the PATRIOT Act. I have been trying to close this particular loophole for close to a decade now. Some of our colleagues have said the bulk collection has never been abused; that no one's rights have been violated. My own view is--and I will ask what my colleague thinks--that vacuuming up all this information, particularly when databases get violated all the time--we have seen historically instances where there has been improper conduct by the government. I believe dragnet surveillance violates the rights of millions of our people every day. Vacuuming up the private phone records of millions of Americans with no connection to wrongdoing is simply a violation of their rights. And vacuuming up Americans' email records, which I pointed out before my colleague came to the floor--which he and our former colleague Senator Udall and I battled--is surely a violation of the rights of Americans as well. Colleagues, that wouldn't have been pointed out at all--it wouldn't have been pointed out at all--unless Senator Udall and I, with the help of our friend from New Mexico, hadn't been pushing back on it. Finally, one day the government said: Well, we will get rid of it because it wasn't effective. They got rid of it because they saw they were going to get hard questions, the kinds of questions my friend from New Mexico has been asking. Now, with respect to the legality of this program, I know my colleague and I actually filed a legal brief, along with our former colleague Mark Udall, when the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was examining that program. In our brief, it was argued that we were able to debunk many of the claims that had been made about the effectiveness of the program. I think it would be helpful if my colleague from New Mexico laid out some of that analysis here tonight. I would ask the Senator from New Mexico to begin, and I would encourage him to start by addressing the claim that the bulk collection of Americans' phone records is essential for stopping terrorist attacks. My question to my colleague is, Is there any evidence, any [[Page S3338]] real concrete evidence, to support that claim? Mr. HEINRICH. I thank my friend from Oregon and begin by saying that despite what we may have heard from talking heads on the Sunday shows and on the cable news networks, the answer is no. There is simply no evidence to support those claims. When this mass surveillance was first revealed to the public 2 years ago, the executive branch initially responded to questions like this by claiming that various post-9/11 authorities had resulted in the thwarting of approximately ``54 terrorist events in the U.S. homeland and abroad.'' Now, a number of us, including my friend from Oregon and my former colleague from Colorado, Senator Udall, began to pull on that thread to really parse down and see just what the executive branch was talking about. First, of those 54 terrorist events, it turned out that only 13 were actually focused in the United States. But more importantly, those numbers conflated multiple different programs, including authorities under section 215 and different authorities under section 702. On June 19, 2013, my colleague from Oregon and Senator Udall pointed out that ``it appears that the bulk phone records collection program under section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act played little or no role in most of these disruptions. Saying that `these programs' have disrupted `dozens of potential terrorist plots' is misleading if the bulk phone records collection program is actually providing little or no unique value.'' Of the original 54 instances the executive branch pointed to, every one of them crumbled under scrutiny. None of them actually justified the continued existence of the bulk collection program. Let me take a moment, with the indulgence of our colleagues, and read what was written by Judge Leon of the District Court for the District of Columbia, when he ruled in the Klayman v. Obama case. This is a little long, but I think it is important this be part of the official record of this debate. Judge Leon writes: [T]he Government does not cite a single instance in which analysis of the NSA's bulk metadata collection actually stopped an imminent attack, or otherwise aided the Government in achieving any objective that was time-sensitive in nature. In fact, none of the three ``recent episodes'' cited by the Government that supposedly ``illustrate the role that telephony metadata analysis can play in preventing and protecting against terrorist attack'' involved any apparent urgency. He continues to write that: []In the first example, the FBI learned of a terrorist plot still ``in its early stages'' and investigated that plot before turning to the metadata ``to ensure that all potential connections were identified.'' []Assistant Director Holley does not say that the metadata revealed any new information-- much less time-sensitive information--that had not already come to light in the investigation up to that point. The judge continues: []In the second example, it appears that the metadata analysis was used only after the terrorist was arrested ``to establish [his] foreign ties and put them in context with his U.S. based planning efforts.'' []And in the third, the metadata analysis ``revealed a previously unknown number for [a] co-conspirator . . . and corroborated his connection to [the target of the investigation] as well as to other U.S.- based extremists.'' Continuing to quote Judge Leon: []Again, there is no indication that these revelations were immediately useful or that they prevented an impending attack. Assistant Director Holley even concedes that bulk metadata analysis only ``sometimes provides information earlier than the FBI's other investigative methods and techniques.'' Finally, Judge Leon writes: []Given the limited record before me at this point in the litigation--most notably, the utter lack of evidence that a terrorist attack has ever been prevented because of searching the NSA database was faster than other investigative tactics--I have serious doubts about the efficacy of the metadata collection program as a means of conducting time- sensitive investigations in cases involving imminent threats of terrorism. That is where the judge leaves off. And I will turn back to the Senator from Oregon to address the three cases we discussed in more detail in our amicus brief to the Second Circuit. Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague. The first of these examples--and they really are kind of overblown examples about the effectiveness of bulk collection--is the case of an individual named Najibullah Zazi. Mr. Zazi was a known terrorism suspect, and a number of people have suggested that bulk phone records collection was somehow essential to stopping him because a query of the bulk phone records database for numbers linked to Mr. Zazi returned a previously unknown number belonging to another terrorism suspect. However, since the government had already identified Zazi as a terrorism suspect prior to querying the bulk phone records database, it had all the evidence it needed to obtain the phone records of Zazi and his associates using an individualized section 215 order or other legal authorities. In the second case, some have pointed to Mr. Moalin, the San Diego man convicted of sending $8,500 to support al-Shabaab in Somalia. The intelligence community has indicated that information from the bulk phone records database ``established a connection between a phone number known to be used by an extremist overseas . . . and an unknown San Diego-based number'' that belonged to Mr. Moalin. Yet there are ample existing authorities under which the United States can conduct surveillance on a phone number known to be used by extremists overseas and other phone numbers in contact with that phone number. The argument that Mr. Moalin's case is an example of a unique value of bulk phone records collection is just not accurate. My view is this is yet another case that offers a misleading exaggeration with respect to the effectiveness of bulk phone records collection. Finally, several supporters of the bulk metadata program have claimed that ``[i]f we had had [the bulk phone-records] program in place at the time [of the September 11, 2001 attacks,] we would have been able to identify'' the phone number of one of the hijackers, Khalid al-Mihdhar. Just as in these other cases, however, the record indicates that Mr. Mihdhar's phone number could also have been obtained by the government using a variety of alternate means. Before September 11, the government was surveilling a safe house in Yemen but failed to realize that Mr. Mihdhar, who was in contact with the safe house, was actually inside the United States. The government could have used any number of authorities to determine whether anyone in our country was in contact with the safe house it was already targeting. It didn't need a record of every Americans' phone calls to establish that simple connection. Mr. HEINRICH. I wish to expound on that point a bit, about the many other ways the government can legitimately acquire phone records of terrorism suspects, because I think this is a very important point to understand the tools that already exist that have been very effective and have proven themselves over time. There are actually a number of legal authorities that can get the same information without the government collecting billions of call records--billions of call records that, in large part, belong to innocent Americans. For example, the Stored Communications Act permits the government to obtain precisely the same call records that are now acquired through bulk collection under section 215 when they are ``relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.'' Additionally, national security letters, which I point out do not require a court order, can also be used by the government to obtain call records for intelligence purposes. Further, the government can also acquire telephony metadata on a real-time basis by obtaining orders from either regular Federal courts or the FISC for the installation of pen registers or trap-and-trace devices. Finally, individualized orders for phone records, as opposed to orders authorizing broad bulk collection, can also be obtained under section 215. I think those of us early in this debate thought that was what was going to occur under the PATRIOT Act in the first place. But that is what the USA FREEDOM Act seeks to require while prohibiting the bulk collection of millions of personal records. It even includes emergency authorization authority for the government to get records prior to getting court approval, subject to later court approval, in an emergency. The government can use any of these authorities without any more evidence [[Page S3339]] than what is currently required to use the bulk phone records database, with less impact, I would point out, on the privacy interests of millions of innocent Americans. I think at this point the Senator from Oregon and I have laid out our case as to why this dragnet bulk surveillance program fails to make our country measurably safer and why it should end. I am pleased to say that a number of people have finally come around to our way of thinking on this. Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague. I will wrap up and then give the last word to my friend from New Mexico on the subject. He is absolutely right that some of the most authoritative leaders in our country-- experts on terror--have reached the same judgment we have. I made mention of the President's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies, and I really would encourage colleagues who are following this debate and citizens across the country--that report is available online, and it is available in our office. Page 104 of that report is very explicit. It says that the information that would otherwise be obtained in collecting all of these phone records-- millions of phone records of law-abiding Americans, people such as Mike Morell, former Acting Director of the CIA, and Richard Clark, who served in two administrations--they said it could have been obtained through conventional processes. This is a program that is not making us safer. And it is not my judgment that ought to be the last word; it should be that of people like those I just quoted. The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board's report on the telephone records program said pretty much the same thing: [T]he Section 215 program has shown minimal value in safeguarding the nation from terrorism. Based on the information provided to the Board, including classified briefings and documentation, we have not identified a single instance involving a threat to the United States in which the program made a concrete difference in the outcome of a counterterrorism investigation. I will close by way of saying--and I touched on this before my friend from New Mexico arrived--I would like to do a lot more than I believe is likely to happen here quickly in the Senate. I do want to see us finally throw in the dustbin of history this bulk phone records collection program because it doesn't make us safer and it compromises our liberty. But, as I indicated to my friend from New Mexico, I would also like to close this backdoor search loophole in the FISA Act, which is going to be a bigger problem in the days ahead given the evolution of communications systems and how they have become globally integrated. I will close by saying that one of the most important issues we are going to have to tackle in the days ahead is going to deal with encryption. Encryption, of course, is the encoding of data and messages so that they cannot be easily read. The reason this will be an enormously important issue--and my colleague and I have talked about this--is because of the NSA overreach, the collection of all these phone records of law-abiding people. A lot of our most innovative, cutting-edge companies have found their customers raising real questions about whether their products can be used safely, and a lot of the purchasers who buy their products around the world are saying: Maybe we shouldn't trust them. Maybe we should try to start taking control over their servers and have local storage requirements and that sort of thing. So what our companies did, because they saw the effect of the overreach by the NSA, was they started to use encryption to protect the data and messages of the consumers who buy their products. Most recently, the head of the FBI, Mr. Comey, rather than try to come back with a solution that protected both our privacy and our security, he said he was interested in requiring companies to build weaknesses into their products. Just think about that--requiring companies to build weaknesses into their products. So the government-- which, in effect, caused this problem with the overreach--in effect, rather than trying to find a solution that worked for both security and liberty, said: We will start talking about requiring companies to actually build weaknesses into their products. I and others have pointed out that once you do that, hang on to your hat. When the good guys have the keys, that is one thing, but when companies are required to build weaknesses into their products, the bad guys are going to get the keys in a hurry, too. And with all the cyber hacking and the risks we already have, we ought to be really careful about going where Mr. Comey, our FBI Director, has proposed to go. But that is not for tonight. Tonight is not an occasion where we will be able to, on a bipartisan basis, close the backdoor-search loophole or where we will be able to come up with a sensible policy with respect to encryption rather than requiring companies to actually build weaknesses in their products. We will not be able to do that tonight. But we will now have a chance here in the Senate to take steps that have been bipartisan both here in the Senate and in the other body, in the House of Representatives, to end the bulk phone records collection program because it doesn't make us safer and it threatens our liberties. I always like to close by thinking about Ben Franklin, who said that anybody who gives up their liberty to have security really doesn't deserve either. I am so pleased to have a chance to serve with my colleague from New Mexico on the Intelligence Committee, who is going to be a thoughtful advocate for these kinds of policies, in my view, for many years to come. I thank him for his involvement tonight and would be happy to give him the last word of our colloquy at this time. I yield to my colleague. Mr. HEINRICH. I thank my friend from Oregon. I think he could not have chosen a more appropriate way to end than to reference what Ben Franklin said so many years ago, that great quote that ``those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.'' While many reforms still lie in front of us, I think, as we move forward to approving the USA FREEDOM Act, we move a lot closer to the balance that Ben Franklin articulated so well over 200 years ago. I look forward to working with my colleague from Oregon and all of our colleagues in achieving that balance and standing up for our constituents. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we did not have to end up here, just hours away from the midnight expiration of three surveillance authorities, and having just moved to proceed to the USA FREEDOM Act. I have tried since last year to move legislation through the Senate to address these sunsets. In November, Senator Reid brought the USA FREEDOM Act to the floor but the Republican leadership of the Senate blocked debate on it. When they took over the Senate, they assured us that they would send bills--including this one--through appropriate committee process. There were promises that the new leadership would not fill the amendment tree, and would use a transparent legislative process. But not one of those promises has been fulfilled with respect to any legislation dealing with the upcoming sunsets. Once again this year, I proposed with Senator Lee a new version of the USA FREEDOM Act. That bill had significant process in the House, where it passed by an overwhelming margin earlier this month. And once again, the bipartisan coalition here in the Senate tried to get the bill passed. Two Fridays ago, the Senate Republican leadership did not allow us to debate the bill. Tonight, the Senate did the right thing by invoking cloture on the motion to proceed to the USA FREEDOM Act. I am glad to see several Republicans switched their votes. This is significant progress, but it is late in coming. We should have proceeded to this bill two Fridays ago. Had we done so, we could have stayed here to do our work, considered amendments, and passed the bill well in advance of tonight's sunset. Instead, we are hours away from expiration and just now considering legislation that many of us have been working on for years. Our intelligence community needs predictability and certainty, not a manufactured crisis. If all Senators cooperate, we can finish this bill tonight. We can consider a [[Page S3340]] handful of amendments under a time agreement, and pass this bill before midnight. That would be the responsible thing to do. Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Capito). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I know of no further debate on the motion. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to proceed. The motion was agreed to. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 85 (Sunday, May 31, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 85 (Sunday, May 31, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S3331-S3340] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] USA FREEDOM ACT OF 2015--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, before the recess, I tried to get a short-term extension of three provisions that will expire at midnight tonight: section 215, business records; section 206, roving wiretap authority; and the ``lone wolf'' provision. Unfortunately, those efforts were unsuccessful. ``Lone wolf'' and roving wiretap are not--I repeat, not--the subject of controversy with the House bill. So I would propose that we extend at least the ``lone wolf'' and the roving wiretap authorities while we continue to litigate the differing views on section 215. More specifically, I would propose that we extend those two provisions-- ``lone wolf'' and roving wiretaps--for up to 2 weeks. Unanimous Consent Request Mr. President, having said that, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of a bill, which is at the desk, to extend the expiring provisions relating to ``lone wolf'' and roving wiretaps for 2 weeks, and that the bill be read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Kentucky. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, one of the promises that was given when the PATRIOT Act was originally passed was that, in exchange for allowing a less than constitutional standard, we would only use the actions against---- The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. PAUL. Terrorists and against foreigners. We found that 99 percent of the time, section 213 is used for domestic crime. I believe that no section of the PATRIOT Act should be passed unless our targets are terrorists--not Americans. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, regular order. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky---- Mr. COTTON. Regular order. Mr. PAUL. I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last week, I proposed giving the Intelligence Committee the time it would need to work toward the kind of bipartisan legislative compromise Americans deserve--a compromise that would preserve important counterterrorism tools necessary to protect American lives. That effort was blocked. Just now, I proposed an even narrower extension that would have only extended some of the least controversial--least controversial--but still critical tools to ensure they do not lapse as Senators work toward a more comprehensive legislative outcome. But even that very narrow offer was blocked. I think it should be worrying for our country because the nature of the threat we face is very serious. It is aggressive, it is sophisticated, it is geographically dispersed, and it is not--not--going away. As the LA Times reported, ``the Obama administration has dramatically stepped up warnings of potential terrorist attacks on American soil after several years of relative calm.'' The paper reported that this is occurring in the wake of ``FBI arrests of at least 30 Americans on terrorism-related charges this year in an array of `lone wolf' plots.'' So these aren't theoretical threats. They are not theoretical threats. They are with us every day. We have to face up to them. We shouldn't be disarming unilaterally as our enemies grow more sophisticated and aggressive, and we certainly should not be doing so based on a campaign of demagoguery and disinformation launched in the wake of the unlawful actions of Edward Snowden, who was last seen in Russia. The opponents of this program have not been able to provide any-- any--examples of the NSA abusing the authorities provided under section 215. And the record will show that, in fact, there has not been one documented instance of abuse of it. I think it is also important to remember that the contents of calls are not captured. That is the general view, but it is an incorrect one. I will say it again: The contents of calls are not captured. I say this to the American people: If you have been told that, that is not correct. That is what I mean about a campaign of disinformation. The only things in question are the number dialed, the number from which the call was made, the length of the call, and the date. That is it. That is it. Detailed oversight procedures have been put in place, too, in order to protect the privacy of Americans. Now, I believe this is a program that strikes a critical balance between privacy on the one hand and national security on the other. That doesn't mean the Senate still shouldn't have the opportunity to make some changes to it. That is precisely the outcome I had been hoping to facilitate by seeking several short-term extensions. And considering all that has come to light about the House-passed bill in recent weeks, I believe this was more than reasonable. The administration's inability to answer even the most basic questions about the alternate bulk data system it would have to build under that legislation is, to say the least, pretty troubling--pretty troubling. And that is not just my view. That is the view of many in this body, including colleagues who have been favorably predisposed to the House bill. In particular, I know Senators from both parties have been disturbed by the administration's continuing inability to guarantee whether the new system would work as well as the current one or whether there would even be any data available to analyze. While the administration has let it be known that this nonexistent system could only be built in time if telephone providers cooperated in building it, providers have made it abundantly clear that they are not going to commit to retaining the data. They are not going to commit to retaining the data for any period of time unless legally required to do so, and there is no such requirement in the House-passed bill--none at all. Here is how one provider put it: ``[We are] not prepared to commit to voluntarily retain documents for any particular period of time pursuant to the proposed USA Freedom Act if not required by law''--if not required by law. Now, these are just a few of the reasons I thought it prudent to try to give the Senate more space to advance better legislation through committee consideration and regular order, with input from both sides. But, my colleagues, it is now clear that will not be possible in the face of a determined opposition from those who simply wish to end the counterterrorism program altogether. No time to try to improve the House-passed bill will be allowed because some would like to end the program altogether. So this is where we find ourselves. This is the reality. So it essentially leaves us with two options. Option one is to allow the program to expire altogether without attempting to replace it. That would mean disarming completely and arbitrarily, based on a campaign of disinformation, in the face of growing, aggressive, and sophisticated threats--growing, aggressive, and sophisticated threats. That is a totally unacceptable outcome--a completely and totally unacceptable outcome. So we won't be doing that. [[Page S3332]] So we are left with option two, the House-passed bill. It is certainly not ideal. But along with votes on some modest amendments that attempt to ensure the program can actually work as promised, it is now the only realistic way forward. So I remain determined to continue working toward the best outcome for the American people possible under the circumstances. This is where we are, colleagues. We have the House-passed bill with some serious flaws and an inability to get a short-term extension to try to improve the House-passed bill in the way we normally do this-- through some kind of consultative process. So bearing that in mind, I move to proceed to the motion to reconsider vote No. 194, the vote by which cloture was not invoked on the motion to proceed to H.R. 2048. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The motion was agreed to. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 2048. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The motion was agreed to. Cloture Motion The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: Cloture Motion We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to proceed to H.R. 2048, an act to reform the authorities of the Federal Government to require the production of certain business records, conduct electronic surveillance, use pen registers and trap and trace devices, and use other forms of information gathering for foreign intelligence, counterterrorism, and criminal purposes, and for other purposes. Mitch McConnell, Lamar Alexander, Michael B. Enzi, David Vitter, John Cornyn, Johnny Isakson, Lisa Murkowski, John Barrasso, Richard Burr, Pat Roberts, Roy Blunt, Bob Corker, Orrin G. Hatch, Jerry Moran, Patrick J. Toomey, Mike Lee, Ted Cruz. The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the motion to proceed to H.R. 2048, an act to reform the authorities of the Federal Government to require the production of certain business records, conduct electronic surveillance, use pen registers and trap and trace devices, and use other forms of information gathering for foreign intelligence, counterterrorism, and criminal purposes, and for other purposes, shall be brought to a close, upon reconsideration? The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Enzi), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Graham), and the Senator from Nebraska (Mr. Sasse). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Menendez), the Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray), and the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Barrasso). Are there any Senators in the Chamber wishing to vote or to change their vote? The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 77, nays 17, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 196 Leg.] YEAS--77 Alexander Ayotte Baldwin Bennet Blumenthal Booker Boozman Boxer Brown Burr Cantwell Capito Cardin Carper Casey Cassidy Cochran Coons Corker Cornyn Cruz Daines Donnelly Durbin Feinstein Flake Franken Gardner Gillibrand Hatch Heinrich Heitkamp Heller Hirono Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kaine King Kirk Klobuchar Lankford Leahy Lee Manchin Markey McCain McCaskill McConnell Merkley Mikulski Murkowski Murphy Nelson Perdue Peters Portman Reed Reid Rounds Sanders Schumer Scott Shaheen Stabenow Sullivan Tester Tillis Toomey Udall Vitter Warner Warren Whitehouse Wicker Wyden NAYS--17 Barrasso Blunt Coats Collins Cotton Crapo Ernst Fischer Grassley Moran Paul Risch Roberts Rubio Sessions Shelby Thune NOT VOTING--6 Enzi Graham Menendez Murray Sasse Schatz The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 77, the nays are 17. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the affirmative, upon reconsideration, the motion is agreed to. The Senator from Kentucky. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, could we have order? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Mr. PAUL. Will the Chair inform me when I have 5 minutes remaining? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified. Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, tonight begins the process of ending bulk collection. The bill will ultimately pass. We always look for silver linings. I think the bill may be replacing one form of bulk collection with another, but the government, after this bill passes, will no longer collect our phone records. My concern is that the phone companies still may do the same thing. Currently, my understanding is the NSA is at the phone company sucking up the phone records and sending them to Utah. My concern is---- The PRESIDING OFFICER. Order in the Senate, please. The Senator deserves to be heard. Mr. PAUL. My concern is that under the new program, the records will still be sucked up into NSA computers, but the computers will be at the phone company, not in Utah. So the question is, Will it be a distinction without a difference? The question also will be, Will this be individualized? One of the issues about the Fourth Amendment that was the biggest part of the Fourth Amendment for our Founding Fathers was that a warrant should be individualized. General warrants were what we fought the Revolution over. James Otis fought a famous case in the 1760s, and he fought against the British soldiers writing their own warrants. What is interesting is that part of the PATRIOT Act allows our police to write their own warrants. We have something called national security letters. These have been done by the hundreds of thousands. Interestingly, when the President was in the Senate, he was opposed to national security letters and said that they should have judicial warrants. Now, it is interesting that in this bill that will pass, it is supported by the President, supported by the Director of National Intelligence, and now supported in a wide bipartisan fashion. It concerns me whether or not---- The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Will the Senator please suspend. The Senate will be in order. Please take your conversations out of the well, out of the Chamber. The Senator deserves to be heard. Mr. PAUL. It concerns me that the President, who supports the bulk data collection and has been performing it illegally for 6 years, now supports this bill. The devil is in the details. The question is, Will the new bill still allow bulk collection by the phone companies? Will they be able to put into the search engine not an individual about whom we have suspicion but an entire corporation? This is what was revealed when we saw the warrant that had Tsarnaev's name on it. The Director of National Intelligence came before the American people, came before Congress and swore under oath that they weren't doing this. Part of my problem with the intelligence-gathering in our country is it is hard for me to have trust. It is hard for me to have trust in the people to whom we are giving great power. They also insist we won't be able to catch terrorists. They insist the bulk collection allowed them to catch terrorists. But then it turned out, when it was investigated, when we looked at the classified documents, when the President's bipartisan privacy and civil liberties commission looked at this, when his review board looked at this, and then when the Department of Justice inspector general looked at this, [[Page S3333]] they all found that there was no unique data, there was no great discovery, there was no great breaking up of a terrorist ring. People have brought up the Boston Bomber, the Tsarnaev boy. They say: Well, we need this. We need the PATRIOT Act after the bombing to get his phone records. That is the most absurd thing I have ever heard. He has already committed a bombing. In fact, I think he was dead at that point, and they are saying we couldn't get a warrant to look at his phone records? It is absolutely absurd. I had a meeting with somebody from the intelligence community about 6 months ago, and I asked them this question: How do we get more information about terrorists--with a warrant with their name on it, where we can go as deep into the details as we want, or this metadata collection that uses a less-than-constitutional standard? And he said: Without question, we get more information with a warrant than we do through the metadata. When someone commits an act of atrocity, there is no question we would get a warrant, but I would go even further. I would say that I want to get more warrants on people before they blow up things. I would say that we need more money spent on FBI agents analyzing data and trying to find out whom we have suspicion about so we can investigate their records. I think we spend so much money on people about whom there is no suspicion that we don't have enough time and money left to go after the people who would actually harm us. The people who argue that the world will end at midnight tonight---- The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will please suspend. Order in the Chamber. Please take your conversations off the floor. Mr. PAUL. The people who argue that the world will end and that we will be overrun by jihadists tonight are trying to use fear. They want to take just a little bit of our liberty, but they get it by making us afraid. They want us to fear and give up our liberty. They tell us that if we have nothing to hide, we have nothing to fear. That is a far cry from the standard we were founded upon--innocent until proven guilty. One of the objections I tried to bring forward earlier but was interrupted repeatedly was that the PATRIOT Act was originally intended to go after foreigners and terrorists. We allowed a less-than- constitutional standard. We didn't ask for probable cause; we just said it had to be relevant, the information had to be relevant to an investigation about terrorists. But here is the problem, and this is one of the big problems I have with the PATRIOT Act. We now use parts of the PATRIOT Act to arrest people for domestic crime. Section 213, sneak-and-peek, where the government can come into your house, place listening devices, never announce they were ever in your house, and then leave and monitor your behavior and never let you know they were there, is being used 99.5 percent of the time for domestic crime. So, little by little, we have allowed our freedom to slip away. We allowed the Fourth Amendment to be diminished. We allowed the narrowing loss of something called probable cause. People say: Well, how would we get terrorists with that? The vast majority of warrants are approved in our country--the vast majority of warrants that are Fourth Amendment warrants where we individualized and put a name on it and asked probable cause. If tonight the police are looking for a rapist or a murderer, they will go to the house, and if they suspect the person is inside but nothing is imminently happening, they will stand on the curb and they almost always get a warrant. Do you think there is a judge in this land who would not grant a warrant--particularly after the Boston bombing--to look at the Tsarnaev brothers' records? There is not a judge in the land who would say no. I would venture to say that in advance there is not much chance that a judge would say no if you went to them and said: The Russians have given us indication and evidence that he has been radicalized and has associated overseas with people who are training to attack us. There is no reason why the Constitution can't be used. But we just have to not let those who are in power make us cower in fear. They use fear to take your freedom, and we have to be very, very careful of this. Now, some are saying I am misrepresenting this, that I am saying the government is listening to your phone calls. I am saying they are collecting your phone records. There are programs, though, in which there may be looking at content--emails, for example. The current law says that after 6 months even the content of your email has no protection. We have a very good piece of legislation to try to fix that. But realize that those who are loud, those who are really wanting you to give up your freedom, don't believe the Fourth Amendment protects your records at all. And this is a big debate. We went to the court. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals--the highest court in the land just below the Supreme Court--said that what they are doing is illegal, but we don't yet have a ruling on whether it is constitutional. One of my fears about the bill we are going to pass--the sort of in- between step some think may be better--is that it could moot the case. This means the court case will never get heard by the Supreme Court. I have a court case against the NSA. There is another district court that has ruled against the NSA. We now have an appellate ruling against the NSA. The court may well look at the activity of the Senate and say: Well, you guys have fixed the problem. We don't need to look at it anymore. It is no longer relevant. My other concern about this new bill that is going to pass is that the same people will judge it who judged the previous system. These people are called the rubberstamp courtroom, also known as FISA. Realize that the FISA Court is the court that said the collection of all Americans' records is relevant. The appellate court basically laughed at this notion and said that it sort of destroys any meaning to the word ``relevant'' if you collect everybody's records. It is not even a modifier. Instead of saying ``relevant,'' they should have said ``You can have everyone's records all the time.'' One of my other concerns about the in-between solution we are going to choose is that some are conjecturing--and you have to be suspicious of a government that often lies about their purpose--some are conjecturing that they are going to collect more phone data under the new system. One of the complaints last week, as there was discussion about this--in the newspaper, it was reported that really they were only collecting about 20 to 30 percent of your cell phone data. They were trying to collect all of your land line data, but they weren't for some reason collecting all of your cell phone data. One of my concerns is that as we go to this new system, they may actually be better at collecting our phone records and they may well be able to collect all of our cell phone data. Unless we go to a system where we individualize the warrants, unless we go to a system where a person's name is on the warrant, I am going to be very, very concerned. Now, we will present amendments on this bill. We tried to negotiate to be allowed to present amendments, but there wasn't a lot of negotiating that went on in the last week--in fact, there was none. We will still try. We will put amendments forward, and we will try to get amendments to make the bulk collection less bad when it does occur. One of the things we would like to do is to say that when they search the phone records, they can't put the name of a corporation in there; they would have to put in an individual's name. It is kind of tricky, the way these things are worded. The wording of this bill will say they can only put a U.S. person into the selector term to search all phone records. The problem is that they define ``U.S. person'' as also meaning corporation or association or grouping. So there is a little bit of looseness to the language. So if we are still going to allow corporations, what is to stop them from going back and putting AT&T or Verizon in the selection? Once again they will be looking at all the phone records, and all we will have done is transferred the phone records from government control in Utah to phone company control in another location. Will we be trading bulk collection in Utah for bulk collection under the phone companies? There are good people who believe this bill will reform, and I think they [[Page S3334]] are well-intended. I think they are good people who really think that we will end bulk collection and that it won't happen. My fear, though, is of the people who interpret this work at a place known as the rubberstamp factory over at FISA. It is a secret court, and it is a court in which 99.5 percent of the time they approve warrants. Warrants are simply rubberstamped over there. In fact, they approved that ``relevant'' meant all of your records. So my question is, If they put AT&T as a selector item, will we have the same thing, just in a different location? I have several amendments I am interested in if we are able to amend the bill. One is that the search would have to be an individual. That is more consistent with the Fourth Amendment. Another one would change the standard to the constitutional standard, which would be that there would have to be probable cause, which is a higher standard than simply saying it is relevant. Then we would actually be sending a new signal to the FISA Court. Another amendment I have, which I think would go a long way toward making the PATRIOT Act less bad--I think is the best way to put it-- would be to say that any information gathered under a less-than- constitutional standard could only be used for foreigners and terrorists. See, that was the promise. At the time, there were people who opposed the PATRIOT Act--not enough, but there were a few--and when they opposed the PATRIOT Act, they said their fear was that it would be used against American citizens. They said: No, no, we are only going after terrorists. But the law allows them to do it, and we now have sections of the PATRIOT Act which 99.5 percent of the time are being used for domestic crime. We have also seen that the Drug Enforcement Agency--it is alleged--is using information gathered under the PATRIOT Act to then go back and recreate cases against people for domestic crime. The question we have to ask ourselves is, Are we so frightened that we are willing to give up our freedom? Are we really willing to trade liberty for security? I think the U.S. Court of Appeals had some great points that they made when they ruled against the government, and I think what is important to know is that the President has continued to do this illegally. You have seen him on television. The President has been saying: Well, Congress is just getting in the way. If Congress would just do their job and get rid of this, everything would be OK. But the truth is that Congress never authorized this. Even the authors of the PATRIOT Act said this was not something Congress ever even contemplated. The court is now saying that as well. This was done by the executive branch--admittedly, both a Republican executive branch and a Democratic executive branch--but this wasn't created by Congress. So when the President says ``Well, Congress should just do this,'' the question that has never been asked by anyone in the media is ``Why doesn't he stop it?'' Everybody who has given advice has said he would, and he will come out and say he believes in a balanced solution, but he really is just abdicating the solution and has never discontinued the program, even when he has been told explicitly by the court that the program is an illegal program. This is what the U.S. court of appeals said in the case ACLU v. Clapper: We agree with the appellants that such an expansive concept of ``relevance'' is unprecedented and unwarranted. . . . The records demanded are not those of suspects under investigation, or of people or businesses that have contact with such subjects, or of people or businesses that have contact with others who are in contact with the subjects. So even two steps removed, we are gathering records that are completely irrelevant to the investigation. We are gathering up the phone records of innocent Americans. The other side will say: Well, we are not looking at them. So I have been thinking about this. Our Founders objected to the British soldiers writing warrants. They objected to them coming into their house and grabbing their papers. Do you think our Framers would have been happy if the British Government said: OK, we are just breaking your door down, we are just getting your papers, but we are not going to look at them. Do you think that would have changed the mindset of the Framers? So the fact that they say they are not looking at our records--is that any comfort or should it be any comfort? The act of violation is in taking your records. The act of violation is in allowing the police or a form of the police--the FBI--to write warrants that are not signed by a judge. The court goes on to say: ``The interpretation that the government asks us to adopt defies any limiting principle.'' The idea of a limiting principle when the court looks at things is that, the way I see it, is the difference between something being arbitrary, where there is no sort of principle that confines what would happen--if you have a law that has no limiting principle, it is essentially arbitrary. This is what Hayek wrote about in ``The Road to Serfdom.'' Hayek talked about the difference between the rule of law and having an arbitrary interpretation of the law. The danger of having an arbitrary interpretation of the law and the danger of having general warrants is that they have been used in the past with bias. People have brought their own bias into this. In the sixties, the bias was against civil rights activists and against Vietnam war activists. In the forties, the bias was in incarcerating and interring Japanese Americans. But what was consistent in all of these circumstances was that there was a generalization--a generalization based on the color of your skin, whether you were Asian American or African American, and also about the shade of your ideology. There is a danger in allowing the government to generalize without suspicion and to disobey the Fourth Amendment, and the danger comes that the government could one day generalize and bias could enter into things. We have on our records right now laws that allow an American citizen to be detained. It is not specifically a part of the PATRIOT Act, but it is along the same lines as this, that you are getting rid of the due process amendments and the ability of the Bill of Rights to protect an individual. When we allow an individual to be detained without a trial, what happens is that there is the possibility that someone could decide we don't like ``those'' people. And when you say that could never happen, think about the times in our history when it has. Richard Jewell, everybody said he was the Olympic Bomber. He was convicted on TV. Within hours, people said: Richard Jewell is guilty. Think about if he had been a Black man in 1920 in the South what may have happened to him. Think about the possibility for bias entering into our government. Think about what Madison said about government is--Madison said that we restrain government because we are worried that government may not be comprised of angels. If government were comprised of angels, we would not have to worry about restraining government. Patrick Henry said that the Constitution was about restraining government, not the people. It is not enough for people to say: Oh, I am a good man or I am a good person or the NSA would never do this. The other problem that makes us doubtful is that the NSA has not been honest with us. If they want to develop trust again, the President should have immediately let the person who lied to us go, the Director of National Intelligence. The appeals court concluded by saying that the government's bulk collection of telephone metadata exceeds the scope of what Congress has authorized and therefore violates section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. Some will try to argue that this debate was not worth the time we took on it. I could not disagree more. I am like everybody else. You know, I prize my time with my family and being at home on the weekends. I wish we would have done this in a more sensitive way, where we would have had more time and had an open amendment process. But we waited until the end. We waited until the final deadline. This is a characteristic of government. It is a flaw in government, frankly. We lurch from deadline to deadline. People wonder why Congress is so unpopular. It is because we go from deadline to deadline and then it is: Hurry up. We have no time to debate. We just must pass it as is. [[Page S3335]] The biggest debate against amendments is--and it finally convinced people who did not like this. They so much dislike amendments and slowing down the process, they are just going to take it. Even though they don't like it, they are going to pass what the House passed. It is unlikely any amendments will pass. But the thing is, we need to get away from lurching from deadline to deadline. What happens, with budget or spending or any of these bills, is we are presented with thousand-page bills with only hours to go. About a year ago this came up. At that time, we were presented with a 1,000-page bill with 2 hours to go. I read the Senate rules. It said: We are supposed to be presented with the bill for 48 hours in advance. So I raised my hand and made a motion. The motion I made was: Guys, we are breaking the rules here. Men and women, we are breaking the rules here. So they just voted to amend the rules for that bill and ignore the rules. This is why the American people are so frustrated. People here in town think I am making a huge mistake. Some of them, I think, secretly want there to be an attack on the United States so they can blame it on me. One of the people in the media the other day came up to me and said: Oh, when there is a great attack, are you going to feel guilty that you caused this great attack? The people who attack us are responsible for attacks on us. Do we blame the police chief for the attack by the Boston Bombers? The thing is, is that there can be attacks even if we use the Constitution. But there have been attacks while collecting your bulk data. So the ones who say: Well, when an attack occurs, it is going to be all your fault, are any of them willing to accept the blame? We have bulk collection now. Are any of them willing to accept the blame for the Boston bombing, for the recent shooting in Garland? No, but they will be the first to point fingers and say: Oh, yes, it is all your fault. We never should have given up on this great program. I am completely convinced that we can obey the Constitution, use the Fourth Amendment as intended, spirited letter of the law, and catch terrorists. When we look objectively at this program, when they analyzed the classified information, they found that there was no unique data. We had to fight them tooth and nail because they started out saying that 52 cases were cracked by the bulk data program. But then when the President's own bipartisan commission looked at it, it turned out that none of that was true. This gets back to the trust issue. If we are going to be lied to by the Director of National Intelligence, it is hard for us to believe them when they come forward and they say: Oh, this is protecting us. We have to have it. But what we are hearing is information from someone who really did not think it was a big deal to lie to us about whether the program even existed. Mark my words, the battle is not over. There are some--and I talked with one of the, I would say, smarter people in Silicon Valley, somebody who knows this from an intimate level, how things work, and how the codes and programs work. He maintains that the bulk collection of phone data is the tip of the iceberg, that there is more information in other data pools that are classified. Some of this is done through an Executive order called 12333. I am not sure I know everything in it. I have had no briefings on it. So anything I will tell you is from the newspaper alone. But the thing is, is that I would like to know: Are we also collecting your credit card information? Are we collecting your texts? Are we collecting your emails? They have already told us the Fourth Amendment does not protect your emails, even the content, after 6 months. In fact, really they have told you, the Fourth Amendment does not apply to your records at all. So be very careful about the people who say: Trust us. We will never violate your freedom. We will never take advantage of things. The President's Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board's conclusion was that: Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act has shown minimal value in safeguarding the Nation from terrorism. We have not identified any single instance involving a threat to the United States in which the program made a concrete difference in the outcome. The President's privacy board went on to say: The government's collection of a person's entire telephone calling history has a significant and detrimental effect on individual privacy. When they talked about whether the phone records were relevant to an investigation, the President's Commission said this: First, the telephone records acquired under the program have no connection to any specific FBI investigation at the time of their collection. Second, because the records are collected in bulk, potentially encompassing all telephone calling records across the Nation, they cannot be regarded as relevant to any FBI investigation. Here is the continuing danger to us, though: It is, I think, maybe a minor success that we are going to prevent the government from collecting these records. But realize that the interpretation of this will still occur in secret in the FISA Court. This is the FISA Court that said that collecting everyone's records was relevant. It completely destroys the notion that the word ``relevant'' has any meaning at all. This will be the question: Whether we can trust the FISA Court to make an interpretation that is at a higher degree of discernment than the one in which they said ``relevant'' can mean anything. The original USA FREEDOM Act, as passed originally by the House committee, was a better bill. It was gradually watered down until even the Director of National Intelligence, the one who lied about the program, now supports it, which gives me some misgivings. But the records that will be collected--the question is, How will we have an interpretation by the FISA Court? The original bill had an advocate. I thought this was a good part of the original bill. There would be a judicial advocate who would argue on the side of those who were having their records taken. So there would be an adversarial court, lawyers on both sides. Many people who write about jurisprudence and trying to find justice say that one of the essential functions of a court system, in order to find justice, is that there has to be a lawyer on both sides. There has to be an advocate on both sides. The truth is not always easy to find. The truth is presentation of facts by one side, presentation of contrary facts by the other side, and someone has to figure out which facts are more believable or which facts trump other facts. So I think a judicial advocate would have been good. They are still going to have it. They call it by a different name now, but it will be optional at the discretion of the FISA Court. So the court that ruled that all of your records are relevant now will have a choice as to whether to give you an advocate. That does not give me a great deal of comfort. There are other ways we could do this. We occasionally do look at terrorism cases in regular Federal court. When names come up that could jeopardize someone's safety at our intelligence agency or a secret, Federal courts can go into secret session. I have heard the Senator from Oregon often mention this. I think it is a great point that no one wants to reveal the names of anyone or the code or the secrets of how we do this. But if we are talking about constitutional principles, we want to do it in the open. Laws should not be discussed in secret. As we move forward, the PATRIOT Act will expire tonight. It will only be temporary. They will ultimately get their way. But I think the majority of the American people actually do believe the government has gone too far. In Washington, it is the opposite, but I think Washington is out of touch. There will be 80 votes, you know, to say: Continue the PATRIOT Act--maybe more. But if you go into the general public, if you get outside the beltway and visit America, you find it is completely the opposite. There was a poll a couple of weeks ago that said: Over 80 percent of people under age 40--over 80 percent of them--think that the government collecting your phone records is wrong and should not occur. So I think really this will be useful. People say: You are destroying yourself. You should have never done this. The American people will not side with you. People wished me harm and wished that this would be unsuccessful. But you know what, I came here to defend the Bill of Rights and to defend the [[Page S3336]] Constitution, popular or not. But I frankly think that the Bill of Rights and the Constitution are very popular, very important, and I will continue, as long as I have breath and as long as I am here to defend them. I yield back the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I just want to make sure, having worked with Senator Paul for many, many months now, that I especially appreciate his efforts in the last few days in this week to try to accommodate this body with respect to amendments. My colleague has said repeatedly that he was very interested in a short list of amendments, that he hoped to have some modest time that would be available for these amendments. He and I have worked together on a number of them. I think it is a reflection, as people think about this debate and on a topic that is of such enormous importance, that my colleague from Kentucky, especially with respect to this amendment issue, has tried continually to be reasonable and to be accommodating to this body. Until just a few hours ago, I was at home in Oregon having townhall meetings, flew all night to be here for this extremely important session. Of course, the topic we discussed this evening was front and center in terms of my constituents. The message from Oregonians at these townhall meetings was very clear. The people whom I have the honor to represent in the Senate want policies that advance their security and protect their liberties. The program we have been talking about tonight in the Senate really does not deliver either. It does not make us safer. It chips away at our liberties. I am going to spend a little bit of time this evening making the case for those kinds of arguments and laying out the challenge for the days ahead. Now, with respect to this safety issue, all of us understand-- particularly the Presiding Officer, who has been on the Intelligence Committee, as I have, for over 14 years--that it is a dangerous world. Anyone who serves on the Intelligence Committee knows that beyond any kind of debate. So we want policies that really deliver both security and liberty. This is what the President's own experts had to say with respect to this program that involves collecting millions and millions of phone records on law-abiding Americans. This was a group that was appointed and spent a considerable amount of time looking at the bulk phone records collection program. They issued a report, and will I just paraphrase what is the central finding, on page 104 of their report: As to information contributed to terrorist investigations by the use of section 215 telephony metadata--that is the collecting all of these millions and millions of phone records--these experts say that ``could readily have been obtained in a timely manner using conventional Section 215 orders.'' Now, the reason that is important is it spells out and recognizes that those who signed this report are individuals with some of the most pristine antiterror credentials in this country--Mike Morell, for example, the former Acting Director of the CIA; Richard Clarke, who held an extremely important position in two administrations and served with both Republicans and Democrats. Both of them are signatories to this important report. Beyond that--and it has not received much attention--the reality is that our government, on top of everything else, has emergency authorities so that when those who are charged with protecting our country believe there is a threat to the Nation, they are allowed to issue an emergency authorization to get the information they need right away, and then they can go back and get the warrant approved after the fact. Nobody is talking about eliminating that emergency authority. So what we have is a program that the most authoritative antiterror experts in the country believe does not make our Nation any safer. I read the most significant finding in their report. On top of that, as I just indicated, emergency authorities are still preserved. In fact, I have indicated to our President and to those who work in the intelligence agencies that if at any point the executive branch and, particularly, the intelligence agencies feel that their emergency authorities are inadequate to protect the country, I personally would be willing to support efforts to ensure that those emergency capabilities are reformed and our country can take the steps it needs when it is necessary. On top of this question, with respect to the issue of our safety, I want to talk about what I heard at some length earlier today with respect to how the program worked. I heard a number of Senators say that nobody in government is listening to these calls. That was repeated a number of times on the floor of this body. When the government, under this program, knows whom you called, when you called, and where you called from, in many instances the government doesn't need to be listening. If the government knows, under this program, that a person called a psychiatrist 3 times in 36 hours--twice after midnight--that is a lot of private and personal information. The government doesn't need to be listening to that call. So as to this notion that some who have wanted to make sure that our country would have both security and liberty are saying that it is a fantasy that the government is listening to calls, I could tell you that those who have been trying to reform the program have said, in effect, that the government doesn't need to listen to those calls. If the government has that amount of private and personal information, the government knows a lot about you, and it really doesn't need to listen. Certainly, if you are talking about a land line, then the government knows where you are calling from if they have a phone book. So with respect to this question of the government listening, I want it particularly understood that a program such as this, when the government has this kind of information, I believe, represents a threat to our liberty. The reason why I think so is that hardly a week goes by when databases aren't violated. No. 1, we see that reported regularly in the press. No. 2, we have known about unfortunate times in our history--J. Edgar Hoover comes to mind--when this kind of information could be used. And, No. 3, I have been very concerned, given what our former colleague, Senator Udall, and I had to do with respect to bulk phone record collection of email. We battled to end this. Of course, this was email that could be read by government agencies. We battled with various intelligence leaders saying that we felt this was a violation of people's rights and it wasn't effective. They asserted for months and months that it was. Finally, one day they woke up and said the program wasn't needed any more. None of this would have even happened had not Senator Udall and I made that case repeatedly. The intelligence leadership knew that we were not going to give it up, but that is what goes on if there isn't a check on some of these kinds of procedures. Senator Paul made mention of the fact that the intelligence leadership has not exactly been straight with the American people on these issues. I emphasize that we are not talking about the thousands and thousands of law-abiding patriotic, dedicated, wonderful people who work in the intelligence field. Day in and day out they do so much for our country. We are so appreciative of all they do. They are the ones who do the hard work, for example, to capture Bin Laden and day in and day out to make us safer. But the intelligence leadership, on the other hand, as noted by our colleague from Kentucky, has not always been straight with the American people. I spent many months trying to decipher what the former NSA Director meant when he said the government doesn't collect any dossiers on millions of Americans. I pointed out I had been on the Intelligence Committee for a long time and I had never heard the term ``dossier'' used. So I tried to learn more about it, used private opportunities and public opportunities, and just couldn't get the information. So, finally, I said: I have to ask this question in public. On the Intelligence Committee you don't get but perhaps 20 or 25 minutes a year to ask questions in public, to hold intelligence leaders accountable [[Page S3337]] on policy matters--not secret operations, because secret operations have to stay secret, but policy matters. So, after being stonewalled for many months--many months--I finally said I have to ask this question in public. So to make sure no one would feel ambushed, I sent the question to the Director of National Intelligence, Mr. Clapper. I sent it a day ahead of time. Then I didn't hear anything about its being inappropriate or in violation of classification rules. So I asked in public: Does the government collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans? I was told no, and that answer was obviously false. I tried to get it corrected, and we still couldn't get it corrected. Of course, then Mr. Snowden spoke out publicly and pointed that out. Since that time, the Director of National Intelligence and his representatives have given these five different explanations for why that answer was given. So that is why you have to ask the hard questions. You have to ask the hard questions about these issues. I see my friend and colleague Senator Heinrich has joined us tonight. I am so pleased that he has joined the Intelligence Committee. Senator Heinrich is one of those Senators who subscribes to that view that I just mentioned--that it is our job to ask the hard questions. It may be uncomfortable. It is not designed in any way to convey disrespect. We see it as our job to ask the hard questions. I would be interested in my colleague's thoughts with respect to this issue and to have him be given a chance to participate in this colloquy. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HEINRICH. First, I thank my friend from Oregon and I recognize the substantial leadership he has shown on this issue over the years. Long before I came to the Intelligence Committee and long before Edward Snowden began to steal documents, Senator Wyden, along with Senator Mark Udall and others, were doing everything they could--without disclosing classified information--to shine a light on the fact that the U.S. Government was collecting massive volumes of data on millions of law-abiding American citizens. My friend from Oregon deserves our thanks for that leadership. Now, after the bulk call data collection program was revealed to the public, the government, frankly, defended it and defended it vigorously. It took a number of months for the intelligence community and the rest of the administration to take a deep breath and really assess whether bulk metadata collection was necessary, whether it was effective, and to consider whether there were other less intrusive, more constitutionally grounded ways to accomplish these same goals. Starting with the President's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies, the administration began to agree that ``some of the authorities that were expanded or created in the aftermath of September 11 unduly sacrifice fundamental interests in individual liberty, personal privacy, and democratic governance.'' And they recommended changing those authorities in order to ``strike a better balance between the competing interests and providing for the common defense and securing `the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.' '' Following that, multiple efforts have been made to update and reform FISA and to update and reform the USA PATRIOT Act. None of those have been successful. But now we are forced to come to a resolution through a combination of, frankly, procrastination, and, I think, misguided hope that the American people would look the other way while the government continued to vacuum up and store their personal information and data as part of a program that even the intelligence community acknowledges can be accomplished through less intrusive means. I will be honest. The current USA FREEDOM Act isn't what I consider perfect. For example, I prefer that it include strong reform of section 702 collection, but I accept that circumstances require us to be pragmatic, require us to govern and move forward and to work with one another in both parties to find compromise. That is what the USA FREEDOM Act is. It is a product of bipartisan compromise. That is why it passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 338 to 88. And let's be blunt, many of those who voted against it didn't do so because they support bulk collection. They did so because they want to see section 215 wither and die in its entirety. That is the political reality we face today, and we need to accept it rather than demanding a continuation of a program that the appeals court has determined is illegal. Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague for his statements and would just want to explore this a little bit further. I hope that those who are following this debate understand that my colleague from New Mexico is a real rising star in the Senate. He and I would like the USA FREEDOM Act to go further, and we both worked together on legislation that would make additional reforms. Certainly, our colleagues on the Intelligence Committee and here in the Senate can expect to see us continuing to work together to advance these additional reforms over the coming months and years. For now, the two of us are saying we ought to support the USA FREEDOM Act and then move on--move on to other critical areas. I particularly want to see closed what is called the backdoor search loophole, which my colleague from New Mexico talked about. What this means, colleagues, is that when you are engaged in a lawful search of someone who is a threat overseas, pursuant to section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, very often law-abiding Americans can get swept up in this search and have their emails looked at. This is a problem today, and my view is it is likely to be a growing concern in the future because, increasingly, communications systems around the world are becoming globally integrated, so the amount of emails that are reviewed of Americans is likely to grow. But we can't get that change here tonight. So, as my colleague from New Mexico has mentioned, the USA FREEDOM Act would make several worthwhile reforms, such as increasing transparency, reducing the government's reliance on secret laws. But from my perspective, the centerpiece of it is ending the bulk collection of Americans' information under the PATRIOT Act. I have been trying to close this particular loophole for close to a decade now. Some of our colleagues have said the bulk collection has never been abused; that no one's rights have been violated. My own view is--and I will ask what my colleague thinks--that vacuuming up all this information, particularly when databases get violated all the time--we have seen historically instances where there has been improper conduct by the government. I believe dragnet surveillance violates the rights of millions of our people every day. Vacuuming up the private phone records of millions of Americans with no connection to wrongdoing is simply a violation of their rights. And vacuuming up Americans' email records, which I pointed out before my colleague came to the floor--which he and our former colleague Senator Udall and I battled--is surely a violation of the rights of Americans as well. Colleagues, that wouldn't have been pointed out at all--it wouldn't have been pointed out at all--unless Senator Udall and I, with the help of our friend from New Mexico, hadn't been pushing back on it. Finally, one day the government said: Well, we will get rid of it because it wasn't effective. They got rid of it because they saw they were going to get hard questions, the kinds of questions my friend from New Mexico has been asking. Now, with respect to the legality of this program, I know my colleague and I actually filed a legal brief, along with our former colleague Mark Udall, when the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was examining that program. In our brief, it was argued that we were able to debunk many of the claims that had been made about the effectiveness of the program. I think it would be helpful if my colleague from New Mexico laid out some of that analysis here tonight. I would ask the Senator from New Mexico to begin, and I would encourage him to start by addressing the claim that the bulk collection of Americans' phone records is essential for stopping terrorist attacks. My question to my colleague is, Is there any evidence, any [[Page S3338]] real concrete evidence, to support that claim? Mr. HEINRICH. I thank my friend from Oregon and begin by saying that despite what we may have heard from talking heads on the Sunday shows and on the cable news networks, the answer is no. There is simply no evidence to support those claims. When this mass surveillance was first revealed to the public 2 years ago, the executive branch initially responded to questions like this by claiming that various post-9/11 authorities had resulted in the thwarting of approximately ``54 terrorist events in the U.S. homeland and abroad.'' Now, a number of us, including my friend from Oregon and my former colleague from Colorado, Senator Udall, began to pull on that thread to really parse down and see just what the executive branch was talking about. First, of those 54 terrorist events, it turned out that only 13 were actually focused in the United States. But more importantly, those numbers conflated multiple different programs, including authorities under section 215 and different authorities under section 702. On June 19, 2013, my colleague from Oregon and Senator Udall pointed out that ``it appears that the bulk phone records collection program under section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act played little or no role in most of these disruptions. Saying that `these programs' have disrupted `dozens of potential terrorist plots' is misleading if the bulk phone records collection program is actually providing little or no unique value.'' Of the original 54 instances the executive branch pointed to, every one of them crumbled under scrutiny. None of them actually justified the continued existence of the bulk collection program. Let me take a moment, with the indulgence of our colleagues, and read what was written by Judge Leon of the District Court for the District of Columbia, when he ruled in the Klayman v. Obama case. This is a little long, but I think it is important this be part of the official record of this debate. Judge Leon writes: [T]he Government does not cite a single instance in which analysis of the NSA's bulk metadata collection actually stopped an imminent attack, or otherwise aided the Government in achieving any objective that was time-sensitive in nature. In fact, none of the three ``recent episodes'' cited by the Government that supposedly ``illustrate the role that telephony metadata analysis can play in preventing and protecting against terrorist attack'' involved any apparent urgency. He continues to write that: []In the first example, the FBI learned of a terrorist plot still ``in its early stages'' and investigated that plot before turning to the metadata ``to ensure that all potential connections were identified.'' []Assistant Director Holley does not say that the metadata revealed any new information-- much less time-sensitive information--that had not already come to light in the investigation up to that point. The judge continues: []In the second example, it appears that the metadata analysis was used only after the terrorist was arrested ``to establish [his] foreign ties and put them in context with his U.S. based planning efforts.'' []And in the third, the metadata analysis ``revealed a previously unknown number for [a] co-conspirator . . . and corroborated his connection to [the target of the investigation] as well as to other U.S.- based extremists.'' Continuing to quote Judge Leon: []Again, there is no indication that these revelations were immediately useful or that they prevented an impending attack. Assistant Director Holley even concedes that bulk metadata analysis only ``sometimes provides information earlier than the FBI's other investigative methods and techniques.'' Finally, Judge Leon writes: []Given the limited record before me at this point in the litigation--most notably, the utter lack of evidence that a terrorist attack has ever been prevented because of searching the NSA database was faster than other investigative tactics--I have serious doubts about the efficacy of the metadata collection program as a means of conducting time- sensitive investigations in cases involving imminent threats of terrorism. That is where the judge leaves off. And I will turn back to the Senator from Oregon to address the three cases we discussed in more detail in our amicus brief to the Second Circuit. Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague. The first of these examples--and they really are kind of overblown examples about the effectiveness of bulk collection--is the case of an individual named Najibullah Zazi. Mr. Zazi was a known terrorism suspect, and a number of people have suggested that bulk phone records collection was somehow essential to stopping him because a query of the bulk phone records database for numbers linked to Mr. Zazi returned a previously unknown number belonging to another terrorism suspect. However, since the government had already identified Zazi as a terrorism suspect prior to querying the bulk phone records database, it had all the evidence it needed to obtain the phone records of Zazi and his associates using an individualized section 215 order or other legal authorities. In the second case, some have pointed to Mr. Moalin, the San Diego man convicted of sending $8,500 to support al-Shabaab in Somalia. The intelligence community has indicated that information from the bulk phone records database ``established a connection between a phone number known to be used by an extremist overseas . . . and an unknown San Diego-based number'' that belonged to Mr. Moalin. Yet there are ample existing authorities under which the United States can conduct surveillance on a phone number known to be used by extremists overseas and other phone numbers in contact with that phone number. The argument that Mr. Moalin's case is an example of a unique value of bulk phone records collection is just not accurate. My view is this is yet another case that offers a misleading exaggeration with respect to the effectiveness of bulk phone records collection. Finally, several supporters of the bulk metadata program have claimed that ``[i]f we had had [the bulk phone-records] program in place at the time [of the September 11, 2001 attacks,] we would have been able to identify'' the phone number of one of the hijackers, Khalid al-Mihdhar. Just as in these other cases, however, the record indicates that Mr. Mihdhar's phone number could also have been obtained by the government using a variety of alternate means. Before September 11, the government was surveilling a safe house in Yemen but failed to realize that Mr. Mihdhar, who was in contact with the safe house, was actually inside the United States. The government could have used any number of authorities to determine whether anyone in our country was in contact with the safe house it was already targeting. It didn't need a record of every Americans' phone calls to establish that simple connection. Mr. HEINRICH. I wish to expound on that point a bit, about the many other ways the government can legitimately acquire phone records of terrorism suspects, because I think this is a very important point to understand the tools that already exist that have been very effective and have proven themselves over time. There are actually a number of legal authorities that can get the same information without the government collecting billions of call records--billions of call records that, in large part, belong to innocent Americans. For example, the Stored Communications Act permits the government to obtain precisely the same call records that are now acquired through bulk collection under section 215 when they are ``relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.'' Additionally, national security letters, which I point out do not require a court order, can also be used by the government to obtain call records for intelligence purposes. Further, the government can also acquire telephony metadata on a real-time basis by obtaining orders from either regular Federal courts or the FISC for the installation of pen registers or trap-and-trace devices. Finally, individualized orders for phone records, as opposed to orders authorizing broad bulk collection, can also be obtained under section 215. I think those of us early in this debate thought that was what was going to occur under the PATRIOT Act in the first place. But that is what the USA FREEDOM Act seeks to require while prohibiting the bulk collection of millions of personal records. It even includes emergency authorization authority for the government to get records prior to getting court approval, subject to later court approval, in an emergency. The government can use any of these authorities without any more evidence [[Page S3339]] than what is currently required to use the bulk phone records database, with less impact, I would point out, on the privacy interests of millions of innocent Americans. I think at this point the Senator from Oregon and I have laid out our case as to why this dragnet bulk surveillance program fails to make our country measurably safer and why it should end. I am pleased to say that a number of people have finally come around to our way of thinking on this. Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague. I will wrap up and then give the last word to my friend from New Mexico on the subject. He is absolutely right that some of the most authoritative leaders in our country-- experts on terror--have reached the same judgment we have. I made mention of the President's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies, and I really would encourage colleagues who are following this debate and citizens across the country--that report is available online, and it is available in our office. Page 104 of that report is very explicit. It says that the information that would otherwise be obtained in collecting all of these phone records-- millions of phone records of law-abiding Americans, people such as Mike Morell, former Acting Director of the CIA, and Richard Clark, who served in two administrations--they said it could have been obtained through conventional processes. This is a program that is not making us safer. And it is not my judgment that ought to be the last word; it should be that of people like those I just quoted. The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board's report on the telephone records program said pretty much the same thing: [T]he Section 215 program has shown minimal value in safeguarding the nation from terrorism. Based on the information provided to the Board, including classified briefings and documentation, we have not identified a single instance involving a threat to the United States in which the program made a concrete difference in the outcome of a counterterrorism investigation. I will close by way of saying--and I touched on this before my friend from New Mexico arrived--I would like to do a lot more than I believe is likely to happen here quickly in the Senate. I do want to see us finally throw in the dustbin of history this bulk phone records collection program because it doesn't make us safer and it compromises our liberty. But, as I indicated to my friend from New Mexico, I would also like to close this backdoor search loophole in the FISA Act, which is going to be a bigger problem in the days ahead given the evolution of communications systems and how they have become globally integrated. I will close by saying that one of the most important issues we are going to have to tackle in the days ahead is going to deal with encryption. Encryption, of course, is the encoding of data and messages so that they cannot be easily read. The reason this will be an enormously important issue--and my colleague and I have talked about this--is because of the NSA overreach, the collection of all these phone records of law-abiding people. A lot of our most innovative, cutting-edge companies have found their customers raising real questions about whether their products can be used safely, and a lot of the purchasers who buy their products around the world are saying: Maybe we shouldn't trust them. Maybe we should try to start taking control over their servers and have local storage requirements and that sort of thing. So what our companies did, because they saw the effect of the overreach by the NSA, was they started to use encryption to protect the data and messages of the consumers who buy their products. Most recently, the head of the FBI, Mr. Comey, rather than try to come back with a solution that protected both our privacy and our security, he said he was interested in requiring companies to build weaknesses into their products. Just think about that--requiring companies to build weaknesses into their products. So the government-- which, in effect, caused this problem with the overreach--in effect, rather than trying to find a solution that worked for both security and liberty, said: We will start talking about requiring companies to actually build weaknesses into their products. I and others have pointed out that once you do that, hang on to your hat. When the good guys have the keys, that is one thing, but when companies are required to build weaknesses into their products, the bad guys are going to get the keys in a hurry, too. And with all the cyber hacking and the risks we already have, we ought to be really careful about going where Mr. Comey, our FBI Director, has proposed to go. But that is not for tonight. Tonight is not an occasion where we will be able to, on a bipartisan basis, close the backdoor-search loophole or where we will be able to come up with a sensible policy with respect to encryption rather than requiring companies to actually build weaknesses in their products. We will not be able to do that tonight. But we will now have a chance here in the Senate to take steps that have been bipartisan both here in the Senate and in the other body, in the House of Representatives, to end the bulk phone records collection program because it doesn't make us safer and it threatens our liberties. I always like to close by thinking about Ben Franklin, who said that anybody who gives up their liberty to have security really doesn't deserve either. I am so pleased to have a chance to serve with my colleague from New Mexico on the Intelligence Committee, who is going to be a thoughtful advocate for these kinds of policies, in my view, for many years to come. I thank him for his involvement tonight and would be happy to give him the last word of our colloquy at this time. I yield to my colleague. Mr. HEINRICH. I thank my friend from Oregon. I think he could not have chosen a more appropriate way to end than to reference what Ben Franklin said so many years ago, that great quote that ``those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.'' While many reforms still lie in front of us, I think, as we move forward to approving the USA FREEDOM Act, we move a lot closer to the balance that Ben Franklin articulated so well over 200 years ago. I look forward to working with my colleague from Oregon and all of our colleagues in achieving that balance and standing up for our constituents. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I yield the floor. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we did not have to end up here, just hours away from the midnight expiration of three surveillance authorities, and having just moved to proceed to the USA FREEDOM Act. I have tried since last year to move legislation through the Senate to address these sunsets. In November, Senator Reid brought the USA FREEDOM Act to the floor but the Republican leadership of the Senate blocked debate on it. When they took over the Senate, they assured us that they would send bills--including this one--through appropriate committee process. There were promises that the new leadership would not fill the amendment tree, and would use a transparent legislative process. But not one of those promises has been fulfilled with respect to any legislation dealing with the upcoming sunsets. Once again this year, I proposed with Senator Lee a new version of the USA FREEDOM Act. That bill had significant process in the House, where it passed by an overwhelming margin earlier this month. And once again, the bipartisan coalition here in the Senate tried to get the bill passed. Two Fridays ago, the Senate Republican leadership did not allow us to debate the bill. Tonight, the Senate did the right thing by invoking cloture on the motion to proceed to the USA FREEDOM Act. I am glad to see several Republicans switched their votes. This is significant progress, but it is late in coming. We should have proceeded to this bill two Fridays ago. Had we done so, we could have stayed here to do our work, considered amendments, and passed the bill well in advance of tonight's sunset. Instead, we are hours away from expiration and just now considering legislation that many of us have been working on for years. Our intelligence community needs predictability and certainty, not a manufactured crisis. If all Senators cooperate, we can finish this bill tonight. We can consider a [[Page S3340]] handful of amendments under a time agreement, and pass this bill before midnight. That would be the responsible thing to do. Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Capito). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I know of no further debate on the motion. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to proceed. The motion was agreed to. ____________________",package_114_92.csv,75380,75380,75445,"[congressional record volume 161, number 85 (sunday, may 31, 2015)] [senate] [pages s3331-s3340] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] usa freedom act of 2015--motion to proceed--continued the presiding officer. the majority leader. mr. mcconnell. mr. president, before the recess, i tried to get a short-term extension of three provisions that will expire at midnight tonight: section 215, business records; section 206, roving wiretap authority; and the ``lone wolf'' provision. unfortunately, those efforts were unsuccessful. ``lone wolf'' and roving wiretap are not--i repeat, not--the subject of controversy with the house bill. so i would propose that we extend at least the ``lone wolf'' and the roving wiretap authorities while we continue to litigate the differing views on section 215. more specifically, i would propose that we extend those two provisions-- ``lone wolf'' and roving wiretaps--for up to 2 weeks. unanimous consent request mr. president, having said that, i ask unanimous consent that the senate proceed to the immediate consideration of a bill, which is at the desk, to extend the expiring provisions relating to ``lone wolf'' and roving wiretaps for 2 weeks, and that the bill be read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate. the presiding officer. is there objection? the senator from kentucky. mr. paul. mr. president, reserving the right to object, one of the promises that was given when the patriot act was originally passed was that, in exchange for allowing a less than constitutional standard, we would only use the actions against---- the presiding officer. is there objection? mr. paul. terrorists and against foreigners. we found that 99 percent of the time, section 213 is used for domestic crime. i believe that no section of the patriot act should be passed unless our targets are terrorists--not americans. mr. cornyn. mr. president, regular order. the presiding officer. the senator from kentucky---- mr. cotton. regular order. mr. paul. i object. the presiding officer. objection is heard. mr. mcconnell. mr. president, last week, i proposed giving the intelligence committee the time it would need to work toward the kind of bipartisan legislative compromise americans deserve--a compromise that would preserve important counterterrorism tools necessary to protect american lives. that effort was blocked. just now, i proposed an even narrower extension that would have only extended some of the least controversial--least controversial--but still critical tools to ensure they do not lapse as senators work toward a more comprehensive legislative outcome. but even that very narrow offer was blocked. i think it should be worrying for our country because the nature of the threat we face is very serious. it is aggressive, it is sophisticated, it is geographically dispersed, and it is not--not--going away. as the la times reported, ``the obama administration has dramatically stepped up warnings of potential terrorist attacks on american soil after several years of relative calm.'' the paper reported that this is occurring in the wake of ``fbi arrests of at least 30 americans on terrorism-related charges this year in an array of `lone wolf' plots.'' so these aren't theoretical threats. they are not theoretical threats. they are with us every day. we have to face up to them. we shouldn't be disarming unilaterally as our enemies grow more sophisticated and aggressive, and we certainly should not be doing so based on a campaign of demagoguery and disinformation launched in the wake of the unlawful actions of edward snowden, who was last seen in russia. the opponents of this program have not been able to provide any-- any--examples of the nsa abusing the authorities provided under section 215. and the record will show that, in fact, there has not been one documented instance of abuse of it. i think it is also important to remember that the contents of calls are not captured. that is the general view, but it is an incorrect one. i will say it again: the contents of calls are not captured. i say this to the american people: if you have been told that, that is not correct. that is what i mean about a campaign of disinformation. the only things in question are the number dialed, the number from which the call was made, the length of the call, and the date. that is it. that is it. detailed oversight procedures have been put in place, too, in order to protect the privacy of americans. now, i believe this is a program that strikes a critical balance between privacy on the one hand and national security on the other. that doesn't mean the senate still shouldn't have the opportunity to make some changes to it. that is precisely the outcome i had been hoping to facilitate by seeking several short-term extensions. and considering all that has come to light about the house-passed bill in recent weeks, i believe this was more than reasonable. the administration's inability to answer even the most basic questions about the alternate bulk data system it would have to build under that legislation is, to say the least, pretty troubling--pretty troubling. and that is not just my view. that is the view of many in this body, including colleagues who have been favorably predisposed to the house bill. in particular, i know senators from both parties have been disturbed by the administration's continuing inability to guarantee whether the new system would work as well as the current one or whether there would even be any data available to analyze. while the administration has let it be known that this nonexistent system could only be built in time if telephone providers cooperated in building it, providers have made it abundantly clear that they are not going to commit to retaining the data. they are not going to commit to retaining the data for any period of time unless legally required to do so, and there is no such requirement in the house-passed bill--none at all. here is how one provider put it: ``[we are] not prepared to commit to voluntarily retain documents for any particular period of time pursuant to the proposed usa freedom act if not required by law''--if not required by law. now, these are just a few of the reasons i thought it prudent to try to give the senate more space to advance better legislation through committee consideration and regular order, with input from both sides. but, my colleagues, it is now clear that will not be possible in the face of a determined opposition from those who simply wish to end the counterterrorism program altogether. no time to try to improve the house-passed bill will be allowed because some would like to end the program altogether. so this is where we find ourselves. this is the reality. so it essentially leaves us with two options. option one is to allow the program to expire altogether without attempting to replace it. that would mean disarming completely and arbitrarily, based on a campaign of disinformation, in the face of growing, aggressive, and sophisticated threats--growing, aggressive, and sophisticated threats. that is a totally unacceptable outcome--a completely and totally unacceptable outcome. so we won't be doing that. [[page s3332]] so we are left with option two, the house-passed bill. it is certainly not ideal. but along with votes on some modest amendments that attempt to ensure the program can actually work as promised, it is now the only realistic way forward. so i remain determined to continue working toward the best outcome for the american people possible under the circumstances. this is where we are, colleagues. we have the house-passed bill with some serious flaws and an inability to get a short-term extension to try to improve the house-passed bill in the way we normally do this-- through some kind of consultative process. so bearing that in mind, i move to proceed to the motion to reconsider vote no. 194, the vote by which cloture was not invoked on the motion to proceed to h.r. 2048. the presiding officer. the question is on agreeing to the motion. the motion was agreed to. mr. mcconnell. mr. president, i move to reconsider the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to h.r. 2048. the presiding officer. the question is on agreeing to the motion. the motion was agreed to. cloture motion the presiding officer. pursuant to rule xxii, the chair lays before the senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. the senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: cloture motion we, the undersigned senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule xxii of the standing rules of the senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to proceed to h.r. 2048, an act to reform the authorities of the federal government to require the production of certain business records, conduct electronic surveillance, use pen registers and trap and trace devices, and use other forms of information gathering for foreign intelligence, counterterrorism, and criminal purposes, and for other purposes. mitch mcconnell, lamar alexander, michael b. enzi, david vitter, john cornyn, johnny isakson, lisa murkowski, john barrasso, richard burr, pat roberts, roy blunt, bob corker, orrin g. hatch, jerry moran, patrick j. toomey, mike lee, ted cruz. the presiding officer. by unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. the question is, is it the sense of the senate that debate on the motion to proceed to h.r. 2048, an act to reform the authorities of the federal government to require the production of certain business records, conduct electronic surveillance, use pen registers and trap and trace devices, and use other forms of information gathering for foreign intelligence, counterterrorism, and criminal purposes, and for other purposes, shall be brought to a close, upon reconsideration? the yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll. mr. cornyn. the following senators are necessarily absent: the senator from wyoming (mr. enzi), the senator from south carolina (mr. graham), and the senator from nebraska (mr. sasse). mr. durbin. i announce that the senator from new jersey (mr. menendez), the senator from washington (mrs. murray), and the senator from hawaii (mr. schatz) are necessarily absent. the presiding officer (mr. barrasso). are there any senators in the chamber wishing to vote or to change their vote?

the presiding officer. the senate will be in order. mr. paul. will the chair inform me when i have 5 minutes remaining? the presiding officer. the senator will be so notified. mr. paul. mr. president, tonight begins the process of ending bulk collection. the bill will ultimately pass. we always look for silver linings. i think the bill may be replacing one form of bulk collection with another, but the government, after this bill passes, will no longer collect our phone records. my concern is that the phone companies still may do the same thing. currently, my understanding is the nsa is at the phone company sucking up the phone records and sending them to utah. my concern is---- the presiding officer. order in the senate, please. the senator deserves to be heard. mr. paul. my concern is that under the new program, the records will still be sucked up into nsa computers, but the computers will be at the phone company, not in utah. so the question is, will it be a distinction without a difference? the question also will be, will this be individualized? one of the issues about the fourth amendment that was the biggest part of the fourth amendment for our founding fathers was that a warrant should be individualized. general warrants were what we fought the revolution over. james otis fought a famous case in the 1760s, and he fought against the british soldiers writing their own warrants. what is interesting is that part of the patriot act allows our police to write their own warrants. we have something called national security letters. these have been done by the hundreds of thousands. interestingly, when the president was in the senate, he was opposed to national security letters and said that they should have judicial warrants. now, it is interesting that in this bill that will pass, it is supported by the president, supported by the director of national intelligence, and now supported in a wide bipartisan fashion. it concerns me whether or not---- the presiding officer. the senate will be in order. will the senator please suspend. the senate will be in order. please take your conversations out of the well, out of the chamber. the senator deserves to be heard. mr. paul. it concerns me that the president, who supports the bulk data collection and has been performing it illegally for 6 years, now supports this bill. the devil is in the details. the question is, will the new bill still allow bulk collection by the phone companies? will they be able to put into the search engine not an individual about whom we have suspicion but an entire corporation? this is what was revealed when we saw the warrant that had tsarnaev's name on it. the director of national intelligence came before the american people, came before congress and swore under oath that they weren't doing this. part of my problem with the intelligence-gathering in our country is it is hard for me to have trust. it is hard for me to have trust in the people to whom we are giving great power. they also insist we won't be able to catch terrorists. they insist the bulk collection allowed them to catch terrorists. but then it turned out, when it was investigated, when we looked at the classified documents, when the president's bipartisan privacy and civil liberties commission looked at this, when his review board looked at this, and then when the department of justice inspector general looked at this, [[page s3333]] they all found that there was no unique data, there was no great discovery, there was no great breaking up of a terrorist ring. people have brought up the boston bomber, the tsarnaev boy. they say: well, we need this. we need the patriot act after the bombing to get his phone records. that is the most absurd thing i have ever heard. he has already committed a bombing. in fact, i think he was dead at that point, and they are saying we couldn't get a warrant to look at his phone records? it is absolutely absurd. i had a meeting with somebody from the intelligence community about 6 months ago, and i asked them this question: how do we get more information about terrorists--with a warrant with their name on it, where we can go as deep into the details as we want, or this metadata collection that uses a less-than-constitutional standard? and he said: without question, we get more information with a warrant than we do through the metadata. when someone commits an act of atrocity, there is no question we would get a warrant, but i would go even further. i would say that i want to get more warrants on people before they blow up things. i would say that we need more money spent on fbi agents analyzing data and trying to find out whom we have suspicion about so we can investigate their records. i think we spend so much money on people about whom there is no suspicion that we don't have enough time and money left to go after the people who would actually harm us. the people who argue that the world will end at midnight tonight---- the presiding officer. the senator will please suspend. order in the chamber. please take your conversations off the floor. mr. paul. the people who argue that the world will end and that we will be overrun by jihadists tonight are trying to use fear. they want to take just a little bit of our liberty, but they get it by making us afraid. they want us to fear and give up our liberty. they tell us that if we have nothing to hide, we have nothing to fear. that is a far cry from the standard we were founded upon--innocent until proven guilty. one of the objections i tried to bring forward earlier but was interrupted repeatedly was that the patriot act was originally intended to go after foreigners and terrorists. we allowed a less-than- constitutional standard. we didn't ask for probable cause; we just said it had to be relevant, the information had to be relevant to an investigation about terrorists. but here is the problem, and this is one of the big problems i have with the patriot act. we now use parts of the patriot act to arrest people for domestic crime. section 213, sneak-and-peek, where the government can come into your house, place listening devices, never announce they were ever in your house, and then leave and monitor your behavior and never let you know they were there, is being used 99.5 percent of the time for domestic crime. so, little by little, we have allowed our freedom to slip away. we allowed the fourth amendment to be diminished. we allowed the narrowing loss of something called probable cause. people say: well, how would we get terrorists with that? the vast majority of warrants are approved in our country--the vast majority of warrants that are fourth amendment warrants where we individualized and put a name on it and asked probable cause. if tonight the police are looking for a rapist or a murderer, they will go to the house, and if they suspect the person is inside but nothing is imminently happening, they will stand on the curb and they almost always get a warrant. do you think there is a judge in this land who would not grant a warrant--particularly after the boston bombing--to look at the tsarnaev brothers' records? there is not a judge in the land who would say no. i would venture to say that in advance there is not much chance that a judge would say no if you went to them and said: the russians have given us indication and evidence that he has been radicalized and has associated overseas with people who are training to attack us. there is no reason why the constitution can't be used. but we just have to not let those who are in power make us cower in fear. they use fear to take your freedom, and we have to be very, very careful of this. now, some are saying i am misrepresenting this, that i am saying the government is listening to your phone calls. i am saying they are collecting your phone records. there are programs, though, in which there may be looking at content--emails, for example. the current law says that after 6 months even the content of your email has no protection. we have a very good piece of legislation to try to fix that. but realize that those who are loud, those who are really wanting you to give up your freedom, don't believe the fourth amendment protects your records at all. and this is a big debate. we went to the court. the second circuit court of appeals--the highest court in the land just below the supreme court--said that what they are doing is illegal, but we don't yet have a ruling on whether it is constitutional. one of my fears about the bill we are going to pass--the sort of in- between step some think may be better--is that it could moot the case. this means the court case will never get heard by the supreme court. i have a court case against the nsa. there is another district court that has ruled against the nsa. we now have an appellate ruling against the nsa. the court may well look at the activity of the senate and say: well, you guys have fixed the problem. we don't need to look at it anymore. it is no longer relevant. my other concern about this new bill that is going to pass is that the same people will judge it who judged the previous system. these people are called the rubberstamp courtroom, also known as fisa. realize that the fisa court is the court that said the collection of all americans' records is relevant. the appellate court basically laughed at this notion and said that it sort of destroys any meaning to the word ``relevant'' if you collect everybody's records. it is not even a modifier. instead of saying ``relevant,'' they should have said ``you can have everyone's records all the time.'' one of my other concerns about the in-between solution we are going to choose is that some are conjecturing--and you have to be suspicious of a government that often lies about their purpose--some are conjecturing that they are going to collect more phone data under the new system. one of the complaints last week, as there was discussion about this--in the newspaper, it was reported that really they were only collecting about 20 to 30 percent of your cell phone data. they were trying to collect all of your land line data, but they weren't for some reason collecting all of your cell phone data. one of my concerns is that as we go to this new system, they may actually be better at collecting our phone records and they may well be able to collect all of our cell phone data. unless we go to a system where we individualize the warrants, unless we go to a system where a person's name is on the warrant, i am going to be very, very concerned. now, we will present amendments on this bill. we tried to negotiate to be allowed to present amendments, but there wasn't a lot of negotiating that went on in the last week--in fact, there was none. we will still try. we will put amendments forward, and we will try to get amendments to make the bulk collection less bad when it does occur. one of the things we would like to do is to say that when they search the phone records, they can't put the name of a corporation in there; they would have to put in an individual's name. it is kind of tricky, the way these things are worded. the wording of this bill will say they can only put a u.s. person into the selector term to search all phone records. the problem is that they define ``u.s. person'' as also meaning corporation or association or grouping. so there is a little bit of looseness to the language. so if we are still going to allow corporations, what is to stop them from going back and putting at&t or verizon in the selection? once again they will be looking at all the phone records, and all we will have done is transferred the phone records from government control in utah to phone company control in another location. will we be trading bulk collection in utah for bulk collection under the phone companies? there are good people who believe this bill will reform, and i think they [[page s3334]] are well-intended. i think they are good people who really think that we will end bulk collection and that it won't happen. my fear, though, is of the people who interpret this work at a place known as the rubberstamp factory over at fisa. it is a secret court, and it is a court in which 99.5 percent of the time they approve warrants. warrants are simply rubberstamped over there. in fact, they approved that ``relevant'' meant all of your records. so my question is, if they put at&t as a selector item, will we have the same thing, just in a different location? i have several amendments i am interested in if we are able to amend the bill. one is that the search would have to be an individual. that is more consistent with the fourth amendment. another one would change the standard to the constitutional standard, which would be that there would have to be probable cause, which is a higher standard than simply saying it is relevant. then we would actually be sending a new signal to the fisa court. another amendment i have, which i think would go a long way toward making the patriot act less bad--i think is the best way to put it-- would be to say that any information gathered under a less-than- constitutional standard could only be used for foreigners and terrorists. see, that was the promise. at the time, there were people who opposed the patriot act--not enough, but there were a few--and when they opposed the patriot act, they said their fear was that it would be used against american citizens. they said: no, no, we are only going after terrorists. but the law allows them to do it, and we now have sections of the patriot act which 99.5 percent of the time are being used for domestic crime. we have also seen that the drug enforcement agency--it is alleged--is using information gathered under the patriot act to then go back and recreate cases against people for domestic crime. the question we have to ask ourselves is, are we so frightened that we are willing to give up our freedom? are we really willing to trade liberty for security? i think the u.s. court of appeals had some great points that they made when they ruled against the government, and i think what is important to know is that the president has continued to do this illegally. you have seen him on television. the president has been saying: well, congress is just getting in the way. if congress would just do their job and get rid of this, everything would be ok. but the truth is that congress never authorized this. even the authors of the patriot act said this was not something congress ever even contemplated. the court is now saying that as well. this was done by the executive branch--admittedly, both a republican executive branch and a democratic executive branch--but this wasn't created by congress. so when the president says ``well, congress should just do this,'' the question that has never been asked by anyone in the media is ``why doesn't he stop it?'' everybody who has given advice has said he would, and he will come out and say he believes in a balanced solution, but he really is just abdicating the solution and has never discontinued the program, even when he has been told explicitly by the court that the program is an illegal program. this is what the u.s. court of appeals said in the case aclu v. clapper: we agree with the appellants that such an expansive concept of ``relevance'' is unprecedented and unwarranted. . . . the records demanded are not those of suspects under investigation, or of people or businesses that have contact with such subjects, or of people or businesses that have contact with others who are in contact with the subjects. so even two steps removed, we are gathering records that are completely irrelevant to the investigation. we are gathering up the phone records of innocent americans. the other side will say: well, we are not looking at them. so i have been thinking about this. our founders objected to the british soldiers writing warrants. they objected to them coming into their house and grabbing their papers. do you think our framers would have been happy if the british government said: ok, we are just breaking your door down, we are just getting your papers, but we are not going to look at them. do you think that would have changed the mindset of the framers? so the fact that they say they are not looking at our records--is that any comfort or should it be any comfort? the act of violation is in taking your records. the act of violation is in allowing the police or a form of the police--the fbi--to write warrants that are not signed by a judge. the court goes on to say: ``the interpretation that the government asks us to adopt defies any limiting principle.'' the idea of a limiting principle when the court looks at things is that, the way i see it, is the difference between something being arbitrary, where there is no sort of principle that confines what would happen--if you have a law that has no limiting principle, it is essentially arbitrary. this is what hayek wrote about in ``the road to serfdom.'' hayek talked about the difference between the rule of law and having an arbitrary interpretation of the law. the danger of having an arbitrary interpretation of the law and the danger of having general warrants is that they have been used in the past with bias. people have brought their own bias into this. in the sixties, the bias was against civil rights activists and against vietnam war activists. in the forties, the bias was in incarcerating and interring japanese americans. but what was consistent in all of these circumstances was that there was a generalization--a generalization based on the color of your skin, whether you were asian american or african american, and also about the shade of your ideology. there is a danger in allowing the government to generalize without suspicion and to disobey the fourth amendment, and the danger comes that the government could one day generalize and bias could enter into things. we have on our records right now laws that allow an american citizen to be detained. it is not specifically a part of the patriot act, but it is along the same lines as this, that you are getting rid of the due process amendments and the ability of the bill of rights to protect an individual. when we allow an individual to be detained without a trial, what happens is that there is the possibility that someone could decide we don't like ``those'' people. and when you say that could never happen, think about the times in our history when it has. richard jewell, everybody said he was the olympic bomber. he was convicted on tv. within hours, people said: richard jewell is guilty. think about if he had been a black man in 1920 in the south what may have happened to him. think about the possibility for bias entering into our government. think about what madison said about government is--madison said that we restrain government because we are worried that government may not be comprised of angels. if government were comprised of angels, we would not have to worry about restraining government. patrick henry said that the constitution was about restraining government, not the people. it is not enough for people to say: oh, i am a good man or i am a good person or the nsa would never do this. the other problem that makes us doubtful is that the nsa has not been honest with us. if they want to develop trust again, the president should have immediately let the person who lied to us go, the director of national intelligence. the appeals court concluded by saying that the government's bulk collection of telephone metadata exceeds the scope of what congress has authorized and therefore violates section 215 of the patriot act. some will try to argue that this debate was not worth the time we took on it. i could not disagree more. i am like everybody else. you know, i prize my time with my family and being at home on the weekends. i wish we would have done this in a more sensitive way, where we would have had more time and had an open amendment process. but we waited until the end. we waited until the final deadline. this is a characteristic of government. it is a flaw in government, frankly. we lurch from deadline to deadline. people wonder why congress is so unpopular. it is because we go from deadline to deadline and then it is: hurry up. we have no time to debate. we just must pass it as is. [[page s3335]] the biggest debate against amendments is--and it finally convinced people who did not like this. they so much dislike amendments and slowing down the process, they are just going to take it. even though they don't like it, they are going to pass what the house passed. it is unlikely any amendments will pass. but the thing is, we need to get away from lurching from deadline to deadline. what happens, with budget or spending or any of these bills, is we are presented with thousand-page bills with only hours to go. about a year ago this came up. at that time, we were presented with a 1,000-page bill with 2 hours to go. i read the senate rules. it said: we are supposed to be presented with the bill for 48 hours in advance. so i raised my hand and made a motion. the motion i made was: guys, we are breaking the rules here. men and women, we are breaking the rules here. so they just voted to amend the rules for that bill and ignore the rules. this is why the american people are so frustrated. people here in town think i am making a huge mistake. some of them, i think, secretly want there to be an attack on the united states so they can blame it on me. one of the people in the media the other day came up to me and said: oh, when there is a great attack, are you going to feel guilty that you caused this great attack? the people who attack us are responsible for attacks on us. do we blame the police chief for the attack by the boston bombers? the thing is, is that there can be attacks even if we use the constitution. but there have been attacks while collecting your bulk data. so the ones who say: well, when an attack occurs, it is going to be all your fault, are any of them willing to accept the blame? we have bulk collection now. are any of them willing to accept the blame for the boston bombing, for the recent shooting in garland? no, but they will be the first to point fingers and say: oh, yes, it is all your fault. we never should have given up on this great program. i am completely convinced that we can obey the constitution, use the fourth amendment as intended, spirited letter of the law, and catch terrorists. when we look objectively at this program, when they analyzed the classified information, they found that there was no unique data. we had to fight them tooth and nail because they started out saying that 52 cases were cracked by the bulk data program. but then when the president's own bipartisan commission looked at it, it turned out that none of that was true. this gets back to the trust issue. if we are going to be lied to by the director of national intelligence, it is hard for us to believe them when they come forward and they say: oh, this is protecting us. we have to have it. but what we are hearing is information from someone who really did not think it was a big deal to lie to us about whether the program even existed. mark my words, the battle is not over. there are some--and i talked with one of the, i would say, smarter people in silicon valley, somebody who knows this from an intimate level, how things work, and how the codes and programs work. he maintains that the bulk collection of phone data is the tip of the iceberg, that there is more information in other data pools that are classified. some of this is done through an executive order called 12333. i am not sure i know everything in it. i have had no briefings on it. so anything i will tell you is from the newspaper alone. but the thing is, is that i would like to know: are we also collecting your credit card information? are we collecting your texts? are we collecting your emails? they have already told us the fourth amendment does not protect your emails, even the content, after 6 months. in fact, really they have told you, the fourth amendment does not apply to your records at all. so be very careful about the people who say: trust us. we will never violate your freedom. we will never take advantage of things. the president's privacy and civil liberties oversight board's conclusion was that: section 215 of the patriot act has shown minimal value in safeguarding the nation from terrorism. we have not identified any single instance involving a threat to the united states in which the program made a concrete difference in the outcome. the president's privacy board went on to say: the government's collection of a person's entire telephone calling history has a significant and detrimental effect on individual privacy. when they talked about whether the phone records were relevant to an investigation, the president's commission said this: first, the telephone records acquired under the program have no connection to any specific fbi investigation at the time of their collection. second, because the records are collected in bulk, potentially encompassing all telephone calling records across the nation, they cannot be regarded as relevant to any fbi investigation. here is the continuing danger to us, though: it is, i think, maybe a minor success that we are going to prevent the government from collecting these records. but realize that the interpretation of this will still occur in secret in the fisa court. this is the fisa court that said that collecting everyone's records was relevant. it completely destroys the notion that the word ``relevant'' has any meaning at all. this will be the question: whether we can trust the fisa court to make an interpretation that is at a higher degree of discernment than the one in which they said ``relevant'' can mean anything. the original usa freedom act, as passed originally by the house committee, was a better bill. it was gradually watered down until even the director of national intelligence, the one who lied about the program, now supports it, which gives me some misgivings. but the records that will be collected--the question is, how will we have an interpretation by the fisa court? the original bill had an advocate. i thought this was a good part of the original bill. there would be a judicial advocate who would argue on the side of those who were having their records taken. so there would be an adversarial court, lawyers on both sides. many people who write about jurisprudence and trying to find justice say that one of the essential functions of a court system, in order to find justice, is that there has to be a lawyer on both sides. there has to be an advocate on both sides. the truth is not always easy to find. the truth is presentation of facts by one side, presentation of contrary facts by the other side, and someone has to figure out which facts are more believable or which facts trump other facts. so i think a judicial advocate would have been good. they are still going to have it. they call it by a different name now, but it will be optional at the discretion of the fisa court. so the court that ruled that all of your records are relevant now will have a choice as to whether to give you an advocate. that does not give me a great deal of comfort. there are other ways we could do this. we occasionally do look at terrorism cases in regular federal court. when names come up that could jeopardize someone's safety at our intelligence agency or a secret, federal courts can go into secret session. i have heard the senator from oregon often mention this. i think it is a great point that no one wants to reveal the names of anyone or the code or the secrets of how we do this. but if we are talking about constitutional principles, we want to do it in the open. laws should not be discussed in secret. as we move forward, the patriot act will expire tonight. it will only be temporary. they will ultimately get their way. but i think the majority of the american people actually do believe the government has gone too far. in washington, it is the opposite, but i think washington is out of touch. there will be 80 votes, you know, to say: continue the patriot act--maybe more. but if you go into the general public, if you get outside the beltway and visit america, you find it is completely the opposite. there was a poll a couple of weeks ago that said: over 80 percent of people under age 40--over 80 percent of them--think that the government collecting your phone records is wrong and should not occur. so i think really this will be useful. people say: you are destroying yourself. you should have never done this. the american people will not side with you. people wished me harm and wished that this would be unsuccessful. but you know what, i came here to defend the bill of rights and to defend the [[page s3336]] constitution, popular or not. but i frankly think that the bill of rights and the constitution are very popular, very important, and i will continue, as long as i have breath and as long as i am here to defend them. i yield back the remainder of my time. the presiding officer. the senator from oregon. mr. wyden. mr. president, before he leaves the floor, i just want to make sure, having worked with senator paul for many, many months now, that i especially appreciate his efforts in the last few days in this week to try to accommodate this body with respect to amendments. my colleague has said repeatedly that he was very interested in a short list of amendments, that he hoped to have some modest time that would be available for these amendments. he and i have worked together on a number of them. i think it is a reflection, as people think about this debate and on a topic that is of such enormous importance, that my colleague from kentucky, especially with respect to this amendment issue, has tried continually to be reasonable and to be accommodating to this body. until just a few hours ago, i was at home in oregon having townhall meetings, flew all night to be here for this extremely important session. of course, the topic we discussed this evening was front and center in terms of my constituents. the message from oregonians at these townhall meetings was very clear. the people whom i have the honor to represent in the senate want policies that advance their security and protect their liberties. the program we have been talking about tonight in the senate really does not deliver either. it does not make us safer. it chips away at our liberties. i am going to spend a little bit of time this evening making the case for those kinds of arguments and laying out the challenge for the days ahead. now, with respect to this safety issue, all of us understand-- particularly the presiding officer, who has been on the intelligence committee, as i have, for over 14 years--that it is a dangerous world. anyone who serves on the intelligence committee knows that beyond any kind of debate. so we want policies that really deliver both security and liberty. this is what the president's own experts had to say with respect to this program that involves collecting millions and millions of phone records on law-abiding americans. this was a group that was appointed and spent a considerable amount of time looking at the bulk phone records collection program. they issued a report, and will i just paraphrase what is the central finding, on page 104 of their report: as to information contributed to terrorist investigations by the use of section 215 telephony metadata--that is the collecting all of these millions and millions of phone records--these experts say that ``could readily have been obtained in a timely manner using conventional section 215 orders.'' now, the reason that is important is it spells out and recognizes that those who signed this report are individuals with some of the most pristine antiterror credentials in this country--mike morell, for example, the former acting director of the cia; richard clarke, who held an extremely important position in two administrations and served with both republicans and democrats. both of them are signatories to this important report. beyond that--and it has not received much attention--the reality is that our government, on top of everything else, has emergency authorities so that when those who are charged with protecting our country believe there is a threat to the nation, they are allowed to issue an emergency authorization to get the information they need right away, and then they can go back and get the warrant approved after the fact. nobody is talking about eliminating that emergency authority. so what we have is a program that the most authoritative antiterror experts in the country believe does not make our nation any safer. i read the most significant finding in their report. on top of that, as i just indicated, emergency authorities are still preserved. in fact, i have indicated to our president and to those who work in the intelligence agencies that if at any point the executive branch and, particularly, the intelligence agencies feel that their emergency authorities are inadequate to protect the country, i personally would be willing to support efforts to ensure that those emergency capabilities are reformed and our country can take the steps it needs when it is necessary. on top of this question, with respect to the issue of our safety, i want to talk about what i heard at some length earlier today with respect to how the program worked. i heard a number of senators say that nobody in government is listening to these calls. that was repeated a number of times on the floor of this body. when the government, under this program, knows whom you called, when you called, and where you called from, in many instances the government doesn't need to be listening. if the government knows, under this program, that a person called a psychiatrist 3 times in 36 hours--twice after midnight--that is a lot of private and personal information. the government doesn't need to be listening to that call. so as to this notion that some who have wanted to make sure that our country would have both security and liberty are saying that it is a fantasy that the government is listening to calls, i could tell you that those who have been trying to reform the program have said, in effect, that the government doesn't need to listen to those calls. if the government has that amount of private and personal information, the government knows a lot about you, and it really doesn't need to listen. certainly, if you are talking about a land line, then the government knows where you are calling from if they have a phone book. so with respect to this question of the government listening, i want it particularly understood that a program such as this, when the government has this kind of information, i believe, represents a threat to our liberty. the reason why i think so is that hardly a week goes by when databases aren't violated. no. 1, we see that reported regularly in the press. no. 2, we have known about unfortunate times in our history--j. edgar hoover comes to mind--when this kind of information could be used. and, no. 3, i have been very concerned, given what our former colleague, senator udall, and i had to do with respect to bulk phone record collection of email. we battled to end this. of course, this was email that could be read by government agencies. we battled with various intelligence leaders saying that we felt this was a violation of people's rights and it wasn't effective. they asserted for months and months that it was. finally, one day they woke up and said the program wasn't needed any more. none of this would have even happened had not senator udall and i made that case repeatedly. the intelligence leadership knew that we were not going to give it up, but that is what goes on if there isn't a check on some of these kinds of procedures. senator paul made mention of the fact that the intelligence leadership has not exactly been straight with the american people on these issues. i emphasize that we are not talking about the thousands and thousands of law-abiding patriotic, dedicated, wonderful people who work in the intelligence field. day in and day out they do so much for our country. we are so appreciative of all they do. they are the ones who do the hard work, for example, to capture bin laden and day in and day out to make us safer. but the intelligence leadership, on the other hand, as noted by our colleague from kentucky, has not always been straight with the american people. i spent many months trying to decipher what the former nsa director meant when he said the government doesn't collect any dossiers on millions of americans. i pointed out i had been on the intelligence committee for a long time and i had never heard the term ``dossier'' used. so i tried to learn more about it, used private opportunities and public opportunities, and just couldn't get the information. so, finally, i said: i have to ask this question in public. on the intelligence committee you don't get but perhaps 20 or 25 minutes a year to ask questions in public, to hold intelligence leaders accountable [[page s3337]] on policy matters--not secret operations, because secret operations have to stay secret, but policy matters. so, after being stonewalled for many months--many months--i finally said i have to ask this question in public. so to make sure no one would feel ambushed, i sent the question to the director of national intelligence, mr. clapper. i sent it a day ahead of time. then i didn't hear anything about its being inappropriate or in violation of classification rules. so i asked in public: does the government collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of americans? i was told no, and that answer was obviously false. i tried to get it corrected, and we still couldn't get it corrected. of course, then mr. snowden spoke out publicly and pointed that out. since that time, the director of national intelligence and his representatives have given these five different explanations for why that answer was given. so that is why you have to ask the hard questions. you have to ask the hard questions about these issues. i see my friend and colleague senator heinrich has joined us tonight. i am so pleased that he has joined the intelligence committee. senator heinrich is one of those senators who subscribes to that view that i just mentioned--that it is our job to ask the hard questions. it may be uncomfortable. it is not designed in any way to convey disrespect. we see it as our job to ask the hard questions. i would be interested in my colleague's thoughts with respect to this issue and to have him be given a chance to participate in this colloquy. the presiding officer (mr. johnson). without objection, it is so ordered. mr. heinrich. first, i thank my friend from oregon and i recognize the substantial leadership he has shown on this issue over the years. long before i came to the intelligence committee and long before edward snowden began to steal documents, senator wyden, along with senator mark udall and others, were doing everything they could--without disclosing classified information--to shine a light on the fact that the u.s. government was collecting massive volumes of data on millions of law-abiding american citizens. my friend from oregon deserves our thanks for that leadership. now, after the bulk call data collection program was revealed to the public, the government, frankly, defended it and defended it vigorously. it took a number of months for the intelligence community and the rest of the administration to take a deep breath and really assess whether bulk metadata collection was necessary, whether it was effective, and to consider whether there were other less intrusive, more constitutionally grounded ways to accomplish these same goals. starting with the president's review group on intelligence and communications technologies, the administration began to agree that ``some of the authorities that were expanded or created in the aftermath of september 11 unduly sacrifice fundamental interests in individual liberty, personal privacy, and democratic governance.'' and they recommended changing those authorities in order to ``strike a better balance between the competing interests and providing for the common defense and securing `the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.' '' following that, multiple efforts have been made to update and reform fisa and to update and reform the usa patriot act. none of those have been successful. but now we are forced to come to a resolution through a combination of, frankly, procrastination, and, i think, misguided hope that the american people would look the other way while the government continued to vacuum up and store their personal information and data as part of a program that even the intelligence community acknowledges can be accomplished through less intrusive means. i will be honest. the current usa freedom act isn't what i consider perfect. for example, i prefer that it include strong reform of section 702 collection, but i accept that circumstances require us to be pragmatic, require us to govern and move forward and to work with one another in both parties to find compromise. that is what the usa freedom act is. it is a product of bipartisan compromise. that is why it passed the house of representatives by a vote of 338 to 88. and let's be blunt, many of those who voted against it didn't do so because they support bulk collection. they did so because they want to see section 215 wither and die in its entirety. that is the political reality we face today, and we need to accept it rather than demanding a continuation of a program that the appeals court has determined is illegal. mr. wyden. i thank my colleague for his statements and would just want to explore this a little bit further. i hope that those who are following this debate understand that my colleague from new mexico is a real rising star in the senate. he and i would like the usa freedom act to go further, and we both worked together on legislation that would make additional reforms. certainly, our colleagues on the intelligence committee and here in the senate can expect to see us continuing to work together to advance these additional reforms over the coming months and years. for now, the two of us are saying we ought to support the usa freedom act and then move on--move on to other critical areas. i particularly want to see closed what is called the backdoor search loophole, which my colleague from new mexico talked about. what this means, colleagues, is that when you are engaged in a lawful search of someone who is a threat overseas, pursuant to section 702 of the foreign intelligence surveillance act, very often law-abiding americans can get swept up in this search and have their emails looked at. this is a problem today, and my view is it is likely to be a growing concern in the future because, increasingly, communications systems around the world are becoming globally integrated, so the amount of emails that are reviewed of americans is likely to grow. but we can't get that change here tonight. so, as my colleague from new mexico has mentioned, the usa freedom act would make several worthwhile reforms, such as increasing transparency, reducing the government's reliance on secret laws. but from my perspective, the centerpiece of it is ending the bulk collection of americans' information under the patriot act. i have been trying to close this particular loophole for close to a decade now. some of our colleagues have said the bulk collection has never been abused; that no one's rights have been violated. my own view is--and i will ask what my colleague thinks--that vacuuming up all this information, particularly when databases get violated all the time--we have seen historically instances where there has been improper conduct by the government. i believe dragnet surveillance violates the rights of millions of our people every day. vacuuming up the private phone records of millions of americans with no connection to wrongdoing is simply a violation of their rights. and vacuuming up americans' email records, which i pointed out before my colleague came to the floor--which he and our former colleague senator udall and i battled--is surely a violation of the rights of americans as well. colleagues, that wouldn't have been pointed out at all--it wouldn't have been pointed out at all--unless senator udall and i, with the help of our friend from new mexico, hadn't been pushing back on it. finally, one day the government said: well, we will get rid of it because it wasn't effective. they got rid of it because they saw they were going to get hard questions, the kinds of questions my friend from new mexico has been asking. now, with respect to the legality of this program, i know my colleague and i actually filed a legal brief, along with our former colleague mark udall, when the court of appeals for the second circuit was examining that program. in our brief, it was argued that we were able to debunk many of the claims that had been made about the effectiveness of the program. i think it would be helpful if my colleague from new mexico laid out some of that analysis here tonight. i would ask the senator from new mexico to begin, and i would encourage him to start by addressing the claim that the bulk collection of americans' phone records is essential for stopping terrorist attacks. my question to my colleague is, is there any evidence, any [[page s3338]] real concrete evidence, to support that claim? mr. heinrich. i thank my friend from oregon and begin by saying that despite what we may have heard from talking heads on the sunday shows and on the cable news networks, the answer is no. there is simply no evidence to support those claims. when this mass surveillance was first revealed to the public 2 years ago, the executive branch initially responded to questions like this by claiming that various post-9/11 authorities had resulted in the thwarting of approximately ``54 terrorist events in the u.s. homeland and abroad.'' now, a number of us, including my friend from oregon and my former colleague from colorado, senator udall, began to pull on that thread to really parse down and see just what the executive branch was talking about. first, of those 54 terrorist events, it turned out that only 13 were actually focused in the united states. but more importantly, those numbers conflated multiple different programs, including authorities under section 215 and different authorities under section 702. on june 19, 2013, my colleague from oregon and senator udall pointed out that ``it appears that the bulk phone records collection program under section 215 of the usa patriot act played little or no role in most of these disruptions. saying that `these programs' have disrupted `dozens of potential terrorist plots' is misleading if the bulk phone records collection program is actually providing little or no unique value.'' of the original 54 instances the executive branch pointed to, every one of them crumbled under scrutiny. none of them actually justified the continued existence of the bulk collection program. let me take a moment, with the indulgence of our colleagues, and read what was written by judge leon of the district court for the district of columbia, when he ruled in the klayman v. obama case. this is a little long, but i think it is important this be part of the official record of this debate. judge leon writes: [t]he government does not cite a single instance in which analysis of the nsa's bulk metadata collection actually stopped an imminent attack, or otherwise aided the government in achieving any objective that was time-sensitive in nature. in fact, none of the three ``recent episodes'' cited by the government that supposedly ``illustrate the role that telephony metadata analysis can play in preventing and protecting against terrorist attack'' involved any apparent urgency. he continues to write that: []in the first example, the fbi learned of a terrorist plot still ``in its early stages'' and investigated that plot before turning to the metadata ``to ensure that all potential connections were identified.'' []assistant director holley does not say that the metadata revealed any new information-- much less time-sensitive information--that had not already come to light in the investigation up to that point. the judge continues: []in the second example, it appears that the metadata analysis was used only after the terrorist was arrested ``to establish [his] foreign ties and put them in context with his u.s. based planning efforts.'' []and in the third, the metadata analysis ``revealed a previously unknown number for [a] co-conspirator . . . and corroborated his connection to [the target of the investigation] as well as to other u.s.- based extremists.'' continuing to quote judge leon: []again, there is no indication that these revelations were immediately useful or that they prevented an impending attack. assistant director holley even concedes that bulk metadata analysis only ``sometimes provides information earlier than the fbi's other investigative methods and techniques.'' finally, judge leon writes: []given the limited record before me at this point in the litigation--most notably, the utter lack of evidence that a terrorist attack has ever been prevented because of searching the nsa database was faster than other investigative tactics--i have serious doubts about the efficacy of the metadata collection program as a means of conducting time- sensitive investigations in cases involving imminent threats of terrorism. that is where the judge leaves off. and i will turn back to the senator from oregon to address the three cases we discussed in more detail in our amicus brief to the second circuit. mr. wyden. i thank my colleague. the first of these examples--and they really are kind of overblown examples about the effectiveness of bulk collection--is the case of an individual named najibullah zazi. mr. zazi was a known terrorism suspect, and a number of people have suggested that bulk phone records collection was somehow essential to stopping him because a query of the bulk phone records database for numbers linked to mr. zazi returned a previously unknown number belonging to another terrorism suspect. however, since the government had already identified zazi as a terrorism suspect prior to querying the bulk phone records database, it had all the evidence it needed to obtain the phone records of zazi and his associates using an individualized section 215 order or other legal authorities. in the second case, some have pointed to mr. moalin, the san diego man convicted of sending $8,500 to support al-shabaab in somalia. the intelligence community has indicated that information from the bulk phone records database ``established a connection between a phone number known to be used by an extremist overseas . . . and an unknown san diego-based number'' that belonged to mr. moalin. yet there are ample existing authorities under which the united states can conduct surveillance on a phone number known to be used by extremists overseas and other phone numbers in contact with that phone number. the argument that mr. moalin's case is an example of a unique value of bulk phone records collection is just not accurate. my view is this is yet another case that offers a misleading exaggeration with respect to the effectiveness of bulk phone records collection. finally, several supporters of the bulk metadata program have claimed that ``[i]f we had had [the bulk phone-records] program in place at the time [of the september 11, 2001 attacks,] we would have been able to identify'' the phone number of one of the hijackers, khalid al-mihdhar. just as in these other cases, however, the record indicates that mr. mihdhar's phone number could also have been obtained by the government using a variety of alternate means. before september 11, the government was surveilling a safe house in yemen but failed to realize that mr. mihdhar, who was in contact with the safe house, was actually inside the united states. the government could have used any number of authorities to determine whether anyone in our country was in contact with the safe house it was already targeting. it didn't need a record of every americans' phone calls to establish that simple connection. mr. heinrich. i wish to expound on that point a bit, about the many other ways the government can legitimately acquire phone records of terrorism suspects, because i think this is a very important point to understand the tools that already exist that have been very effective and have proven themselves over time. there are actually a number of legal authorities that can get the same information without the government collecting billions of call records--billions of call records that, in large part, belong to innocent americans. for example, the stored communications act permits the government to obtain precisely the same call records that are now acquired through bulk collection under section 215 when they are ``relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.'' additionally, national security letters, which i point out do not require a court order, can also be used by the government to obtain call records for intelligence purposes. further, the government can also acquire telephony metadata on a real-time basis by obtaining orders from either regular federal courts or the fisc for the installation of pen registers or trap-and-trace devices. finally, individualized orders for phone records, as opposed to orders authorizing broad bulk collection, can also be obtained under section 215. i think those of us early in this debate thought that was what was going to occur under the patriot act in the first place. but that is what the usa freedom act seeks to require while prohibiting the bulk collection of millions of personal records. it even includes emergency authorization authority for the government to get records prior to getting court approval, subject to later court approval, in an emergency. the government can use any of these authorities without any more evidence [[page s3339]] than what is currently required to use the bulk phone records database, with less impact, i would point out, on the privacy interests of millions of innocent americans. i think at this point the senator from oregon and i have laid out our case as to why this dragnet bulk surveillance program fails to make our country measurably safer and why it should end. i am pleased to say that a number of people have finally come around to our way of thinking on this. mr. wyden. i thank my colleague. i will wrap up and then give the last word to my friend from new mexico on the subject. he is absolutely right that some of the most authoritative leaders in our country-- experts on terror--have reached the same judgment we have. i made mention of the president's review group on intelligence and communications technologies, and i really would encourage colleagues who are following this debate and citizens across the country--that report is available online, and it is available in our office. page 104 of that report is very explicit. it says that the information that would otherwise be obtained in collecting all of these phone records-- millions of phone records of law-abiding americans, people such as mike morell, former acting director of the cia, and richard clark, who served in two administrations--they said it could have been obtained through conventional processes. this is a program that is not making us safer. and it is not my judgment that ought to be the last word; it should be that of people like those i just quoted. the privacy and civil liberties oversight board's report on the telephone records program said pretty much the same thing: [t]he section 215 program has shown minimal value in safeguarding the nation from terrorism. based on the information provided to the board, including classified briefings and documentation, we have not identified a single instance involving a threat to the united states in which the program made a concrete difference in the outcome of a counterterrorism investigation. i will close by way of saying--and i touched on this before my friend from new mexico arrived--i would like to do a lot more than i believe is likely to happen here quickly in the senate. i do want to see us finally throw in the dustbin of history this bulk phone records collection program because it doesn't make us safer and it compromises our liberty. but, as i indicated to my friend from new mexico, i would also like to close this backdoor search loophole in the fisa act, which is going to be a bigger problem in the days ahead given the evolution of communications systems and how they have become globally integrated. i will close by saying that one of the most important issues we are going to have to tackle in the days ahead is going to deal with encryption. encryption, of course, is the encoding of data and messages so that they cannot be easily read. the reason this will be an enormously important issue--and my colleague and i have talked about this--is because of the nsa overreach, the collection of all these phone records of law-abiding people. a lot of our most innovative, cutting-edge companies have found their customers raising real questions about whether their products can be used safely, and a lot of the purchasers who buy their products around the world are saying: maybe we shouldn't trust them. maybe we should try to start taking control over their servers and have local storage requirements and that sort of thing. so what our companies did, because they saw the effect of the overreach by the nsa, was they started to use encryption to protect the data and messages of the consumers who buy their products. most recently, the head of the fbi, mr. comey, rather than try to come back with a solution that protected both our privacy and our security, he said he was interested in requiring companies to build weaknesses into their products. just think about that--requiring companies to build weaknesses into their products. so the government-- which, in effect, caused this problem with the overreach--in effect, rather than trying to find a solution that worked for both security and liberty, said: we will start talking about requiring companies to actually build weaknesses into their products. i and others have pointed out that once you do that, hang on to your hat. when the good guys have the keys, that is one thing, but when companies are required to build weaknesses into their products, the bad guys are going to get the keys in a hurry, too. and with all the cyber hacking and the risks we already have, we ought to be really careful about going where mr. comey, our fbi director, has proposed to go. but that is not for tonight. tonight is not an occasion where we will be able to, on a bipartisan basis, close the backdoor-search loophole or where we will be able to come up with a sensible policy with respect to encryption rather than requiring companies to actually build weaknesses in their products. we will not be able to do that tonight. but we will now have a chance here in the senate to take steps that have been bipartisan both here in the senate and in the other body, in the house of representatives, to end the bulk phone records collection program because it doesn't make us safer and it threatens our liberties. i always like to close by thinking about ben franklin, who said that anybody who gives up their liberty to have security really doesn't deserve either. i am so pleased to have a chance to serve with my colleague from new mexico on the intelligence committee, who is going to be a thoughtful advocate for these kinds of policies, in my view, for many years to come. i thank him for his involvement tonight and would be happy to give him the last word of our colloquy at this time. i yield to my colleague. mr. heinrich. i thank my friend from oregon. i think he could not have chosen a more appropriate way to end than to reference what ben franklin said so many years ago, that great quote that ``those who would give up essential liberty, to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.'' while many reforms still lie in front of us, i think, as we move forward to approving the usa freedom act, we move a lot closer to the balance that ben franklin articulated so well over 200 years ago. i look forward to working with my colleague from oregon and all of our colleagues in achieving that balance and standing up for our constituents. mr. wyden. mr. president, i yield the floor. mr. leahy. mr. president, we did not have to end up here, just hours away from the midnight expiration of three surveillance authorities, and having just moved to proceed to the usa freedom act. i have tried since last year to move legislation through the senate to address these sunsets. in november, senator reid brought the usa freedom act to the floor but the republican leadership of the senate blocked debate on it. when they took over the senate, they assured us that they would send bills--including this one--through appropriate committee process. there were promises that the new leadership would not fill the amendment tree, and would use a transparent legislative process. but not one of those promises has been fulfilled with respect to any legislation dealing with the upcoming sunsets. once again this year, i proposed with senator lee a new version of the usa freedom act. that bill had significant process in the house, where it passed by an overwhelming margin earlier this month. and once again, the bipartisan coalition here in the senate tried to get the bill passed. two fridays ago, the senate republican leadership did not allow us to debate the bill. tonight, the senate did the right thing by invoking cloture on the motion to proceed to the usa freedom act. i am glad to see several republicans switched their votes. this is significant progress, but it is late in coming. we should have proceeded to this bill two fridays ago. had we done so, we could have stayed here to do our work, considered amendments, and passed the bill well in advance of tonight's sunset. instead, we are hours away from expiration and just now considering legislation that many of us have been working on for years. our intelligence community needs predictability and certainty, not a manufactured crisis. if all senators cooperate, we can finish this bill tonight. we can consider a [[page s3340]] handful of amendments under a time agreement, and pass this bill before midnight. that would be the responsible thing to do. mr. barrasso. mr. president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. mcconnell. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer

EDWARD BROWN Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I wish to recognize C. Edward ``Ed'' Brown, FACHE, on his election to the American Medical Group Association's Policy Hall of Fame. Ed has a long track record in Iowa and Washington as a leading advocate in health care policy reform. He also served in numerous leadership roles at the American Medical Group Association, chairing its public policy committee for 4 years and serving as chairman of its board. Mr. Brown has had a distinguished career in health care in Iowa, where he has served for the last 21 years as chief executive officer of the Iowa Clinic, a multispecialty group practice in Des Moines. The Iowa Clinic is the largest physician-owned multispecialty group in central Iowa, with nearly 200 physicians and health care providers practicing in 40 specialties. The clinic serves a population area of 1.1 million, averaging 400,000 patient visits each year. Ed has a long list of achievements in delivering cutting edge, quality-focused health care to the benefit of Iowans, and his achievements include the Iowa Clinic's adoption of electronic medical records and information technology systems. He holds a bachelor's degree in nursing from the University of Evansville and a master's degree in health administration from Washington University in St. Louis. Also, he is a fellow of the American College of Healthcare Executives, with more than 30 years of experience in executive and senior levels of health care management. As an advocate for multispecialty medical groups and AMGA, Ed has been a leader in promoting a model of care delivery and an organization that represents some of the Nation's highest quality and most prestigious health care delivery systems. It is wonderful to see someone with such a distinguished health care record in Iowa recognized at the national level as a dedicated leader who is committed to improving health care at such an important time for our Nation's health care delivery system. Ed's voice has been an invaluable contribution to the health care debate in this country, and I congratulate him on this deserved recognition for his countless achievements in the public policy realm. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 85 (Sunday, May 31, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S3341] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS ______ TRIBUTE TO C.
