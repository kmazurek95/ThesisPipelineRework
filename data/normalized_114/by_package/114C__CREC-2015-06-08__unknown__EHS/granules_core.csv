CREC-2015-06-08-pt1-PgS3849-5,CREC-2015-06-08,114,JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 90 (Monday, June 8, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S3849-S3850] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS Mr. REID. Madam President, a few days ago, the majority leader was reported to have declared to a conservative talk-radio show that under his leadership, the Republican Senate will shirk its constitutional duties by not continuing to confirm judges--period. He went on to say: We may confirm a few that come from States where only Republicans give the President the names, but other than that, we are going to do none. I assume this is accurate. I hope it is not, but I assume that it is. It would be a very stunning and disappointing declaration that the senior Senator from Kentucky, especially since he argued for the fair consideration of President Bush's court nominees, would now switch his position. In July of 2008, here is what he said: ``Even with lameduck Presidents, there is a historical standard of fairness as to confirming judicial nominees, especially circuit court nominees.'' That is a direct quote from the majority leader. These are his words. Not a single word has been made up. That is what he said: ``Even with lameduck presidents, there is a historical standard of fairness as to confirming judicial nominees, especially circuit court nominees.'' And the record is spread with many quotes he has given just the same. He also said in that same year: ``No party is without blame in the confirmation process, but what is going on now--or, more accurately, what is not going on--is yet another step backward in politicizing the confirmation process--something we had all hoped that we would get beyond.'' Earlier my friend from Kentucky said: ``Judicial nominations need to be treated fairly and commitments need to be kept.'' And even earlier than that, here is what he said: ``On the issue of judicial confirmations, the majority leader and I discussed this matter publicly at the beginning of the Congress''--he is saying that he and I are talking--``and we agreed that President Bush, in the last 2 years of his term, should be treated as well as President Reagan, Bush 41, and President Clinton were treated in the last 2 years of their tenures in office because there was one common thread, and that was that the Senate was controlled by the opposition party.'' So what he is saying there is that what he wanted was for Bush to be treated the same way that Bush 1, President Reagan, and President Clinton had been treated. He got that with large numbers of judges being appointed. So we are here now with the statements ringing loudly that the majority leader is intent on writing off the Senate's constitutional duty of offering our advice and consent now that President Obama is nominating individuals to the Federal bench. The Republican leader is a student of the Senate. He says he is, and I believe that. I am confident that he understands that the Senate cannot and should not neglect the constitutional obligations we have. The Senate cannot simply ignore critical vacancies in the last 2 years of any President's term--what a bad standard to set, especially with the growth in certain communities. We have a number of judicial emergencies that have been determined. It is all the more troubling that the majority leader wants to pick an unnecessary fight over judges just as Republican Senators are working with the President to fill vacancies in their States. The majority leader is essentially telling other Senators that their judicial recommendations simply don't matter--Democrats, Independents, Republicans. The majority leader is telling the chairman of the Judiciary Committee that regardless of the judicial nominations his committee continues to report out, they could be blocked on the Senate floor. But I do say this just as a caveat: The present Judiciary Committee is doing the same thing that was done by the present chairman of the Finance Committee when he was chair of the [[Page S3850]] Judiciary Committee. He didn't have to worry about a lot of names on the calendar because he simply held no hearings in the Judiciary Committee. The same situation is prevailing now. So we don't have a lot of people on the calendar because they are not having any hearings to speak of in the Judiciary Committee. I have spoken here on the floor before about the nomination of Felipe Restrepo for the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia. After repeated, repeated, and repeated delays, the committee is finally considering his nomination on Wednesday. He has been waiting for months. This is an incredibly qualified nominee who enjoys vast bipartisan support, including both Pennsylvania Senators, one a Democrat and one a Republican. The Republican Senator from Pennsylvania has said that Judge Restrepo would be a ``superb addition to the Third Circuit.'' In that case we have waited months to even have a hearing. So it must have been shocking for the junior Senator from Pennsylvania to learn that his judicial pick would face another delay-- a delay indefinitely, perhaps. This is a blatant rejection of the Senate's constitutional duties. Just as Senator McConnell argued for fairness for President Bush's nominations, it is not unreasonable for Democrats to expect that same measure of fairness that President Bush got in the 110th Congress. Regardless of whether a State had two Democrats, two Republicans or a split delegation, Senate Democrats brought President Bush's nominees up for a vote. By this point in the seventh year of George W. Bush's Presidency, Senate Democrats confirmed 18 judges, including 3 circuit court judges. In almost 6 months, the Republican Senate has only confirmed four district court judges. To put this in perspective, during the Presidency of Bush, we confirmed four in 1 month. So perhaps the majority leader's comments about a judicial slowdown were just confirming what he has already done to block the President's nominees. I repeat. The committee is being run the same way that the present chair of the Finance Committee did when he was chair of the Judiciary Committee--just holding no hearings. That way, there is nobody on the calendar--or very few. The Republican Senate hasn't confirmed even a single circuit court judge--not even a consensus nominee such as Kara Stoll to the Federal Circuit. She was reported out of committee by a voice vote in April. Nothing so far--they are not even having hearings, I repeat, on most nominees. Therefore, there is no one to report to the floor. Actions speak louder than words, and the majority leader can demonstrate that his remarks were misinterpreted--and I would certainly hope so--by scheduling a prompt vote on the Stoll nomination. We should schedule a vote on her nomination no later than this week. Kara Stoll is the only appeals court judge awaiting a vote before the Senate. For the reasons I have just said, people have been in the pipeline, but they won't hold hearings. Both of these nominations--Restrepo and Stoll--need a vote now. Let's hope the majority leader will reflect upon his past statements about fair consideration of judicial nominees, in comparison to what he said on a talk show--I guess appealing to the rightwing even more than what has happened recently, and that is quite a bit. Let's hope he does not treat judicial nominees as they have never been treated before. Let's hope that the Senate will quickly confirm at least these two qualified judges. We need a lot more, but these two would be a step in the right direction. I note there is no one on the floor, and I ask that the Chair announce the business of the day. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 90 (Monday, June 8, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S3849-S3850] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS Mr. REID.

Madam President, I note with some interest over the weekend in the New York Times that ``Russia Wields Aid and Ideology Against West to Fight Sanctions.'' On the front page of the New York Times: The war in Ukraine that has pitted Russia against the West is being waged not just with tanks, artillery and troops. Increasingly, Moscow has brought to bear different kinds of weapons, according to American and European officials: Money, ideology, and disinformation. Yesterday and today in the Wall Street Journal: ``Iraqis Call for a Deeper Overhaul of Army.'' Also: ``Mistrust of military leadership among troops is widespread in crisis of confidence.'' Right below that: ``Airstrikes Kill Dozens as Fighting in Yemen Intensifies.'' The reporting of a world in turmoil, as described by my friend Lindsey Graham as on fire, continues. To top it all off, today, speaking to reporters at the G7 summit in Germany, President Obama said: ``We don't yet have a complete strategy about how to combat ISIS.'' I would remind my colleagues that on August 28, 2014, nearly a year ago, President Obama stated: ``We don't have a strategy yet to fight ISIS in Iraq and in Syria.'' My friends, nearly a year after the President said we don't have a strategy yet to fight ISIS in Iraq and in Syria, he said again: We don't yet have a complete strategy about how to combat ISIS. [[Page S3851]] I would like to see the incomplete strategy. I would like to see something. I would not like to see continue that 75 percent of the combat missions that are flown in Iraq and Syria return to base without firing a weapon because we don't have forward air controllers on the ground. When is this administration going to figure out that if we want to destroy the enemy, we have to be able to identify the enemy, and that requires forward air controllers on the ground and that means U.S. troops. I know that whenever I and some others say we need additional U.S. troops, people recoil and say, Oh, no, here we go again. Well, what is going on now is ISIS is succeeding. Bashar Assad is hanging on. Iran is on the move. They now dominate four countries: Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Lebanon. And the President of the United States says we don't yet have a complete strategy. Well, the Pentagon is a pretty big place. There are hundreds of people who work for the National Security Advisor, and somehow, nearly a year later, we don't yet have a strategy? Wow. ISIS goes from house to house in Ramadi with lists of names and they execute people and they kill 3-year-old children and they burn their bodies in the streets. And the atrocities in Syria continue as Bashar Assad barrel-bombs innocent men, women, and children--barrel bombs, by the way, supplied by Iran and Russia--and we don't yet have a ``complete strategy.'' Well, I have never seen the world in more crises, nor has Henry Kissinger, nor have most other longtime observers of our Nation and the world. I urge my colleagues to take a look at a map of the Middle East from January of 2009, when President Obama was sworn in as President of the United States, and look at that same map today and color in where there is ISIS, where there is Iranian domination, where there is conflict, and where there is a complete lack, except in the State of Israel, of democratization or the kinds of freedoms the United States of America stands for. All I can say is one has to wonder whether this President just wants to wait out the next year and a half and basically do nothing to stop this genocide, blood-letting, and the horrible things that are happening throughout the Middle East, where, in the view of the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Director of the CIA, they say, as far as ISIS is concerned, they pose a threat to the security of the United States. Why do they say that? Obviously, because these thousands of young men who have gone to Syria and Iraq and are being radicalized and trained are going to go back to where they came from. Everybody knows that. On the day Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, left our Camp Bucca--where he spent 4 years along with about 25,000 others--he said to the Americans: We will see you in New York. Mr. Baghdadi is not known for his sense of humor. What we are trying to do in this legislation that is before the Senate is to provide the means, the training, the equipment, the care for the men and women, and the much needed reforms that I have been over and will continue to go over, whether it be in retirement, whether it be in acquisition, whether it be in a number of other areas of the Department of Defense and the way we defend this Nation. That is, in my view, long, long overdue. Now we see the President of the United States threatening to veto this legislation, if it gets through the House and the Senate, over the issue of OCO. That, as my colleagues know, is overseas contingency operations, which began with the conflicts in Afghanistan and in Iraq as a means of providing additional funds to pay for and fund the operations in those countries as the name implies-- overseas contingency operations. I have opposed sequestration. I think it is a terrible thing to inflict on the men and women who are serving in the military, much less on our national security. I agree with our uniformed leaders, every one of whom has testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that if we continue sequestration, it puts the lives of the men and women who are serving in the military at greater risk. I don't know of a greater obligation that we have than to prevent putting the lives of the young men and women who have volunteered to serve this country at greater risk. But that has been lost on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. So now we have the OCO, and it funds the defense of this country at the levels the President requested. I don't like it. I don't like it because it can only give them 1 year of planning. What the military really needs is to be able to plan for at least 5 years ahead of time. We can't build new weapons and new ships and new airplanes on a year- to-year basis. But it is better than the sequestration, which, as I said, increases the threat to this Nation's security. Last week, the White House issued a Statement of Administration Policy threatening to veto this national security legislation. The threat hardly comes as a surprise. After all, the President has threatened to veto, for some reason or another, every Defense authorization bill since 2011. The White House's compilation of complaints is long, but it is woefully short on substance. The Statement of Administration Policy makes clear that the true basis for the administration's veto threat has nothing to do with defense. Objecting to the use of $38 billion in overseas contingency operation funds--or OCO--to meet the President's request of $612 billion, the statement said the President ``will not fix defense without fixing nondefense spending.'' It is incomprehensible that as America confronts the most diverse and complex array of crises around the world since the end of World War II, that a President of the United States, who has not yet been able to come up with a ``complete strategy'' for the challenges we face, would veto funding for our military to prove a political point. The threats we confront today are far more serious than they were a year ago and significantly more so since the Congress passed the Budget Control Act in 2011. That legislation arbitrarily capped defense spending and established the mindless mechanism of sequestration which was triggered in 2013. As a result, with worldwide threats rising, we as a nation are on a course to cut nearly $1 trillion of defense spending over 10 years. Every single military and national security leader who has testified before the Armed Services Committee this year has denounced sequestration and urged its repeal as soon as possible. This legislation doesn't end sequestration, unfortunately. Believe me, our committee would have done so if the NDAA were capable of it, but it is not. The NDAA is a policy bill. This legislation is a policy bill. It is the appropriators who deal with the money. It only deals with defense issues, and it doesn't spend a dollar. It provides the Department of Defense and the men and women in uniform with the authorities and support they need to defend the Nation. It fully supports President Obama's budget request of $612 billion for national defense, which is $38 billion above the spending caps established by the Budget Control Act. Let me repeat that. The legislation gives the President every dollar of budget authority he requested. The difference is that this legislation follows the Senate budget resolution, which was voted on time after time all night long and was agreed to by both Houses of Congress. It is the Senate budget resolution. Now, this is not my preferred option, as I said. That is why the committee included a special transfer authority in this legislation that allows the Department of Defense to transfer the additional $38 billion from OCO to the base budget in the event legislation is enacted that increases the statutory limits on discretionary defense and nondefense spending in proportionately equal amounts. This was the product of a bipartisan compromise, and it was the most we could do in the Defense authorization bill to recognize the need for a broader physical agreement without denying funding for our military right now. Here on the floor we have heard a number of misconceptions about OCO funding, many of which have been fed by this administration's rhetoric. While OCO is not the ideal way to budget our defense, technical and budgetary consequences to using OCO funding have been greatly exaggerated. OCO is authorized and appropriated on an annual basis, just like base funding. OCO funding is allocated to the same [[Page S3852]] DOD accounts as base funding. In fact, the Defense bill purposely placed the additional $38 billion of OCO funding in the same accounts and activities for which the President himself requested the money. These activities have historically had a large share of OCO funding, and the account has been designated by the President as OCO eligible in the past, and there are no laws that make OCO funding expire any differently than base funding. The White House threat to veto this legislation and the desire for increases in nondefense spending are misguided and irresponsible. With global threats rising, it simply makes no sense to oppose a defense policy bill--legislation that spends no money but is full of vital authorities that our troops need--for a reason that has nothing to do with national defense spending. The NDAA should not be treated as a hostage in budget negotiation. The political reality is that the Budget Control Act, which the President signed, remains the law of the land. So faced with a choice between OCO money and no money, I choose OCO, and multiple senior military leaders testified before the Armed Services Committee this year that they would make the same choice for one simple reason: This is $38 billion of real money that our military desperately needs and without which our top military leaders have said they cannot succeed. The bottom line is this. The NDAA authorized $612 billion for national defense. This is the amount requested by the President and justified by his own national security strategy. If the President and some of my colleagues oppose the Defense bill due to concerns over nondefense spending, I suspect they will have a very difficult time explaining and justifying that choice to Americans who increasingly cite national security as a top concern. The Statement of Administration Policy raises specious concerns with the sweeping defense acquisition reforms in the NDAA. For example, the White House asserted that transferring some acquisition authority back to the services is somehow inconsistent with the Secretary of Defense's exercise of authority, direction, and control over all of the Department of Defense's programs and activities. I could not disagree more with that assertion. What this legislation does is merely switch who does what in certain circumstances from different people who all directly report and serve under the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of Defense. In this legislation, for a limited number of programs to start with, the Secretary of Defense will look to the service Secretaries directly for management of these acquisition programs rather than looking to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, or AT&L. This is not usurpation of the Secretary of Defense's power. It is called streamlining of authorities and reducing layers of unnecessary bureaucracy. There is a section in the legislation that would allow the Secretary of Defense to continue to rely on more layers of management, if he chooses, but only if he certifies to Congress that this makes sense. There simply is not any undermining of the Secretary of Defense's authority in here. Another concern raised has been that the transfer of milestone decision authority to the services would reduce the Secretary of Defense's ability--through AT&L--to guard against unwarranted optimism in program planning and budget formulation. Unwarranted optimism is indeed a plague on acquisition, and there is not a monopoly of that in the services. Nothing in this bill overrides a requirement to use better cost estimates from the Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation. In fact, new incentives and real penalties imposed on the services in this legislation are designed to put some of this optimism in check. Some in the White House and the Department of Defense want to perpetuate the absurd fiction that the current system is working. Even after a wave of 25 program cancellations by former Secretary Gates, all of the programs that are left under AT&L management have over $200 billion in cost overruns. I want to repeat that. Under the supervision of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, there are programs that have over $200 billion in cost overruns. AT&L is trying to have it both ways, claiming credit for the improvements in the acquisition system while blaming the services for its long list of failures. This is exactly the program this legislation is trying to address, blurred lines of accountability inside the Defense Acquisition System that allow its leaders to evade responsibility for results. The reality is that in the modern world the AT&L management process takes too long and costs too much. For example, an Army study looked at the time it would take to go through all of the AT&L reviews and buy nothing. I repeat: To go through all those reviews and buy nothing. What was the answer? Ten years--10 years to buy nothing. The Government Accountability Office looked at the much vaunted milestone reviews that the Office of the Secretary of Defense is touting as a success. Just one review takes on average 2 years. A similar review at the Missile Defense Agency takes about 3 months. Our adversaries are not shuffling paper. They are building weapons systems. It is time for us to do the same. I find it disappointing or maybe just outright laughable that the Statement of Administration Policy expressed concern about the Armed Services Committee's decision to downsize and streamline the bureaucratic overhead of the Pentagon, while at the same time complaining that we are not letting them downsize the fighting forces. Let me repeat. The administration wants to keep more Pentagon bureaucrats while drawing down our forces and cutting military equipment such as fighter aircraft. Is there any Member of this Chamber who believes we should increase the Army staff by 60 percent over a decade, and then turn around and slash our Army brigade combat teams from 45 to 32? Of course not. The administration cites reductions already taking place in headquarters activities, but ignores the fact that the Air Force is trying to achieve those reductions by playing a shell game--creating two new organizations and shifting people around. Moving the deck chairs on the Titanic didn't keep the ship from sinking, and shifting people around in a game of ``hide the headquarters staff'' will not keep our national security from sinking under the weight of bureaucratic empires. As the White House asks the Senate to preserve bloated staffs, the Statement of Administration Policy laments the Committee's effort to address dangerous strike fighter capacity shortfalls across the services. As deliveries of the F-35 have continued to fall short of projections, the Air Force has continued to drain combat power. Senior Air Force officials have repeatedly testified to the alarming reality that their service is the smallest in its history, with readiness at very low levels, all while our airmen perform ongoing combat operations in the Middle East, theater support packages in Eastern Europe, presence and reassurance to our allies in the Asia-Pacific, and maintain a strong strategic nuclear deterrence posture. The misallocation of airpower resources over the past 6 years, coupled with the mismanagement of very expensive aircraft weapons systems procurement programs, places America's national security interests in jeopardy and endangers the lives of our men and women in uniform. Our military commanders know this is true. That is why, for example, the Chief of Naval Operations and the Commandant of the Marine Corps included in their unfunded priorities lists requests for 12 F-18 Super Hornets for the Navy and 6 F-35B Joint Strike Fighters for the Marine Corps. The NDAA funds these requests because senior Navy and Marine Corps leaders have repeatedly testified to significant strike fighter shortfalls in the maritime services due to unanticipated increased combat operations in the Middle East, aging and obsolete fighter aircraft, and significant delays in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter delivery schedule. Bizarrely, the White House has apparently disregarded that testimony and instead labels these requests for more combat power from our military commanders as ``unnecessary.'' The Statement of Administration Policy opposes the strong oversight measures put in place by the NDAA on the Ford-class aircraft carrier program. The administration objects to a [[Page S3853]] provision in this legislation that reduces the cost cap for the USS John F. Kennedy by $100 million from $11.498 billion to $11.398 billion. But in the budget request, the Navy estimated the cost of this ship at $11.348 billion. In other words, the NDAA still provides a buffer of $50 million. The provision simply locks in the savings the Department has advertised, which comes after more than $2 billion in cost growth--$2 billion in cost growth of one aircraft carrier. Unless the budget request is misleading or inaccurate, this provision should not result in reduced capability or a breach of the cost cap as the administration claims. It is also unfortunate that the administration doesn't recognize the importance of conducting full-ship shock trials on the USS Gerald R. Ford, known as CVN-78. With the abundance of new technology, including the catapult, arresting gear, and radar, as well as the reliance on electricity rather than steam to power key systems, there continues to be a great deal of risk in this program. Testing CVN-78 will not only improve the design of future carriers but also reduce the costs associated with retrofitting engineering changes. Absent this provision, the Navy will delay by up to 7 years full-ship shock trials and shift the test from the lead ship in the class to the second ship. That poses the risk that CVN-78 will deploy and potentially fight without this testing, putting the lives of our sailors at risk. The Statement of Administration Policy also raised objections to a number of provisions related to military personnel. For instance, the administration bemoans the fact that the Committee did not adopt its plan to raise existing TRICARE fees and implement new fees for Medicare-eligible retirees and their family members. The so-called Consolidated Health Plans would not have created a modern, value-based health care system. The administration made no attempt at all to improve access to care, quality of care or beneficiary satisfaction. The NDAA, on the other hand, addresses those issues and more without raising enrollment fees or creating new fees. The White House expressed concern about the provisions in the NDAA that call for a plan to privatize commissaries and a 2-year pilot program at no fewer than five commissaries in the largest markets of the commissary system to assess the feasibility and advisability of the plan. But the rationale is confusing. The administration claims that ``there is an independent study underway to determine whether privatization is a feasible option and we should wait for those results prior to making any policy changes.'' The bill did require a comprehensive review in fiscal year 2015 by an independent organization of the management, food, and pricing options of the commissary system. But in that section, there was no requirement to study the feasibility of privatization of the commissary system. It is also curious that the administration warns against implementing a pilot program on privatization before the results of an independent study, while at the same time encouraging the Congress to adopt their own proposed pilot program. The White House's policy statement reflects the President's feckless policy towards Russia. Despite the advice of nearly every statesman and policy expert who has appeared before the Armed Services Committee in recent months--Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Madeleine Albright, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and others--and against the advice of both the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, the President has refused to provide defensive lethal assistance to Ukraine. The President's continued inaction, for fear of provoking Russia, is seen by Putin as weakness and invites the very aggression we seek to avoid. The Ukrainian people aren't asking for U.S. troops. They are simply asking for the right tools to defend themselves and their country, and those are the tools that this legislation would provide. We have seen Vladimir Putin commit aggression, draw back, commit more aggression, draw back. We are now in the phase where any day now we will see continued aggression and territory-grabbing by Vladimir Putin as he establishes his land bridge to Crimea and puts additional pressures on Baltic countries and Moldova. Meanwhile, we refuse to give the Ukrainians weapons with which to defend themselves. This bill does not force the President to provide lethal assistance to Ukraine. Trust me, if there were a way to do that, it would be in this bill. The President has a decision to make on providing lethal assistance to Ukraine. That decision has consequences far beyond whether the President obligates the full amount of funds authorized in a decision that is long overdue. Making matters worse, the Statement of Administration Policy seeks flexibility to continue our Nation's dependence on Russian rocket engines. The NDAA would put an end to this dependence by 2019 and stop hundreds of millions of dollars from going to Vladimir Putin and his cronies. It eliminates a launch subsidy that the commander of Air Force Space Command has stated impedes fair competition, and it directs the administration to stop playing games, develop a domestic rocket engine--not a new rocket system--to replace the Russian RD-180. The Russians are being paid billions of dollars for their rocket engines, and there is a ``middle man'' who has made tens of millions of dollars just by moving those rockets from Russia to the United States. There is an individual who runs this outfit who has been sanctioned by the U.S. Government, and we have elements in the Pentagon who still want to deal with him for as long as possible. In testimony before the Armed Services Committee in March, Gen. John Kelly, the commander of U.S. Southern Command, testified: ``With the amount of drugs and people that move across our southwest border, it doesn't seem all that secure to me.'' General Kelly went on to state that the threat of terrorists crossing our southern border is ``extremely serious'' and that ``if a terrorist or almost anyone wants to get into our country, they just pay the fare.'' They just pay the fare. That is why this bill would provide $45 million for Operation Phalanx, increasing border security operations by the National Guard along the southern border, and boosting aerial surveillance of the region by up to 60 percent. To date, Operation Phalanx has directly contributed to more than 96,000 apprehensions along the border and the interdiction of more than 282,000 pounds of drugs destined for our communities. The legislation directs the Secretary of Defense to provide up to $75 million in additional assistance to Customs and Border Protection operations to secure the southern border, potentially including the deployment of personnel, surveillance assets, and intelligence support from the U.S. military. The NDAA would authorize an additional $50 million to address U.S. Southern Command's unfunded priorities to increase surveillance and interdiction operations in Central America--a primary transit point for illicit trafficking into the United States. Finally, I am disappointed by the administration's puzzling response to provisions in the NDAA related to the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. The administration argues that this legislation's limitations placed on Guantanamo Bay transfers are unnecessary and beyond the scope of congressional authority. That is false. Congress has long had constitutional authority over wartime detention matters, and there are good reasons for Congress to assert its authority in this instance. For over 6 years, the administration has stated that one of its highest policy priorities is to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. But for that same period of time, Members of the Senate have repeatedly requested a plan that explains how the administration will handle each of the detainees currently held there, and unfortunately, over the last 6\1/2\ years, the administration has consistently failed to provide that plan. As the terrorist threat continues around the world and grows and metastasizes, the administration continues to demand that the facility be closed while failing to explain how it will do so. There are serious legal and security challenges inherent in moving this population to other locations, whether inside or outside of the United States. Congress is simply asking the executive branch to explain where it will hold those set for trial, how it will continue to detain dangerous terrorists pursuant to the laws of war, and how it [[Page S3854]] will mitigate the risks of moving this population. If the administration can provide those answers to these basic questions to the satisfaction of the American people, then congressional restrictions on the movement of these detainees will be lifted and the plan can be implemented. Now, Congress's need for answers is even more acute after the administration transferred five senior Taliban detainees under secret agreement to Qatar without prior notification to Congress as required by law. The President of the United States blatantly violated the law-- which required, before these five detainees were transferred to Qatar, that Congress be notified 6 months ahead of time--using the rationale that they were afraid the information might leak. Is that justification for breaking the law? And isn't it understandable, the skepticism here on both sides of the aisle about any plan they may have or may not have? Isn't it reasonable that the Congress of the United States should be presented with a plan, and shouldn't the Congress of the United States express its approval or disapproval? The notification standard was enacted into law to allow the President the authority to implement his stated policy but with a good-faith understanding that the people's representative could weigh in on these important decisions before the transfers happened. The President's failure to abide by the notification provisions undermined any trust Congress had in the process. Now, as the Taliban continues to plot attacks against U.S. servicemembers in Afghanistan, the administration is scurrying to figure out how to keep those five terrorists from the battlefield. This is not congressional overreach; it is congressional oversight. The President has decided that the security risks of keeping Guantanamo open outweigh the security and legal risks of closing it. Congress is seeking information that will allow the American people and Congress to understand that decision. The American people deserve an explanation for how the President plans to execute one of his most repeated policy goals. There is some dispute about what percentage of those who have been released from detention in Guantanamo have reentered the fight. Some say it is as high as 30 percent, and some say it is as low as 7 or 8 percent. There is no debate that detainees who were released from Guantanamo have reentered the fight, placing the lives of American service men and women in jeopardy and in danger. Of course, the five who were released were amongst the toughest, the worst, the hardest cases. Now there is some question as to whether they will remain under strict supervision in Qatar. Let me conclude by simply saying that the NDAA is far too important to be held hostage in a budget negotiation. For 53 consecutive years, the Congress has passed a national defense authorization act. With threats to our national security multiplying around the world, I would hope this year would be no different. I thank my colleague from Rhode Island for all of the hard work he and his staff and Members on that side of the aisle have done in order to have legislation that passed overwhelmingly through the Senate Armed Services Committee. I hope we can move forward on getting that legislation through the Senate, in consultation and in compromise with the House, and to the White House for the President's signature. I would say again that I read carefully the administration's objection to the legislation as it now stands. These are not valid in some cases. In other cases, we would be glad to negotiate with the White House as we go to conference with the House after completing this. I sincerely hope and pray that--there are so many provisions there that are important to the lives of the men and women serving in the military that I would hope the President would take into consideration how important this is to the men and women who are serving, their lives and their welfare, their equipment, their training, and their ability to defend this Nation.

The ranking member and I have asked all of our colleagues to adhere to a filing deadline for first-degree amendments to the bill at 6 p.m. tomorrow, Tuesday. There are several hundred filed amendments already, and those with further amendments should bring them down tomorrow by close of business. I also wish to add, my colleagues, I hope we can agree to the filing deadline. That will be approximately a week that we have been on the bill. I think that, hopefully, will be sufficient time for most of our colleagues or all of our colleagues to have time to file amendments. Senator Reed and I will continue the practice of allowing pending amendments, one on either side. We will be able then to schedule votes on pending amendments as they are, one on either side. I thank Senator Reed, and I hope we can get a lot of debate and discussion. The Reed amendment is a very important amendment. I respect Senator Reed's view on this issue, and we obviously will let the body decide. I do hope our colleagues understand that we have many filed amendments, and we would like to get to as many of them as possible. We would like to have as many Members be able to have their amendments on this bill as they feel necessary. We don't have to emphasize the importance of this legislation. I also look forward to Members coming to the floor tomorrow and debating the Reed amendment. It is a very important amendment, and I think it deserves the views of as many Members as possible, including those who are on the committee. Senator Reed. Mr. REED. The Senator and I concur that we should urge our colleagues to file their amendments. We have several hundred pending, as the chairman pointed out, and we hope that can be accomplished by 6 p.m. tomorrow. We will be debating amendments and then scheduling amendments tomorrow afternoon. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 90 (Monday, June 8, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S3850-S3855] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016 The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I note with some interest over the weekend in the New York Times that ``Russia Wields Aid and Ideology Against West to Fight Sanctions.'' On the front page of the New York Times: The war in Ukraine that has pitted Russia against the West is being waged not just with tanks, artillery and troops. Increasingly, Moscow has brought to bear different kinds of weapons, according to American and European officials: Money, ideology, and disinformation. Yesterday and today in the Wall Street Journal: ``Iraqis Call for a Deeper Overhaul of Army.'' Also: ``Mistrust of military leadership among troops is widespread in crisis of confidence.'' Right below that: ``Airstrikes Kill Dozens as Fighting in Yemen Intensifies.'' The reporting of a world in turmoil, as described by my friend Lindsey Graham as on fire, continues. To top it all off, today, speaking to reporters at the G7 summit in Germany, President Obama said: ``We don't yet have a complete strategy about how to combat ISIS.'' I would remind my colleagues that on August 28, 2014, nearly a year ago, President Obama stated: ``We don't have a strategy yet to fight ISIS in Iraq and in Syria.'' My friends, nearly a year after the President said we don't have a strategy yet to fight ISIS in Iraq and in Syria, he said again: We don't yet have a complete strategy about how to combat ISIS. [[Page S3851]] I would like to see the incomplete strategy. I would like to see something. I would not like to see continue that 75 percent of the combat missions that are flown in Iraq and Syria return to base without firing a weapon because we don't have forward air controllers on the ground. When is this administration going to figure out that if we want to destroy the enemy, we have to be able to identify the enemy, and that requires forward air controllers on the ground and that means U.S. troops. I know that whenever I and some others say we need additional U.S. troops, people recoil and say, Oh, no, here we go again. Well, what is going on now is ISIS is succeeding. Bashar Assad is hanging on. Iran is on the move. They now dominate four countries: Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Lebanon. And the President of the United States says we don't yet have a complete strategy. Well, the Pentagon is a pretty big place. There are hundreds of people who work for the National Security Advisor, and somehow, nearly a year later, we don't yet have a strategy? Wow. ISIS goes from house to house in Ramadi with lists of names and they execute people and they kill 3-year-old children and they burn their bodies in the streets. And the atrocities in Syria continue as Bashar Assad barrel-bombs innocent men, women, and children--barrel bombs, by the way, supplied by Iran and Russia--and we don't yet have a ``complete strategy.'' Well, I have never seen the world in more crises, nor has Henry Kissinger, nor have most other longtime observers of our Nation and the world. I urge my colleagues to take a look at a map of the Middle East from January of 2009, when President Obama was sworn in as President of the United States, and look at that same map today and color in where there is ISIS, where there is Iranian domination, where there is conflict, and where there is a complete lack, except in the State of Israel, of democratization or the kinds of freedoms the United States of America stands for. All I can say is one has to wonder whether this President just wants to wait out the next year and a half and basically do nothing to stop this genocide, blood-letting, and the horrible things that are happening throughout the Middle East, where, in the view of the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Director of the CIA, they say, as far as ISIS is concerned, they pose a threat to the security of the United States. Why do they say that? Obviously, because these thousands of young men who have gone to Syria and Iraq and are being radicalized and trained are going to go back to where they came from. Everybody knows that. On the day Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, left our Camp Bucca--where he spent 4 years along with about 25,000 others--he said to the Americans: We will see you in New York. Mr. Baghdadi is not known for his sense of humor. What we are trying to do in this legislation that is before the Senate is to provide the means, the training, the equipment, the care for the men and women, and the much needed reforms that I have been over and will continue to go over, whether it be in retirement, whether it be in acquisition, whether it be in a number of other areas of the Department of Defense and the way we defend this Nation. That is, in my view, long, long overdue. Now we see the President of the United States threatening to veto this legislation, if it gets through the House and the Senate, over the issue of OCO. That, as my colleagues know, is overseas contingency operations, which began with the conflicts in Afghanistan and in Iraq as a means of providing additional funds to pay for and fund the operations in those countries as the name implies-- overseas contingency operations. I have opposed sequestration. I think it is a terrible thing to inflict on the men and women who are serving in the military, much less on our national security. I agree with our uniformed leaders, every one of whom has testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that if we continue sequestration, it puts the lives of the men and women who are serving in the military at greater risk. I don't know of a greater obligation that we have than to prevent putting the lives of the young men and women who have volunteered to serve this country at greater risk. But that has been lost on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. So now we have the OCO, and it funds the defense of this country at the levels the President requested. I don't like it. I don't like it because it can only give them 1 year of planning. What the military really needs is to be able to plan for at least 5 years ahead of time. We can't build new weapons and new ships and new airplanes on a year- to-year basis. But it is better than the sequestration, which, as I said, increases the threat to this Nation's security. Last week, the White House issued a Statement of Administration Policy threatening to veto this national security legislation. The threat hardly comes as a surprise. After all, the President has threatened to veto, for some reason or another, every Defense authorization bill since 2011. The White House's compilation of complaints is long, but it is woefully short on substance. The Statement of Administration Policy makes clear that the true basis for the administration's veto threat has nothing to do with defense. Objecting to the use of $38 billion in overseas contingency operation funds--or OCO--to meet the President's request of $612 billion, the statement said the President ``will not fix defense without fixing nondefense spending.'' It is incomprehensible that as America confronts the most diverse and complex array of crises around the world since the end of World War II, that a President of the United States, who has not yet been able to come up with a ``complete strategy'' for the challenges we face, would veto funding for our military to prove a political point. The threats we confront today are far more serious than they were a year ago and significantly more so since the Congress passed the Budget Control Act in 2011. That legislation arbitrarily capped defense spending and established the mindless mechanism of sequestration which was triggered in 2013. As a result, with worldwide threats rising, we as a nation are on a course to cut nearly $1 trillion of defense spending over 10 years. Every single military and national security leader who has testified before the Armed Services Committee this year has denounced sequestration and urged its repeal as soon as possible. This legislation doesn't end sequestration, unfortunately. Believe me, our committee would have done so if the NDAA were capable of it, but it is not. The NDAA is a policy bill. This legislation is a policy bill. It is the appropriators who deal with the money. It only deals with defense issues, and it doesn't spend a dollar. It provides the Department of Defense and the men and women in uniform with the authorities and support they need to defend the Nation. It fully supports President Obama's budget request of $612 billion for national defense, which is $38 billion above the spending caps established by the Budget Control Act. Let me repeat that. The legislation gives the President every dollar of budget authority he requested. The difference is that this legislation follows the Senate budget resolution, which was voted on time after time all night long and was agreed to by both Houses of Congress. It is the Senate budget resolution. Now, this is not my preferred option, as I said. That is why the committee included a special transfer authority in this legislation that allows the Department of Defense to transfer the additional $38 billion from OCO to the base budget in the event legislation is enacted that increases the statutory limits on discretionary defense and nondefense spending in proportionately equal amounts. This was the product of a bipartisan compromise, and it was the most we could do in the Defense authorization bill to recognize the need for a broader physical agreement without denying funding for our military right now. Here on the floor we have heard a number of misconceptions about OCO funding, many of which have been fed by this administration's rhetoric. While OCO is not the ideal way to budget our defense, technical and budgetary consequences to using OCO funding have been greatly exaggerated. OCO is authorized and appropriated on an annual basis, just like base funding. OCO funding is allocated to the same [[Page S3852]] DOD accounts as base funding. In fact, the Defense bill purposely placed the additional $38 billion of OCO funding in the same accounts and activities for which the President himself requested the money. These activities have historically had a large share of OCO funding, and the account has been designated by the President as OCO eligible in the past, and there are no laws that make OCO funding expire any differently than base funding. The White House threat to veto this legislation and the desire for increases in nondefense spending are misguided and irresponsible. With global threats rising, it simply makes no sense to oppose a defense policy bill--legislation that spends no money but is full of vital authorities that our troops need--for a reason that has nothing to do with national defense spending. The NDAA should not be treated as a hostage in budget negotiation. The political reality is that the Budget Control Act, which the President signed, remains the law of the land. So faced with a choice between OCO money and no money, I choose OCO, and multiple senior military leaders testified before the Armed Services Committee this year that they would make the same choice for one simple reason: This is $38 billion of real money that our military desperately needs and without which our top military leaders have said they cannot succeed. The bottom line is this. The NDAA authorized $612 billion for national defense. This is the amount requested by the President and justified by his own national security strategy. If the President and some of my colleagues oppose the Defense bill due to concerns over nondefense spending, I suspect they will have a very difficult time explaining and justifying that choice to Americans who increasingly cite national security as a top concern. The Statement of Administration Policy raises specious concerns with the sweeping defense acquisition reforms in the NDAA. For example, the White House asserted that transferring some acquisition authority back to the services is somehow inconsistent with the Secretary of Defense's exercise of authority, direction, and control over all of the Department of Defense's programs and activities. I could not disagree more with that assertion. What this legislation does is merely switch who does what in certain circumstances from different people who all directly report and serve under the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of Defense. In this legislation, for a limited number of programs to start with, the Secretary of Defense will look to the service Secretaries directly for management of these acquisition programs rather than looking to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, or AT&L. This is not usurpation of the Secretary of Defense's power. It is called streamlining of authorities and reducing layers of unnecessary bureaucracy. There is a section in the legislation that would allow the Secretary of Defense to continue to rely on more layers of management, if he chooses, but only if he certifies to Congress that this makes sense. There simply is not any undermining of the Secretary of Defense's authority in here. Another concern raised has been that the transfer of milestone decision authority to the services would reduce the Secretary of Defense's ability--through AT&L--to guard against unwarranted optimism in program planning and budget formulation. Unwarranted optimism is indeed a plague on acquisition, and there is not a monopoly of that in the services. Nothing in this bill overrides a requirement to use better cost estimates from the Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation. In fact, new incentives and real penalties imposed on the services in this legislation are designed to put some of this optimism in check. Some in the White House and the Department of Defense want to perpetuate the absurd fiction that the current system is working. Even after a wave of 25 program cancellations by former Secretary Gates, all of the programs that are left under AT&L management have over $200 billion in cost overruns. I want to repeat that. Under the supervision of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, there are programs that have over $200 billion in cost overruns. AT&L is trying to have it both ways, claiming credit for the improvements in the acquisition system while blaming the services for its long list of failures. This is exactly the program this legislation is trying to address, blurred lines of accountability inside the Defense Acquisition System that allow its leaders to evade responsibility for results. The reality is that in the modern world the AT&L management process takes too long and costs too much. For example, an Army study looked at the time it would take to go through all of the AT&L reviews and buy nothing. I repeat: To go through all those reviews and buy nothing. What was the answer? Ten years--10 years to buy nothing. The Government Accountability Office looked at the much vaunted milestone reviews that the Office of the Secretary of Defense is touting as a success. Just one review takes on average 2 years. A similar review at the Missile Defense Agency takes about 3 months. Our adversaries are not shuffling paper. They are building weapons systems. It is time for us to do the same. I find it disappointing or maybe just outright laughable that the Statement of Administration Policy expressed concern about the Armed Services Committee's decision to downsize and streamline the bureaucratic overhead of the Pentagon, while at the same time complaining that we are not letting them downsize the fighting forces. Let me repeat. The administration wants to keep more Pentagon bureaucrats while drawing down our forces and cutting military equipment such as fighter aircraft. Is there any Member of this Chamber who believes we should increase the Army staff by 60 percent over a decade, and then turn around and slash our Army brigade combat teams from 45 to 32? Of course not. The administration cites reductions already taking place in headquarters activities, but ignores the fact that the Air Force is trying to achieve those reductions by playing a shell game--creating two new organizations and shifting people around. Moving the deck chairs on the Titanic didn't keep the ship from sinking, and shifting people around in a game of ``hide the headquarters staff'' will not keep our national security from sinking under the weight of bureaucratic empires. As the White House asks the Senate to preserve bloated staffs, the Statement of Administration Policy laments the Committee's effort to address dangerous strike fighter capacity shortfalls across the services. As deliveries of the F-35 have continued to fall short of projections, the Air Force has continued to drain combat power. Senior Air Force officials have repeatedly testified to the alarming reality that their service is the smallest in its history, with readiness at very low levels, all while our airmen perform ongoing combat operations in the Middle East, theater support packages in Eastern Europe, presence and reassurance to our allies in the Asia-Pacific, and maintain a strong strategic nuclear deterrence posture. The misallocation of airpower resources over the past 6 years, coupled with the mismanagement of very expensive aircraft weapons systems procurement programs, places America's national security interests in jeopardy and endangers the lives of our men and women in uniform. Our military commanders know this is true. That is why, for example, the Chief of Naval Operations and the Commandant of the Marine Corps included in their unfunded priorities lists requests for 12 F-18 Super Hornets for the Navy and 6 F-35B Joint Strike Fighters for the Marine Corps. The NDAA funds these requests because senior Navy and Marine Corps leaders have repeatedly testified to significant strike fighter shortfalls in the maritime services due to unanticipated increased combat operations in the Middle East, aging and obsolete fighter aircraft, and significant delays in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter delivery schedule. Bizarrely, the White House has apparently disregarded that testimony and instead labels these requests for more combat power from our military commanders as ``unnecessary.'' The Statement of Administration Policy opposes the strong oversight measures put in place by the NDAA on the Ford-class aircraft carrier program. The administration objects to a [[Page S3853]] provision in this legislation that reduces the cost cap for the USS John F. Kennedy by $100 million from $11.498 billion to $11.398 billion. But in the budget request, the Navy estimated the cost of this ship at $11.348 billion. In other words, the NDAA still provides a buffer of $50 million. The provision simply locks in the savings the Department has advertised, which comes after more than $2 billion in cost growth--$2 billion in cost growth of one aircraft carrier. Unless the budget request is misleading or inaccurate, this provision should not result in reduced capability or a breach of the cost cap as the administration claims. It is also unfortunate that the administration doesn't recognize the importance of conducting full-ship shock trials on the USS Gerald R. Ford, known as CVN-78. With the abundance of new technology, including the catapult, arresting gear, and radar, as well as the reliance on electricity rather than steam to power key systems, there continues to be a great deal of risk in this program. Testing CVN-78 will not only improve the design of future carriers but also reduce the costs associated with retrofitting engineering changes. Absent this provision, the Navy will delay by up to 7 years full-ship shock trials and shift the test from the lead ship in the class to the second ship. That poses the risk that CVN-78 will deploy and potentially fight without this testing, putting the lives of our sailors at risk. The Statement of Administration Policy also raised objections to a number of provisions related to military personnel. For instance, the administration bemoans the fact that the Committee did not adopt its plan to raise existing TRICARE fees and implement new fees for Medicare-eligible retirees and their family members. The so-called Consolidated Health Plans would not have created a modern, value-based health care system. The administration made no attempt at all to improve access to care, quality of care or beneficiary satisfaction. The NDAA, on the other hand, addresses those issues and more without raising enrollment fees or creating new fees. The White House expressed concern about the provisions in the NDAA that call for a plan to privatize commissaries and a 2-year pilot program at no fewer than five commissaries in the largest markets of the commissary system to assess the feasibility and advisability of the plan. But the rationale is confusing. The administration claims that ``there is an independent study underway to determine whether privatization is a feasible option and we should wait for those results prior to making any policy changes.'' The bill did require a comprehensive review in fiscal year 2015 by an independent organization of the management, food, and pricing options of the commissary system. But in that section, there was no requirement to study the feasibility of privatization of the commissary system. It is also curious that the administration warns against implementing a pilot program on privatization before the results of an independent study, while at the same time encouraging the Congress to adopt their own proposed pilot program. The White House's policy statement reflects the President's feckless policy towards Russia. Despite the advice of nearly every statesman and policy expert who has appeared before the Armed Services Committee in recent months--Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Madeleine Albright, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and others--and against the advice of both the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, the President has refused to provide defensive lethal assistance to Ukraine. The President's continued inaction, for fear of provoking Russia, is seen by Putin as weakness and invites the very aggression we seek to avoid. The Ukrainian people aren't asking for U.S. troops. They are simply asking for the right tools to defend themselves and their country, and those are the tools that this legislation would provide. We have seen Vladimir Putin commit aggression, draw back, commit more aggression, draw back. We are now in the phase where any day now we will see continued aggression and territory-grabbing by Vladimir Putin as he establishes his land bridge to Crimea and puts additional pressures on Baltic countries and Moldova. Meanwhile, we refuse to give the Ukrainians weapons with which to defend themselves. This bill does not force the President to provide lethal assistance to Ukraine. Trust me, if there were a way to do that, it would be in this bill. The President has a decision to make on providing lethal assistance to Ukraine. That decision has consequences far beyond whether the President obligates the full amount of funds authorized in a decision that is long overdue. Making matters worse, the Statement of Administration Policy seeks flexibility to continue our Nation's dependence on Russian rocket engines. The NDAA would put an end to this dependence by 2019 and stop hundreds of millions of dollars from going to Vladimir Putin and his cronies. It eliminates a launch subsidy that the commander of Air Force Space Command has stated impedes fair competition, and it directs the administration to stop playing games, develop a domestic rocket engine--not a new rocket system--to replace the Russian RD-180. The Russians are being paid billions of dollars for their rocket engines, and there is a ``middle man'' who has made tens of millions of dollars just by moving those rockets from Russia to the United States. There is an individual who runs this outfit who has been sanctioned by the U.S. Government, and we have elements in the Pentagon who still want to deal with him for as long as possible. In testimony before the Armed Services Committee in March, Gen. John Kelly, the commander of U.S. Southern Command, testified: ``With the amount of drugs and people that move across our southwest border, it doesn't seem all that secure to me.'' General Kelly went on to state that the threat of terrorists crossing our southern border is ``extremely serious'' and that ``if a terrorist or almost anyone wants to get into our country, they just pay the fare.'' They just pay the fare. That is why this bill would provide $45 million for Operation Phalanx, increasing border security operations by the National Guard along the southern border, and boosting aerial surveillance of the region by up to 60 percent. To date, Operation Phalanx has directly contributed to more than 96,000 apprehensions along the border and the interdiction of more than 282,000 pounds of drugs destined for our communities. The legislation directs the Secretary of Defense to provide up to $75 million in additional assistance to Customs and Border Protection operations to secure the southern border, potentially including the deployment of personnel, surveillance assets, and intelligence support from the U.S. military. The NDAA would authorize an additional $50 million to address U.S. Southern Command's unfunded priorities to increase surveillance and interdiction operations in Central America--a primary transit point for illicit trafficking into the United States. Finally, I am disappointed by the administration's puzzling response to provisions in the NDAA related to the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. The administration argues that this legislation's limitations placed on Guantanamo Bay transfers are unnecessary and beyond the scope of congressional authority. That is false. Congress has long had constitutional authority over wartime detention matters, and there are good reasons for Congress to assert its authority in this instance. For over 6 years, the administration has stated that one of its highest policy priorities is to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. But for that same period of time, Members of the Senate have repeatedly requested a plan that explains how the administration will handle each of the detainees currently held there, and unfortunately, over the last 6\1/2\ years, the administration has consistently failed to provide that plan. As the terrorist threat continues around the world and grows and metastasizes, the administration continues to demand that the facility be closed while failing to explain how it will do so. There are serious legal and security challenges inherent in moving this population to other locations, whether inside or outside of the United States. Congress is simply asking the executive branch to explain where it will hold those set for trial, how it will continue to detain dangerous terrorists pursuant to the laws of war, and how it [[Page S3854]] will mitigate the risks of moving this population. If the administration can provide those answers to these basic questions to the satisfaction of the American people, then congressional restrictions on the movement of these detainees will be lifted and the plan can be implemented. Now, Congress's need for answers is even more acute after the administration transferred five senior Taliban detainees under secret agreement to Qatar without prior notification to Congress as required by law. The President of the United States blatantly violated the law-- which required, before these five detainees were transferred to Qatar, that Congress be notified 6 months ahead of time--using the rationale that they were afraid the information might leak. Is that justification for breaking the law? And isn't it understandable, the skepticism here on both sides of the aisle about any plan they may have or may not have? Isn't it reasonable that the Congress of the United States should be presented with a plan, and shouldn't the Congress of the United States express its approval or disapproval? The notification standard was enacted into law to allow the President the authority to implement his stated policy but with a good-faith understanding that the people's representative could weigh in on these important decisions before the transfers happened. The President's failure to abide by the notification provisions undermined any trust Congress had in the process. Now, as the Taliban continues to plot attacks against U.S. servicemembers in Afghanistan, the administration is scurrying to figure out how to keep those five terrorists from the battlefield. This is not congressional overreach; it is congressional oversight. The President has decided that the security risks of keeping Guantanamo open outweigh the security and legal risks of closing it. Congress is seeking information that will allow the American people and Congress to understand that decision. The American people deserve an explanation for how the President plans to execute one of his most repeated policy goals. There is some dispute about what percentage of those who have been released from detention in Guantanamo have reentered the fight. Some say it is as high as 30 percent, and some say it is as low as 7 or 8 percent. There is no debate that detainees who were released from Guantanamo have reentered the fight, placing the lives of American service men and women in jeopardy and in danger. Of course, the five who were released were amongst the toughest, the worst, the hardest cases. Now there is some question as to whether they will remain under strict supervision in Qatar. Let me conclude by simply saying that the NDAA is far too important to be held hostage in a budget negotiation. For 53 consecutive years, the Congress has passed a national defense authorization act. With threats to our national security multiplying around the world, I would hope this year would be no different. I thank my colleague from Rhode Island for all of the hard work he and his staff and Members on that side of the aisle have done in order to have legislation that passed overwhelmingly through the Senate Armed Services Committee. I hope we can move forward on getting that legislation through the Senate, in consultation and in compromise with the House, and to the White House for the President's signature. I would say again that I read carefully the administration's objection to the legislation as it now stands. These are not valid in some cases. In other cases, we would be glad to negotiate with the White House as we go to conference with the House after completing this. I sincerely hope and pray that--there are so many provisions there that are important to the lives of the men and women serving in the military that I would hope the President would take into consideration how important this is to the men and women who are serving, their lives and their welfare, their equipment, their training, and their ability to defend this Nation.

The ranking member and I have asked all of our colleagues to adhere to a filing deadline for first-degree amendments to the bill at 6 p.m. tomorrow, Tuesday. There are several hundred filed amendments already, and those with further amendments should bring them down tomorrow by close of business. I also wish to add, my colleagues, I hope we can agree to the filing deadline. That will be approximately a week that we have been on the bill. I think that, hopefully, will be sufficient time for most of our colleagues or all of our colleagues to have time to file amendments. Senator Reed and I will continue the practice of allowing pending amendments, one on either side. We will be able then to schedule votes on pending amendments as they are, one on either side. I thank Senator Reed, and I hope we can get a lot of debate and discussion. The Reed amendment is a very important amendment. I respect Senator Reed's view on this issue, and we obviously will let the body decide. I do hope our colleagues understand that we have many filed amendments, and we would like to get to as many of them as possible. We would like to have as many Members be able to have their amendments on this bill as they feel necessary. We don't have to emphasize the importance of this legislation. I also look forward to Members coming to the floor tomorrow and debating the Reed amendment. It is a very important amendment, and I think it deserves the views of as many Members as possible, including those who are on the committee. Senator Reed. Mr. REED. The Senator and I concur that we should urge our colleagues to file their amendments. We have several hundred pending, as the chairman pointed out, and we hope that can be accomplished by 6 p.m. tomorrow. We will be debating amendments and then scheduling amendments tomorrow afternoon. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I note with some interest over the weekend in the New York Times that ``Russia Wields Aid and Ideology Against West to Fight Sanctions.'' On the front page of the New York Times: The war in Ukraine that has pitted Russia against the West is being waged not just with tanks, artillery and troops. Increasingly, Moscow has brought to bear different kinds of weapons, according to American and European officials: Money, ideology, and disinformation. Yesterday and today in the Wall Street Journal: ``Iraqis Call for a Deeper Overhaul of Army.'' Also: ``Mistrust of military leadership among troops is widespread in crisis of confidence.'' Right below that: ``Airstrikes Kill Dozens as Fighting in Yemen Intensifies.'' The reporting of a world in turmoil, as described by my friend Lindsey Graham as on fire, continues. To top it all off, today, speaking to reporters at the G7 summit in Germany, President Obama said: ``We don't yet have a complete strategy about how to combat ISIS.'' I would remind my colleagues that on August 28, 2014, nearly a year ago, President Obama stated: ``We don't have a strategy yet to fight ISIS in Iraq and in Syria.'' My friends, nearly a year after the President said we don't have a strategy yet to fight ISIS in Iraq and in Syria, he said again: We don't yet have a complete strategy about how to combat ISIS. [[Page S3851]] I would like to see the incomplete strategy. I would like to see something. I would not like to see continue that 75 percent of the combat missions that are flown in Iraq and Syria return to base without firing a weapon because we don't have forward air controllers on the ground. When is this administration going to figure out that if we want to destroy the enemy, we have to be able to identify the enemy, and that requires forward air controllers on the ground and that means U.S. troops. I know that whenever I and some others say we need additional U.S. troops, people recoil and say, Oh, no, here we go again. Well, what is going on now is ISIS is succeeding. Bashar Assad is hanging on. Iran is on the move. They now dominate four countries: Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Lebanon. And the President of the United States says we don't yet have a complete strategy. Well, the Pentagon is a pretty big place. There are hundreds of people who work for the National Security Advisor, and somehow, nearly a year later, we don't yet have a strategy? Wow. ISIS goes from house to house in Ramadi with lists of names and they execute people and they kill 3-year-old children and they burn their bodies in the streets. And the atrocities in Syria continue as Bashar Assad barrel-bombs innocent men, women, and children--barrel bombs, by the way, supplied by Iran and Russia--and we don't yet have a ``complete strategy.'' Well, I have never seen the world in more crises, nor has Henry Kissinger, nor have most other longtime observers of our Nation and the world. I urge my colleagues to take a look at a map of the Middle East from January of 2009, when President Obama was sworn in as President of the United States, and look at that same map today and color in where there is ISIS, where there is Iranian domination, where there is conflict, and where there is a complete lack, except in the State of Israel, of democratization or the kinds of freedoms the United States of America stands for. All I can say is one has to wonder whether this President just wants to wait out the next year and a half and basically do nothing to stop this genocide, blood-letting, and the horrible things that are happening throughout the Middle East, where, in the view of the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Director of the CIA, they say, as far as ISIS is concerned, they pose a threat to the security of the United States. Why do they say that? Obviously, because these thousands of young men who have gone to Syria and Iraq and are being radicalized and trained are going to go back to where they came from. Everybody knows that. On the day Baghdadi, the leader of ISIS, left our Camp Bucca--where he spent 4 years along with about 25,000 others--he said to the Americans: We will see you in New York. Mr. Baghdadi is not known for his sense of humor. What we are trying to do in this legislation that is before the Senate is to provide the means, the training, the equipment, the care for the men and women, and the much needed reforms that I have been over and will continue to go over, whether it be in retirement, whether it be in acquisition, whether it be in a number of other areas of the Department of Defense and the way we defend this Nation. That is, in my view, long, long overdue. Now we see the President of the United States threatening to veto this legislation, if it gets through the House and the Senate, over the issue of OCO. That, as my colleagues know, is overseas contingency operations, which began with the conflicts in Afghanistan and in Iraq as a means of providing additional funds to pay for and fund the operations in those countries as the name implies-- overseas contingency operations. I have opposed sequestration. I think it is a terrible thing to inflict on the men and women who are serving in the military, much less on our national security. I agree with our uniformed leaders, every one of whom has testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that if we continue sequestration, it puts the lives of the men and women who are serving in the military at greater risk. I don't know of a greater obligation that we have than to prevent putting the lives of the young men and women who have volunteered to serve this country at greater risk. But that has been lost on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. So now we have the OCO, and it funds the defense of this country at the levels the President requested. I don't like it. I don't like it because it can only give them 1 year of planning. What the military really needs is to be able to plan for at least 5 years ahead of time. We can't build new weapons and new ships and new airplanes on a year- to-year basis. But it is better than the sequestration, which, as I said, increases the threat to this Nation's security. Last week, the White House issued a Statement of Administration Policy threatening to veto this national security legislation. The threat hardly comes as a surprise. After all, the President has threatened to veto, for some reason or another, every Defense authorization bill since 2011. The White House's compilation of complaints is long, but it is woefully short on substance. The Statement of Administration Policy makes clear that the true basis for the administration's veto threat has nothing to do with defense. Objecting to the use of $38 billion in overseas contingency operation funds--or OCO--to meet the President's request of $612 billion, the statement said the President ``will not fix defense without fixing nondefense spending.'' It is incomprehensible that as America confronts the most diverse and complex array of crises around the world since the end of World War II, that a President of the United States, who has not yet been able to come up with a ``complete strategy'' for the challenges we face, would veto funding for our military to prove a political point. The threats we confront today are far more serious than they were a year ago and significantly more so since the Congress passed the Budget Control Act in 2011. That legislation arbitrarily capped defense spending and established the mindless mechanism of sequestration which was triggered in 2013. As a result, with worldwide threats rising, we as a nation are on a course to cut nearly $1 trillion of defense spending over 10 years. Every single military and national security leader who has testified before the Armed Services Committee this year has denounced sequestration and urged its repeal as soon as possible. This legislation doesn't end sequestration, unfortunately. Believe me, our committee would have done so if the NDAA were capable of it, but it is not. The NDAA is a policy bill. This legislation is a policy bill. It is the appropriators who deal with the money. It only deals with defense issues, and it doesn't spend a dollar. It provides the Department of Defense and the men and women in uniform with the authorities and support they need to defend the Nation. It fully supports President Obama's budget request of $612 billion for national defense, which is $38 billion above the spending caps established by the Budget Control Act. Let me repeat that. The legislation gives the President every dollar of budget authority he requested. The difference is that this legislation follows the Senate budget resolution, which was voted on time after time all night long and was agreed to by both Houses of Congress. It is the Senate budget resolution. Now, this is not my preferred option, as I said. That is why the committee included a special transfer authority in this legislation that allows the Department of Defense to transfer the additional $38 billion from OCO to the base budget in the event legislation is enacted that increases the statutory limits on discretionary defense and nondefense spending in proportionately equal amounts. This was the product of a bipartisan compromise, and it was the most we could do in the Defense authorization bill to recognize the need for a broader physical agreement without denying funding for our military right now. Here on the floor we have heard a number of misconceptions about OCO funding, many of which have been fed by this administration's rhetoric. While OCO is not the ideal way to budget our defense, technical and budgetary consequences to using OCO funding have been greatly exaggerated. OCO is authorized and appropriated on an annual basis, just like base funding. OCO funding is allocated to the same [[Page S3852]] DOD accounts as base funding. In fact, the Defense bill purposely placed the additional $38 billion of OCO funding in the same accounts and activities for which the President himself requested the money. These activities have historically had a large share of OCO funding, and the account has been designated by the President as OCO eligible in the past, and there are no laws that make OCO funding expire any differently than base funding. The White House threat to veto this legislation and the desire for increases in nondefense spending are misguided and irresponsible. With global threats rising, it simply makes no sense to oppose a defense policy bill--legislation that spends no money but is full of vital authorities that our troops need--for a reason that has nothing to do with national defense spending. The NDAA should not be treated as a hostage in budget negotiation. The political reality is that the Budget Control Act, which the President signed, remains the law of the land. So faced with a choice between OCO money and no money, I choose OCO, and multiple senior military leaders testified before the Armed Services Committee this year that they would make the same choice for one simple reason: This is $38 billion of real money that our military desperately needs and without which our top military leaders have said they cannot succeed. The bottom line is this. The NDAA authorized $612 billion for national defense. This is the amount requested by the President and justified by his own national security strategy. If the President and some of my colleagues oppose the Defense bill due to concerns over nondefense spending, I suspect they will have a very difficult time explaining and justifying that choice to Americans who increasingly cite national security as a top concern. The Statement of Administration Policy raises specious concerns with the sweeping defense acquisition reforms in the NDAA. For example, the White House asserted that transferring some acquisition authority back to the services is somehow inconsistent with the Secretary of Defense's exercise of authority, direction, and control over all of the Department of Defense's programs and activities. I could not disagree more with that assertion. What this legislation does is merely switch who does what in certain circumstances from different people who all directly report and serve under the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of Defense. In this legislation, for a limited number of programs to start with, the Secretary of Defense will look to the service Secretaries directly for management of these acquisition programs rather than looking to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, or AT&L. This is not usurpation of the Secretary of Defense's power. It is called streamlining of authorities and reducing layers of unnecessary bureaucracy. There is a section in the legislation that would allow the Secretary of Defense to continue to rely on more layers of management, if he chooses, but only if he certifies to Congress that this makes sense. There simply is not any undermining of the Secretary of Defense's authority in here. Another concern raised has been that the transfer of milestone decision authority to the services would reduce the Secretary of Defense's ability--through AT&L--to guard against unwarranted optimism in program planning and budget formulation. Unwarranted optimism is indeed a plague on acquisition, and there is not a monopoly of that in the services. Nothing in this bill overrides a requirement to use better cost estimates from the Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation. In fact, new incentives and real penalties imposed on the services in this legislation are designed to put some of this optimism in check. Some in the White House and the Department of Defense want to perpetuate the absurd fiction that the current system is working. Even after a wave of 25 program cancellations by former Secretary Gates, all of the programs that are left under AT&L management have over $200 billion in cost overruns. I want to repeat that. Under the supervision of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, there are programs that have over $200 billion in cost overruns. AT&L is trying to have it both ways, claiming credit for the improvements in the acquisition system while blaming the services for its long list of failures. This is exactly the program this legislation is trying to address, blurred lines of accountability inside the Defense Acquisition System that allow its leaders to evade responsibility for results. The reality is that in the modern world the AT&L management process takes too long and costs too much. For example, an Army study looked at the time it would take to go through all of the AT&L reviews and buy nothing. I repeat: To go through all those reviews and buy nothing. What was the answer? Ten years--10 years to buy nothing. The Government Accountability Office looked at the much vaunted milestone reviews that the Office of the Secretary of Defense is touting as a success. Just one review takes on average 2 years. A similar review at the Missile Defense Agency takes about 3 months. Our adversaries are not shuffling paper. They are building weapons systems. It is time for us to do the same. I find it disappointing or maybe just outright laughable that the Statement of Administration Policy expressed concern about the Armed Services Committee's decision to downsize and streamline the bureaucratic overhead of the Pentagon, while at the same time complaining that we are not letting them downsize the fighting forces. Let me repeat. The administration wants to keep more Pentagon bureaucrats while drawing down our forces and cutting military equipment such as fighter aircraft. Is there any Member of this Chamber who believes we should increase the Army staff by 60 percent over a decade, and then turn around and slash our Army brigade combat teams from 45 to 32? Of course not. The administration cites reductions already taking place in headquarters activities, but ignores the fact that the Air Force is trying to achieve those reductions by playing a shell game--creating two new organizations and shifting people around. Moving the deck chairs on the Titanic didn't keep the ship from sinking, and shifting people around in a game of ``hide the headquarters staff'' will not keep our national security from sinking under the weight of bureaucratic empires. As the White House asks the Senate to preserve bloated staffs, the Statement of Administration Policy laments the Committee's effort to address dangerous strike fighter capacity shortfalls across the services. As deliveries of the F-35 have continued to fall short of projections, the Air Force has continued to drain combat power. Senior Air Force officials have repeatedly testified to the alarming reality that their service is the smallest in its history, with readiness at very low levels, all while our airmen perform ongoing combat operations in the Middle East, theater support packages in Eastern Europe, presence and reassurance to our allies in the Asia-Pacific, and maintain a strong strategic nuclear deterrence posture. The misallocation of airpower resources over the past 6 years, coupled with the mismanagement of very expensive aircraft weapons systems procurement programs, places America's national security interests in jeopardy and endangers the lives of our men and women in uniform. Our military commanders know this is true. That is why, for example, the Chief of Naval Operations and the Commandant of the Marine Corps included in their unfunded priorities lists requests for 12 F-18 Super Hornets for the Navy and 6 F-35B Joint Strike Fighters for the Marine Corps. The NDAA funds these requests because senior Navy and Marine Corps leaders have repeatedly testified to significant strike fighter shortfalls in the maritime services due to unanticipated increased combat operations in the Middle East, aging and obsolete fighter aircraft, and significant delays in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter delivery schedule. Bizarrely, the White House has apparently disregarded that testimony and instead labels these requests for more combat power from our military commanders as ``unnecessary.'' The Statement of Administration Policy opposes the strong oversight measures put in place by the NDAA on the Ford-class aircraft carrier program. The administration objects to a [[Page S3853]] provision in this legislation that reduces the cost cap for the USS John F. Kennedy by $100 million from $11.498 billion to $11.398 billion. But in the budget request, the Navy estimated the cost of this ship at $11.348 billion. In other words, the NDAA still provides a buffer of $50 million. The provision simply locks in the savings the Department has advertised, which comes after more than $2 billion in cost growth--$2 billion in cost growth of one aircraft carrier. Unless the budget request is misleading or inaccurate, this provision should not result in reduced capability or a breach of the cost cap as the administration claims. It is also unfortunate that the administration doesn't recognize the importance of conducting full-ship shock trials on the USS Gerald R. Ford, known as CVN-78. With the abundance of new technology, including the catapult, arresting gear, and radar, as well as the reliance on electricity rather than steam to power key systems, there continues to be a great deal of risk in this program. Testing CVN-78 will not only improve the design of future carriers but also reduce the costs associated with retrofitting engineering changes. Absent this provision, the Navy will delay by up to 7 years full-ship shock trials and shift the test from the lead ship in the class to the second ship. That poses the risk that CVN-78 will deploy and potentially fight without this testing, putting the lives of our sailors at risk. The Statement of Administration Policy also raised objections to a number of provisions related to military personnel. For instance, the administration bemoans the fact that the Committee did not adopt its plan to raise existing TRICARE fees and implement new fees for Medicare-eligible retirees and their family members. The so-called Consolidated Health Plans would not have created a modern, value-based health care system. The administration made no attempt at all to improve access to care, quality of care or beneficiary satisfaction. The NDAA, on the other hand, addresses those issues and more without raising enrollment fees or creating new fees. The White House expressed concern about the provisions in the NDAA that call for a plan to privatize commissaries and a 2-year pilot program at no fewer than five commissaries in the largest markets of the commissary system to assess the feasibility and advisability of the plan. But the rationale is confusing. The administration claims that ``there is an independent study underway to determine whether privatization is a feasible option and we should wait for those results prior to making any policy changes.'' The bill did require a comprehensive review in fiscal year 2015 by an independent organization of the management, food, and pricing options of the commissary system. But in that section, there was no requirement to study the feasibility of privatization of the commissary system. It is also curious that the administration warns against implementing a pilot program on privatization before the results of an independent study, while at the same time encouraging the Congress to adopt their own proposed pilot program. The White House's policy statement reflects the President's feckless policy towards Russia. Despite the advice of nearly every statesman and policy expert who has appeared before the Armed Services Committee in recent months--Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Madeleine Albright, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and others--and against the advice of both the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, the President has refused to provide defensive lethal assistance to Ukraine. The President's continued inaction, for fear of provoking Russia, is seen by Putin as weakness and invites the very aggression we seek to avoid. The Ukrainian people aren't asking for U.S. troops. They are simply asking for the right tools to defend themselves and their country, and those are the tools that this legislation would provide. We have seen Vladimir Putin commit aggression, draw back, commit more aggression, draw back. We are now in the phase where any day now we will see continued aggression and territory-grabbing by Vladimir Putin as he establishes his land bridge to Crimea and puts additional pressures on Baltic countries and Moldova. Meanwhile, we refuse to give the Ukrainians weapons with which to defend themselves. This bill does not force the President to provide lethal assistance to Ukraine. Trust me, if there were a way to do that, it would be in this bill. The President has a decision to make on providing lethal assistance to Ukraine. That decision has consequences far beyond whether the President obligates the full amount of funds authorized in a decision that is long overdue. Making matters worse, the Statement of Administration Policy seeks flexibility to continue our Nation's dependence on Russian rocket engines. The NDAA would put an end to this dependence by 2019 and stop hundreds of millions of dollars from going to Vladimir Putin and his cronies. It eliminates a launch subsidy that the commander of Air Force Space Command has stated impedes fair competition, and it directs the administration to stop playing games, develop a domestic rocket engine--not a new rocket system--to replace the Russian RD-180. The Russians are being paid billions of dollars for their rocket engines, and there is a ``middle man'' who has made tens of millions of dollars just by moving those rockets from Russia to the United States. There is an individual who runs this outfit who has been sanctioned by the U.S. Government, and we have elements in the Pentagon who still want to deal with him for as long as possible. In testimony before the Armed Services Committee in March, Gen. John Kelly, the commander of U.S. Southern Command, testified: ``With the amount of drugs and people that move across our southwest border, it doesn't seem all that secure to me.'' General Kelly went on to state that the threat of terrorists crossing our southern border is ``extremely serious'' and that ``if a terrorist or almost anyone wants to get into our country, they just pay the fare.'' They just pay the fare. That is why this bill would provide $45 million for Operation Phalanx, increasing border security operations by the National Guard along the southern border, and boosting aerial surveillance of the region by up to 60 percent. To date, Operation Phalanx has directly contributed to more than 96,000 apprehensions along the border and the interdiction of more than 282,000 pounds of drugs destined for our communities. The legislation directs the Secretary of Defense to provide up to $75 million in additional assistance to Customs and Border Protection operations to secure the southern border, potentially including the deployment of personnel, surveillance assets, and intelligence support from the U.S. military. The NDAA would authorize an additional $50 million to address U.S. Southern Command's unfunded priorities to increase surveillance and interdiction operations in Central America--a primary transit point for illicit trafficking into the United States. Finally, I am disappointed by the administration's puzzling response to provisions in the NDAA related to the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. The administration argues that this legislation's limitations placed on Guantanamo Bay transfers are unnecessary and beyond the scope of congressional authority. That is false. Congress has long had constitutional authority over wartime detention matters, and there are good reasons for Congress to assert its authority in this instance. For over 6 years, the administration has stated that one of its highest policy priorities is to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. But for that same period of time, Members of the Senate have repeatedly requested a plan that explains how the administration will handle each of the detainees currently held there, and unfortunately, over the last 6\1/2\ years, the administration has consistently failed to provide that plan. As the terrorist threat continues around the world and grows and metastasizes, the administration continues to demand that the facility be closed while failing to explain how it will do so. There are serious legal and security challenges inherent in moving this population to other locations, whether inside or outside of the United States. Congress is simply asking the executive branch to explain where it will hold those set for trial, how it will continue to detain dangerous terrorists pursuant to the laws of war, and how it [[Page S3854]] will mitigate the risks of moving this population. If the administration can provide those answers to these basic questions to the satisfaction of the American people, then congressional restrictions on the movement of these detainees will be lifted and the plan can be implemented. Now, Congress's need for answers is even more acute after the administration transferred five senior Taliban detainees under secret agreement to Qatar without prior notification to Congress as required by law. The President of the United States blatantly violated the law-- which required, before these five detainees were transferred to Qatar, that Congress be notified 6 months ahead of time--using the rationale that they were afraid the information might leak. Is that justification for breaking the law? And isn't it understandable, the skepticism here on both sides of the aisle about any plan they may have or may not have? Isn't it reasonable that the Congress of the United States should be presented with a plan, and shouldn't the Congress of the United States express its approval or disapproval? The notification standard was enacted into law to allow the President the authority to implement his stated policy but with a good-faith understanding that the people's representative could weigh in on these important decisions before the transfers happened. The President's failure to abide by the notification provisions undermined any trust Congress had in the process. Now, as the Taliban continues to plot attacks against U.S. servicemembers in Afghanistan, the administration is scurrying to figure out how to keep those five terrorists from the battlefield. This is not congressional overreach; it is congressional oversight. The President has decided that the security risks of keeping Guantanamo open outweigh the security and legal risks of closing it. Congress is seeking information that will allow the American people and Congress to understand that decision. The American people deserve an explanation for how the President plans to execute one of his most repeated policy goals. There is some dispute about what percentage of those who have been released from detention in Guantanamo have reentered the fight. Some say it is as high as 30 percent, and some say it is as low as 7 or 8 percent. There is no debate that detainees who were released from Guantanamo have reentered the fight, placing the lives of American service men and women in jeopardy and in danger. Of course, the five who were released were amongst the toughest, the worst, the hardest cases. Now there is some question as to whether they will remain under strict supervision in Qatar. Let me conclude by simply saying that the NDAA is far too important to be held hostage in a budget negotiation. For 53 consecutive years, the Congress has passed a national defense authorization act. With threats to our national security multiplying around the world, I would hope this year would be no different. I thank my colleague from Rhode Island for all of the hard work he and his staff and Members on that side of the aisle have done in order to have legislation that passed overwhelmingly through the Senate Armed Services Committee. I hope we can move forward on getting that legislation through the Senate, in consultation and in compromise with the House, and to the White House for the President's signature. I would say again that I read carefully the administration's objection to the legislation as it now stands. These are not valid in some cases. In other cases, we would be glad to negotiate with the White House as we go to conference with the House after completing this. I sincerely hope and pray that--there are so many provisions there that are important to the lives of the men and women serving in the military that I would hope the President would take into consideration how important this is to the men and women who are serving, their lives and their welfare, their equipment, their training, and their ability to defend this Nation.

There are several hundred filed amendments already, and those with further amendments should bring them down tomorrow by close of business. I also wish to add, my colleagues, I hope we can agree to the filing deadline. That will be approximately a week that we have been on the bill. I think that, hopefully, will be sufficient time for most of our colleagues or all of our colleagues to have time to file amendments. Senator Reed and I will continue the practice of allowing pending amendments, one on either side. We will be able then to schedule votes on pending amendments as they are, one on either side. I thank Senator Reed, and I hope we can get a lot of debate and discussion. The Reed amendment is a very important amendment. I respect Senator Reed's view on this issue, and we obviously will let the body decide. I do hope our colleagues understand that we have many filed amendments, and we would like to get to as many of them as possible. We would like to have as many Members be able to have their amendments on this bill as they feel necessary. We don't have to emphasize the importance of this legislation. I also look forward to Members coming to the floor tomorrow and debating the Reed amendment. It is a very important amendment, and I think it deserves the views of as many Members as possible, including those who are on the committee. Senator Reed. Mr. REED. The Senator and I concur that we should urge our colleagues to file their amendments. We have several hundred pending, as the chairman pointed out, and we hope that can be accomplished by 6 p.m. tomorrow. We will be debating amendments and then scheduling amendments tomorrow afternoon. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona. ____________________",package_114_85.csv,45979,45979,46044,"[congressional record volume 161, number 90 (monday, june 8, 2015)] [senate] [pages s3850-s3855] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2016 the presiding officer. under the previous order, the senate will resume consideration of h.r. 1735, which the clerk will report. the senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: a bill (h.r. 1735) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2016 for military activities of the department of defense, for military construction, and for defense activities of the department of energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes. pending: mccain amendment no. 1463, in the nature of a substitute. mccain amendment no. 1456 (to amendment no. 1463), to require additional information supporting long-range plans for construction of naval vessels. reed amendment no. 1521 (to amendment no. 1463), to limit the availability of amounts authorized to be appropriated for overseas contingency operations pending relief from the spending limits under the budget control act of 2011. cornyn amendment no. 1486 (to amendment no. 1463), to require reporting on energy security issues involving europe and the russian federation, and to express the sense of congress regarding ways the united states could help vulnerable allies and partners with energy security. vitter amendment no. 1473 (to amendment no. 1463), to limit the retirement of army combat units. markey amendment no. 1645 (to amendment no. 1463), to express the sense of congress that exports of crude oil to united states allies and partners should not be determined to be consistent with the national interest if those exports would increase energy prices in the united states for american consumers or businesses or increase the reliance of the united states on imported oil. reed (for blumenthal) amendment no. 1564 (to amendment no. 1463), to increase civil penalties for violations of the servicemembers civil relief act. mccain (for paul) modified amendment no. 1543 (to amendment no. 1463), to strengthen employee cost savings suggestions programs within the federal government. reed (for durbin) amendment no. 1559 (to amendment no. 1463), to prohibit the award of department of defense contracts to inverted domestic corporations. mr. mccain. madam president, i note with some interest over the weekend in the new york times that ``russia wields aid and ideology against west to fight sanctions.'' on the front page of the new york times: the war in ukraine that has pitted russia against the west is being waged not just with tanks, artillery and troops. increasingly, moscow has brought to bear different kinds of weapons, according to american and european officials: money, ideology, and disinformation. yesterday and today in the wall street journal: ``iraqis call for a deeper overhaul of army.'' also: ``mistrust of military leadership among troops is widespread in crisis of confidence.'' right below that: ``airstrikes kill dozens as fighting in yemen intensifies.'' the reporting of a world in turmoil, as described by my friend lindsey graham as on fire, continues. to top it all off, today, speaking to reporters at the g7 summit in germany, president obama said: ``we don't yet have a complete strategy about how to combat isis.'' i would remind my colleagues that on august 28, 2014, nearly a year ago, president obama stated: ``we don't have a strategy yet to fight isis in iraq and in syria.'' my friends, nearly a year after the president said we don't have a strategy yet to fight isis in iraq and in syria, he said again: we don't yet have a complete strategy about how to combat isis. [[page s3851]] i would like to see the incomplete strategy. i would like to see something. i would not like to see continue that 75 percent of the combat missions that are flown in iraq and syria return to base without firing a weapon because we don't have forward air controllers on the ground. when is this administration going to figure out that if we want to destroy the enemy, we have to be able to identify the enemy, and that requires forward air controllers on the ground and that means u.s. troops. i know that whenever i and some others say we need additional u.s. troops, people recoil and say, oh, no, here we go again. well, what is going on now is isis is succeeding. bashar assad is hanging on. iran is on the move. they now dominate four countries: syria, iraq, yemen, and lebanon. and the president of the united states says we don't yet have a complete strategy. well, the pentagon is a pretty big place. there are hundreds of people who work for the national security advisor, and somehow, nearly a year later, we don't yet have a strategy? wow. isis goes from house to house in ramadi with lists of names and they execute people and they kill 3-year-old children and they burn their bodies in the streets. and the atrocities in syria continue as bashar assad barrel-bombs innocent men, women, and children--barrel bombs, by the way, supplied by iran and russia--and we don't yet have a ``complete strategy.'' well, i have never seen the world in more crises, nor has henry kissinger, nor have most other longtime observers of our nation and the world. i urge my colleagues to take a look at a map of the middle east from january of 2009, when president obama was sworn in as president of the united states, and look at that same map today and color in where there is isis, where there is iranian domination, where there is conflict, and where there is a complete lack, except in the state of israel, of democratization or the kinds of freedoms the united states of america stands for. all i can say is one has to wonder whether this president just wants to wait out the next year and a half and basically do nothing to stop this genocide, blood-letting, and the horrible things that are happening throughout the middle east, where, in the view of the director of the federal bureau of investigation and the director of the cia, they say, as far as isis is concerned, they pose a threat to the security of the united states. why do they say that? obviously, because these thousands of young men who have gone to syria and iraq and are being radicalized and trained are going to go back to where they came from. everybody knows that. on the day baghdadi, the leader of isis, left our camp bucca--where he spent 4 years along with about 25,000 others--he said to the americans: we will see you in new york. mr. baghdadi is not known for his sense of humor. what we are trying to do in this legislation that is before the senate is to provide the means, the training, the equipment, the care for the men and women, and the much needed reforms that i have been over and will continue to go over, whether it be in retirement, whether it be in acquisition, whether it be in a number of other areas of the department of defense and the way we defend this nation. that is, in my view, long, long overdue. now we see the president of the united states threatening to veto this legislation, if it gets through the house and the senate, over the issue of oco. that, as my colleagues know, is overseas contingency operations, which began with the conflicts in afghanistan and in iraq as a means of providing additional funds to pay for and fund the operations in those countries as the name implies-- overseas contingency operations. i have opposed sequestration. i think it is a terrible thing to inflict on the men and women who are serving in the military, much less on our national security. i agree with our uniformed leaders, every one of whom has testified before the senate armed services committee that if we continue sequestration, it puts the lives of the men and women who are serving in the military at greater risk. i don't know of a greater obligation that we have than to prevent putting the lives of the young men and women who have volunteered to serve this country at greater risk. but that has been lost on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. so now we have the oco, and it funds the defense of this country at the levels the president requested. i don't like it. i don't like it because it can only give them 1 year of planning. what the military really needs is to be able to plan for at least 5 years ahead of time. we can't build new weapons and new ships and new airplanes on a year- to-year basis. but it is better than the sequestration, which, as i said, increases the threat to this nation's security. last week, the white house issued a statement of administration policy threatening to veto this national security legislation. the threat hardly comes as a surprise. after all, the president has threatened to veto, for some reason or another, every defense authorization bill since 2011. the white house's compilation of complaints is long, but it is woefully short on substance. the statement of administration policy makes clear that the true basis for the administration's veto threat has nothing to do with defense. objecting to the use of $38 billion in overseas contingency operation funds--or oco--to meet the president's request of $612 billion, the statement said the president ``will not fix defense without fixing nondefense spending.'' it is incomprehensible that as america confronts the most diverse and complex array of crises around the world since the end of world war ii, that a president of the united states, who has not yet been able to come up with a ``complete strategy'' for the challenges we face, would veto funding for our military to prove a political point. the threats we confront today are far more serious than they were a year ago and significantly more so since the congress passed the budget control act in 2011. that legislation arbitrarily capped defense spending and established the mindless mechanism of sequestration which was triggered in 2013. as a result, with worldwide threats rising, we as a nation are on a course to cut nearly $1 trillion of defense spending over 10 years. every single military and national security leader who has testified before the armed services committee this year has denounced sequestration and urged its repeal as soon as possible. this legislation doesn't end sequestration, unfortunately. believe me, our committee would have done so if the ndaa were capable of it, but it is not. the ndaa is a policy bill. this legislation is a policy bill. it is the appropriators who deal with the money. it only deals with defense issues, and it doesn't spend a dollar. it provides the department of defense and the men and women in uniform with the authorities and support they need to defend the nation. it fully supports president obama's budget request of $612 billion for national defense, which is $38 billion above the spending caps established by the budget control act. let me repeat that. the legislation gives the president every dollar of budget authority he requested. the difference is that this legislation follows the senate budget resolution, which was voted on time after time all night long and was agreed to by both houses of congress. it is the senate budget resolution. now, this is not my preferred option, as i said. that is why the committee included a special transfer authority in this legislation that allows the department of defense to transfer the additional $38 billion from oco to the base budget in the event legislation is enacted that increases the statutory limits on discretionary defense and nondefense spending in proportionately equal amounts. this was the product of a bipartisan compromise, and it was the most we could do in the defense authorization bill to recognize the need for a broader physical agreement without denying funding for our military right now. here on the floor we have heard a number of misconceptions about oco funding, many of which have been fed by this administration's rhetoric. while oco is not the ideal way to budget our defense, technical and budgetary consequences to using oco funding have been greatly exaggerated. oco is authorized and appropriated on an annual basis, just like base funding. oco funding is allocated to the same [[page s3852]] dod accounts as base funding. in fact, the defense bill purposely placed the additional $38 billion of oco funding in the same accounts and activities for which the president himself requested the money. these activities have historically had a large share of oco funding, and the account has been designated by the president as oco eligible in the past, and there are no laws that make oco funding expire any differently than base funding. the white house threat to veto this legislation and the desire for increases in nondefense spending are misguided and irresponsible. with global threats rising, it simply makes no sense to oppose a defense policy bill--legislation that spends no money but is full of vital authorities that our troops need--for a reason that has nothing to do with national defense spending. the ndaa should not be treated as a hostage in budget negotiation. the political reality is that the budget control act, which the president signed, remains the law of the land. so faced with a choice between oco money and no money, i choose oco, and multiple senior military leaders testified before the armed services committee this year that they would make the same choice for one simple reason: this is $38 billion of real money that our military desperately needs and without which our top military leaders have said they cannot succeed. the bottom line is this. the ndaa authorized $612 billion for national defense. this is the amount requested by the president and justified by his own national security strategy. if the president and some of my colleagues oppose the defense bill due to concerns over nondefense spending, i suspect they will have a very difficult time explaining and justifying that choice to americans who increasingly cite national security as a top concern. the statement of administration policy raises specious concerns with the sweeping defense acquisition reforms in the ndaa. for example, the white house asserted that transferring some acquisition authority back to the services is somehow inconsistent with the secretary of defense's exercise of authority, direction, and control over all of the department of defense's programs and activities. i could not disagree more with that assertion. what this legislation does is merely switch who does what in certain circumstances from different people who all directly report and serve under the authority, direction, and control of the secretary of defense. in this legislation, for a limited number of programs to start with, the secretary of defense will look to the service secretaries directly for management of these acquisition programs rather than looking to the under secretary of defense for acquisition, technology, and logistics, or at&l. this is not usurpation of the secretary of defense's power. it is called streamlining of authorities and reducing layers of unnecessary bureaucracy. there is a section in the legislation that would allow the secretary of defense to continue to rely on more layers of management, if he chooses, but only if he certifies to congress that this makes sense. there simply is not any undermining of the secretary of defense's authority in here. another concern raised has been that the transfer of milestone decision authority to the services would reduce the secretary of defense's ability--through at&l--to guard against unwarranted optimism in program planning and budget formulation. unwarranted optimism is indeed a plague on acquisition, and there is not a monopoly of that in the services. nothing in this bill overrides a requirement to use better cost estimates from the office of cost assessment and program evaluation. in fact, new incentives and real penalties imposed on the services in this legislation are designed to put some of this optimism in check. some in the white house and the department of defense want to perpetuate the absurd fiction that the current system is working. even after a wave of 25 program cancellations by former secretary gates, all of the programs that are left under at&l management have over $200 billion in cost overruns. i want to repeat that. under the supervision of the under secretary of defense for acquisition, technology, and logistics, there are programs that have over $200 billion in cost overruns. at&l is trying to have it both ways, claiming credit for the improvements in the acquisition system while blaming the services for its long list of failures. this is exactly the program this legislation is trying to address, blurred lines of accountability inside the defense acquisition system that allow its leaders to evade responsibility for results. the reality is that in the modern world the at&l management process takes too long and costs too much. for example, an army study looked at the time it would take to go through all of the at&l reviews and buy nothing. i repeat: to go through all those reviews and buy nothing. what was the answer? ten years--10 years to buy nothing. the government accountability office looked at the much vaunted milestone reviews that the office of the secretary of defense is touting as a success. just one review takes on average 2 years. a similar review at the missile defense agency takes about 3 months. our adversaries are not shuffling paper. they are building weapons systems. it is time for us to do the same. i find it disappointing or maybe just outright laughable that the statement of administration policy expressed concern about the armed services committee's decision to downsize and streamline the bureaucratic overhead of the pentagon, while at the same time complaining that we are not letting them downsize the fighting forces. let me repeat. the administration wants to keep more pentagon bureaucrats while drawing down our forces and cutting military equipment such as fighter aircraft. is there any member of this chamber who believes we should increase the army staff by 60 percent over a decade, and then turn around and slash our army brigade combat teams from 45 to 32? of course not. the administration cites reductions already taking place in headquarters activities, but ignores the fact that the air force is trying to achieve those reductions by playing a shell game--creating two new organizations and shifting people around. moving the deck chairs on the titanic didn't keep the ship from sinking, and shifting people around in a game of ``hide the headquarters staff'' will not keep our national security from sinking under the weight of bureaucratic empires. as the white house asks the senate to preserve bloated staffs, the statement of administration policy laments the committee's effort to address dangerous strike fighter capacity shortfalls across the services. as deliveries of the f-35 have continued to fall short of projections, the air force has continued to drain combat power. senior air force officials have repeatedly testified to the alarming reality that their service is the smallest in its history, with readiness at very low levels, all while our airmen perform ongoing combat operations in the middle east, theater support packages in eastern europe, presence and reassurance to our allies in the asia-pacific, and maintain a strong strategic nuclear deterrence posture. the misallocation of airpower resources over the past 6 years, coupled with the mismanagement of very expensive aircraft weapons systems procurement programs, places america's national security interests in jeopardy and endangers the lives of our men and women in uniform. our military commanders know this is true. that is why, for example, the chief of naval operations and the commandant of the marine corps included in their unfunded priorities lists requests for 12 f-18 super hornets for the navy and 6 f-35b joint strike fighters for the marine corps. the ndaa funds these requests because senior navy and marine corps leaders have repeatedly testified to significant strike fighter shortfalls in the maritime services due to unanticipated increased combat operations in the middle east, aging and obsolete fighter aircraft, and significant delays in the f-35 joint strike fighter delivery schedule. bizarrely, the white house has apparently disregarded that testimony and instead labels these requests for more combat power from our military commanders as ``unnecessary.'' the statement of administration policy opposes the strong oversight measures put in place by the ndaa on the ford-class aircraft carrier program. the administration objects to a [[page s3853]] provision in this legislation that reduces the cost cap for the uss john f. kennedy by $100 million from $11.498 billion to $11.398 billion. but in the budget request, the navy estimated the cost of this ship at $11.348 billion. in other words, the ndaa still provides a buffer of $50 million. the provision simply locks in the savings the department has advertised, which comes after more than $2 billion in cost growth--$2 billion in cost growth of one aircraft carrier. unless the budget request is misleading or inaccurate, this provision should not result in reduced capability or a breach of the cost cap as the administration claims. it is also unfortunate that the administration doesn't recognize the importance of conducting full-ship shock trials on the uss gerald r. ford, known as cvn-78. with the abundance of new technology, including the catapult, arresting gear, and radar, as well as the reliance on electricity rather than steam to power key systems, there continues to be a great deal of risk in this program. testing cvn-78 will not only improve the design of future carriers but also reduce the costs associated with retrofitting engineering changes. absent this provision, the navy will delay by up to 7 years full-ship shock trials and shift the test from the lead ship in the class to the second ship. that poses the risk that cvn-78 will deploy and potentially fight without this testing, putting the lives of our sailors at risk. the statement of administration policy also raised objections to a number of provisions related to military personnel. for instance, the administration bemoans the fact that the committee did not adopt its plan to raise existing tricare fees and implement new fees for medicare-eligible retirees and their family members. the so-called consolidated health plans would not have created a modern, value-based health care system. the administration made no attempt at all to improve access to care, quality of care or beneficiary satisfaction. the ndaa, on the other hand, addresses those issues and more without raising enrollment fees or creating new fees. the white house expressed concern about the provisions in the ndaa that call for a plan to privatize commissaries and a 2-year pilot program at no fewer than five commissaries in the largest markets of the commissary system to assess the feasibility and advisability of the plan. but the rationale is confusing. the administration claims that ``there is an independent study underway to determine whether privatization is a feasible option and we should wait for those results prior to making any policy changes.'' the bill did require a comprehensive review in fiscal year 2015 by an independent organization of the management, food, and pricing options of the commissary system. but in that section, there was no requirement to study the feasibility of privatization of the commissary system. it is also curious that the administration warns against implementing a pilot program on privatization before the results of an independent study, while at the same time encouraging the congress to adopt their own proposed pilot program. the white house's policy statement reflects the president's feckless policy towards russia. despite the advice of nearly every statesman and policy expert who has appeared before the armed services committee in recent months--henry kissinger, george shultz, madeleine albright, zbigniew brzezinski, and others--and against the advice of both the secretary of state and secretary of defense, the president has refused to provide defensive lethal assistance to ukraine. the president's continued inaction, for fear of provoking russia, is seen by putin as weakness and invites the very aggression we seek to avoid. the ukrainian people aren't asking for u.s. troops. they are simply asking for the right tools to defend themselves and their country, and those are the tools that this legislation would provide. we have seen vladimir putin commit aggression, draw back, commit more aggression, draw back. we are now in the phase where any day now we will see continued aggression and territory-grabbing by vladimir putin as he establishes his land bridge to crimea and puts additional pressures on baltic countries and moldova. meanwhile, we refuse to give the ukrainians weapons with which to defend themselves. this bill does not force the president to provide lethal assistance to ukraine. trust me, if there were a way to do that, it would be in this bill. the president has a decision to make on providing lethal assistance to ukraine. that decision has consequences far beyond whether the president obligates the full amount of funds authorized in a decision that is long overdue. making matters worse, the statement of administration policy seeks flexibility to continue our nation's dependence on russian rocket engines. the ndaa would put an end to this dependence by 2019 and stop hundreds of millions of dollars from going to vladimir putin and his cronies. it eliminates a launch subsidy that the commander of air force space command has stated impedes fair competition, and it directs the administration to stop playing games, develop a domestic rocket engine--not a new rocket system--to replace the russian rd-180. the russians are being paid billions of dollars for their rocket engines, and there is a ``middle man'' who has made tens of millions of dollars just by moving those rockets from russia to the united states. there is an individual who runs this outfit who has been sanctioned by the u.s. government, and we have elements in the pentagon who still want to deal with him for as long as possible. in testimony before the armed services committee in march, gen. john kelly, the commander of u.s. southern command, testified: ``with the amount of drugs and people that move across our southwest border, it doesn't seem all that secure to me.'' general kelly went on to state that the threat of terrorists crossing our southern border is ``extremely serious'' and that ``if a terrorist or almost anyone wants to get into our country, they just pay the fare.'' they just pay the fare. that is why this bill would provide $45 million for operation phalanx, increasing border security operations by the national guard along the southern border, and boosting aerial surveillance of the region by up to 60 percent. to date, operation phalanx has directly contributed to more than 96,000 apprehensions along the border and the interdiction of more than 282,000 pounds of drugs destined for our communities. the legislation directs the secretary of defense to provide up to $75 million in additional assistance to customs and border protection operations to secure the southern border, potentially including the deployment of personnel, surveillance assets, and intelligence support from the u.s. military. the ndaa would authorize an additional $50 million to address u.s. southern command's unfunded priorities to increase surveillance and interdiction operations in central america--a primary transit point for illicit trafficking into the united states. finally, i am disappointed by the administration's puzzling response to provisions in the ndaa related to the detention facility at guantanamo bay. the administration argues that this legislation's limitations placed on guantanamo bay transfers are unnecessary and beyond the scope of congressional authority. that is false. congress has long had constitutional authority over wartime detention matters, and there are good reasons for congress to assert its authority in this instance. for over 6 years, the administration has stated that one of its highest policy priorities is to close the detention facility at guantanamo bay. but for that same period of time, members of the senate have repeatedly requested a plan that explains how the administration will handle each of the detainees currently held there, and unfortunately, over the last 6\1/2\ years, the administration has consistently failed to provide that plan. as the terrorist threat continues around the world and grows and metastasizes, the administration continues to demand that the facility be closed while failing to explain how it will do so. there are serious legal and security challenges inherent in moving this population to other locations, whether inside or outside of the united states. congress is simply asking the executive branch to explain where it will hold those set for trial, how it will continue to detain dangerous terrorists pursuant to the laws of war, and how it [[page s3854]] will mitigate the risks of moving this population. if the administration can provide those answers to these basic questions to the satisfaction of the american people, then congressional restrictions on the movement of these detainees will be lifted and the plan can be implemented. now, congress's need for answers is even more acute after the administration transferred five senior taliban detainees under secret agreement to qatar without prior notification to congress as required by law. the president of the united states blatantly violated the law-- which required, before these five detainees were transferred to qatar, that congress be notified 6 months ahead of time--using the rationale that they were afraid the information might leak. is that justification for breaking the law? and isn't it understandable, the skepticism here on both sides of the aisle about any plan they may have or may not have? isn't it reasonable that the congress of the united states should be presented with a plan, and shouldn't the congress of the united states express its approval or disapproval? the notification standard was enacted into law to allow the president the authority to implement his stated policy but with a good-faith understanding that the people's representative could weigh in on these important decisions before the transfers happened. the president's failure to abide by the notification provisions undermined any trust congress had in the process. now, as the taliban continues to plot attacks against u.s. servicemembers in afghanistan, the administration is scurrying to figure out how to keep those five terrorists from the battlefield. this is not congressional overreach; it is congressional oversight. the president has decided that the security risks of keeping guantanamo open outweigh the security and legal risks of closing it. congress is seeking information that will allow the american people and congress to understand that decision. the american people deserve an explanation for how the president plans to execute one of his most repeated policy goals. there is some dispute about what percentage of those who have been released from detention in guantanamo have reentered the fight. some say it is as high as 30 percent, and some say it is as low as 7 or 8 percent. there is no debate that detainees who were released from guantanamo have reentered the fight, placing the lives of american service men and women in jeopardy and in danger. of course, the five who were released were amongst the toughest, the worst, the hardest cases. now there is some question as to whether they will remain under strict supervision in qatar. let me conclude by simply saying that the ndaa is far too important to be held hostage in a budget negotiation. for 53 consecutive years, the congress has passed a national defense authorization act. with threats to our national security multiplying around the world, i would hope this year would be no different. i thank my colleague from rhode island for all of the hard work he and his staff and members on that side of the aisle have done in order to have legislation that passed overwhelmingly through the senate armed services committee. i hope we can move forward on getting that legislation through the senate, in consultation and in compromise with the house, and to the white house for the president's signature. i would say again that i read carefully the administration's objection to the legislation as it now stands. these are not valid in some cases. in other cases, we would be glad to negotiate with the white house as we go to conference with the house after completing this. i sincerely hope and pray that--there are so many provisions there that are important to the lives of the men and women serving in the military that i would hope the president would take into consideration how important this is to the men and women who are serving, their lives and their welfare, their equipment, their training, and their ability to defend this nation. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer (mr. lankford). the clerk will call the roll the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. reed. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. amendment no. 1559, as modified mr. reed. mr. president, i have a modification to amendment no. 1559, which i offered on behalf of senator durbin, and i ask that the amendment be so modified. the presiding officer. the senator has that right. the amendment is so modified. the amendment, as modified, is as follows: at the end of subtitle b of title viii, add the following: sec. 832. prohibition on awarding of department of defense contracts to inverted domestic corporations. (a) prohibition.--chapter 137 of title 10, united states code, is amended by adding at the end the following new section: ``sec. 2338. prohibition on awarding contracts to inverted domestic corporations ``(a) prohibition.-- ``(1) in general.--the head of an agency may not award a contract for the procurement of property or services to-- ``(a) any foreign incorporated entity that such head has determined is an inverted domestic corporation or any subsidiary of such entity;

Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the Frances Perkins Center on the designation of the Frances Perkins Homestead, located in Newcastle, ME, as a National Historic Landmark. The Brick House was the home of the remarkable Frances Perkins, the first woman appointed to a Presidential cabinet. This is an honor that has been given to only 2,500 other historic places in the United States and I applaud the Frances Perkins Center for receiving this distinction. Frances Perkins found that no matter where she lived during her life, her true home would always be in Maine. While she was born in Boston in 1880, both of her parents were native Mainers. She grew up living in Worcester and spending summers with her grandmother on the family's saltwater farm in Newcastle. Frances credited her own character to be a direct result of her grandmother's influence and their time together in Maine. Frances was a motivated and inquisitive person from a young age. She attended Classical High School in Worcester and, though it was uncommon at the time, she went on to Mount Holyoke College where she was a standout student. Professors immediately noticed Frances' ambition and natural intellect. Frances graduated from Mont Holyoke in 1902 with a major in physics and minors in chemistry and biology. Throughout her life, Frances was devoted to improving the lives of American workers. After college, Frances moved to Illinois, working as a teacher and volunteering in settlement houses. She then received her master's degree from Colombia and subsequently began her extraordinary career in public service, working for the New York City Consumers League and then the New York State Industrial Commission. The impressive work by Frances for the Industrial Commission led to newly elected New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt to name her New York State Commissioner of Labor. She received attention and admiration in this role for her ceaseless commitment to improving work conditions in New York. In February 1933, Roosevelt appointed Frances Secretary of Labor in his Presidential cabinet. Frances was the first female Federal cabinet official, which remains one of her most notable and outstanding achievements. Frances' accomplishments as Secretary of Labor had, and continue to have, a profound impact on American lives. Frances was the lead architect in designing New Deal policies during the Great Depression; however, her work did not stop there. She was incredibly influential in creating legislation for Social Security and establishing a 40-hour work week. Frances is also known for her major role in prohibiting child labor, enforcing worker's rights, and designing unemployment insurance as well as workers' aid. Frances' beliefs, values, and spirit grew from her strong connection to Maine. Frances regularly returned to her Maine home, especially when she desired a haven to rest and remember her roots. She owned and maintained the family farm in Newcastle from 1927 until she died on May 14, 1965 at the age of 85. She is buried nearby the homestead. I am thrilled at the nomination of the Frances Perkins Homestead as a National Historic Landmark. Frances was a fearless leader who exemplified American values of hard work and determination. Frances' work lives on as an essential benefit to countless American citizens. I am proud that her legacy is a part of Maine's history and I warmly congratulate the Frances Perkins Homestead, and all those involved with achieving this accomplishment, on its dedication as a National Historic Landmark. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 90 (Monday, June 8, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S3856] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS ______ CONGRATULATING THE FRANCES PERKINS CENTER Mr. KING.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize the Girl Scouts of America on the occasion of their 103rd Anniversary. The Girl Scouts were created in 1912 in the midst of the progressive movement by Juliette Gordon Low for the purpose of empowering young women and instilling them with character, honesty, patriotism, and leadership skills. The independence and integrity that young women develop with the Girl Scouts is a priceless resource for these girls later in life. For 103 years, the Girl Scouts have influenced female leaders, and have led the fight for equality and inclusiveness in leadership positions. The fact that former girl scouts make up 60 percent of the women in the House of Representatives and over 50 percent of current female business owners demonstrates the organization's ability to cultivate leaders. Through the Girl Scouts, girls have gained skills that are essential tools to help women achieve equality in leadership positions. The Girl Scouts have also developed and implemented programs to help middle and high school girls become financially literate and independent. Indeed, the Girl Scout Cookie Program is the largest girl- led business in the world and is a hallmark program that helps girls across the country develop the skills, such as money management, customer interaction, and business ethics, which are essential to life- long success. They have also invested in science and mathematics programs to empower young women who have an interest in those fields. Through their continued efforts to develop girls' leadership abilities, confidence, and worldly knowledge, the Girl Scouts have played an important role in helping young women reach their full potential. Today, I mark the legacy and future of this invaluable organization. I applaud the Girl Scouts of Maine, and America, for the immeasurable impact they have had on women's rights, and women themselves, over the past 103 years. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 90 (Monday, June 8, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S3856] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GIRL SCOUTS OF AMERICA 103RD ANNIVERSARY Mr. KING.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize the Girl Scouts of America on the occasion of their 103rd Anniversary. The Girl Scouts were created in 1912 in the midst of the progressive movement by Juliette Gordon Low for the purpose of empowering young women and instilling them with character, honesty, patriotism, and leadership skills. The independence and integrity that young women develop with the Girl Scouts is a priceless resource for these girls later in life. For 103 years, the Girl Scouts have influenced female leaders, and have led the fight for equality and inclusiveness in leadership positions. The fact that former girl scouts make up 60 percent of the women in the House of Representatives and over 50 percent of current female business owners demonstrates the organization's ability to cultivate leaders. Through the Girl Scouts, girls have gained skills that are essential tools to help women achieve equality in leadership positions. The Girl Scouts have also developed and implemented programs to help middle and high school girls become financially literate and independent. Indeed, the Girl Scout Cookie Program is the largest girl- led business in the world and is a hallmark program that helps girls across the country develop the skills, such as money management, customer interaction, and business ethics, which are essential to life- long success. They have also invested in science and mathematics programs to empower young women who have an interest in those fields. Through their continued efforts to develop girls' leadership abilities, confidence, and worldly knowledge, the Girl Scouts have played an important role in helping young women reach their full potential. Today, I mark the legacy and future of this invaluable organization.

OGDEN Mr. KING. Mr. President, I wish to honor the career of LTC Peter W. Ogden, who will retire this June as director of the Bureau of Veterans' Services. Peter has served in this role for the past 11 years and I am profoundly grateful for all that he has done for Maine and our esteemed veterans. Peter began serving the Nation and the State of Maine long before his position as director. He enlisted in the U.S Army Corps of Engineers in 1967 and in the following years he completed two combat tours in Vietnam. After graduating from Maine Military Academy as a Distinguished Graduate, Peter served in the Maine Army National Guard. In total, Peter spent an impressive 28 years of his life dedicated to military service. Peter is an excellent example of a person who brings personal and selfless commitment to his career. As a veteran himself, Peter has a complete and thorough understanding of the challenges and issues veterans face on a regular basis. He has worked tirelessly to provide Maine veterans and their families with informational services, assistance programs, and strong representation. Through his work as director, Peter has improved the lives of countless Maine veterans and families. The programs and services Peter developed while director are essential to veterans as well as military men, women and families. I was particularly impressed by Peter's work supporting [[Page S3857]] Gold Star families through projects such as House in the Woods. This project continues to help both families and veterans cope with loss by providing a close support network and outdoor-related experiences, from fishing to hiking. I greatly value public servants like Peter and I have a high appreciation for the essential and high-quality service he has ensured for Maine veterans during his time as director of the Bureau of Veterans' Services. I extend my sincerest congratulations and gratitude to Peter for all of his accomplishments and I wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 90 (Monday, June 8, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S3856-S3857] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL PETER W.

CREC-2015-06-08-pt1-PgS3857,CREC-2015-06-08,114,CONGRATULATING SOUTHERN MAINE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 90 (Monday, June 8, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S3857] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING SOUTHERN MAINE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION Mr. KING. Mr. President, today I bring to the fore an organization that serves as a model for coordinated economic development and environmental responsibility. Later this month, the Southern Maine Planning and Development Commission, or SMPDC, will celebrate its 50th anniversary. This milestone is a testament not only to its longevity and breadth, but also to its ability to continually develop pertinent projects for southern Maine's economy. They are truly an inspiration for similar initiatives across the country and around the globe. SMPDC is a Council of Governments enabled by State statute that serves the southern part of our great State in 39 communities. As this region forms the southern tip of Maine, it injects economic vitality to all corners of the State as the ``Gateway to Maine.'' It boasts 300 miles of breathtaking coastline--with rocky points, quiet inlets, and sandy beaches. This coastline alone brings in thousands of tourists each year who wish to share the marvels of our distinct and special home. This region also extends westward toward the White Mountains, an area dotted with numerous lakes, fertile lands, dense forests, and crossed by the mighty Saco River. To help maintain this land for us and for future generations, the folks at SMPDC offer comprehensive planning and ordinance revision to communities to ensure they achieve the appropriate growth while preserving the land and shoreline that so characterizes the Maine way of life. Being the Gateway to Maine, and given the recent Federal gridlock over properly funding the Highway Trust Fund, I would be remiss not to mention the commission's work to assist municipalities throughout the region in transportation project planning and management. They have rallied local leaders and first responders to address the emergencies on the roads and made the veins of our economy safer through their Traffic Incident Management Group--which in 2007 was given the Excellence in Regional Transportation Award by the National Association of Development. Furthermore, with I-95 and Amtrak pouring resources and revenue into the State, SMPDC has been essential to coordinating community action to ensure we make the most of these assets. And even while focusing on the largest arteries of transportation in the area, the commission has not turned a blind eye to the scenic roads and healthy travel alternatives that encourage people to get outdoors and reaffirms access and economic prospects for Maine's vibrant eco- tourism industry. Teaming up with the Bicycle Coalition of Maine, SMPDC has successfully implemented the York County Active Communities Network. This initiative explores the potential for improvements and funding opportunities for those looking to bike or walk safely and freely throughout their community. The group has also added further economic vitality to Maine through its work with the Pequawket Trail Scenic Byway, which winds its way through the White Mountains in western Maine and along the Saco River. This Corridor Management Plan floods the scenic towns along it with visitors and economic opportunity from downtown Standish to historic Fryeburg. Perhaps what the commission is most widely recognized for is their success with the Brownfields Redevelopment Project, which is funded in part by the EPA's Brownfield and Land Revitalization Program. Brownfields are abandoned or underused industrial and commercial properties that have some threat of environmental contamination, whether it is real or perceived. Beginning in 2004, the Brownfield Redevelopment Project started funding ventures throughout southern Maine to rebuild old dams, mills, and other previously condemned facilities to help reintroduce many of Maine's beautiful, historic buildings to their communities. South Berwick now boasts a fantastic renovated library and Kennebunk even retooled a gas station to create a community ice rink, while the mills in Sanford and Biddeford are teeming with hundreds of new businesses. At an event earlier in the year, the EPA cited SMPDC as one of the top 10 in the Nation for their wide ranging success with these projects. This work is truly exciting and a perfect demonstration of SMPDC's powerful impact on southern Maine. As the Southern Maine Planning and Development Council ushers in their 50th anniversary on June 24, we should take time to reflect on the countless dedicated public servants who have worked with unwavering commitment to better their communities. I am deeply grateful for their countless accomplishments, and look forward to the many more inspiring and productive projects they undertake in the future. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 90 (Monday, June 8, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S3857] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING SOUTHERN MAINE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION Mr. KING.

While much of the world considers the U.S. to be a relative newcomer to the global soccer community on the men's side of the game, our women's team is unmatched in its esteem, having won two World Cup titles since the tournament began in 1991 and never finishing below third place. I hope that this U.S. team will build upon its rich history of success at the seventh Women's World Cup.

A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the State of Washington urging the United States Congress to support the conversion of the 81st Armored Brigade Combat Team of the Washington National Guard into a Stryker Brigade Combat Team with brigade units stationed in Washington, Oregon, and California; to the Committee on Armed Services. Senate Joint Memorial 8008 Whereas, The opportunity exists to add a second Stryker Brigade Combat Team to the Army National Guard's force structure, and to locate this Brigade on the west coast; and Whereas, There are a variety of practical and strategic reasons which make the 81st Armored Brigade Combat Team a logical candidate for conversion; and Whereas, A Stryker Brigade Combat Team stationed on the west coast will strengthen our nation's defense by maintaining Stryker capacity focused on the Asia-Pacific Region, enhance Regular Army/Army National Guard partnership, and provide a key domestic response capability; and Whereas, Transitioning the 81st Armored Brigade Combat Team to a Stryker Brigade Combat Team strategically places Strykers in Washington, Oregon, and California, and will save taxpayers thirty million dollars over the course of an army force generation cycle; and Whereas, The 81st Armored Brigade Combat Team is headquartered at Camp Murray, Washington, located just across the street from Joint Base Lewis-McChord, which is the United States Army's Stryker Center of Excellence and is within convoy range of the Yakima Training Center; and Whereas, The extensive Stryker infrastructure available at Joint Base Lewis-McChord and the Yakima Training Center represents a great advantage in leveraging shared resources; and Whereas, Furthermore, this places the Stryker Brigade Combat Team equipment sets brought back from overseas contingencies into mission-ready use, and available for overseas and domestic contingency response; and Whereas, Strykers will also give the governors of Washington, Oregon, and California a fast, durable, and effective asset to save lives, protect property, maintain peace, and ensure the continuity of government in times of emergency; Now, therefore, Your Memorialists respectfully pray that as you consider force structure balance in this era of constrained resources, coupled with the tactical, strategic, and domestic needs of our nation, you will support the conversion of the 81st Armored Brigade Combat Team of the Washington National Guard into a Stryker Brigade Combat Team with brigade units stationed in Washington, Oregon, and California. Be it resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately transmitted to the Honorable Barack Obama, President of the United States, General Frank J. Grass, Chief of the National Guard Bureau, the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and each member of Congress from the State of Washington. ____ POM-34. A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the State of Washington urging the United States Congress to expedite appropriation of funds, for Columbia River Basin dreissenid efforts, to significantly enhance monitoring and prevention efforts and to implement the intent of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Senate Joint Memorial 8013 Whereas, Maintaining a healthy suite of economic, environmental, and social ecosystem services in aquatic systems is integral to the quality of life in the State of Washington; and Whereas, Healthy aquatic habitats provide clean drinking water, flood control, transportation, recreation, purification of human and industrial wastes, power generation, habitat for native plants and animals, production of fish and other foods, marketable goods, and cultural benefits; and Whereas, Aquatic invasive species, including Dreissenids (quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) and zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha)), are invasive species that cause irreparable ecological damage to many waters in the United States; and Whereas, Dreissenids have not yet been detected in the Pacific Northwest. The estimated annual cost to address established populations of dreissenids in the Pacific Northwest economic region is almost five hundred million dollars annually; and Whereas, The Water Resources Reform and Development Act was signed in June 2014. It authorizes twenty million dollars for Columbia River Basin dreissenid efforts through the Secretary of the Army; Now, therefore, Your Memorialists respectfully request that Congress expedite appropriation of these funds to significantly enhance monitoring and prevention efforts and to implement the intent of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act. Be it resolved; That copies of this Memorial be immediately transmitted to the Honorable Barack Obama, President of the United States, Sally Jewell, Secretary of the Department of the Interior, the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and each member of Congress from the State of Washington. ____ POM-35. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of the State of Nevada urging the United States Congress to amend the Migratory Bird Treaty Act or take any other appropriate action to ensure that the common raven is not a protected species under the Act; to the Committee on Environmental and Public Works. Assembly Joint Resolution No. 2 Whereas, The greater sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) is a species of bird that inhabits much of the sagebrush habitat in Nevada as well as other western states; and Whereas, The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that the greater sage grouse is warranted for listing as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1531 et seq.; and Whereas, Through the enactment of Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 15, File Number 48, Statutes of Nevada 2005, at page 3022, the members of the 73rd Session of the Nevada Legislature found that the listing of the greater sage grouse as an endangered or threatened species would have a devastatingly negative impact on Nevada's land development, land use, water use, mining, recreational activities and local economies; and Whereas, The desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) is a species of tortoise that inhabits the desert habitat of the southwestern United States, including the Mojave desert region of southern Nevada; and Whereas, The desert tortoise is listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 16 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1531 et seq.; and Whereas, The common raven (Corvus corax) is a species of bird that inhabits Nevada and much of the western United States, Mexico, Canada, Europe and Asia; and [[Page S3860]] Whereas, The International Union for Conservation of Nature estimates the global population of the common raven as greater than 16 million and trending upwards, thus classifying it as a species of least concern; and Whereas, A known cause of decline in the sage grouse population is egg depredation by the common raven, and research conducted at Idaho State University has suggested that reductions in the raven population significantly increase sage grouse nest success; and Whereas, The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has identified the common raven as the most highly visible predator of hatchling and juvenile desert tortoises, and research published by the Western Ecological Research Center of the United States Geological Survey recommends controlling certain raven populations to assist in the recovery of desert tortoise populations; and Whereas, The common raven is a protected species under regulations adopted pursuant to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, 16 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1703 et seq., which drastically curtails the ability of this State to manage the population of the common raven in order to protect sage grouse nests and desert tortoises: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of Nevada, Jointly, That the members of the 78th Session of the Nevada Legislature urge the United States Congress to amend the Migratory Bird Treaty Act or take any other appropriate action to ensure that the common raven is not a protected species under that Act; and be it further Resolved, That the members of the 78th Session of the Nevada Legislature urge the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to: 1. Work with the Nevada Department of Wildlife to decrease common raven populations in this State; and 2. Adopt regulations allowing the State of Nevada to manage the common raven population and reduce the number of common ravens in this State; and be it further Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of the United States as the presiding officer of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, each member of the Nevada Congressional Delegation, the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the President of the Nevada Cattlemen's Association, the President of the Nevada Farm Bureau Federation, the Chair of the Sagebrush Ecosystem Council and the Executive Director of the Western Governors' Association; and be it further Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon passage. ____ POM-36. A resolution adopted by the House of Representatives of the State of Michigan urging the President of the United States to allow an additional 25,000 refugee visas for certain displaced individuals, with preference for placement in Michigan; to the Committee on the Judiciary. House Resolution No. 9 Whereas, The United States has long been a safe harbor for persecuted foreign nationals. Through the U.S. refugee visa program, individuals and their families who are harassed, oppressed, or have faced harassment or oppression at home because of their race, religion, nationality, public opinion, or social association can find relief in the U.S. When a humanitarian crisis occurs, the U.S. may also grant eligible individuals refugee visas. Once in the country, federal resettlement agencies help match refugees with local communities that can help support their needs; and Whereas, The number of refugee visas available is determined and set by the President of the United States. In consultation with the cabinet and the House and Senate committees on the judiciary, the President assesses all concerns of humanitarian and national interest to determine the number of visas that will be available for the upcoming fiscal year; and Whereas, The recent crisis in Syria and Iraq has forced hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, largely from religious minorities in the region--many of which are Assyrians, Chaldeans, Syriacs, and Yazidis--from their hometowns that have been ransacked by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Those displaced persons are unable to return to their homes, and most do not have access to resources needed to fulfill basic needs, including food, water, and shelter. Moreover, these refugees face constant fear of persecution due to nothing more than the faith they claim, and their pronouncement of faith has led to violence as explicit as crucifixions, beheadings, and slavery. Minimal support has been offered to many of the more than three million Iraqis refugees, two million of which were displaced last year alone, and those fortunate to remain in temporary shelters are overburdening and overcrowding neighboring nations and communities who stand on constant guard for fear that they will be the next target of ISIL. As this regional conflict endures, the displacement and imminent migration and persecution of refugees will continue; and Whereas, Displaced Iraqi refugees must be offered relief from this regional instability and granted entry into the United States. Iraqi refugees have complemented our American society with a proven history of contributing to the economic and social well-being of this nation. In the Chaldean or Catholic Iraqi community of Metro Detroit, which is the largest concentration of Chaldeans outside of Iraq, 61 percent of households founded their own business, and this network of businesses is indispensable to the local economy. Moreover, organizations like the Chaldean Community Foundation offer resources to bind and strengthen the community as well as welcome and support refugees, in part by using community businesses to invest in new members and encourage the advancement of the community; and Whereas, The current allotment of refugee visas may not be adequate to accommodate these individuals. When an unforeseen emergency arises, the President has the flexibility to issue emergency refugee visas for an affected group if the remaining annual allotment is insufficient to assist these displaced individuals, and Whereas, The Chaldean Church and its bishop have garnered support for this request and driven a body of people able and willing to sustain and support the incoming refugees. The community stands ready to assist persecuted Iraqis and victims of war rebuild their lives in the U.S.: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we urge the President of the United States to allow an additional 25,000 refugee visas for displaced Iraqis, being the Assyrians, Chaldeans, Syriacs, and Yazidis displaced because of their faith; and be it further Resolved, That we urge that these refugees be given preference for placement in the state of Michigan; and be it further Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to the President of the United States, the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan congressional delegation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 90 (Monday, June 8, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S3859-S3860] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS The following petitions and memorials were laid before the Senate and were referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated: POM-33.

Sec. 1703 et seq., which drastically curtails the ability of this State to manage the population of the common raven in order to protect sage grouse nests and desert tortoises: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of Nevada, Jointly, That the members of the 78th Session of the Nevada Legislature urge the United States Congress to amend the Migratory Bird Treaty Act or take any other appropriate action to ensure that the common raven is not a protected species under that Act; and be it further Resolved, That the members of the 78th Session of the Nevada Legislature urge the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to: 1. Work with the Nevada Department of Wildlife to decrease common raven populations in this State; and 2. Adopt regulations allowing the State of Nevada to manage the common raven population and reduce the number of common ravens in this State; and be it further Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of the United States as the presiding officer of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, each member of the Nevada Congressional Delegation, the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the President of the Nevada Cattlemen's Association, the President of the Nevada Farm Bureau Federation, the Chair of the Sagebrush Ecosystem Council and the Executive Director of the Western Governors' Association; and be it further Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon passage. ____ POM-36. A resolution adopted by the House of Representatives of the State of Michigan urging the President of the United States to allow an additional 25,000 refugee visas for certain displaced individuals, with preference for placement in Michigan; to the Committee on the Judiciary. House Resolution No. 9 Whereas, The United States has long been a safe harbor for persecuted foreign nationals. Through the U.S. refugee visa program, individuals and their families who are harassed, oppressed, or have faced harassment or oppression at home because of their race, religion, nationality, public opinion, or social association can find relief in the U.S. When a humanitarian crisis occurs, the U.S. may also grant eligible individuals refugee visas. Once in the country, federal resettlement agencies help match refugees with local communities that can help support their needs; and Whereas, The number of refugee visas available is determined and set by the President of the United States. In consultation with the cabinet and the House and Senate committees on the judiciary, the President assesses all concerns of humanitarian and national interest to determine the number of visas that will be available for the upcoming fiscal year; and Whereas, The recent crisis in Syria and Iraq has forced hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, largely from religious minorities in the region--many of which are Assyrians, Chaldeans, Syriacs, and Yazidis--from their hometowns that have been ransacked by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Those displaced persons are unable to return to their homes, and most do not have access to resources needed to fulfill basic needs, including food, water, and shelter. Moreover, these refugees face constant fear of persecution due to nothing more than the faith they claim, and their pronouncement of faith has led to violence as explicit as crucifixions, beheadings, and slavery. Minimal support has been offered to many of the more than three million Iraqis refugees, two million of which were displaced last year alone, and those fortunate to remain in temporary shelters are overburdening and overcrowding neighboring nations and communities who stand on constant guard for fear that they will be the next target of ISIL. As this regional conflict endures, the displacement and imminent migration and persecution of refugees will continue; and Whereas, Displaced Iraqi refugees must be offered relief from this regional instability and granted entry into the United States. Iraqi refugees have complemented our American society with a proven history of contributing to the economic and social well-being of this nation. In the Chaldean or Catholic Iraqi community of Metro Detroit, which is the largest concentration of Chaldeans outside of Iraq, 61 percent of households founded their own business, and this network of businesses is indispensable to the local economy. Moreover, organizations like the Chaldean Community Foundation offer resources to bind and strengthen the community as well as welcome and support refugees, in part by using community businesses to invest in new members and encourage the advancement of the community; and Whereas, The current allotment of refugee visas may not be adequate to accommodate these individuals. When an unforeseen emergency arises, the President has the flexibility to issue emergency refugee visas for an affected group if the remaining annual allotment is insufficient to assist these displaced individuals, and Whereas, The Chaldean Church and its bishop have garnered support for this request and driven a body of people able and willing to sustain and support the incoming refugees. The community stands ready to assist persecuted Iraqis and victims of war rebuild their lives in the U.S.: Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we urge the President of the United States to allow an additional 25,000 refugee visas for displaced Iraqis, being the Assyrians, Chaldeans, Syriacs, and Yazidis displaced because of their faith; and be it further Resolved, That we urge that these refugees be given preference for placement in the state of Michigan; and be it further Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to the President of the United States, the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan congressional delegation. ____________________",package_114_85.csv,14131,14131,14196,"[congressional record volume 161, number 90 (monday, june 8, 2015)] [senate] [pages s3859-s3860] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] petitions and memorials the following petitions and memorials were laid before the senate and were referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated: pom-33. a joint memorial adopted by the legislature of the state of washington urging the united states congress to support the conversion of the 81st armored brigade combat team of the washington national guard into a stryker brigade combat team with brigade units stationed in washington, oregon, and california; to the committee on armed services. senate joint memorial 8008 whereas, the opportunity exists to add a second stryker brigade combat team to the army national guard's force structure, and to locate this brigade on the west coast; and whereas, there are a variety of practical and strategic reasons which make the 81st armored brigade combat team a logical candidate for conversion; and whereas, a stryker brigade combat team stationed on the west coast will strengthen our nation's defense by maintaining stryker capacity focused on the asia-pacific region, enhance regular army/army national guard partnership, and provide a key domestic response capability; and whereas, transitioning the 81st armored brigade combat team to a stryker brigade combat team strategically places strykers in washington, oregon, and california, and will save taxpayers thirty million dollars over the course of an army force generation cycle; and whereas, the 81st armored brigade combat team is headquartered at camp murray, washington, located just across the street from joint base lewis-mcchord, which is the united states army's stryker center of excellence and is within convoy range of the yakima training center; and whereas, the extensive stryker infrastructure available at joint base lewis-mcchord and the yakima training center represents a great advantage in leveraging shared resources; and whereas, furthermore, this places the stryker brigade combat team equipment sets brought back from overseas contingencies into mission-ready use, and available for overseas and domestic contingency response; and whereas, strykers will also give the governors of washington, oregon, and california a fast, durable, and effective asset to save lives, protect property, maintain peace, and ensure the continuity of government in times of emergency; now, therefore, your memorialists respectfully pray that as you consider force structure balance in this era of constrained resources, coupled with the tactical, strategic, and domestic needs of our nation, you will support the conversion of the 81st armored brigade combat team of the washington national guard into a stryker brigade combat team with brigade units stationed in washington, oregon, and california. be it resolved, that copies of this memorial be immediately transmitted to the honorable barack obama, president of the united states, general frank j. grass, chief of the national guard bureau, the president of the united states senate, the speaker of the house of representatives, and each member of congress from the state of washington. ____ pom-34. a joint memorial adopted by the legislature of the state of washington urging the united states congress to expedite appropriation of funds, for columbia river basin dreissenid efforts, to significantly enhance monitoring and prevention efforts and to implement the intent of the water resources reform and development act; to the committee on environment and public works. senate joint memorial 8013 whereas, maintaining a healthy suite of economic, environmental, and social ecosystem services in aquatic systems is integral to the quality of life in the state of washington; and whereas, healthy aquatic habitats provide clean drinking water, flood control, transportation, recreation, purification of human and industrial wastes, power generation, habitat for native plants and animals, production of fish and other foods, marketable goods, and cultural benefits; and whereas, aquatic invasive species, including dreissenids (quagga mussels (dreissena rostriformis bugensis) and zebra mussels (dreissena polymorpha)), are invasive species that cause irreparable ecological damage to many waters in the united states; and whereas, dreissenids have not yet been detected in the pacific northwest. the estimated annual cost to address established populations of dreissenids in the pacific northwest economic region is almost five hundred million dollars annually; and whereas, the water resources reform and development act was signed in june 2014. it authorizes twenty million dollars for columbia river basin dreissenid efforts through the secretary of the army; now, therefore, your memorialists respectfully request that congress expedite appropriation of these funds to significantly enhance monitoring and prevention efforts and to implement the intent of the water resources reform and development act. be it resolved; that copies of this memorial be immediately transmitted to the honorable barack obama, president of the united states, sally jewell, secretary of the department of the interior, the president of the united states senate, the speaker of the house of representatives, and each member of congress from the state of washington. ____ pom-35. a joint resolution adopted by the legislature of the state of nevada urging the united states congress to amend the migratory bird treaty act or take any other appropriate action to ensure that the common raven is not a protected species under the act; to the committee on environmental and public works. assembly joint resolution no. 2 whereas, the greater sage grouse (centrocercus urophasianus) is a species of bird that inhabits much of the sagebrush habitat in nevada as well as other western states; and whereas, the united states fish and wildlife service has determined that the greater sage grouse is warranted for listing as endangered or threatened under the endangered species act of 1973, 16 u.s.c. sec. sec. 1531 et seq.; and whereas, through the enactment of senate concurrent resolution no. 15, file number 48, statutes of nevada 2005, at page 3022, the members of the 73rd session of the nevada legislature found that the listing of the greater sage grouse as an endangered or threatened species would have a devastatingly negative impact on nevada's land development, land use, water use, mining, recreational activities and local economies; and whereas, the desert tortoise (gopherus agassizii) is a species of tortoise that inhabits the desert habitat of the southwestern united states, including the mojave desert region of southern nevada;

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL VACANCIES REFORM ACT OF 1998 WITH RESPECT TO INSPECTORS GENERAL. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) There are 4 Presidentially-appointed Inspector General vacancies for which a nomination is not pending before the Senate. (2) Sections 3345 through 3349d of title 5, United States Code, (in this section referred to as the ``Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998'') prohibit an acting officer from serving in that position for longer than 210 days. (3) Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, the actions of an acting officer serving beyond the 210-day period ``shall have no force or effect'', but this does not apply to an acting Inspector General. (4) The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 provides an exception to the enforcement clause for acting Inspectors General to ensure a President cannot leave a watchdog in place who has no power or authority and therefore provides no mechanism to enforce the 210-day limit for acting Inspectors General. (5) For 6 of the 7 Presidentially-appointed Inspector General vacancies, the individual serving in the office in an acting capacity has been serving for more than 210 days, in violation of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998. (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that-- (1) the President should comply with the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 and fill vacancies of Presidentially- appointed positions, including Inspectors General, within 210 days of the position becoming vacant; and (2) the President cannot avoid this requirement merely by changing the title of an acting officer if that officer still retains the same or substantially similar duties as an acting officer in that office. ______ SA 1802. Mr. JOHNSON submitted an amendment intended to be proposed to amendment SA 1463 proposed by Mr. McCain to the bill H.R. 1735, to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2016 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table, as follows: At the end of subtitle G of title X, add the following: SEC. 1085. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING NOMINATING A PERMANENT INSPECTOR GENERAL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) There are 4 Presidentially-appointed Inspector General vacancies for which a nomination is not pending before the Senate. (2) It is vital that Offices of Inspectors General remain independent. (3) In the absence of a permanent Inspector General, an Office of Inspector General is run by an acting Inspector General who, no matter how qualified or well-intentioned, is not granted the same protections afforded to an Inspector General who is confirmed by the Senate, as the acting Inspector General-- (A) is not truly independent; (B) may be removed by the head of the agency at any time; (C) only serves temporarily and does not drive the policy of the Office; and (D) is at a greater risk of compromising the work of the Office to appease the agency or the President. (4) One of the current Presidentially-appointed Inspector General vacancies is the Inspector General of the Department of Veterans Affairs, which has been vacant since December 31, 2013. (5) The acting Inspector General of the Department of Veterans Affairs, who has served in the position since December 31, 2013, is not properly independent from the Department of Veterans Affairs, is unresponsive to Congress, lacks transparency to the public, and has lost the trust of whistleblowers at the Department of Veterans Affairs. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the President should nominate a permanent Inspector General of the Department of Veterans Affairs not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act. ______ SA 1803.

(4) The arrest of former President Mohamed Nasheed this year was widely condemned as politically-motivated and his conviction and sentence of 13 years in prison has been condemned by Amnesty International as a ``travesty of justice''. (5) United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad described ``flagrant irregularities'' in the trial of President Nasheed, including conflicts of interests by the judges and the court's refusal to allow him to present any defense witnesses. (6) On May 1, 2015, tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets in Male, Maldives, and were met with violence, tear gas, and stun guns by security forces. More than 200 people were arrested. (7) In his speech in Sri Lanka on May 2, 2015, Secretary of State John Kerry said ``[W]e've seen even now how regrettably there are troubling signs that democracy is under threat in the Maldives where the former president Nasheed has been imprisoned without due process. And that is an injustice that must be addressed soon''. (8) On June 2, 2015, the Government of the Maldives charged three more leaders of opposition parties with terrorism. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the Government of the Maldives should immediately release former President Nasheed and all political prisoners in the country, and guarantee human rights for all of the citizens of the Maldives. ______ SA 1828.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL VACANCIES REFORM ACT OF 1998 WITH RESPECT TO INSPECTORS GENERAL. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) There are 4 Presidentially-appointed Inspector General vacancies for which a nomination is not pending before the Senate. (2) Sections 3345 through 3349d of title 5, United States Code, (in this section referred to as the ``Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998'') prohibit an acting officer from serving in that position for longer than 210 days. (3) Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, the actions of an acting officer serving beyond the 210-day period ``shall have no force or effect'', but this does not apply to an acting Inspector General. (4) The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 provides an exception to the enforcement clause for acting Inspectors General to ensure a President cannot leave a watchdog in place who has no power or authority and therefore provides no mechanism to enforce the 210-day limit for acting Inspectors General. (5) For 6 of the 7 Presidentially-appointed Inspector General vacancies, the individual serving in the office in an acting capacity has been serving for more than 210 days, in violation of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998. (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that-- (1) the President should comply with the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 and fill vacancies of Presidentially- appointed positions, including Inspectors General, within 210 days of the position becoming vacant; and (2) the President cannot avoid this requirement merely by changing the title of an acting officer if that officer still retains the same or substantially similar duties as an acting officer in that office. ______ SA 1802. Mr. JOHNSON submitted an amendment intended to be proposed to amendment SA 1463 proposed by Mr. McCain to the bill H.R. 1735, to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2016 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table, as follows: At the end of subtitle G of title X, add the following: SEC. 1085. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING NOMINATING A PERMANENT INSPECTOR GENERAL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) There are 4 Presidentially-appointed Inspector General vacancies for which a nomination is not pending before the Senate. (2) It is vital that Offices of Inspectors General remain independent. (3) In the absence of a permanent Inspector General, an Office of Inspector General is run by an acting Inspector General who, no matter how qualified or well-intentioned, is not granted the same protections afforded to an Inspector General who is confirmed by the Senate, as the acting Inspector General-- (A) is not truly independent; (B) may be removed by the head of the agency at any time; (C) only serves temporarily and does not drive the policy of the Office; and (D) is at a greater risk of compromising the work of the Office to appease the agency or the President. (4) One of the current Presidentially-appointed Inspector General vacancies is the Inspector General of the Department of Veterans Affairs, which has been vacant since December 31, 2013. (5) The acting Inspector General of the Department of Veterans Affairs, who has served in the position since December 31, 2013, is not properly independent from the Department of Veterans Affairs, is unresponsive to Congress, lacks transparency to the public, and has lost the trust of whistleblowers at the Department of Veterans Affairs. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the President should nominate a permanent Inspector General of the Department of Veterans Affairs not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act. ______ SA 1803.

(2) Increasing human rights violations in the Maldives fuel instability and therefore pose a threat to regional security issues. (3) Since January 2015, President Abdulla Yameen has cracked down on dissent both within his own party and in the political opposition. (4) The arrest of former President Mohamed Nasheed this year was widely condemned as politically-motivated and his conviction and sentence of 13 years in prison has been condemned by Amnesty International as a ``travesty of justice''. (5) United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad described ``flagrant irregularities'' in the trial of President Nasheed, including conflicts of interests by the judges and the court's refusal to allow him to present any defense witnesses. (6) On May 1, 2015, tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets in Male, Maldives, and were met with violence, tear gas, and stun guns by security forces. More than 200 people were arrested. (7) In his speech in Sri Lanka on May 2, 2015, Secretary of State John Kerry said ``[W]e've seen even now how regrettably there are troubling signs that democracy is under threat in the Maldives where the former president Nasheed has been imprisoned without due process. And that is an injustice that must be addressed soon''. (8) On June 2, 2015, the Government of the Maldives charged three more leaders of opposition parties with terrorism. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the Government of the Maldives should immediately release former President Nasheed and all political prisoners in the country, and guarantee human rights for all of the citizens of the Maldives. ______ SA 1828.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL VACANCIES REFORM ACT OF 1998 WITH RESPECT TO INSPECTORS GENERAL. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) There are 4 Presidentially-appointed Inspector General vacancies for which a nomination is not pending before the Senate. (2) Sections 3345 through 3349d of title 5, United States Code, (in this section referred to as the ``Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998'') prohibit an acting officer from serving in that position for longer than 210 days. (3) Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, the actions of an acting officer serving beyond the 210-day period ``shall have no force or effect'', but this does not apply to an acting Inspector General. (4) The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 provides an exception to the enforcement clause for acting Inspectors General to ensure a President cannot leave a watchdog in place who has no power or authority and therefore provides no mechanism to enforce the 210-day limit for acting Inspectors General.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING NOMINATING A PERMANENT INSPECTOR GENERAL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) There are 4 Presidentially-appointed Inspector General vacancies for which a nomination is not pending before the Senate. (2) It is vital that Offices of Inspectors General remain independent. (3) In the absence of a permanent Inspector General, an Office of Inspector General is run by an acting Inspector General who, no matter how qualified or well-intentioned, is not granted the same protections afforded to an Inspector General who is confirmed by the Senate, as the acting Inspector General-- (A) is not truly independent; (B) may be removed by the head of the agency at any time; (C) only serves temporarily and does not drive the policy of the Office; and (D) is at a greater risk of compromising the work of the Office to appease the agency or the President. (4) One of the current Presidentially-appointed Inspector General vacancies is the Inspector General of the Department of Veterans Affairs, which has been vacant since December 31, 2013. (5) The acting Inspector General of the Department of Veterans Affairs, who has served in the position since December 31, 2013, is not properly independent from the Department of Veterans Affairs, is unresponsive to Congress, lacks transparency to the public, and has lost the trust of whistleblowers at the Department of Veterans Affairs. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the President should nominate a permanent Inspector General of the Department of Veterans Affairs not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act. ______ SA 1803.

(2) Increasing human rights violations in the Maldives fuel instability and therefore pose a threat to regional security issues. (3) Since January 2015, President Abdulla Yameen has cracked down on dissent both within his own party and in the political opposition. (4) The arrest of former President Mohamed Nasheed this year was widely condemned as politically-motivated and his conviction and sentence of 13 years in prison has been condemned by Amnesty International as a ``travesty of justice''. (5) United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad described ``flagrant irregularities'' in the trial of President Nasheed, including conflicts of interests by the judges and the court's refusal to allow him to present any defense witnesses. (6) On May 1, 2015, tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets in Male, Maldives, and were met with violence, tear gas, and stun guns by security forces. More than 200 people were arrested. (7) In his speech in Sri Lanka on May 2, 2015, Secretary of State John Kerry said ``[W]e've seen even now how regrettably there are troubling signs that democracy is under threat in the Maldives where the former president Nasheed has been imprisoned without due process. And that is an injustice that must be addressed soon''. (8) On June 2, 2015, the Government of the Maldives charged three more leaders of opposition parties with terrorism. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the Government of the Maldives should immediately release former President Nasheed and all political prisoners in the country, and guarantee human rights for all of the citizens of the Maldives. ______ SA 1828.

(2) sections 3345 through 3349d of title 5, united states code, (in this section referred to as the ``federal vacancies reform act of 1998'') prohibit an acting officer from serving in that position for longer than 210 days. (3) under the federal vacancies reform act of 1998, the actions of an acting officer serving beyond the 210-day period ``shall have no force or effect'', but this does not apply to an acting inspector general. (4) the federal vacancies reform act of 1998 provides an exception to the enforcement clause for acting inspectors general to ensure a president cannot leave a watchdog in place who has no power or authority and therefore provides no mechanism to enforce the 210-day limit for acting inspectors general. (5) for 6 of the 7 presidentially-appointed inspector general vacancies, the individual serving in the office in an acting capacity has been serving for more than 210 days, in violation of the federal vacancies reform act of 1998.

(a) findings.--congress finds the following: (1) there are 4 presidentially-appointed inspector general vacancies for which a nomination is not pending before the senate. (2) it is vital that offices of inspectors general remain independent. (3) in the absence of a permanent inspector general, an office of inspector general is run by an acting inspector general who, no matter how qualified or well-intentioned, is not granted the same protections afforded to an inspector general who is confirmed by the senate, as the acting inspector general-- (a) is not truly independent; (b) may be removed by the head of the agency at any time; (c) only serves temporarily and does not drive the policy of the office; and (d) is at a greater risk of compromising the work of the office to appease the agency or the president. (4) one of the current presidentially-appointed inspector general vacancies is the inspector general of the department of veterans affairs, which has been vacant since december 31, 2013. (5) the acting inspector general of the department of veterans affairs, who has served in the position since december 31, 2013, is not properly independent from the department of veterans affairs, is unresponsive to congress, lacks transparency to the public, and has lost the trust of whistleblowers at the department of veterans affairs.

CREC-2015-06-08-pt1-PgS3885-4,CREC-2015-06-08,114,NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 90 (Monday, June 8, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S3885-S3887] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Presiding Officer in the Chamber in allowing me to speak this late in the day about issues that are vital to our national defense, which will be addressed tomorrow and during the course of the week in votes on the National Defense Authorization Act. The task before the Senate in the National Defense Authorization Act is nothing less than to craft a sustainable, long-term strategy to defend America. In fact, it is to sustain our global leadership in a time of shifting alliances, significant challenges, and emerging threats, while bringing a long-term balance and sustainability to our military. This defense measure is a solid start, but it must be made stronger to better meet the needs of our military men and women and our Nation as we enter this supremely perilous time. The danger to America has never been greater. Our foes have never been more insidious and pernicious, and many of the States opposing us have never been more willing to take measures that fundamentally contravene not only our security but our sense of moral right and wrong. I approach the National Defense Authorization Act with this principle in mind. Neither the United States nor our troops, nor anyone involved in our national defense should ever face a fair fight. Our men and women in uniform should never be challenged in the air, on the sea or on land with a fair fight. It should be one-sided and in our favor. That is the basic principle. We must be superior in our military Armed Forces. I am grateful to the chairman of our committee, Senator McCain of Arizona, an extraordinarily distinguished veteran and a partner in a number of amendments to this measure, and to the ranking member Senator Jack Reed, also a public servant of extraordinary distinction and a veteran. I am grateful for their leadership in bringing us to this point on a bill that attracted bipartisan support--overwhelming support--on the Armed Services Committee, where I am privileged to serve. The provisions in this bill will enable us to remain the strongest country militarily in the world. At the end of the day, our values, our way of life, and our democracy give us our real strength, but the military is necessary to defend those values and our quality and way of life. The military defends our values and traditions and our fundamental rights and liberties, which we worked hard last week to uphold in the USA FREEDOM Act. I have filed a number of amendments that underscore the need for continuing improvement in this bill. They are forward-looking amendments. One of them would modernize the National Guard's helicopter fleet by providing vital capabilities for the military as well as the sustainability and growth for Connecticut's dedicated defense industry. To protect our heroes in uniform, I have also proposed an amendment that would provide stronger legal tools against predatory lending and other abuses targeting our military men and women nearby the very bases they are stationed. [[Page S3886]] Mr. President, I refer my colleagues to these two amendments, Nos. 1820 and 1564. I also joined Ranking Member Reed in cosponsoring his amendment, which will set forth a responsible and sustainable budget strategy by ending sequestration in our military budget and allowing us to ensure that all of our Nation's key security priorities are addressed. Tomorrow, this body will vote on that amendment. It is a critical vote. It allows us to choose sides as to whether we will put close to $40 billion, in effect, on our national debt rather than in our budget or on our credit card rather than find a sustainable means to pay for it. Each of us will have to decide whether we want to end sequestration, which I am committed to ending, or instead whether we will continue sequestration-and the very real harm it imposes on our nation-by putting an extra $40 billion in the overseas contingent operations account known as OCO. Sequestration cannot be allowed to become a permanent fixture. We must work together in a bipartisan manner to end it. In my time in the U.S. Senate, I have fought for our national defense funding because I believe our troops in harm's way deserve our full, uncompromising, unyielding, and unstinting support. We owe them the best equipment, the best training and supplies, as well as the best institutional support and health care that the world has to offer because they are the best fighting force that our world has ever seen. They fight for a nation that is the best, strongest, and greatest in the history of the world--not only in its military strength but in its fundamental values and freedom that allow us to speak as we wish in this very Chamber, to criticize authority, to speak truth to those in power, to debate, to come together, as we did this past weekend to worship and gather together and say whatever we please and think as we wish. I hope we will address this vital interest in making sure we provide a sustainable source of funding by ending sequestration rather than relying on the overseas contingency operation account, which is a form of borrowing. It increases the deficit; it doesn't reduce it. It diminishes stable and sustainable funding; it doesn't enhance it. It simply provides more uncertainty rather than a long-term strategy. This measure, which I support, enhances our security by providing for the construction of Virginia-class submarines--that are necessary. In fact, the NDAA provides $800 million in additional funding over what the President requested, and it endorses equipping all future attack submarines within an enhanced payload capability. Naval warfare, and particularly undersea warfare, is as relevant and important now as it ever was, and these submarines will do much to enhance our readiness, our nuclear deterrence, our special operations, and our surveillance. They are the stealthiest, strongest weapons platform under the sea ever known to man. Likewise, the research and development in the Ohio replacement program will continue to go forward. The bill provides for $1 billion for six additional Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for the Marine Corps--this is profoundly significant-- as well as $17 million in new military construction for the Connecticut National Guard. There are other measures, but apart from the hard work is an important step for fairness and keeping faith and dealing fairly with our men and women in uniform. This legislation provides for a 1.3 percent pay raise and $85 million to be directed toward improving financial literacy among our servicemembers. That is really the very least we can do. Our military men and women do not do this for the pay or the financial compensation, but for their families' sake, we need to deal with them fairly and keep faith with them. In my role as ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have paid special attention to ensuring that this bill helps to ease the transition of military personnel into civilian life by establishing a new ``Record of Service'' card upon their separation that will help prevent identity theft and financial fraud. I urge the DOD, as does the Armed Services Committee, to discontinue its use of Social Security numbers on military records. It will help prevent identity theft and the kinds of breaches that put our servicemen and their families at risk financially, just as they are often at risk physically in combat. The bill also directs DOD to stem the tide of opioid prescription drug abuse, and it helps military retirees get smoking cessation assistance. I would go further and provide for stronger measures to deal with over-prescription through education programs and drug formularies that provide alternatives, and that is one of the amendments I will offer. Finally, two principal amendments I propose are an amendment to provide additional helicopters for the Army National Guard, which I will speak on now and seek to make pending at a later point, and an amendment improving consumer protections for military personnel and their families, which is currently pending. First, we can greatly strengthen this bill by making a commitment to our National Guard to provide additional helicopters. The UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter is one of the most versatile and heavily used aviation capabilities in the Army National Guard, as well as by all the states in which they serve. The UH-60A is the oldest model Black Hawk in service and is currently flown almost exclusively by the Army National Guard. We can strengthen this bill by fulfilling our commitment to the National Guard in providing 15 additional UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters that are the workhorse of our warriors who serve in our National Guard, warriors who have distinguished themselves not only in combat but also in emergencies and disasters at home. These helicopters will help them serve at home and abroad, which is one of the reasons that acquiring more of these helicopters, M model Black Hawks, are one of the priorities of the National Guard Association. I have listened to the National Guard leaders in Connecticut, and I have listened to distinguished warriors and veterans of the National Guard from around the country, and I know these UH-60 Black Hawks are the workhorses. They are important in medium-lift capability to the National Guard in support of homeland defense and response to emergencies. The UH-60A models now lack onboard capabilities--modern capabilities that would enable them to be deployed overseas in hostile environments without significant upgrades to others parts of their configuration. They need that upgrade to be configured properly. The new aircraft would flow to states all across the country and ensure the National Guard is ready to deploy both at home and abroad. Under the Army's current budget projections, the Army National Guard will not replace their aging UH-60A Black Hawk helicopters until 2025. We need to do better, we need to do it more promptly, and that is why I am proposing amendment No. 1820. The amendment is fully paid for by an offset from the Foreign Currency Fund. The upside of a strengthening American dollar is that the Army can put more funds towards buying American helicopters and spend less in foreign currency expenses. The other principal amendment, which I have made pending to the bill, improves the consumer protections afforded to our servicemembers and their families by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. On the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, penalties, quite bluntly, are too low, and that is why I wish to thank my colleagues Ranking Member Reed as well as Senators Durbin, Murray, and Whitehouse, all of whom have been working tirelessly and have joined me in proposing stronger protections in the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act by doubling the penalties and making them as high as $110,000 for a first violation and $220,000 for a second or subsequent violation. This legislation provides deterrents, punishment, and a stop to this kind of financial abuse that may take place, literally, within sight of military bases. Recently, the Department of Justice used this authority to obtain a civil penalty against Capital One and Sallie Mae. We have seen financial abuse by Capital One, when it foreclosed improperly on servicemembers' homes. These practices can include these kinds of abuses involving foreclosure and other kinds of exploitation which Sallie Mae, unfortunately, engaged in. ``Federal [[Page S3887]] law protects our servicemembers from having to repay loans under terms that are unaffordable or unfair.'' Student lender Sallie Mae sidestepped requirements by charging excessive rates to borrowers who filed documents proving they were members of the U.S. military. For over a decade Sallie Mae violated SCRA by failing to provide over 60,000 military servicemembers with the 6 percent interest rate cap they were entitled to on their student loans. This type of conduct is more than just inappropriate, it is inexcusable, and it will not be tolerated. In addition, my colleagues have been working to make other important improvements to the SCRA. For example, Senator Reed has worked tirelessly to ensure servicemembers can terminate leases on rental properties without early termination fees if they are assigned to, or relocate to, government quarters. Senator Whitehouse has sought to make permanent a one-year post service protection from foreclosure for returning servicemembers and Senator Durbin has been fighting to make sure our servicemembers with student loan debt can take advantage of the protections of the SCRA. I appreciate my colleagues tireless advocacy and look forward to working together to advance these important provisions. I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for Senator Reed's amendment tomorrow. We face critical decisions ahead. This measure has extraordinary merit. We must keep faith with those who serve, and I hope we will when we vote this week on the National Defense Authorization Act. I thank the Presiding Officer. I yield the floor. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 90 (Monday, June 8, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S3885-S3887] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Presiding Officer in the Chamber in allowing me to speak this late in the day about issues that are vital to our national defense, which will be addressed tomorrow and during the course of the week in votes on the National Defense Authorization Act. The task before the Senate in the National Defense Authorization Act is nothing less than to craft a sustainable, long-term strategy to defend America. In fact, it is to sustain our global leadership in a time of shifting alliances, significant challenges, and emerging threats, while bringing a long-term balance and sustainability to our military. This defense measure is a solid start, but it must be made stronger to better meet the needs of our military men and women and our Nation as we enter this supremely perilous time. The danger to America has never been greater. Our foes have never been more insidious and pernicious, and many of the States opposing us have never been more willing to take measures that fundamentally contravene not only our security but our sense of moral right and wrong. I approach the National Defense Authorization Act with this principle in mind. Neither the United States nor our troops, nor anyone involved in our national defense should ever face a fair fight. Our men and women in uniform should never be challenged in the air, on the sea or on land with a fair fight. It should be one-sided and in our favor. That is the basic principle. We must be superior in our military Armed Forces. I am grateful to the chairman of our committee, Senator McCain of Arizona, an extraordinarily distinguished veteran and a partner in a number of amendments to this measure, and to the ranking member Senator Jack Reed, also a public servant of extraordinary distinction and a veteran. I am grateful for their leadership in bringing us to this point on a bill that attracted bipartisan support--overwhelming support--on the Armed Services Committee, where I am privileged to serve. The provisions in this bill will enable us to remain the strongest country militarily in the world. At the end of the day, our values, our way of life, and our democracy give us our real strength, but the military is necessary to defend those values and our quality and way of life. The military defends our values and traditions and our fundamental rights and liberties, which we worked hard last week to uphold in the USA FREEDOM Act. I have filed a number of amendments that underscore the need for continuing improvement in this bill. They are forward-looking amendments. One of them would modernize the National Guard's helicopter fleet by providing vital capabilities for the military as well as the sustainability and growth for Connecticut's dedicated defense industry. To protect our heroes in uniform, I have also proposed an amendment that would provide stronger legal tools against predatory lending and other abuses targeting our military men and women nearby the very bases they are stationed. [[Page S3886]] Mr. President, I refer my colleagues to these two amendments, Nos. 1820 and 1564. I also joined Ranking Member Reed in cosponsoring his amendment, which will set forth a responsible and sustainable budget strategy by ending sequestration in our military budget and allowing us to ensure that all of our Nation's key security priorities are addressed. Tomorrow, this body will vote on that amendment. It is a critical vote. It allows us to choose sides as to whether we will put close to $40 billion, in effect, on our national debt rather than in our budget or on our credit card rather than find a sustainable means to pay for it. Each of us will have to decide whether we want to end sequestration, which I am committed to ending, or instead whether we will continue sequestration-and the very real harm it imposes on our nation-by putting an extra $40 billion in the overseas contingent operations account known as OCO. Sequestration cannot be allowed to become a permanent fixture. We must work together in a bipartisan manner to end it. In my time in the U.S. Senate, I have fought for our national defense funding because I believe our troops in harm's way deserve our full, uncompromising, unyielding, and unstinting support. We owe them the best equipment, the best training and supplies, as well as the best institutional support and health care that the world has to offer because they are the best fighting force that our world has ever seen. They fight for a nation that is the best, strongest, and greatest in the history of the world--not only in its military strength but in its fundamental values and freedom that allow us to speak as we wish in this very Chamber, to criticize authority, to speak truth to those in power, to debate, to come together, as we did this past weekend to worship and gather together and say whatever we please and think as we wish. I hope we will address this vital interest in making sure we provide a sustainable source of funding by ending sequestration rather than relying on the overseas contingency operation account, which is a form of borrowing. It increases the deficit; it doesn't reduce it. It diminishes stable and sustainable funding; it doesn't enhance it. It simply provides more uncertainty rather than a long-term strategy. This measure, which I support, enhances our security by providing for the construction of Virginia-class submarines--that are necessary. In fact, the NDAA provides $800 million in additional funding over what the President requested, and it endorses equipping all future attack submarines within an enhanced payload capability. Naval warfare, and particularly undersea warfare, is as relevant and important now as it ever was, and these submarines will do much to enhance our readiness, our nuclear deterrence, our special operations, and our surveillance. They are the stealthiest, strongest weapons platform under the sea ever known to man. Likewise, the research and development in the Ohio replacement program will continue to go forward. The bill provides for $1 billion for six additional Joint Strike Fighter aircraft for the Marine Corps--this is profoundly significant-- as well as $17 million in new military construction for the Connecticut National Guard. There are other measures, but apart from the hard work is an important step for fairness and keeping faith and dealing fairly with our men and women in uniform. This legislation provides for a 1.3 percent pay raise and $85 million to be directed toward improving financial literacy among our servicemembers. That is really the very least we can do. Our military men and women do not do this for the pay or the financial compensation, but for their families' sake, we need to deal with them fairly and keep faith with them. In my role as ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have paid special attention to ensuring that this bill helps to ease the transition of military personnel into civilian life by establishing a new ``Record of Service'' card upon their separation that will help prevent identity theft and financial fraud. I urge the DOD, as does the Armed Services Committee, to discontinue its use of Social Security numbers on military records. It will help prevent identity theft and the kinds of breaches that put our servicemen and their families at risk financially, just as they are often at risk physically in combat. The bill also directs DOD to stem the tide of opioid prescription drug abuse, and it helps military retirees get smoking cessation assistance. I would go further and provide for stronger measures to deal with over-prescription through education programs and drug formularies that provide alternatives, and that is one of the amendments I will offer. Finally, two principal amendments I propose are an amendment to provide additional helicopters for the Army National Guard, which I will speak on now and seek to make pending at a later point, and an amendment improving consumer protections for military personnel and their families, which is currently pending. First, we can greatly strengthen this bill by making a commitment to our National Guard to provide additional helicopters. The UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter is one of the most versatile and heavily used aviation capabilities in the Army National Guard, as well as by all the states in which they serve. The UH-60A is the oldest model Black Hawk in service and is currently flown almost exclusively by the Army National Guard. We can strengthen this bill by fulfilling our commitment to the National Guard in providing 15 additional UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters that are the workhorse of our warriors who serve in our National Guard, warriors who have distinguished themselves not only in combat but also in emergencies and disasters at home. These helicopters will help them serve at home and abroad, which is one of the reasons that acquiring more of these helicopters, M model Black Hawks, are one of the priorities of the National Guard Association. I have listened to the National Guard leaders in Connecticut, and I have listened to distinguished warriors and veterans of the National Guard from around the country, and I know these UH-60 Black Hawks are the workhorses. They are important in medium-lift capability to the National Guard in support of homeland defense and response to emergencies. The UH-60A models now lack onboard capabilities--modern capabilities that would enable them to be deployed overseas in hostile environments without significant upgrades to others parts of their configuration. They need that upgrade to be configured properly. The new aircraft would flow to states all across the country and ensure the National Guard is ready to deploy both at home and abroad. Under the Army's current budget projections, the Army National Guard will not replace their aging UH-60A Black Hawk helicopters until 2025. We need to do better, we need to do it more promptly, and that is why I am proposing amendment No. 1820. The amendment is fully paid for by an offset from the Foreign Currency Fund.

warriors and veterans of the national guard from around the country, and i know these uh-60 black hawks are the workhorses. they are important in medium-lift capability to the national guard in support of homeland defense and response to emergencies. the uh-60a models now lack onboard capabilities--modern capabilities that would enable them to be deployed overseas in hostile environments without significant upgrades to others parts of their configuration. they need that upgrade to be configured properly. the new aircraft would flow to states all across the country and ensure the national guard is ready to deploy both at home and abroad. under the army's current budget projections, the army national guard will not replace their aging uh-60a black hawk helicopters until 2025. we need to do better, we need to do it more promptly, and that is why i am proposing amendment no. 1820. the amendment is fully paid for by an offset from the foreign currency fund. the upside of a strengthening american dollar is that the army can put more funds towards buying american helicopters and spend less in foreign currency expenses. the other principal amendment, which i have made pending to the bill, improves the consumer protections afforded to our servicemembers and their families by the servicemembers civil relief act. on the servicemembers civil relief act, penalties, quite bluntly, are too low, and that is why i wish to thank my colleagues ranking member reed as well as senators durbin, murray, and whitehouse, all of whom have been working tirelessly and have joined me in proposing stronger protections in the servicemembers civil relief act by doubling the penalties and making them as high as $110,000 for a first violation and $220,000 for a second or subsequent violation. this legislation provides deterrents, punishment, and a stop to this kind of financial abuse that may take place, literally, within sight of military bases. recently, the department of justice used this authority to obtain a civil penalty against capital one and sallie mae. we have seen financial abuse by capital one, when it foreclosed improperly on servicemembers' homes. these practices can include these kinds of abuses involving foreclosure and other kinds of exploitation which sallie mae, unfortunately, engaged in. ``federal [[page s3887]] law protects our servicemembers from having to repay loans under terms that are unaffordable or unfair.'' student lender sallie mae sidestepped requirements by charging excessive rates to borrowers who filed documents proving they were members of the u.s. military. for over a decade sallie mae violated scra by failing to provide over 60,000 military servicemembers with the 6 percent interest rate cap they were entitled to on their student loans. this type of conduct is more than just inappropriate, it is inexcusable, and it will not be tolerated. in addition, my colleagues have been working to make other important improvements to the scra. for example, senator reed has worked tirelessly to ensure servicemembers can terminate leases on rental properties without early termination fees if they are assigned to, or relocate to, government quarters. senator whitehouse has sought to make permanent a one-year post service protection from foreclosure for returning servicemembers and senator durbin has been fighting to make sure our servicemembers with student loan debt can take advantage of the protections of the scra. i appreciate my colleagues tireless advocacy and look forward to working together to advance these important provisions. i ask my colleagues to join me in voting for senator reed's amendment tomorrow. we face critical decisions ahead. this measure has extraordinary merit. we must keep faith with those who serve, and i hope we will when we vote this week on the national defense authorization act. i thank the presiding officer. i yield the floor.

CREC-2015-06-08-pt1-PgE849-6,CREC-2015-06-08,114,RECOGNIZING THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SYSTEM FOR THEIR OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 90 (Monday, June 8, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E849-E850] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SYSTEM FOR THEIR OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS ______ HON. LAMAR SMITH of texas in the house of representatives Monday, June 8, 2015 Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, graduation season is once again upon us, and congratulations go to all who have accomplished the outstanding goal of attaining a high school diploma or college degree. I also want to recognize the hundreds of thousands of teachers in my home state, the great state of Texas--from pre-K to post-grad. One of the great higher education systems in the nation is the University of Texas System, which just happens to be headquartered in my district. Each year, UT System institutions confer more than one- third of Texas' undergraduate degrees and educate two-thirds of the state's health care professionals. Overall, the UT System includes more than 210,000 students across the state, a group of young Texans that includes first generation Americans striving to improve their place in society, engineers, computer scientists, historians, educators, inventors, and future doctors. The UT System is also one of the largest employers in Texas. Across its fourteen campuses, the System employs more than 90,000 faculty, staff, and administrators, all focused on three aligned objectives: educate the future leaders of our nation, innovate and create the discoveries and tools of tomorrow, and advance scholarly knowledge beyond current boundaries. The UT System family includes three of the nation's 68 National Cancer Institute cancer centers--one of which, the UT Health Science Center in San Antonio, is located in my district. In addition, the UT Health Science Center in San Antonio is one of the four UT System medical centers to have received continuous Clinical and Translational Science Awards from the National Institutes of Health for their proven success in quickly delivering to patients the drugs and therapies they discover. UT San Antonio was the first university in Texas, and twenty-third nationwide, to be recognized by the NSA as a national leader in the emerging field of cybersecurity research and training and designated a Center for Academic Excellence. UT's MD Anderson Cancer Center, located at the Texas Medical Center in Houston, is often recognized as the top cancer center in the world. It conducts more cancer clinical trials than any institution across the globe, receives more National Cancer Institute funding than any other institution, and is responsible for more than one-third of all new FDA- approved cancer drugs. UT Austin is home to more than 200 members of the National Academies and 12 recipients of the National Medal of Science. And it has 43 academic programs considered to be in the Top 10 nationally; 50 in the Top 25. The UT Medical Branch is home to the Galveston National Laboratory, the only operational BioSafety Level 4 National Lab on a university campus in the United States. Scientists there are playing a leading role in researching and developing treatments and vaccines for global infectious diseases, and were recently included in the group of Ebola fighters Time Magazine chose to represent their Person of the Year. Last year, UT El Paso was selected by Washington Monthly as one of the top 10 universities in the nation, grouped with Stanford, Harvard, UC Berkeley, UCLA and UC San Diego and ranked #1 for the third consecutive year among all U.S. universities in the social mobility category for its success in helping students achieve the American Dream. [[Page E850]] The UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas is home to six Nobel Laureates--a distinction no other medical school in America can claim. UT Arlington is the largest producer of baccalaureate educated nurses in Texas and the largest not-for-profit college of nursing in the nation, training nearly 8,000 on-line and in-person students. The extraordinary emergency care doctors of UT Health Science Center Houston who manage the world's busiest Level 1 Trauma Center at Memorial Hermann Hospital were featured this year in the Lifetime Network series ``Life flight: Trauma Center Houston.'' UT Dallas was ranked 15th in the 2014 Times Higher Education magazine list of the world's most outstanding young universities. One of the criteria contributing to this ranking is the high standing of the university's students. The average SAT score for incoming freshman consistently is the highest among public universities in Texas. UT Health Science Center Tyler, northeast Texas' only university medical center, is ranked by Axial and Becker's Hospital Review as one of the top 100 hospitals in the country for patient healthcare, including quality, patient satisfaction, and communication. UT Tyler is a leading innovator for providing students with multiple options to complete a degree from remote locations. It is the only university in Texas to offer three distance-learning campuses where students can take classes close to home. In addition, the UT Tyler Houston Engineering Center provides a seamless pathway to a four-year degree in civil, electrical, or mechanical engineering in partnership with Houston Community College. Students can take lower-division courses at HCC and upper-division courses from UT Tyler at the Alief- Hayes Road Campus in Houston. The University of Texas of the Permian Basin (UTPB) has created Early College High Schools with several West Texas school districts at which at-risk high school students have the opportunity to earn a high school diploma and up to sixty college credit hours. The first UTPB Early College High School within the Presidio Independent School District was the first in Texas where college courses are delivered online. But, Mr. Speaker, the UT System is not resting on its laurels. In fact, it is preparing for the future on several fronts. It is in the process of opening what will become the second-largest Hispanic-serving institution in the nation. UT Rio Grande Valley will incorporate multiple locations throughout South Texas and will have a transformative effect on the health, economy and overall well-being of the region. When UTRGV opens its doors, the UT System will also become the only university system in America to open a new university with a medical school in the 21st century. In fact, the UT System is the only university system in the country currently building two new medical schools--in addition to UTRGV, the System is creating the new Dell Medical School as a part of UT Austin's growing presence. Mr. Speaker, as you can see I am proud to represent the University of Texas System, which rightfully has been recognized as one of the great university systems in the U.S. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 90 (Monday, June 8, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E849-E850] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SYSTEM FOR THEIR OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS ______ HON.

In addition, the UT Tyler Houston Engineering Center provides a seamless pathway to a four-year degree in civil, electrical, or mechanical engineering in partnership with Houston Community College. Students can take lower-division courses at HCC and upper-division courses from UT Tyler at the Alief- Hayes Road Campus in Houston. The University of Texas of the Permian Basin (UTPB) has created Early College High Schools with several West Texas school districts at which at-risk high school students have the opportunity to earn a high school diploma and up to sixty college credit hours. The first UTPB Early College High School within the Presidio Independent School District was the first in Texas where college courses are delivered online. But, Mr. Speaker, the UT System is not resting on its laurels. In fact, it is preparing for the future on several fronts. It is in the process of opening what will become the second-largest Hispanic-serving institution in the nation. UT Rio Grande Valley will incorporate multiple locations throughout South Texas and will have a transformative effect on the health, economy and overall well-being of the region. When UTRGV opens its doors, the UT System will also become the only university system in America to open a new university with a medical school in the 21st century. In fact, the UT System is the only university system in the country currently building two new medical schools--in addition to UTRGV, the System is creating the new Dell Medical School as a part of UT Austin's growing presence. Mr. Speaker, as you can see I am proud to represent the University of Texas System, which rightfully has been recognized as one of the great university systems in the U.S. ____________________",package_114_85.csv,6903,6903,6968,"[congressional record volume 161, number 90 (monday, june 8, 2015)] [extensions of remarks] [pages e849-e850] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] recognizing the university of texas system for their outstanding achievements ______ hon. lamar smith of texas in the house of representatives monday, june 8, 2015 mr. smith of texas. mr. speaker, graduation season is once again upon us, and congratulations go to all who have accomplished the outstanding goal of attaining a high school diploma or college degree. i also want to recognize the hundreds of thousands of teachers in my home state, the great state of texas--from pre-k to post-grad. one of the great higher education systems in the nation is the university of texas system, which just happens to be headquartered in my district. each year, ut system institutions confer more than one- third of texas' undergraduate degrees and educate two-thirds of the state's health care professionals. overall, the ut system includes more than 210,000 students across the state, a group of young texans that includes first generation americans striving to improve their place in society, engineers, computer scientists, historians, educators, inventors, and future doctors. the ut system is also one of the largest employers in texas. across its fourteen campuses, the system employs more than 90,000 faculty, staff, and administrators, all focused on three aligned objectives: educate the future leaders of our nation, innovate and create the discoveries and tools of tomorrow, and advance scholarly knowledge beyond current boundaries. the ut system family includes three of the nation's 68 national cancer institute cancer centers--one of which, the ut health science center in san antonio, is located in my district. in addition, the ut health science center in san antonio is one of the four ut system medical centers to have received continuous clinical and translational science awards from the national institutes of health for their proven success in quickly delivering to patients the drugs and therapies they discover. ut san antonio was the first university in texas, and twenty-third nationwide, to be recognized by the nsa as a national leader in the emerging field of cybersecurity research and training and designated a center for academic excellence. ut's md anderson cancer center, located at the texas medical center in houston, is often recognized as the top cancer center in the world. it conducts more cancer clinical trials than any institution across the globe, receives more national cancer institute funding than any other institution, and is responsible for more than one-third of all new fda- approved cancer drugs. ut austin is home to more than 200 members of the national academies and 12 recipients of the national medal of science. and it has 43 academic programs considered to be in the top 10 nationally; 50 in the top 25. the ut medical branch is home to the galveston national laboratory, the only operational biosafety level 4 national lab on a university campus in the united states. scientists there are playing a leading role in researching and developing treatments and vaccines for global infectious diseases, and were recently included in the group of ebola fighters time magazine chose to represent their person of the year. last year, ut el paso was selected by washington monthly as one of the top 10 universities in the nation, grouped with stanford, harvard, uc berkeley, ucla and uc san diego and ranked #1 for the third consecutive year among all u.s. universities in the social mobility category for its success in helping students achieve the american dream.

Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Joshua Ray Johnson for his sacrifice and service to our country. Upon graduation from Eustace High School, Petty Officer 3rd Class Johnson enlisted in the Navy in October 2006. Petty Officer Johnson served stateside in the Military Police before being deployed overseas. He was assigned to the MOB Accounting OPS unit. Petty Officer Johnson's assignment was part of NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) that was established after the regime change in Afghanistan in 2001. Initially, the ISAF was established to train the Afghan National Security Forces and assist Afghanistan in rebuilding key government institutions. When Josh arrived in the Middle East, the ISAF had expanded its operations to more intensive combat operations and part of this involved reconnaissance missions to evaluate, account and report on the status of residential occupants. Petty Officer Johnson was wounded in Iraq when an improvised explosive device detonated and he suffered a bullet wound in his arm. He was honorably discharged in April of 2010 and was the recipient of the Purple Heart. While serving his country bravely and courageously, Petty Officer Johnson battled enemies and faced danger and possible death every day. Today, Petty Officer Johnson faces the toughest fight ever. He was diagnosed with Stage IV cancer that is inoperable and incurable in November 2014, on the day before Veterans Day. We will continue to keep him, his family and medical personnel in our prayers daily, that he will overcome this battle. Humbly, I echo the words of President Ronald Reagan, ``We will always remember.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Sandra Vogelson, for her achievements, contributions, and her service to the people of New Jersey as a community leader and a health advocate. Mrs. Vogelson passed away at the age of seventy-three. Sandra was revered throughout her community and she will truly be missed. Sandra graduated from my alma mater, Camden County Community College, with a degree in Art, and dedicated her life to the community of South Jersey. She served as a member of Cooper's Ferry Development Association, where she was always seeking new ways to improve the City of Camden. Sandra founded a philanthropic event, ``Pink Roses and ``Teal Magnolias.'' This event raises funds to continue the fight against breast and gynecologic cancers. Over the years, ``Pink Roses and Teal Magnolias'' became a staple within our community, by raising tens of thousands of dollars for research and other clinical programs at the MD Anderson Cancer Center at Cooper. Furthermore, she took a keen interest in the education of New Jersey's young people. In 1992, Sandra established the Camden County College Foundation, and served on the board for the next two decades. Her leadership provided critical fundraising efforts for the college, allowing it to expand and serve as an exemplary educational institution for the students of Camden. Mr. Speaker, Sandra Vogelson was a pillar of society who lived a life full of virtue service. She left a great mark on South Jersey, and is survived three daughters, five grandchildren, and eight great- grandchildren. I join the Camden County community and the state of New Jersey in honoring the achievements and the life of this extraordinary woman. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 90 (Monday, June 8, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E850] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF SANDRA VOGELSON ______ HON.

KATHY CASTOR of florida in the house of representatives Tuesday, June 2, 2015 The House in Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2578) making appropriations for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, Science, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes: Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chair, I rise today to support the Cohen amendment and urge the House to oppose the excessive cuts to the nonprofit and independent Legal Services Corporation. Legal Services has a mission to ``provide equal access to the system of justice'' in America. It is the most important provider of civil legal aid for Americans who cannot afford high-priced legal counsel. In fact, legal representation often is out of reach for many [[Page E851]] American families. This amendment will make the lives of millions of American families even more challenging. Plus, if you take away legal counsel, you also complicate the resolution of disputes for businesses and others as well. You all know Legal Services is not a Washington- based bureaucratic program. To the contrary, there are legal aid attorneys and professionals in every State, with more than 800 offices. Legal Services' moneys are put to work back home across America outside of Washington. In my Tampa Bay community, Bay Area Legal Services helps to keep the wheels of justice turning for everyone. What type of legal help? Foreclosure, consumer assistance, domestic violence. Many of the domestic violence victims are simply trying to keep their children safe and their families together. Others include veterans returning from war, families with housing issues, those that were hit hard by natural disasters and are dealing with the aftermath, and families involved in child custody disputes. I have seen these advocates in action. Many Members of Congress actually refer cases to Legal Services groups in our area. They help families navigate the justice system. They also boost the economy through avoided costs and swift resolution of disputes. I would also like to remind my colleagues that Legal Services has already undergone significant cuts over the past few years. Funding for Legal Services was $420 million in fiscal year 2010. It was cut-- especially after sequestration in 2013--and any further cuts will do severe damage. This amendment jeopardizes access to justice and the rule of law. This year's bill is a destructive step backwards which threatens these vital community services by slashing funding by $75 million. This is the lowest level of funding since FY 1999. These devastating cuts will terminate over 1,000 full time staff including 430 attorney positions. Under these draconian cuts, Legal services offices across the country will be forced to close 25 offices, complete 150,000 fewer cases, and serve 350,000 fewer people. In exacting such severe cuts, your advice to families is, ``You can't get help''. ``You can't avoid a foreclosure''. ``You can't escape an abusive relationship or defend yourself against consumer scams''. We cannot allow hundreds of thousands of American veterans, elderly victims of foreclosure, and women and children desperate to escape domestic violence to be denied assistance. So I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote on the Cohen amendment. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 90 (Monday, June 8, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E850-E851] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016 ______ speech of HON.

Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to the FY16 Transportation and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill. In short, this bill is shortsighted and fraught with handouts to special interests at the expense of the safety of the American people. Once again, the Majority in this body has squandered an opportunity to invest in our nation's crumbling roads and infrastructure, and it has squandered an opportunity to combat homelessness and provide access to safer, affordable housing for millions. Our future prosperity and economic growth depend on the investments we make now to ensure America remains the most competitive nation in an increasingly global economy. Instead of investing in safer rail to prevent accidents like the recent and fatal derailment of Amtrak in Philadelphia, this bill cuts Amtrak's budget by nearly $290 million and subsequently hampers its ability to implement proven technologies that would have prevented this tragedy and countless others. Instead of supporting the Federal Aviation Administration's efforts to implement NextGen technologies to keep our skies the safest in the world, this bill cuts the agency's capital investment program by $100 million from the FY15 enacted level and $355 million below the President's budget request. This bill cuts funding to programs like Choice Neighborhoods and the Community Development Block Grants that would revitalize our communities, the Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes programs that would keep our families safe from harmful materials, and programs such as Housing for the Elderly that helps deliver the dignity and assistance for our most vulnerable populations. This is just a bad bill, Mr. Chair, and these are just a few of the reasons why this is a terrible bill, and one that will surely be vetoed by the President.

This bill cuts funding to programs like Choice Neighborhoods and the Community Development Block Grants that would revitalize our communities, the Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes programs that would keep our families safe from harmful materials, and programs such as Housing for the Elderly that helps deliver the dignity and assistance for our most vulnerable populations. This is just a bad bill, Mr. Chair, and these are just a few of the reasons why this is a terrible bill, and one that will surely be vetoed by the President. I urge my colleagues to reject this bill and bring this legislation back to the drawing board. ____________________",package_114_85.csv,2671,2671,2736,"[congressional record volume 161, number 90 (monday, june 8, 2015)] [extensions of remarks] [page e851] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] transportation, housing and urban development, and related agencies appropriations act, 2016 ______ speech of hon. eddie bernice johnson of texas in the house of representatives wednesday, june 3, 2015 the house in committee of the whole house on the state of the union had under consideration the bill (h.r. 2577) making appropriations for the departments of transportation, and housing and urban development, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending september 30, 2016, and for other purposes: ms. eddie bernice johnson of texas. mr. chair, i rise today in opposition to the fy16 transportation and housing and urban development appropriations bill. in short, this bill is shortsighted and fraught with handouts to special interests at the expense of the safety of the american people. once again, the majority in this body has squandered an opportunity to invest in our nation's crumbling roads and infrastructure, and it has squandered an opportunity to combat homelessness and provide access to safer, affordable housing for millions. our future prosperity and economic growth depend on the investments we make now to ensure america remains the most competitive nation in an increasingly global economy. instead of investing in safer rail to prevent accidents like the recent and fatal derailment of amtrak in philadelphia, this bill cuts amtrak's budget by nearly $290 million and subsequently hampers its ability to implement proven technologies that would have prevented this tragedy and countless others. instead of supporting the federal aviation administration's efforts to implement nextgen technologies to keep our skies the safest in the world, this bill cuts the agency's capital investment program by $100 million from the fy15 enacted level and $355 million below the president's budget request. this bill cuts funding to programs like choice neighborhoods and the community development block grants that would revitalize our communities, the lead hazard control and healthy homes programs that would keep our families safe from harmful materials, and programs such as housing for the elderly that helps deliver the dignity and assistance for our most vulnerable populations. this is just a bad bill, mr. chair, and these are just a few of the reasons why this is a terrible bill, and one that will surely be vetoed by the president. i urge my colleagues to reject this bill and bring this legislation back to the drawing board. ____________________",2671

Dawdy for his courageous service to our country. A graduate of Mabank High School, Private First Class Dawdy served in the 1 Marine Expeditionary Force (1 MEF) during Operation Iraqi Freedom. On March 19, 2004, Pfc. Dawdy was driving a seven-ton truck in his unit's convoy. Shortly after leaving Camp Fallujah, Iraq, the convoy hit an improvised explosive device. With his leg torn with shrapnel, Pfc. Dawdy still managed to maintain control of his truck and maneuvered nearly one hundred yards before pulling off to the side of the road and losing consciousness. As a testament to his bravery and leadership, a fellow Marine called Pfc. Dawdy a ``father figure'' who made ``all the wise decisions.'' Pfc. Dawdy was awarded the Purple Heart for the injuries he sustained in combat while bravely serving his country. Humbly, I echo the words of President Ronald Reagan, ``We will always remember. We will always be proud. We will always be prepared, so we will always be free.'' And humbly, I offer my sincere gratitude to Pfc. John J. Dawdy for his service and acts of bravery that allow us the freedoms we enjoy today. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 90 (Monday, June 8, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E851] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING MR.
