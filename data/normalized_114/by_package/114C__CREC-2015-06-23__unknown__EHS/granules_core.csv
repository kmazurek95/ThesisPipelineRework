The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano) for 5 minutes. Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and pay tribute to Juan Felipe Herrera, who was recently appointed to serve as the United States Poet Laureate. The son of migrant farmworkers, Mr. Herrera is the first Latino American to be appointed to this position and has published more than a dozen short stories, novels, and collections of poetry. In 2008, he was awarded the National Book Critics Circle Award, and in 2012 he was appointed California's Poet Laureate. Never one to shy away from experimentation, Mr. Herrera conducted a 2-year poetry project, entitled, ``The Most Incredible and Biggest Poem on Unity in the World,'' where California residents of all ages submit their writings on unity. The project resulted in a 170-page collection of poems on unity and how we as Americans can come together. A recent retiree from the University of California, Riverside, Mr. Herrera taught creative writing and worked with young people in the Inland Empire by creating an antibullying poetry project that allows kids affected by bullying to channel their feelings through poetry. Poetry, after all, is an incredibly powerful medium. In his work, ``Let Me Tell You What a Poem Brings,'' Herrera spoke of poetry's impact, saying: Before you go further, let me tell you what a poem brings, first, you must know the secret, there is no poem to speak of, it is a way to attain a life without boundaries, yes, it is that easy, a poem, imagine me telling you this, instead of going day by day against the razors, well, the judgments, all the tick-tock bronze, a leather jacket sizing you up, the fashion mall, for example, from the outside you think you are being entertained, when you enter, things change, you get caught by surprise, your mouth goes sour, you get thirsty, your legs grow cold standing still in the middle of a storm, a poem, of course, is always open for business too, except, as you can see, it isn't exactly business that pulls your spirit into the alarming waters, there you can bathe, you can play, you can even join in on the gossip--the mist, that is, the mist becomes central to your existence. As a former student of Juan Felipe Herrera's, I offer my congratulations and know that he will continue to inspire and move us with his words as our next Poet Laureate. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [House] [Page H4548] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATIONS TO JUAN FELIPE HERRERA The SPEAKER pro tempore.

CREC-2015-06-23-pt1-PgH4547-4,CREC-2015-06-23,114,END HUNGER NOW,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [House] [Pages H4547-H4548] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] END HUNGER NOW The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for 5 minutes. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, last Congress, we passed a new farm bill. As a member of the Agriculture Committee, I could not support it, either in committee or on the House floor. I couldn't support it because it cut SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, our Nation's premier antihunger program. I couldn't support a bill that I believed made hunger worse in America. At the time, members of both parties offered many assurances that the changes to SNAP's relationship with LIHEAP, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, wouldn't hurt SNAP recipients, that the changes were merely ``closing a loophole'' rather than a true benefit cut. I was skeptical of those assurances at the time--and with good reason. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the change would reduce benefits for about 850,000 low-income households by an average of $90 a month in the 14 States and the District of Columbia that took advantage of a State option to link LIHEAP and SNAP. States chose to use this option to alleviate some of the heartbreaking choices that poor families face. Seniors and the disabled are all too often the ones forced to choose between buying food or heating their homes or paying for their prescriptions. Throughout the farm bill process, antihunger advocates in the ``heat and eat'' States vigorously opposed the LIHEAP cuts to SNAP, saying their effects would be much greater than the Congressional Budget Office estimates. I'm sorry to say they were right. These cuts are much more than just abstract numbers. We are starting to hear real stories from real people who are seeing their SNAP benefits cut. Hunger is worse in this country because of these cuts. Take Judy Beals, a disabled senior from Belleville, Wisconsin. Earlier this year, she saw her SNAP benefit cut from $120 a month to $16 a month. Let me repeat that, she now gets $16 a month in food assistance. That is it. That is unconscionable. How could anyone afford to feed themselves for a month on that? Ms. Beals says she is forced to eat just once a day now that her SNAP benefit has been cut as she tries to figure out how to pay her other bills. To add insult to injury, Ms. Beals found out that her SNAP benefit had been cut at the register at the grocery store with a full cart of groceries. Mr. Speaker, Ms. Beals' story is not unique. The Hunger Task Force in Milwaukee estimates that, in Wisconsin alone, 255,000 families have seen their SNAP benefits reduced since the LIHEAP cuts went into effect. We are hearing similar stories in New Jersey, another State that did not extend its heat and eat program. The Food Bank of South New Jersey estimates that 160,000 New Jersey residents have lost about $90 a month in SNAP benefits due to the farm bill cut. Now, to be fair, there are several States, including my home State of Massachusetts, that did the right thing and found a way, mostly with State funds, to make up the money lost by the LIHEAP cut in the farm bill. Republican and Democratic Governors stepped up and recognized that those already struggling to put food on the table would be worse off if they didn't find a way to fix the cut. In those States that did not make up the money, we will continue to hear stories of people who have seen their SNAP benefit cut. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to serve on the House Agriculture Committee. Since the beginning of this Congress, the committee has been conducting a top-to-bottom review of the SNAP program. Now, I have no idea where these hearings are going and, once again, we have heard assurances that there will be no cuts in SNAP, but I have this sinking feeling in my stomach that these hearings are not leading to a place that is good for millions of struggling Americans. The fact is SNAP is a good program. It works. It is effective, and it is efficient. It is one of the most efficiently run Federal programs that exists, with an unbelievably low error rate. Instead of cutting SNAP or making other harmful policy changes, we [[Page H4548]] should be strengthening the program. Democratic and Republican witnesses alike have testified before the Agriculture Committee that the SNAP benefit is already too low. We have heard that the certification and recertification process is time-consuming and onerous, especially for working families. We have heard about people who are eligible to get renewed benefits who fall off the program because of these onerous, new requirements. We have heard from charities that they cannot solve the problems of hunger on their own. Charities do incredible work, but they cannot meet the demand for food assistance. They need a strong Federal partner. We need better coordination among all stakeholders--Federal agencies, nonprofits, faith-based organizations, and businesses--to end hunger. That is why I have been advocating for a White House conference on food, nutrition, and hunger. We need a coordinated, holistic plan to end hunger now. If we make further cuts to SNAP, we will no doubt hear more stories like Ms. Beals where those who are already struggling to put food on the table see their food assistance benefits cut. The bottom line, Mr. Speaker, is that we should not be making hunger worse in this country. We should end hunger now. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [House] [Pages H4547-H4548] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] END HUNGER NOW The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Seniors and the disabled are all too often the ones forced to choose between buying food or heating their homes or paying for their prescriptions. Throughout the farm bill process, antihunger advocates in the ``heat and eat'' States vigorously opposed the LIHEAP cuts to SNAP, saying their effects would be much greater than the Congressional Budget Office estimates. I'm sorry to say they were right. These cuts are much more than just abstract numbers. We are starting to hear real stories from real people who are seeing their SNAP benefits cut. Hunger is worse in this country because of these cuts. Take Judy Beals, a disabled senior from Belleville, Wisconsin. Earlier this year, she saw her SNAP benefit cut from $120 a month to $16 a month. Let me repeat that, she now gets $16 a month in food assistance. That is it. That is unconscionable. How could anyone afford to feed themselves for a month on that? Ms. Beals says she is forced to eat just once a day now that her SNAP benefit has been cut as she tries to figure out how to pay her other bills. To add insult to injury, Ms. Beals found out that her SNAP benefit had been cut at the register at the grocery store with a full cart of groceries. Mr. Speaker, Ms. Beals' story is not unique. The Hunger Task Force in Milwaukee estimates that, in Wisconsin alone, 255,000 families have seen their SNAP benefits reduced since the LIHEAP cuts went into effect. We are hearing similar stories in New Jersey, another State that did not extend its heat and eat program. The Food Bank of South New Jersey estimates that 160,000 New Jersey residents have lost about $90 a month in SNAP benefits due to the farm bill cut. Now, to be fair, there are several States, including my home State of Massachusetts, that did the right thing and found a way, mostly with State funds, to make up the money lost by the LIHEAP cut in the farm bill. Republican and Democratic Governors stepped up and recognized that those already struggling to put food on the table would be worse off if they didn't find a way to fix the cut. In those States that did not make up the money, we will continue to hear stories of people who have seen their SNAP benefit cut. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to serve on the House Agriculture Committee. Since the beginning of this Congress, the committee has been conducting a top-to-bottom review of the SNAP program. Now, I have no idea where these hearings are going and, once again, we have heard assurances that there will be no cuts in SNAP, but I have this sinking feeling in my stomach that these hearings are not leading to a place that is good for millions of struggling Americans. The fact is SNAP is a good program. It works. It is effective, and it is efficient. It is one of the most efficiently run Federal programs that exists, with an unbelievably low error rate. Instead of cutting SNAP or making other harmful policy changes, we [[Page H4548]] should be strengthening the program. Democratic and Republican witnesses alike have testified before the Agriculture Committee that the SNAP benefit is already too low. We have heard that the certification and recertification process is time-consuming and onerous, especially for working families. We have heard about people who are eligible to get renewed benefits who fall off the program because of these onerous, new requirements. We have heard from charities that they cannot solve the problems of hunger on their own. Charities do incredible work, but they cannot meet the demand for food assistance. They need a strong Federal partner. We need better coordination among all stakeholders--Federal agencies, nonprofits, faith-based organizations, and businesses--to end hunger. That is why I have been advocating for a White House conference on food, nutrition, and hunger. We need a coordinated, holistic plan to end hunger now. If we make further cuts to SNAP, we will no doubt hear more stories like Ms. Beals where those who are already struggling to put food on the table see their food assistance benefits cut. The bottom line, Mr. Speaker, is that we should not be making hunger worse in this country. We should end hunger now. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [House] [Pages H4547-H4548] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] END HUNGER NOW The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for 5 minutes. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, last Congress, we passed a new farm bill. As a member of the Agriculture Committee, I could not support it, either in committee or on the House floor. I couldn't support it because it cut SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, our Nation's premier antihunger program. I couldn't support a bill that I believed made hunger worse in America. At the time, members of both parties offered many assurances that the changes to SNAP's relationship with LIHEAP, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, wouldn't hurt SNAP recipients, that the changes were merely ``closing a loophole'' rather than a true benefit cut. I was skeptical of those assurances at the time--and with good reason. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the change would reduce benefits for about 850,000 low-income households by an average of $90 a month in the 14 States and the District of Columbia that took advantage of a State option to link LIHEAP and SNAP.

CREC-2015-06-23-pt1-PgH4550,CREC-2015-06-23,114,DOMAIN OPENNESS THROUGH CONTINUED OVERSIGHT MATTERS ACT OF 2015,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [House] [Pages H4550-H4551] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DOMAIN OPENNESS THROUGH CONTINUED OVERSIGHT MATTERS ACT OF 2015 Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 805) to prohibit the National Telecommunications and Information Administration from relinquishing responsibility over the Internet domain name system until the Comptroller General of the United States submits to Congress a report on the role of the NTIA with respect to such system, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 805 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Domain Openness Through Continued Oversight Matters Act of 2015'' or the ``DOTCOM Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. REQUIREMENTS FOR IANA STEWARDSHIP TRANSITION. (a) In General.--Until the date that is 30 legislative days after the submission to Congress of the report described in subsection (b), the Assistant Secretary may not permit the NTIA's role in the performance of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority functions to terminate, lapse, be cancelled, or otherwise cease to be in effect. (b) Report Described.--The report described in this subsection is a report that contains-- (1) the proposal relating to the transition of the NTIA's stewardship of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority functions that was developed in a process convened by ICANN at the request of the NTIA; and (2) a certification by the Assistant Secretary that-- (A) such proposal-- (i) supports and enhances the multistakeholder model of Internet governance; (ii) maintains the security, stability, and resiliency of the Internet domain name system; (iii) meets the needs and expectations of the global customers and partners of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority services; (iv) maintains the openness of the Internet; and (v) does not replace the role of the NTIA with a government-led or intergovernmental organization solution; and (B) the required changes to ICANN's bylaws contained in the final report of ICANN's Cross Community Working Group on Enhancing ICANN Accountability and the changes to ICANN's bylaws required by ICANN's IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group have been adopted. (c) Definitions.--In this section: (1) Assistant secretary.--The term ``Assistant Secretary'' means the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information. (2) ICANN.--The term ``ICANN'' means the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. (3) Legislative day.--The term ``legislative day'' does not include Saturdays, Sundays, legal public holidays, or days either House of Congress is adjourned for more than 3 days during a session of Congress. (4) NTIA.--The term ``NTIA'' means the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. Amend the title so as to read: ``A bill to provide for certain requirements relating to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority stewardship transition.''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. General Leave Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois? There was no objection. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today we are here to consider H.R. 805, the DOTCOM Act. I first introduced this legislation last Congress, and I am proud to see it brought to the floor today. The DOTCOM Act is a great example of what can get done when we work together and build on the Energy and Commerce Committee's growing record of legislative success. Mr. Speaker, as many of my colleagues know, from the time the administration announced their intent to transition the IANA functions, I have had serious concerns about the potential risk associated with the move. I have said time and again that this is far too important to rush and that we must carefully consider all the potential consequences and outcomes before any transition occurs. Mr. Speaker, my bill would require a period of 30 legislative days for us to review any proposal that NTIA receives from the multistakeholder community and ICANN. This allows us to hear from our constituents and consult with outside experts before we decide if ICANN's proposal is satisfactory. If, in this review period allowed only through passage of the DOTCOM Act, we find that ICANN and/or its proposal does not adequately protect the free and open Internet, Congress can then take action to either completely stop the transfer or require more safeguards to be put in place. Additionally, and perhaps most importantly, the DOTCOM Act requires NTIA to renew their contract to continue these important stewardship functions with ICANN before it expires in September. Everyone agrees that the contract should remain with NTIA while this process moves forward. DOTCOM is the vehicle to make sure this does in fact happen. Extending the contract takes the pressure off of making a rushed transition and perhaps making mistakes. We get one bite at the apple on this, and we need to make sure it is done correctly. Mr. Speaker, before I relinquish my time, I want to say that I am very proud of the work that has been done on this bill in the Energy and Commerce Committee, particularly by Chairmen Upton and Walden and Ranking Members Pallone and Eshoo. We wouldn't be here today without their hard work and also the work of staff, particularly Greta Joynes of my office and committee staff David Redl, Kelsey Guyselman, Margaret McCarthy, David Goldman, and Tiffany Guarascio. Mr. Speaker, clearly, this is an issue that has brought both sides together for the best interests of all Americans. I ask my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 805, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 805, the Domain Openness Through Continued Oversight Matters, or DOTCOM, Act. I am pleased to support this bill, and I want to commend my colleagues for the bipartisan process in the Energy and Commerce Committee that brought us here. The Internet is a great American success story that has benefited billions of users around the globe. Over the last two decades, the United States Government has taken steps to get out of the way and empower a bottom-up approach to Internet governance. Thanks to the success of this multistakeholder model, the Internet has opened up new markets and economic opportunities and become an unprecedented platform for democratic free expression. Mr. Speaker, under both Republican and Democratic administrations, the U.S. Government has supported the idea that the Internet should be governed through a decentralized process, free from governmental control. Since the late 1990s, the U.S. Government has moved towards private sector management of the domain name system. To put it another way, we think that the future of the Internet should be determined by businesses, civil society, and technical experts. Congress has also explicitly embraced this vision. As recently as 2013, the House voted unanimously in support of a bill making it official U.S. policy to ``preserve and advance the successful multistakeholder model that governs the Internet.'' Mr. Speaker, completing the transition of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority advances that policy goal. The IANA transition reaffirms our two-decade commitment to the global multistakeholder community, but we have a responsibility to make sure that the transition is done right. The DOTCOM Act continues the longstanding congressional support for the global, open Internet while appropriately conducting oversight of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. We require NTIA to live up to the commitments the agency has made for the IANA transition and ensure that transparency and accountability mechanisms are in place before the U.S. Government can relinquish its stewardship role. In short, I believe our bill provides the necessary safeguards for the IANA transition to occur without unnecessary delay. Our vote on the DOTCOM Act today is timely for several reasons. Key [[Page H4551]] meetings are taking place, as we speak, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to finalize planning for the IANA transition. And quick action on the DOTCOM Act is needed to provide a better alternative to the language in the House Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill that blocks NTIA's ability to implement the transition. Unlike the appropriations rider, the DOTCOM Act provides a real opportunity for congressional oversight, so I urge all my colleagues to support it. Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairmen Upton and Walden, Representative Shimkus, and their respective staffs, David Redl and Greta Joynes, for working with Congresswoman Eshoo and other Democrats on this bill. The DOTCOM Act shows what we can accomplish when our work is bipartisan from the start. I would also like to thank David Goldman and Margaret McCarthy of my staff for their hard work on this legislation. I look forward to working with you all and our colleagues in the Senate to see this bill become law. Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers. I urge passage of the DOTCOM Act. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 805, the DOTCOM Act. Over the past two decades, U.S. policy through Republican and Democratic administrations has supported the transition of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to the private sector. The DOTCOM Act which passed the Energy and Commerce Committee by voice vote last week carries on this bipartisan tradition by ensuring that the IANA transition supports and enhances the multi-stakeholder model of Internet governance; maintains the security, stability, and resiliency of the Internet domain name system; and does not replace the role of the NTIA with a government-led or intergovernmental organization solution. Importantly, the DOTCOM Act as amended by the Committee, represents a sensible alternative to the funding restriction included in the House- passed Commerce, Justice and Science (CJS) Appropriations bill. I look forward to working with my colleagues to see that the DOTCOM Act becomes the law of the land--rather than enacting a counterproductive limitation of funds which sends the wrong message to the international community. I thank Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Pallone and Congressman Shimkus for their bipartisan cooperation on this bill and I urge my colleagues to support the DOTCOM Act, which is a vote for the multi- stakeholder model of Internet governance and a global, open Internet, free from governmental control. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, right now as we speak, the international community is meeting in Argentina to discuss the state of the Internet around the globe. We have an opportunity today to send a loud and clear message to those gathered in Buenos Aires: that the United States will not stand for anything other than strong safeguards to protect our online future. By advancing the DOTCOM Act, we can ensure that the Internet--the world's greatest platform of ideas, commerce, and social connection-- continues to thrive to the benefit of folks in Michigan and every corner of the country. As we move toward transitioning the United States' oversight role of the Domain Name System to the international community of stakeholders, it is essential we tread carefully and thoughtfully. The bill we are considering today is a bipartisan effort to ensure appropriate congressional oversight of this incredibly important transition, and ensure that the administration and NTIA get it right as there are no do-overs. Over the course of the past year, the Energy and Commerce Committee has engaged in efforts to ensure that any transition proposal considered by the administration contains the necessary safeguards to protect the Internet. This bill incorporates the criteria initially put forward by NTIA, and requires the agency to certify to Congress that the proposal meets these important metrics. It would also put important accountability measures in place for the Internet community. This legislation, which the Energy and Commerce Committee approved by voice vote, is the result of many informative hearings, feedback from a variety of stakeholders--both domestically and internationally--and productive and ongoing conversations between members on both sides of the aisle. Once again, our committee's efforts demonstrate that Congress can work together to achieve meaningful results and build a bipartisan record of success. I want to recognize Mr. Shimkus for his leadership on this issue from the beginning, as well as Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone for their hard work on this commonsense solution to protect the Internet on which we have come to depend. The world is watching. A vote for the DOTCOM Act is a vote for effective Congressional oversight. I urge all members to support this important legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 805, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [House] [Pages H4550-H4551] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DOMAIN OPENNESS THROUGH CONTINUED OVERSIGHT MATTERS ACT OF 2015 Mr. SHIMKUS.

This bill incorporates the criteria initially put forward by NTIA, and requires the agency to certify to Congress that the proposal meets these important metrics. It would also put important accountability measures in place for the Internet community. This legislation, which the Energy and Commerce Committee approved by voice vote, is the result of many informative hearings, feedback from a variety of stakeholders--both domestically and internationally--and productive and ongoing conversations between members on both sides of the aisle. Once again, our committee's efforts demonstrate that Congress can work together to achieve meaningful results and build a bipartisan record of success. I want to recognize Mr. Shimkus for his leadership on this issue from the beginning, as well as Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone for their hard work on this commonsense solution to protect the Internet on which we have come to depend. The world is watching. A vote for the DOTCOM Act is a vote for effective Congressional oversight. I urge all members to support this important legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 805, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [House] [Pages H4550-H4551] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DOMAIN OPENNESS THROUGH CONTINUED OVERSIGHT MATTERS ACT OF 2015 Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 805) to prohibit the National Telecommunications and Information Administration from relinquishing responsibility over the Internet domain name system until the Comptroller General of the United States submits to Congress a report on the role of the NTIA with respect to such system, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 805 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Domain Openness Through Continued Oversight Matters Act of 2015'' or the ``DOTCOM Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. REQUIREMENTS FOR IANA STEWARDSHIP TRANSITION. (a) In General.--Until the date that is 30 legislative days after the submission to Congress of the report described in subsection (b), the Assistant Secretary may not permit the NTIA's role in the performance of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority functions to terminate, lapse, be cancelled, or otherwise cease to be in effect. (b) Report Described.--The report described in this subsection is a report that contains-- (1) the proposal relating to the transition of the NTIA's stewardship of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority functions that was developed in a process convened by ICANN at the request of the NTIA; and (2) a certification by the Assistant Secretary that-- (A) such proposal-- (i) supports and enhances the multistakeholder model of Internet governance; (ii) maintains the security, stability, and resiliency of the Internet domain name system; (iii) meets the needs and expectations of the global customers and partners of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority services; (iv) maintains the openness of the Internet; and (v) does not replace the role of the NTIA with a government-led or intergovernmental organization solution; and (B) the required changes to ICANN's bylaws contained in the final report of ICANN's Cross Community Working Group on Enhancing ICANN Accountability and the changes to ICANN's bylaws required by ICANN's IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group have been adopted. (c) Definitions.--In this section: (1) Assistant secretary.--The term ``Assistant Secretary'' means the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information. (2) ICANN.--The term ``ICANN'' means the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. (3) Legislative day.--The term ``legislative day'' does not include Saturdays, Sundays, legal public holidays, or days either House of Congress is adjourned for more than 3 days during a session of Congress. (4) NTIA.--The term ``NTIA'' means the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. Amend the title so as to read: ``A bill to provide for certain requirements relating to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority stewardship transition.''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. General Leave Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois? There was no objection. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today we are here to consider H.R. 805, the DOTCOM Act. I first introduced this legislation last Congress, and I am proud to see it brought to the floor today. The DOTCOM Act is a great example of what can get done when we work together and build on the Energy and Commerce Committee's growing record of legislative success. Mr. Speaker, as many of my colleagues know, from the time the administration announced their intent to transition the IANA functions, I have had serious concerns about the potential risk associated with the move. I have said time and again that this is far too important to rush and that we must carefully consider all the potential consequences and outcomes before any transition occurs. Mr. Speaker, my bill would require a period of 30 legislative days for us to review any proposal that NTIA receives from the multistakeholder community and ICANN. This allows us to hear from our constituents and consult with outside experts before we decide if ICANN's proposal is satisfactory. If, in this review period allowed only through passage of the DOTCOM Act, we find that ICANN and/or its proposal does not adequately protect the free and open Internet, Congress can then take action to either completely stop the transfer or require more safeguards to be put in place. Additionally, and perhaps most importantly, the DOTCOM Act requires NTIA to renew their contract to continue these important stewardship functions with ICANN before it expires in September. Everyone agrees that the contract should remain with NTIA while this process moves forward. DOTCOM is the vehicle to make sure this does in fact happen. Extending the contract takes the pressure off of making a rushed transition and perhaps making mistakes. We get one bite at the apple on this, and we need to make sure it is done correctly. Mr. Speaker, before I relinquish my time, I want to say that I am very proud of the work that has been done on this bill in the Energy and Commerce Committee, particularly by Chairmen Upton and Walden and Ranking Members Pallone and Eshoo. We wouldn't be here today without their hard work and also the work of staff, particularly Greta Joynes of my office and committee staff David Redl, Kelsey Guyselman, Margaret McCarthy, David Goldman, and Tiffany Guarascio. Mr. Speaker, clearly, this is an issue that has brought both sides together for the best interests of all Americans. I ask my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 805, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 805, the Domain Openness Through Continued Oversight Matters, or DOTCOM, Act. I am pleased to support this bill, and I want to commend my colleagues for the bipartisan process in the Energy and Commerce Committee that brought us here. The Internet is a great American success story that has benefited billions of users around the globe. Over the last two decades, the United States Government has taken steps to get out of the way and empower a bottom-up approach to Internet governance. Thanks to the success of this multistakeholder model, the Internet has opened up new markets and economic opportunities and become an unprecedented platform for democratic free expression. Mr. Speaker, under both Republican and Democratic administrations, the U.S. Government has supported the idea that the Internet should be governed through a decentralized process, free from governmental control. Since the late 1990s, the U.S. Government has moved towards private sector management of the domain name system. To put it another way, we think that the future of the Internet should be determined by businesses, civil society, and technical experts. Congress has also explicitly embraced this vision. As recently as 2013, the House voted unanimously in support of a bill making it official U.S. policy to ``preserve and advance the successful multistakeholder model that governs the Internet.'' Mr. Speaker, completing the transition of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority advances that policy goal. The IANA transition reaffirms our two-decade commitment to the global multistakeholder community, but we have a responsibility to make sure that the transition is done right. The DOTCOM Act continues the longstanding congressional support for the global, open Internet while appropriately conducting oversight of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. We require NTIA to live up to the commitments the agency has made for the IANA transition and ensure that transparency and accountability mechanisms are in place before the U.S. Government can relinquish its stewardship role. In short, I believe our bill provides the necessary safeguards for the IANA transition to occur without unnecessary delay. Our vote on the DOTCOM Act today is timely for several reasons. Key [[Page H4551]] meetings are taking place, as we speak, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to finalize planning for the IANA transition. And quick action on the DOTCOM Act is needed to provide a better alternative to the language in the House Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill that blocks NTIA's ability to implement the transition. Unlike the appropriations rider, the DOTCOM Act provides a real opportunity for congressional oversight, so I urge all my colleagues to support it. Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairmen Upton and Walden, Representative Shimkus, and their respective staffs, David Redl and Greta Joynes, for working with Congresswoman Eshoo and other Democrats on this bill. The DOTCOM Act shows what we can accomplish when our work is bipartisan from the start. I would also like to thank David Goldman and Margaret McCarthy of my staff for their hard work on this legislation. I look forward to working with you all and our colleagues in the Senate to see this bill become law. Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers. I urge passage of the DOTCOM Act. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 805, the DOTCOM Act. Over the past two decades, U.S. policy through Republican and Democratic administrations has supported the transition of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to the private sector. The DOTCOM Act which passed the Energy and Commerce Committee by voice vote last week carries on this bipartisan tradition by ensuring that the IANA transition supports and enhances the multi-stakeholder model of Internet governance; maintains the security, stability, and resiliency of the Internet domain name system; and does not replace the role of the NTIA with a government-led or intergovernmental organization solution. Importantly, the DOTCOM Act as amended by the Committee, represents a sensible alternative to the funding restriction included in the House- passed Commerce, Justice and Science (CJS) Appropriations bill. I look forward to working with my colleagues to see that the DOTCOM Act becomes the law of the land--rather than enacting a counterproductive limitation of funds which sends the wrong message to the international community. I thank Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Pallone and Congressman Shimkus for their bipartisan cooperation on this bill and I urge my colleagues to support the DOTCOM Act, which is a vote for the multi- stakeholder model of Internet governance and a global, open Internet, free from governmental control. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, right now as we speak, the international community is meeting in Argentina to discuss the state of the Internet around the globe. We have an opportunity today to send a loud and clear message to those gathered in Buenos Aires: that the United States will not stand for anything other than strong safeguards to protect our online future. By advancing the DOTCOM Act, we can ensure that the Internet--the world's greatest platform of ideas, commerce, and social connection-- continues to thrive to the benefit of folks in Michigan and every corner of the country. As we move toward transitioning the United States' oversight role of the Domain Name System to the international community of stakeholders, it is essential we tread carefully and thoughtfully. The bill we are considering today is a bipartisan effort to ensure appropriate congressional oversight of this incredibly important transition, and ensure that the administration and NTIA get it right as there are no do-overs. Over the course of the past year, the Energy and Commerce Committee has engaged in efforts to ensure that any transition proposal considered by the administration contains the necessary safeguards to protect the Internet.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. General Leave Mr. SHIMKUS. I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois? There was no objection. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the TSCA Modernization Act has been a long time in coming. We actually started work on this bill in the last Congress. We held a total of eight hearings and received testimony from a broad range of stakeholders, including the administration; but most importantly, we worked with each other, Member to Member, across the aisle. The bill before you, Mr. Speaker, reflects lessons learned over the course of the last 3 years in which we worked on TSCA reform. First, the bill is clear and understandable. Despite the highly technical nature of chemical regulation, Members can pick up this bill, read it from beginning to end, and understand what it does and how it works. Second, the bill does not try to be all things for all people. Major sections of TSCA are not amended at all. For example, we leave the process for new chemical review in TSCA section 5 unchanged because it is working pretty well right now, and changes could make it worse. The heart of the bill is our approach to regulating chemicals already on the market. Thousands of these chemicals have been in commerce for many years, and they pose no known risks and really don't need to be regulated at all. We leave those alone. But we do allow some existing chemicals to be scientifically evaluated for risk and, if necessary, to have that risk managed through a rule by the EPA. Chemicals may be chosen for risk evaluation in one of two ways: either EPA may select a chemical for risk evaluation based on what EPA knows may pose an unreasonable risk, or the manufacturer may designate a chemical for EPA to evaluate for risk. Now, why would a manufacturer invite EPA scrutiny of its product? There are several reasons. First, some interest or even a retailer may be raising concerns about a product, and the manufacturer wants to put those concerns to rest. Or one or two States may be thinking about regulating the chemical. The State-by-State approach can spell disaster for someone trying to capture economies of scale in a national market. What better way to put these concerns to rest than to have EPA, with the scientific standards that we require, perform an objective risk evaluation? Then the EPA decision on that chemical will apply in all the States, and consumers and the public can have the confidence that the chemical is safe for its intended uses. Another area in the legislation that required careful discussion and negotiation is preemption. Of course, we want to make sure national markets are just that and not a patchwork of restrictions varying State to State. At the same time, we did not want to deny anyone a legitimate cause of action under State tort or contract law. So that is what we said: as long as the State law does not conflict with the Federal ruling, the State action may continue. Mr. Speaker, the bill has strict but attainable deadlines for action. If EPA initiates a risk evaluation, it must finish in 3 years. If a manufacturer initiates one and includes information EPA needs to make a decision, EPA should finish that in 2 years. Once the risk evaluation is complete, if EPA decides a rule is needed to manage the risk, EPA must propose the rule within a year. The risk evaluation itself only asks does the chemical present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. That is a science question based on a combination of hazard and actual exposure. If there is an unreasonable risk, the agency's decision on how to manage it is based on many other factors such as cost effectiveness, whether restricting an article will actually reduce exposure, whether replacements are available, and many other concerns. H.R. 2576 permits EPA to regulate articles in those areas where regulation of chemical substances and mixtures alone would not be effective to reduce the identified risk, but requires EPA to be careful in addressing replacement parts that serve a commercially intended function or the original product or are needed to maintain the functionality of the original product. We think this system sets a new standard for quality regulation. Of course, we want to be protected from harm, but we do not want needless, expensive regulations. Consumers want safe choices, not no choice at all. Mr. Speaker, we are on the brink of setting up a commonsense approach to protecting people from unsafe chemical exposure that will become the standard of the world. {time} 1515 We want our constituents to be safe, and we want markets to work. This bill delivers both. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Nearly four decades ago, Congress enacted the Toxic Substances Control Act to identify and regulate risks from dangerous chemicals. Unfortunately, the statute has never worked. Improvements to the law are long overdue, and I am happy to be here today with my Energy and Commerce colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this landmark reform legislation. Mr. Speaker, what brought us together is the failure of the current statute to keep the American public safe and to provide confidence in the safety of American products. Toxic chemicals can be found in the products we use every day and are steadily building up in our bodies and the environment. Consumers are worried about chemicals like BPA and triclosan, but they don't know how to avoid them. It seems like every day there is a new study about how chemicals are negatively affecting our health, and something needs to change. The Energy and Commerce Committee has held many hearings over the last 6 years to understand why TSCA isn't working. Some critical flaws were built into the statute, like the grandfathering of over 60,000 chemicals in 1976 without any safety review. Other flaws came to light only through litigation, like the impossible analytical burden of the statute's ``least burdensome'' clause. Even though we have recognized these flaws, forward progress has been elusive. When Chairman Shimkus and Chairman Upton approached Ranking Member Tonko and myself about working on a streamlined approach to address the essential components of reform, I was hopeful. The result is a bipartisan bill that will remove major obstacles to EPA action and give the Agency new authority and new resources. It will offer more protection and more implementation than current law. It is a strong compromise, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2576 will empower EPA to regulate the universe of chemicals that were grandfathered in 1976 by removing the requirement that EPA impose the ``least burdensome'' regulatory option and by establishing a [[Page H4557]] risk-based standard for risk management, instead of a cost-benefit standard. For the first time, the decision of whether a chemical needs to be regulated will be based purely on the risk it poses. H.R. 2576 will improve EPA's access to information about potentially dangerous chemicals by allowing EPA to require testing through orders and consent agreements, not just rulemakings, and by authorizing EPA to seek data when needed for a risk evaluation without first demonstrating risk. H.R. 2576 will provide expedited action for the worst chemicals, those that are persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic. Under this bill, we can expect quick action to get these chemicals out of our environment and out of our bodies. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2576 will explicitly and directly protect vulnerable populations like children, workers, the elderly, and hotspot communities. The bill will provide more resources for EPA to carry out this important program by removing outdated caps on user fees. It would also ensure that those fees are deposited in a dedicated trust fund for TSCA implementation. Under the bill, all future confidential business information claims by industry would have to be substantiated, preventing abuse and ensuring greater transparency. H.R. 2576 would ensure that States maintain their important role as partners in chemical regulation. Under the bill, preemption of State laws would be more limited than current law and other proposals. No State law would be preempted until Federal requirements are in effect. Many State laws would be protected from preemption, including existing State laws, new State laws adopted to address air and water quality or implement other Federal laws, State tort claims, and State laws regulating uses not evaluated by EPA. In response to concerns raised by stakeholders and Members, a few additional important clarifications have been made following committee markup, and I thank the chairman for working with us to make those changes. There is now clear authority for EPA to set a schedule if manufacturer-requested risk evaluations exceed EPA's capacity, ensuring that such requests won't overwhelm the program. The grandfathering provision for existing State laws has also been clarified based on feedback from State attorneys general. Mr. Speaker, strong committee report language further clarifies the limited role of costs in risks management, the preservation of State monitoring and reporting requirements, and the expansion of EPA's testing authority. I know that tomorrow, we will get back to disagreeing on the importance of environmental protection and the essential role EPA plays in keeping America safe, but for today, we can all agree on the need for a strong and protective Federal regulatory program for chemicals. I want to thank Chairman Shimkus and Chairman Upton for their leadership and their willingness to work with Democrats and stakeholders to craft this legislation. I would also like to thank Jackie Cohen of my staff for her hard work on this legislation, as well as Dave McCarthy of the majority staff for his efforts. This is a true testament to what we can achieve when we work together. I look forward to supporting this bill, and I hope all my colleagues will join me in supporting this landmark legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Bucshon), my colleague. Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2576, the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015, which updates the Toxic Substances Control Act, TSCA, of 1976. This legislation will benefit the Eighth District of Indiana and our Nation by improving the regulation of chemicals in commerce. Indiana's Eighth District has a strong and diverse manufacturing sector, including plastics, fertilizer production, automobiles, and medical devices, which play pivotal roles in the local and State economy. H.R. 2576 will improve the EPA's outdated regulatory process for these industries and manufacturers, fostering conditions for stronger interstate commerce, and ensure robust protections for public health and the environment. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko), the ranking member of the subcommittee. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey and our ranking member on the Energy and Commerce Committee, Representative Pallone, for yielding. Mr. Speaker, 40 years ago, Congress passed the Toxic Substances Control Act, which created a Federal program to manage the risks associated with our Nation's industrial chemicals. That law, TSCA, has never met that need. As a result, the public has lost confidence in this Federal program. The many failings of the current law have been pointed out in reports, reports issued by the Government Accountability Office and others. Well-intentioned attempts over the years to address some of the problems administratively or through voluntary agreements amongst the Environmental Protection Agency, the chemical industry, and the environmental and public health communities have failed. The public has too little information about the safety of chemicals that they are exposed to every day in virtually every product that they use. Even in the face of overwhelming evidence of harm to people's health, EPA is unable to regulate exposure to toxic chemicals. Congress had to step in and explicitly legislate to gain public health and environmental protections from PCBs, for instance, and asbestos. Because of the regulatory vacuum at the Federal level, some States have legislated to secure protections for their citizens. In some cases, large retailers have initiated their own chemical policies to respond to what are consumers' concerns. Forty years of ineffective Federal policy is enough. H.R. 2576, the TSCA Modernization Act, amends TSCA and corrects the fundamental flaws that exist in our law. When my colleague Chairman Shimkus began the effort to reform TSCA in the last Congress, I knew the committee could produce a bill. I believed we could. I was not convinced, however, that we could pass a law; but H.R. 2576 is a decisive step, I believe, in that direction. I thank Chairman Shimkus, Chairman Upton, and Ranking Member Pallone for their continued cooperation and dedicated effort on behalf of this legislation. This truly has been a productive partnership, and the result is a good bill, a bill that I am pleased to support. H.R. 2576 is the result of much discussion, much work, and compromise by all parties involved. While no one group gets all that they might have hoped for in this legislation, every stakeholder group gets something that they need. Frankly, we all need a functional, fair, and reliable Federal program of chemical regulation. Industry gains a fair, predictable Federal program for chemical regulation, a program that will inspire public confidence in the safety of their products. In the context of our global economy, that is an important asset for doing business both here and in other countries. The public health and environmental communities gain a Federal program in which EPA evaluates chemicals and, based on those evaluations, will act to regulate chemicals the Agency determines present a risk to health or a risk to the environment. Under current law, in order to regulate a chemical, EPA must demonstrate that the benefits of regulating outweigh the costs. Under H.R. 2576, EPA's evaluation and decision on whether to act will be based solely on risk factors, risk factors alone. Considerations of cost will be addressed when the Agency selects among different regulatory options to reduce chemical exposures. That is a major gain--a major gain--for public health and a major gain for the environment. H.R. 2576 is a good bill. It offers significant improvements over our current law. I know many Members have concerns about states' rights and State preemption provisions in TSCA. I share those concerns. There is State preemption in current law, and there is State preemption in H.R. 2576, but State preemption only [[Page H4558]] occurs when EPA takes final--final--action on a chemical, either finding it safe or regulating its risks. H.R. 2576 maintains a strong role for the States. With those changes in TSCA, the States will have a more active and credible partner in this effort at the Federal level. Again, I want to thank Chairman Shimkus, Chairman Upton, and Ranking Member Pallone for their excellent work on this bill. I appreciate the constructive partnership that we formed in working together on this legislation. We worked through many difficult issues and found that common ground. I look forward to continuing to work together as this bill moves on to the Senate. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. PALLONE. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. TONKO. I thank the gentleman. I urge my colleagues to end the ineffective chemical policy that we have had for four decades and to support H.R. 2576. I, too, would like to thank some individuals who are very pertinent to this discussion and final product. I thank David McCarthy from the subcommittee staff on the majority side and Jerry Couri from the subcommittee staff, Jackie Cohen from our subcommittee staff on the Democratic side, and Chris Sarley of Chairman Shimkus' personal office staff, and Jean Fruci of my personal staff, the legislative director for my Congressional office. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, could I ask how much time is remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey has 9\1/2\ minutes remaining. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green). Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2576, the TSCA Modernization Act. I am a proud cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation that will update the Toxic Substances Control Act, our Nation's primary statute regulating the use and safety of commercial chemicals for the first time since it was enacted in 1976. This legislation will directly address many of current TSCA's biggest flaws, including eliminating the ``least burdensome'' requirement and explicitly clarifying the law's safety standard excludes any consideration of costs. This bill would require EPA to consider the risks to vulnerable subpopulations, like children, pregnant women, workers, and set restrictions if necessary to protect them. The TSCA Modernization Act will go a long way towards ensuring that all American families--especially for families of chemical facility workers and fence line communities in our congressional district in Houston and Harris County, Texas--are protected from potentially harmful chemicals and bring needed regulatory clarity to this important sector of our Nation's economy. I would like to thank both Chairman Shimkus and Ranking Member Tonko of the Subcommittee on the Environment and the Economy and Chairman Upton and Ranking Member Pallone of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and their staffs for the hard work and willingness to work together to make TSCA reform a reality. I would also like to personally thank my legislative director, Sergio Espinosa, who has worked on this for three terms, I think, Mr. Speaker. I want to ask my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to join us and vote in support of this important legislation. {time} 1530 Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps). Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, we all know that our chemical regulatory system is badly broken and that it has been broken for a very long time. When it comes to chemicals, weak statutory authority and limited resources have prevented the EPA from fulfilling its mission of protecting public health and the environment. Current law is so weak that the EPA famously could not even use it to ban the use of asbestos despite overwhelming evidence that asbestos poses serious risks to human health. Even when the EPA can successfully regulate a chemical under the Toxic Substances Control Act, which we know as TSCA--which has happened only five times--they must do so using a flawed cost-benefit analysis that prioritizes profits over health and safety. These are just a few of the many serious flaws of the current system. While the TSCA Modernization Act does not address all of these problems, it does take several important steps forward that will help improve the health and safety of consumers and their families. It finally ensures that health, not cost, is the standard by which the safety of chemicals is evaluated; it maintains critical State chemical safety laws, such as California's landmark Proposition 65; and for the first time, it includes explicit protections for vulnerable populations, such as pregnant mothers, children, and seniors. I want to commend Chairmen Upton and Shimkus, Ranking Members Pallone and Tonko, and the committee staffs for all of their hard work and commitment for making this a truly bipartisan bill. It is far from perfect, but it has improved at every step of the process, and I hope that continues. Should the Senate pass its TSCA reform package, I hope this cooperation continues in conference so we can produce an even stronger bill. Mr. Speaker, for far too long, our chemical laws have prioritized profits over human health and safety. This bill would put an end to this inequity and to many other serious failings of the current system. The TSCA Modernization Act is a good compromise and is a major step forward. That is why I will be voting for it today, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette). Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2576, the TSCA Modernization Act. Since the 111th Congress, a lot of us have been wrestling very seriously with how to reform the EPA's current regime for reviewing and regulating chemicals. Everyone agrees that the statute has been broken for most of the decades that it has been in effect. Devising a new program, though, that would both enable the EPA to take meaningful action on the chemicals that truly need regulation and that will protect the health of our citizens was an uphill battle in deeply partisan times; yet what we have come up with is a true compromise. We have focused on the aspects of current law that really need to be addressed, and we have developed language that will move the ball forward. As all of the other speakers have said, our work is not done after the vote later today. The Senate, in working its own will, has come up with a reform bill that takes a distinctly different approach. We have a lot to reconcile. It is important that legislation makes it to the President's desk that will equip the EPA to protect us from toxic chemicals over the long term. Ultimately, we will be judged by how well the new law works, not only over the next few years, but over the coming decade. I want to add my thanks, Mr. Speaker, to Congressman Frank Pallone, Congressman Shimkus, Congressman Tonko, Congressman Gene Green, all of our staffs, and, in particular, to my legislative director, Eleanor Bastian, who has been working on this bill ever since we really started seriously negotiating. One last thing--and I think it is important--is that Congresswoman Capps mentioned that this bill will not preempt State law and that it will not preempt Proposition 65. This was an important provision, and I want to thank Congressman Shimkus and his staff for working on it with us because it is important that we have these kinds of protections that we need. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. In closing, I will just say thank you again to Mr. Shimkus, in particular, for reaching out to me and to Mr. Tonko on this legislation and for making it bipartisan. [[Page H4559]] I almost feel anticlimactic today because I know how much hard work has gone into getting this bill to the floor. I know we are going to work hard after it passes in the House to get it passed in the Senate and to have a law that goes to the President, so I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. This is a good bill, and I am going to give my thanks to my colleagues, too. We want a good vote today because we want to make sure we have a strong House position as we go into negotiations with the Senate, and I think we are going to have that. I also appreciate the leadership for bringing this up on the suspension calendar, which, I think, shows a lot of support right at the outset. As everyone else has done, I want to take a moment to thank our colleagues. This has been a multiyear, multi-Congress approach. As a former high school teacher in government history, so far, the system is working on this bill, and we are hoping for good things as we move forward with conference and get something to the President's desk. I harken back to Paul Tonko's comment and Frank Pallone's comment that we could pass a bill but that, if we wanted to pass a law, we really needed to open up the process a little bit. That was very helpful to me, and I appreciate that. I also want to thank Chairman Upton, obviously, for his leadership and for his friendship. Diana DeGette, who just spoke, and Gene Green have both been with me, slaving away, over the last couple of years. We have learned a lot about each other, and we have learned a lot about the law, and it is a very difficult law to understand. We also started getting help from Bob Latta, from Ohio, and from Bill Johnson, and I want to thank them for their help. H.R. 2576 has also gained letters of support from a variety of stakeholders, which include--and sometimes this shocks people to know that we have this group of diverse interests--the American Chemistry Council, the American Alliance for Innovation, the American Cleaning Institute, the Consumer Specialty Products Association, the National Association of Chemical Distributors, the National Wildlife Federation, just to name a few. I also want to thank two people who never promoted any particular policy but who were responsible for exceptional quality in the legislation before us--Tim Brown and Kakuti Lin, who are our House legislative counsel. They make sure that the words in the bill do what we intend them to do. That is a part of this process that really goes unrecognized, the people who are legislative counsel. They spend long hours, and we ask them to do heavy lifting on short notice, so we want to make sure that we thank them here today. In a highly technical field such as chemical risk management, that is not an easy task. I thank them for their skill, dedication, and hard work. Finally, I would like to recognize the dedicated staffs on both sides of the aisle who helped us craft this legislation--David McCarthy, who has already been mentioned, along with Jerry Couri on the Energy and Commerce staff. Understanding our chemical regulations has helped Members navigate through the complex nature of TSCA reform from our very first informational hearing in the last Congress. I know, over there, we have got Jackie Cohen, who in the last Congress was a real pain in the rear end to me, but, this year, we have been able to work together, which has been helpful. Jean Fruci also was a calming influence, and we appreciate her steady guidance. They have both provided quality input to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle throughout this process. I appreciate their dedication, oftentimes through nights and weekends, to help us get to where we are today. I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2576 to send a strong signal that the time is now to update this outdated law and to keep the momentum and the bipartisan spirit moving forward until the President signs it into law. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the purpose of engaging Chairman Shimkus in colloquy. First, I would like to thank Mr. Shimkus for working with me during and after markup to make sure that the important role of states in chemical regulation is preserved. In the absence of a strong federal chemical regulatory program, many states have taken action to protect their citizens from toxic chemicals. Strong laws are in place in many states to address chemicals including BPA, flame retardants, and more. Through the Committee process, explicit protections have been added for state laws and state common laws, including important changes taken from the amendment that I offered at markup. My amendment was drafted in response to the letter sent by 12 State Attorneys General, which I would like to introduce now into the Record. Again, I appreciate you working with me to address the points they raised. It is my understanding that nothing in this bill would preempt or otherwise affect existing state laws or private rights of action, unless there is an actual conflict between a federal requirement and a state requirement. Is that correct? Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, Yes it is. H.R. 2576 contains protection for existing state laws and existing citizen enforcement actions. No existing state requirements will be preempted unless they actually conflict with federal requirements. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, as you know, over twenty-five years ago, the people of California enacted a landmark ballot measure known as Proposition 65. Proposition 65 requires persons who expose individuals to certain chemicals that are known to cause cancer or reproductive harm to display a clear and reasonable warning. Proposition 65 enforcement actions by the state and by private parties have played a crucial role in reducing childhood exposure to harmful chemicals. This state law operates somewhat differently from other state laws related to chemicals, so I want to ask specifically about the protection for Proposition 65 in the bill. It is my understanding that nothing in this bill would preempt or otherwise impact enforcement of Proposition 65 or the ability of the State to continue to authorize citizen enforcement of Proposition 65, unless there is an actual conflict. Is that correct? Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, that is correct. We do not intend to interfere with operation of Proposition 65 unless a requirement under that law actually conflicts with a federal requirement under TSCA. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, and just to be clear, the waiver provision in Section 18(b) of current law, which could protect additional state laws, is not changed by this bill? Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, that is correct. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, this is a long time coming. The breakthrough bipartisan bill before us today is the culmination of a multi-year, multi-Congress effort to modernize our decades-old chemical safety laws. The Toxic Substances Control Act, which was signed into law by Michigan's own President Jerry Ford, needs to be updated for the 21st century. And this thoughtful bill improves chemical safety while encouraging continued innovation and economic growth and gives the public greater confidence in the safety of American-made chemicals and the products that contain them. There are six core elements that form the basis of the TSCA Modernization Act. First, this bill helps markets work and provides certainty. Chemicals will get reviewed and will be ruled either safe for intended uses, or in need of a risk management rule. Once a decision is made by EPA, that decision will apply in all the states. Manufacturers won't have to produce 50 different product versions for 50 different states. Second, the bill respects the role of states and individual rights of action. Tort and contract claims are explicitly protected in the pre- emption section. Third, any regulation of a chemical will be guided by common sense. Is the regulation cost effective? If use in an article were restricted, will exposure actually go down? Is there a feasible replacement? Is the transition period fair? Without good answers to these questions regulation will not move forward. Fourth, the bill will build confidence for consumers and the general public that chemicals on the market anywhere in the U.S. are safe, and not just because EPA says so. EPA must evaluate risk against the most stringent science standards we've ever enacted for chemicals. And the science has to be transparent and hold up to objective peer review. Fifth, the bill lets government and industry actually collaborate. Chemical manufacturers are given the choice to ask for and get a chemical evaluated. And EPA must meet strict action deadlines. If the science indicates the chemical is safe, then EPA must say so, and that determination will be the law in all 50 states. Finally, the bill encourages innovation, largely by protecting confidential business information. New technology is not likely to appear if the secret formula can be stolen and [[Page H4560]] copied the minute a new product appears. This bill would prevent that from happening. Each of the elements of the bill are not trade-offs, each provision works to the support the others. It would not accomplish much good for EPA to evaluate all these chemicals if the results were not going to apply in all the states. It does not make sense for the government to be writing safety regulations if the result is no real improvement in safety. And a manufacturer is not likely to cooperate with the government in chemical evaluation if to do so means giving up a trade secret. The TSCA Modernization Act solves each of these concerns, as all these safeguards work together. Mr. Speaker, this is a big day. The TSCA Modernization Act is good for consumers, good for trade, and good for the environment. I especially commend Mr. Shimkus, Mr. Pallone, Mr. Tonko, and Mr. Latta for their dedication and hard work in putting together a bill that can be signed into law. Let's put jobs and the economy first and vote yes. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2576, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [House] [Pages H4551-H4560] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TSCA MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2015 Mr. SHIMKUS.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. General Leave Mr. SHIMKUS. I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois? There was no objection. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the TSCA Modernization Act has been a long time in coming. We actually started work on this bill in the last Congress. We held a total of eight hearings and received testimony from a broad range of stakeholders, including the administration; but most importantly, we worked with each other, Member to Member, across the aisle. The bill before you, Mr. Speaker, reflects lessons learned over the course of the last 3 years in which we worked on TSCA reform. First, the bill is clear and understandable. Despite the highly technical nature of chemical regulation, Members can pick up this bill, read it from beginning to end, and understand what it does and how it works. Second, the bill does not try to be all things for all people. Major sections of TSCA are not amended at all. For example, we leave the process for new chemical review in TSCA section 5 unchanged because it is working pretty well right now, and changes could make it worse. The heart of the bill is our approach to regulating chemicals already on the market. Thousands of these chemicals have been in commerce for many years, and they pose no known risks and really don't need to be regulated at all. We leave those alone. But we do allow some existing chemicals to be scientifically evaluated for risk and, if necessary, to have that risk managed through a rule by the EPA. Chemicals may be chosen for risk evaluation in one of two ways: either EPA may select a chemical for risk evaluation based on what EPA knows may pose an unreasonable risk, or the manufacturer may designate a chemical for EPA to evaluate for risk. Now, why would a manufacturer invite EPA scrutiny of its product? There are several reasons. First, some interest or even a retailer may be raising concerns about a product, and the manufacturer wants to put those concerns to rest. Or one or two States may be thinking about regulating the chemical. The State-by-State approach can spell disaster for someone trying to capture economies of scale in a national market. What better way to put these concerns to rest than to have EPA, with the scientific standards that we require, perform an objective risk evaluation? Then the EPA decision on that chemical will apply in all the States, and consumers and the public can have the confidence that the chemical is safe for its intended uses. Another area in the legislation that required careful discussion and negotiation is preemption. Of course, we want to make sure national markets are just that and not a patchwork of restrictions varying State to State. At the same time, we did not want to deny anyone a legitimate cause of action under State tort or contract law. So that is what we said: as long as the State law does not conflict with the Federal ruling, the State action may continue. Mr. Speaker, the bill has strict but attainable deadlines for action. If EPA initiates a risk evaluation, it must finish in 3 years. If a manufacturer initiates one and includes information EPA needs to make a decision, EPA should finish that in 2 years. Once the risk evaluation is complete, if EPA decides a rule is needed to manage the risk, EPA must propose the rule within a year. The risk evaluation itself only asks does the chemical present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. That is a science question based on a combination of hazard and actual exposure. If there is an unreasonable risk, the agency's decision on how to manage it is based on many other factors such as cost effectiveness, whether restricting an article will actually reduce exposure, whether replacements are available, and many other concerns. H.R. 2576 permits EPA to regulate articles in those areas where regulation of chemical substances and mixtures alone would not be effective to reduce the identified risk, but requires EPA to be careful in addressing replacement parts that serve a commercially intended function or the original product or are needed to maintain the functionality of the original product. We think this system sets a new standard for quality regulation. Of course, we want to be protected from harm, but we do not want needless, expensive regulations. Consumers want safe choices, not no choice at all. Mr. Speaker, we are on the brink of setting up a commonsense approach to protecting people from unsafe chemical exposure that will become the standard of the world. {time} 1515 We want our constituents to be safe, and we want markets to work. This bill delivers both. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Nearly four decades ago, Congress enacted the Toxic Substances Control Act to identify and regulate risks from dangerous chemicals. Unfortunately, the statute has never worked. Improvements to the law are long overdue, and I am happy to be here today with my Energy and Commerce colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this landmark reform legislation. Mr. Speaker, what brought us together is the failure of the current statute to keep the American public safe and to provide confidence in the safety of American products. Toxic chemicals can be found in the products we use every day and are steadily building up in our bodies and the environment. Consumers are worried about chemicals like BPA and triclosan, but they don't know how to avoid them. It seems like every day there is a new study about how chemicals are negatively affecting our health, and something needs to change. The Energy and Commerce Committee has held many hearings over the last 6 years to understand why TSCA isn't working. Some critical flaws were built into the statute, like the grandfathering of over 60,000 chemicals in 1976 without any safety review. Other flaws came to light only through litigation, like the impossible analytical burden of the statute's ``least burdensome'' clause. Even though we have recognized these flaws, forward progress has been elusive. When Chairman Shimkus and Chairman Upton approached Ranking Member Tonko and myself about working on a streamlined approach to address the essential components of reform, I was hopeful. The result is a bipartisan bill that will remove major obstacles to EPA action and give the Agency new authority and new resources. It will offer more protection and more implementation than current law. It is a strong compromise, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2576 will empower EPA to regulate the universe of chemicals that were grandfathered in 1976 by removing the requirement that EPA impose the ``least burdensome'' regulatory option and by establishing a [[Page H4557]] risk-based standard for risk management, instead of a cost-benefit standard. For the first time, the decision of whether a chemical needs to be regulated will be based purely on the risk it poses. H.R. 2576 will improve EPA's access to information about potentially dangerous chemicals by allowing EPA to require testing through orders and consent agreements, not just rulemakings, and by authorizing EPA to seek data when needed for a risk evaluation without first demonstrating risk. H.R. 2576 will provide expedited action for the worst chemicals, those that are persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic. Under this bill, we can expect quick action to get these chemicals out of our environment and out of our bodies. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2576 will explicitly and directly protect vulnerable populations like children, workers, the elderly, and hotspot communities. The bill will provide more resources for EPA to carry out this important program by removing outdated caps on user fees. It would also ensure that those fees are deposited in a dedicated trust fund for TSCA implementation. Under the bill, all future confidential business information claims by industry would have to be substantiated, preventing abuse and ensuring greater transparency. H.R. 2576 would ensure that States maintain their important role as partners in chemical regulation. Under the bill, preemption of State laws would be more limited than current law and other proposals. No State law would be preempted until Federal requirements are in effect. Many State laws would be protected from preemption, including existing State laws, new State laws adopted to address air and water quality or implement other Federal laws, State tort claims, and State laws regulating uses not evaluated by EPA. In response to concerns raised by stakeholders and Members, a few additional important clarifications have been made following committee markup, and I thank the chairman for working with us to make those changes. There is now clear authority for EPA to set a schedule if manufacturer-requested risk evaluations exceed EPA's capacity, ensuring that such requests won't overwhelm the program. The grandfathering provision for existing State laws has also been clarified based on feedback from State attorneys general. Mr. Speaker, strong committee report language further clarifies the limited role of costs in risks management, the preservation of State monitoring and reporting requirements, and the expansion of EPA's testing authority. I know that tomorrow, we will get back to disagreeing on the importance of environmental protection and the essential role EPA plays in keeping America safe, but for today, we can all agree on the need for a strong and protective Federal regulatory program for chemicals. I want to thank Chairman Shimkus and Chairman Upton for their leadership and their willingness to work with Democrats and stakeholders to craft this legislation. I would also like to thank Jackie Cohen of my staff for her hard work on this legislation, as well as Dave McCarthy of the majority staff for his efforts. This is a true testament to what we can achieve when we work together. I look forward to supporting this bill, and I hope all my colleagues will join me in supporting this landmark legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Bucshon), my colleague. Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2576, the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015, which updates the Toxic Substances Control Act, TSCA, of 1976. This legislation will benefit the Eighth District of Indiana and our Nation by improving the regulation of chemicals in commerce. Indiana's Eighth District has a strong and diverse manufacturing sector, including plastics, fertilizer production, automobiles, and medical devices, which play pivotal roles in the local and State economy. H.R. 2576 will improve the EPA's outdated regulatory process for these industries and manufacturers, fostering conditions for stronger interstate commerce, and ensure robust protections for public health and the environment. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko), the ranking member of the subcommittee. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey and our ranking member on the Energy and Commerce Committee, Representative Pallone, for yielding. Mr. Speaker, 40 years ago, Congress passed the Toxic Substances Control Act, which created a Federal program to manage the risks associated with our Nation's industrial chemicals. That law, TSCA, has never met that need. As a result, the public has lost confidence in this Federal program. The many failings of the current law have been pointed out in reports, reports issued by the Government Accountability Office and others. Well-intentioned attempts over the years to address some of the problems administratively or through voluntary agreements amongst the Environmental Protection Agency, the chemical industry, and the environmental and public health communities have failed. The public has too little information about the safety of chemicals that they are exposed to every day in virtually every product that they use. Even in the face of overwhelming evidence of harm to people's health, EPA is unable to regulate exposure to toxic chemicals. Congress had to step in and explicitly legislate to gain public health and environmental protections from PCBs, for instance, and asbestos. Because of the regulatory vacuum at the Federal level, some States have legislated to secure protections for their citizens. In some cases, large retailers have initiated their own chemical policies to respond to what are consumers' concerns. Forty years of ineffective Federal policy is enough. H.R. 2576, the TSCA Modernization Act, amends TSCA and corrects the fundamental flaws that exist in our law. When my colleague Chairman Shimkus began the effort to reform TSCA in the last Congress, I knew the committee could produce a bill. I believed we could. I was not convinced, however, that we could pass a law; but H.R. 2576 is a decisive step, I believe, in that direction. I thank Chairman Shimkus, Chairman Upton, and Ranking Member Pallone for their continued cooperation and dedicated effort on behalf of this legislation. This truly has been a productive partnership, and the result is a good bill, a bill that I am pleased to support. H.R. 2576 is the result of much discussion, much work, and compromise by all parties involved. While no one group gets all that they might have hoped for in this legislation, every stakeholder group gets something that they need. Frankly, we all need a functional, fair, and reliable Federal program of chemical regulation. Industry gains a fair, predictable Federal program for chemical regulation, a program that will inspire public confidence in the safety of their products. In the context of our global economy, that is an important asset for doing business both here and in other countries. The public health and environmental communities gain a Federal program in which EPA evaluates chemicals and, based on those evaluations, will act to regulate chemicals the Agency determines present a risk to health or a risk to the environment. Under current law, in order to regulate a chemical, EPA must demonstrate that the benefits of regulating outweigh the costs. Under H.R. 2576, EPA's evaluation and decision on whether to act will be based solely on risk factors, risk factors alone. Considerations of cost will be addressed when the Agency selects among different regulatory options to reduce chemical exposures. That is a major gain--a major gain--for public health and a major gain for the environment. H.R. 2576 is a good bill. It offers significant improvements over our current law. I know many Members have concerns about states' rights and State preemption provisions in TSCA. I share those concerns. There is State preemption in current law, and there is State preemption in H.R. 2576, but State preemption only [[Page H4558]] occurs when EPA takes final--final--action on a chemical, either finding it safe or regulating its risks. H.R. 2576 maintains a strong role for the States. With those changes in TSCA, the States will have a more active and credible partner in this effort at the Federal level. Again, I want to thank Chairman Shimkus, Chairman Upton, and Ranking Member Pallone for their excellent work on this bill. I appreciate the constructive partnership that we formed in working together on this legislation. We worked through many difficult issues and found that common ground. I look forward to continuing to work together as this bill moves on to the Senate. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. PALLONE. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. TONKO. I thank the gentleman. I urge my colleagues to end the ineffective chemical policy that we have had for four decades and to support H.R. 2576. I, too, would like to thank some individuals who are very pertinent to this discussion and final product. I thank David McCarthy from the subcommittee staff on the majority side and Jerry Couri from the subcommittee staff, Jackie Cohen from our subcommittee staff on the Democratic side, and Chris Sarley of Chairman Shimkus' personal office staff, and Jean Fruci of my personal staff, the legislative director for my Congressional office. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, could I ask how much time is remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey has 9\1/2\ minutes remaining. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green). Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2576, the TSCA Modernization Act. I am a proud cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation that will update the Toxic Substances Control Act, our Nation's primary statute regulating the use and safety of commercial chemicals for the first time since it was enacted in 1976. This legislation will directly address many of current TSCA's biggest flaws, including eliminating the ``least burdensome'' requirement and explicitly clarifying the law's safety standard excludes any consideration of costs. This bill would require EPA to consider the risks to vulnerable subpopulations, like children, pregnant women, workers, and set restrictions if necessary to protect them. The TSCA Modernization Act will go a long way towards ensuring that all American families--especially for families of chemical facility workers and fence line communities in our congressional district in Houston and Harris County, Texas--are protected from potentially harmful chemicals and bring needed regulatory clarity to this important sector of our Nation's economy. I would like to thank both Chairman Shimkus and Ranking Member Tonko of the Subcommittee on the Environment and the Economy and Chairman Upton and Ranking Member Pallone of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and their staffs for the hard work and willingness to work together to make TSCA reform a reality. I would also like to personally thank my legislative director, Sergio Espinosa, who has worked on this for three terms, I think, Mr. Speaker. I want to ask my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to join us and vote in support of this important legislation. {time} 1530 Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps). Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, we all know that our chemical regulatory system is badly broken and that it has been broken for a very long time. When it comes to chemicals, weak statutory authority and limited resources have prevented the EPA from fulfilling its mission of protecting public health and the environment. Current law is so weak that the EPA famously could not even use it to ban the use of asbestos despite overwhelming evidence that asbestos poses serious risks to human health. Even when the EPA can successfully regulate a chemical under the Toxic Substances Control Act, which we know as TSCA--which has happened only five times--they must do so using a flawed cost-benefit analysis that prioritizes profits over health and safety. These are just a few of the many serious flaws of the current system. While the TSCA Modernization Act does not address all of these problems, it does take several important steps forward that will help improve the health and safety of consumers and their families. It finally ensures that health, not cost, is the standard by which the safety of chemicals is evaluated; it maintains critical State chemical safety laws, such as California's landmark Proposition 65; and for the first time, it includes explicit protections for vulnerable populations, such as pregnant mothers, children, and seniors. I want to commend Chairmen Upton and Shimkus, Ranking Members Pallone and Tonko, and the committee staffs for all of their hard work and commitment for making this a truly bipartisan bill. It is far from perfect, but it has improved at every step of the process, and I hope that continues. Should the Senate pass its TSCA reform package, I hope this cooperation continues in conference so we can produce an even stronger bill. Mr. Speaker, for far too long, our chemical laws have prioritized profits over human health and safety. This bill would put an end to this inequity and to many other serious failings of the current system. The TSCA Modernization Act is a good compromise and is a major step forward. That is why I will be voting for it today, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette). Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2576, the TSCA Modernization Act. Since the 111th Congress, a lot of us have been wrestling very seriously with how to reform the EPA's current regime for reviewing and regulating chemicals. Everyone agrees that the statute has been broken for most of the decades that it has been in effect. Devising a new program, though, that would both enable the EPA to take meaningful action on the chemicals that truly need regulation and that will protect the health of our citizens was an uphill battle in deeply partisan times; yet what we have come up with is a true compromise. We have focused on the aspects of current law that really need to be addressed, and we have developed language that will move the ball forward. As all of the other speakers have said, our work is not done after the vote later today. The Senate, in working its own will, has come up with a reform bill that takes a distinctly different approach. We have a lot to reconcile. It is important that legislation makes it to the President's desk that will equip the EPA to protect us from toxic chemicals over the long term. Ultimately, we will be judged by how well the new law works, not only over the next few years, but over the coming decade. I want to add my thanks, Mr. Speaker, to Congressman Frank Pallone, Congressman Shimkus, Congressman Tonko, Congressman Gene Green, all of our staffs, and, in particular, to my legislative director, Eleanor Bastian, who has been working on this bill ever since we really started seriously negotiating. One last thing--and I think it is important--is that Congresswoman Capps mentioned that this bill will not preempt State law and that it will not preempt Proposition 65. This was an important provision, and I want to thank Congressman Shimkus and his staff for working on it with us because it is important that we have these kinds of protections that we need. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. In closing, I will just say thank you again to Mr. Shimkus, in particular, for reaching out to me and to Mr. Tonko on this legislation and for making it bipartisan. [[Page H4559]] I almost feel anticlimactic today because I know how much hard work has gone into getting this bill to the floor. I know we are going to work hard after it passes in the House to get it passed in the Senate and to have a law that goes to the President, so I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. This is a good bill, and I am going to give my thanks to my colleagues, too. We want a good vote today because we want to make sure we have a strong House position as we go into negotiations with the Senate, and I think we are going to have that. I also appreciate the leadership for bringing this up on the suspension calendar, which, I think, shows a lot of support right at the outset. As everyone else has done, I want to take a moment to thank our colleagues. This has been a multiyear, multi-Congress approach. As a former high school teacher in government history, so far, the system is working on this bill, and we are hoping for good things as we move forward with conference and get something to the President's desk. I harken back to Paul Tonko's comment and Frank Pallone's comment that we could pass a bill but that, if we wanted to pass a law, we really needed to open up the process a little bit. That was very helpful to me, and I appreciate that. I also want to thank Chairman Upton, obviously, for his leadership and for his friendship. Diana DeGette, who just spoke, and Gene Green have both been with me, slaving away, over the last couple of years. We have learned a lot about each other, and we have learned a lot about the law, and it is a very difficult law to understand. We also started getting help from Bob Latta, from Ohio, and from Bill Johnson, and I want to thank them for their help. H.R. 2576 has also gained letters of support from a variety of stakeholders, which include--and sometimes this shocks people to know that we have this group of diverse interests--the American Chemistry Council, the American Alliance for Innovation, the American Cleaning Institute, the Consumer Specialty Products Association, the National Association of Chemical Distributors, the National Wildlife Federation, just to name a few. I also want to thank two people who never promoted any particular policy but who were responsible for exceptional quality in the legislation before us--Tim Brown and Kakuti Lin, who are our House legislative counsel. They make sure that the words in the bill do what we intend them to do. That is a part of this process that really goes unrecognized, the people who are legislative counsel. They spend long hours, and we ask them to do heavy lifting on short notice, so we want to make sure that we thank them here today. In a highly technical field such as chemical risk management, that is not an easy task. I thank them for their skill, dedication, and hard work. Finally, I would like to recognize the dedicated staffs on both sides of the aisle who helped us craft this legislation--David McCarthy, who has already been mentioned, along with Jerry Couri on the Energy and Commerce staff. Understanding our chemical regulations has helped Members navigate through the complex nature of TSCA reform from our very first informational hearing in the last Congress. I know, over there, we have got Jackie Cohen, who in the last Congress was a real pain in the rear end to me, but, this year, we have been able to work together, which has been helpful. Jean Fruci also was a calming influence, and we appreciate her steady guidance. They have both provided quality input to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle throughout this process. I appreciate their dedication, oftentimes through nights and weekends, to help us get to where we are today. I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2576 to send a strong signal that the time is now to update this outdated law and to keep the momentum and the bipartisan spirit moving forward until the President signs it into law. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the purpose of engaging Chairman Shimkus in colloquy. First, I would like to thank Mr. Shimkus for working with me during and after markup to make sure that the important role of states in chemical regulation is preserved. In the absence of a strong federal chemical regulatory program, many states have taken action to protect their citizens from toxic chemicals. Strong laws are in place in many states to address chemicals including BPA, flame retardants, and more. Through the Committee process, explicit protections have been added for state laws and state common laws, including important changes taken from the amendment that I offered at markup. My amendment was drafted in response to the letter sent by 12 State Attorneys General, which I would like to introduce now into the Record. Again, I appreciate you working with me to address the points they raised. It is my understanding that nothing in this bill would preempt or otherwise affect existing state laws or private rights of action, unless there is an actual conflict between a federal requirement and a state requirement. Is that correct? Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, Yes it is. H.R. 2576 contains protection for existing state laws and existing citizen enforcement actions. No existing state requirements will be preempted unless they actually conflict with federal requirements. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, as you know, over twenty-five years ago, the people of California enacted a landmark ballot measure known as Proposition 65. Proposition 65 requires persons who expose individuals to certain chemicals that are known to cause cancer or reproductive harm to display a clear and reasonable warning. Proposition 65 enforcement actions by the state and by private parties have played a crucial role in reducing childhood exposure to harmful chemicals. This state law operates somewhat differently from other state laws related to chemicals, so I want to ask specifically about the protection for Proposition 65 in the bill. It is my understanding that nothing in this bill would preempt or otherwise impact enforcement of Proposition 65 or the ability of the State to continue to authorize citizen enforcement of Proposition 65, unless there is an actual conflict. Is that correct? Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, that is correct. We do not intend to interfere with operation of Proposition 65 unless a requirement under that law actually conflicts with a federal requirement under TSCA. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, and just to be clear, the waiver provision in Section 18(b) of current law, which could protect additional state laws, is not changed by this bill? Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, that is correct. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, this is a long time coming. The breakthrough bipartisan bill before us today is the culmination of a multi-year, multi-Congress effort to modernize our decades-old chemical safety laws. The Toxic Substances Control Act, which was signed into law by Michigan's own President Jerry Ford, needs to be updated for the 21st century. And this thoughtful bill improves chemical safety while encouraging continued innovation and economic growth and gives the public greater confidence in the safety of American-made chemicals and the products that contain them. There are six core elements that form the basis of the TSCA Modernization Act. First, this bill helps markets work and provides certainty. Chemicals will get reviewed and will be ruled either safe for intended uses, or in need of a risk management rule. Once a decision is made by EPA, that decision will apply in all the states. Manufacturers won't have to produce 50 different product versions for 50 different states. Second, the bill respects the role of states and individual rights of action. Tort and contract claims are explicitly protected in the pre- emption section. Third, any regulation of a chemical will be guided by common sense. Is the regulation cost effective? If use in an article were restricted, will exposure actually go down? Is there a feasible replacement? Is the transition period fair? Without good answers to these questions regulation will not move forward. Fourth, the bill will build confidence for consumers and the general public that chemicals on the market anywhere in the U.S. are safe, and not just because EPA says so. EPA must evaluate risk against the most stringent science standards we've ever enacted for chemicals. And the science has to be transparent and hold up to objective peer review. Fifth, the bill lets government and industry actually collaborate. Chemical manufacturers are given the choice to ask for and get a chemical evaluated. And EPA must meet strict action deadlines. If the science indicates the chemical is safe, then EPA must say so, and that determination will be the law in all 50 states. Finally, the bill encourages innovation, largely by protecting confidential business information. New technology is not likely to appear if the secret formula can be stolen and [[Page H4560]] copied the minute a new product appears. This bill would prevent that from happening. Each of the elements of the bill are not trade-offs, each provision works to the support the others. It would not accomplish much good for EPA to evaluate all these chemicals if the results were not going to apply in all the states. It does not make sense for the government to be writing safety regulations if the result is no real improvement in safety. And a manufacturer is not likely to cooperate with the government in chemical evaluation if to do so means giving up a trade secret. The TSCA Modernization Act solves each of these concerns, as all these safeguards work together. Mr. Speaker, this is a big day. The TSCA Modernization Act is good for consumers, good for trade, and good for the environment. I especially commend Mr. Shimkus, Mr. Pallone, Mr. Tonko, and Mr. Latta for their dedication and hard work in putting together a bill that can be signed into law. Let's put jobs and the economy first and vote yes. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2576, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [House] [Pages H4551-H4560] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TSCA MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2015 Mr. SHIMKUS.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois. General Leave Mr. SHIMKUS. I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois? There was no objection. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the TSCA Modernization Act has been a long time in coming. We actually started work on this bill in the last Congress. We held a total of eight hearings and received testimony from a broad range of stakeholders, including the administration; but most importantly, we worked with each other, Member to Member, across the aisle. The bill before you, Mr. Speaker, reflects lessons learned over the course of the last 3 years in which we worked on TSCA reform. First, the bill is clear and understandable. Despite the highly technical nature of chemical regulation, Members can pick up this bill, read it from beginning to end, and understand what it does and how it works. Second, the bill does not try to be all things for all people. Major sections of TSCA are not amended at all. For example, we leave the process for new chemical review in TSCA section 5 unchanged because it is working pretty well right now, and changes could make it worse. The heart of the bill is our approach to regulating chemicals already on the market. Thousands of these chemicals have been in commerce for many years, and they pose no known risks and really don't need to be regulated at all. We leave those alone. But we do allow some existing chemicals to be scientifically evaluated for risk and, if necessary, to have that risk managed through a rule by the EPA. Chemicals may be chosen for risk evaluation in one of two ways: either EPA may select a chemical for risk evaluation based on what EPA knows may pose an unreasonable risk, or the manufacturer may designate a chemical for EPA to evaluate for risk. Now, why would a manufacturer invite EPA scrutiny of its product? There are several reasons. First, some interest or even a retailer may be raising concerns about a product, and the manufacturer wants to put those concerns to rest. Or one or two States may be thinking about regulating the chemical. The State-by-State approach can spell disaster for someone trying to capture economies of scale in a national market. What better way to put these concerns to rest than to have EPA, with the scientific standards that we require, perform an objective risk evaluation? Then the EPA decision on that chemical will apply in all the States, and consumers and the public can have the confidence that the chemical is safe for its intended uses. Another area in the legislation that required careful discussion and negotiation is preemption. Of course, we want to make sure national markets are just that and not a patchwork of restrictions varying State to State. At the same time, we did not want to deny anyone a legitimate cause of action under State tort or contract law. So that is what we said: as long as the State law does not conflict with the Federal ruling, the State action may continue. Mr. Speaker, the bill has strict but attainable deadlines for action. If EPA initiates a risk evaluation, it must finish in 3 years. If a manufacturer initiates one and includes information EPA needs to make a decision, EPA should finish that in 2 years. Once the risk evaluation is complete, if EPA decides a rule is needed to manage the risk, EPA must propose the rule within a year. The risk evaluation itself only asks does the chemical present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. That is a science question based on a combination of hazard and actual exposure. If there is an unreasonable risk, the agency's decision on how to manage it is based on many other factors such as cost effectiveness, whether restricting an article will actually reduce exposure, whether replacements are available, and many other concerns. H.R. 2576 permits EPA to regulate articles in those areas where regulation of chemical substances and mixtures alone would not be effective to reduce the identified risk, but requires EPA to be careful in addressing replacement parts that serve a commercially intended function or the original product or are needed to maintain the functionality of the original product. We think this system sets a new standard for quality regulation. Of course, we want to be protected from harm, but we do not want needless, expensive regulations. Consumers want safe choices, not no choice at all. Mr. Speaker, we are on the brink of setting up a commonsense approach to protecting people from unsafe chemical exposure that will become the standard of the world. {time} 1515 We want our constituents to be safe, and we want markets to work. This bill delivers both. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Nearly four decades ago, Congress enacted the Toxic Substances Control Act to identify and regulate risks from dangerous chemicals. Unfortunately, the statute has never worked. Improvements to the law are long overdue, and I am happy to be here today with my Energy and Commerce colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this landmark reform legislation. Mr. Speaker, what brought us together is the failure of the current statute to keep the American public safe and to provide confidence in the safety of American products. Toxic chemicals can be found in the products we use every day and are steadily building up in our bodies and the environment. Consumers are worried about chemicals like BPA and triclosan, but they don't know how to avoid them. It seems like every day there is a new study about how chemicals are negatively affecting our health, and something needs to change. The Energy and Commerce Committee has held many hearings over the last 6 years to understand why TSCA isn't working. Some critical flaws were built into the statute, like the grandfathering of over 60,000 chemicals in 1976 without any safety review. Other flaws came to light only through litigation, like the impossible analytical burden of the statute's ``least burdensome'' clause. Even though we have recognized these flaws, forward progress has been elusive. When Chairman Shimkus and Chairman Upton approached Ranking Member Tonko and myself about working on a streamlined approach to address the essential components of reform, I was hopeful. The result is a bipartisan bill that will remove major obstacles to EPA action and give the Agency new authority and new resources. It will offer more protection and more implementation than current law. It is a strong compromise, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2576 will empower EPA to regulate the universe of chemicals that were grandfathered in 1976 by removing the requirement that EPA impose the ``least burdensome'' regulatory option and by establishing a [[Page H4557]] risk-based standard for risk management, instead of a cost-benefit standard. For the first time, the decision of whether a chemical needs to be regulated will be based purely on the risk it poses. H.R. 2576 will improve EPA's access to information about potentially dangerous chemicals by allowing EPA to require testing through orders and consent agreements, not just rulemakings, and by authorizing EPA to seek data when needed for a risk evaluation without first demonstrating risk. H.R. 2576 will provide expedited action for the worst chemicals, those that are persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic. Under this bill, we can expect quick action to get these chemicals out of our environment and out of our bodies. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2576 will explicitly and directly protect vulnerable populations like children, workers, the elderly, and hotspot communities. The bill will provide more resources for EPA to carry out this important program by removing outdated caps on user fees. It would also ensure that those fees are deposited in a dedicated trust fund for TSCA implementation. Under the bill, all future confidential business information claims by industry would have to be substantiated, preventing abuse and ensuring greater transparency. H.R. 2576 would ensure that States maintain their important role as partners in chemical regulation. Under the bill, preemption of State laws would be more limited than current law and other proposals. No State law would be preempted until Federal requirements are in effect. Many State laws would be protected from preemption, including existing State laws, new State laws adopted to address air and water quality or implement other Federal laws, State tort claims, and State laws regulating uses not evaluated by EPA. In response to concerns raised by stakeholders and Members, a few additional important clarifications have been made following committee markup, and I thank the chairman for working with us to make those changes. There is now clear authority for EPA to set a schedule if manufacturer-requested risk evaluations exceed EPA's capacity, ensuring that such requests won't overwhelm the program. The grandfathering provision for existing State laws has also been clarified based on feedback from State attorneys general. Mr. Speaker, strong committee report language further clarifies the limited role of costs in risks management, the preservation of State monitoring and reporting requirements, and the expansion of EPA's testing authority. I know that tomorrow, we will get back to disagreeing on the importance of environmental protection and the essential role EPA plays in keeping America safe, but for today, we can all agree on the need for a strong and protective Federal regulatory program for chemicals. I want to thank Chairman Shimkus and Chairman Upton for their leadership and their willingness to work with Democrats and stakeholders to craft this legislation. I would also like to thank Jackie Cohen of my staff for her hard work on this legislation, as well as Dave McCarthy of the majority staff for his efforts. This is a true testament to what we can achieve when we work together. I look forward to supporting this bill, and I hope all my colleagues will join me in supporting this landmark legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Bucshon), my colleague. Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2576, the TSCA Modernization Act of 2015, which updates the Toxic Substances Control Act, TSCA, of 1976. This legislation will benefit the Eighth District of Indiana and our Nation by improving the regulation of chemicals in commerce. Indiana's Eighth District has a strong and diverse manufacturing sector, including plastics, fertilizer production, automobiles, and medical devices, which play pivotal roles in the local and State economy. H.R. 2576 will improve the EPA's outdated regulatory process for these industries and manufacturers, fostering conditions for stronger interstate commerce, and ensure robust protections for public health and the environment. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko), the ranking member of the subcommittee. Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey and our ranking member on the Energy and Commerce Committee, Representative Pallone, for yielding. Mr. Speaker, 40 years ago, Congress passed the Toxic Substances Control Act, which created a Federal program to manage the risks associated with our Nation's industrial chemicals. That law, TSCA, has never met that need. As a result, the public has lost confidence in this Federal program. The many failings of the current law have been pointed out in reports, reports issued by the Government Accountability Office and others. Well-intentioned attempts over the years to address some of the problems administratively or through voluntary agreements amongst the Environmental Protection Agency, the chemical industry, and the environmental and public health communities have failed. The public has too little information about the safety of chemicals that they are exposed to every day in virtually every product that they use. Even in the face of overwhelming evidence of harm to people's health, EPA is unable to regulate exposure to toxic chemicals. Congress had to step in and explicitly legislate to gain public health and environmental protections from PCBs, for instance, and asbestos. Because of the regulatory vacuum at the Federal level, some States have legislated to secure protections for their citizens. In some cases, large retailers have initiated their own chemical policies to respond to what are consumers' concerns. Forty years of ineffective Federal policy is enough. H.R. 2576, the TSCA Modernization Act, amends TSCA and corrects the fundamental flaws that exist in our law. When my colleague Chairman Shimkus began the effort to reform TSCA in the last Congress, I knew the committee could produce a bill. I believed we could. I was not convinced, however, that we could pass a law; but H.R. 2576 is a decisive step, I believe, in that direction. I thank Chairman Shimkus, Chairman Upton, and Ranking Member Pallone for their continued cooperation and dedicated effort on behalf of this legislation. This truly has been a productive partnership, and the result is a good bill, a bill that I am pleased to support. H.R. 2576 is the result of much discussion, much work, and compromise by all parties involved. While no one group gets all that they might have hoped for in this legislation, every stakeholder group gets something that they need. Frankly, we all need a functional, fair, and reliable Federal program of chemical regulation. Industry gains a fair, predictable Federal program for chemical regulation, a program that will inspire public confidence in the safety of their products. In the context of our global economy, that is an important asset for doing business both here and in other countries. The public health and environmental communities gain a Federal program in which EPA evaluates chemicals and, based on those evaluations, will act to regulate chemicals the Agency determines present a risk to health or a risk to the environment. Under current law, in order to regulate a chemical, EPA must demonstrate that the benefits of regulating outweigh the costs. Under H.R. 2576, EPA's evaluation and decision on whether to act will be based solely on risk factors, risk factors alone. Considerations of cost will be addressed when the Agency selects among different regulatory options to reduce chemical exposures. That is a major gain--a major gain--for public health and a major gain for the environment. H.R. 2576 is a good bill. It offers significant improvements over our current law. I know many Members have concerns about states' rights and State preemption provisions in TSCA. I share those concerns. There is State preemption in current law, and there is State preemption in H.R. 2576, but State preemption only [[Page H4558]] occurs when EPA takes final--final--action on a chemical, either finding it safe or regulating its risks. H.R. 2576 maintains a strong role for the States. With those changes in TSCA, the States will have a more active and credible partner in this effort at the Federal level. Again, I want to thank Chairman Shimkus, Chairman Upton, and Ranking Member Pallone for their excellent work on this bill. I appreciate the constructive partnership that we formed in working together on this legislation. We worked through many difficult issues and found that common ground. I look forward to continuing to work together as this bill moves on to the Senate. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. PALLONE. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. Mr. TONKO. I thank the gentleman. I urge my colleagues to end the ineffective chemical policy that we have had for four decades and to support H.R. 2576. I, too, would like to thank some individuals who are very pertinent to this discussion and final product. I thank David McCarthy from the subcommittee staff on the majority side and Jerry Couri from the subcommittee staff, Jackie Cohen from our subcommittee staff on the Democratic side, and Chris Sarley of Chairman Shimkus' personal office staff, and Jean Fruci of my personal staff, the legislative director for my Congressional office. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, could I ask how much time is remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey has 9\1/2\ minutes remaining. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green). Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2576, the TSCA Modernization Act. I am a proud cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation that will update the Toxic Substances Control Act, our Nation's primary statute regulating the use and safety of commercial chemicals for the first time since it was enacted in 1976. This legislation will directly address many of current TSCA's biggest flaws, including eliminating the ``least burdensome'' requirement and explicitly clarifying the law's safety standard excludes any consideration of costs. This bill would require EPA to consider the risks to vulnerable subpopulations, like children, pregnant women, workers, and set restrictions if necessary to protect them. The TSCA Modernization Act will go a long way towards ensuring that all American families--especially for families of chemical facility workers and fence line communities in our congressional district in Houston and Harris County, Texas--are protected from potentially harmful chemicals and bring needed regulatory clarity to this important sector of our Nation's economy. I would like to thank both Chairman Shimkus and Ranking Member Tonko of the Subcommittee on the Environment and the Economy and Chairman Upton and Ranking Member Pallone of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and their staffs for the hard work and willingness to work together to make TSCA reform a reality. I would also like to personally thank my legislative director, Sergio Espinosa, who has worked on this for three terms, I think, Mr. Speaker. I want to ask my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to join us and vote in support of this important legislation. {time} 1530 Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps). Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, we all know that our chemical regulatory system is badly broken and that it has been broken for a very long time. When it comes to chemicals, weak statutory authority and limited resources have prevented the EPA from fulfilling its mission of protecting public health and the environment. Current law is so weak that the EPA famously could not even use it to ban the use of asbestos despite overwhelming evidence that asbestos poses serious risks to human health. Even when the EPA can successfully regulate a chemical under the Toxic Substances Control Act, which we know as TSCA--which has happened only five times--they must do so using a flawed cost-benefit analysis that prioritizes profits over health and safety. These are just a few of the many serious flaws of the current system. While the TSCA Modernization Act does not address all of these problems, it does take several important steps forward that will help improve the health and safety of consumers and their families. It finally ensures that health, not cost, is the standard by which the safety of chemicals is evaluated; it maintains critical State chemical safety laws, such as California's landmark Proposition 65; and for the first time, it includes explicit protections for vulnerable populations, such as pregnant mothers, children, and seniors. I want to commend Chairmen Upton and Shimkus, Ranking Members Pallone and Tonko, and the committee staffs for all of their hard work and commitment for making this a truly bipartisan bill. It is far from perfect, but it has improved at every step of the process, and I hope that continues. Should the Senate pass its TSCA reform package, I hope this cooperation continues in conference so we can produce an even stronger bill. Mr. Speaker, for far too long, our chemical laws have prioritized profits over human health and safety. This bill would put an end to this inequity and to many other serious failings of the current system. The TSCA Modernization Act is a good compromise and is a major step forward. That is why I will be voting for it today, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette). Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2576, the TSCA Modernization Act. Since the 111th Congress, a lot of us have been wrestling very seriously with how to reform the EPA's current regime for reviewing and regulating chemicals. Everyone agrees that the statute has been broken for most of the decades that it has been in effect. Devising a new program, though, that would both enable the EPA to take meaningful action on the chemicals that truly need regulation and that will protect the health of our citizens was an uphill battle in deeply partisan times; yet what we have come up with is a true compromise. We have focused on the aspects of current law that really need to be addressed, and we have developed language that will move the ball forward. As all of the other speakers have said, our work is not done after the vote later today. The Senate, in working its own will, has come up with a reform bill that takes a distinctly different approach. We have a lot to reconcile. It is important that legislation makes it to the President's desk that will equip the EPA to protect us from toxic chemicals over the long term. Ultimately, we will be judged by how well the new law works, not only over the next few years, but over the coming decade. I want to add my thanks, Mr. Speaker, to Congressman Frank Pallone, Congressman Shimkus, Congressman Tonko, Congressman Gene Green, all of our staffs, and, in particular, to my legislative director, Eleanor Bastian, who has been working on this bill ever since we really started seriously negotiating. One last thing--and I think it is important--is that Congresswoman Capps mentioned that this bill will not preempt State law and that it will not preempt Proposition 65. This was an important provision, and I want to thank Congressman Shimkus and his staff for working on it with us because it is important that we have these kinds of protections that we need. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. In closing, I will just say thank you again to Mr. Shimkus, in particular, for reaching out to me and to Mr. Tonko on this legislation and for making it bipartisan. [[Page H4559]] I almost feel anticlimactic today because I know how much hard work has gone into getting this bill to the floor. I know we are going to work hard after it passes in the House to get it passed in the Senate and to have a law that goes to the President, so I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. This is a good bill, and I am going to give my thanks to my colleagues, too. We want a good vote today because we want to make sure we have a strong House position as we go into negotiations with the Senate, and I think we are going to have that. I also appreciate the leadership for bringing this up on the suspension calendar, which, I think, shows a lot of support right at the outset. As everyone else has done, I want to take a moment to thank our colleagues. This has been a multiyear, multi-Congress approach. As a former high school teacher in government history, so far, the system is working on this bill, and we are hoping for good things as we move forward with conference and get something to the President's desk. I harken back to Paul Tonko's comment and Frank Pallone's comment that we could pass a bill but that, if we wanted to pass a law, we really needed to open up the process a little bit. That was very helpful to me, and I appreciate that. I also want to thank Chairman Upton, obviously, for his leadership and for his friendship. Diana DeGette, who just spoke, and Gene Green have both been with me, slaving away, over the last couple of years. We have learned a lot about each other, and we have learned a lot about the law, and it is a very difficult law to understand. We also started getting help from Bob Latta, from Ohio, and from Bill Johnson, and I want to thank them for their help. H.R. 2576 has also gained letters of support from a variety of stakeholders, which include--and sometimes this shocks people to know that we have this group of diverse interests--the American Chemistry Council, the American Alliance for Innovation, the American Cleaning Institute, the Consumer Specialty Products Association, the National Association of Chemical Distributors, the National Wildlife Federation, just to name a few. I also want to thank two people who never promoted any particular policy but who were responsible for exceptional quality in the legislation before us--Tim Brown and Kakuti Lin, who are our House legislative counsel. They make sure that the words in the bill do what we intend them to do. That is a part of this process that really goes unrecognized, the people who are legislative counsel. They spend long hours, and we ask them to do heavy lifting on short notice, so we want to make sure that we thank them here today. In a highly technical field such as chemical risk management, that is not an easy task. I thank them for their skill, dedication, and hard work. Finally, I would like to recognize the dedicated staffs on both sides of the aisle who helped us craft this legislation--David McCarthy, who has already been mentioned, along with Jerry Couri on the Energy and Commerce staff. Understanding our chemical regulations has helped Members navigate through the complex nature of TSCA reform from our very first informational hearing in the last Congress. I know, over there, we have got Jackie Cohen, who in the last Congress was a real pain in the rear end to me, but, this year, we have been able to work together, which has been helpful. Jean Fruci also was a calming influence, and we appreciate her steady guidance. They have both provided quality input to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle throughout this process. I appreciate their dedication, oftentimes through nights and weekends, to help us get to where we are today. I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2576 to send a strong signal that the time is now to update this outdated law and to keep the momentum and the bipartisan spirit moving forward until the President signs it into law. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the purpose of engaging Chairman Shimkus in colloquy. First, I would like to thank Mr. Shimkus for working with me during and after markup to make sure that the important role of states in chemical regulation is preserved. In the absence of a strong federal chemical regulatory program, many states have taken action to protect their citizens from toxic chemicals. Strong laws are in place in many states to address chemicals including BPA, flame retardants, and more. Through the Committee process, explicit protections have been added for state laws and state common laws, including important changes taken from the amendment that I offered at markup. My amendment was drafted in response to the letter sent by 12 State Attorneys General, which I would like to introduce now into the Record. Again, I appreciate you working with me to address the points they raised. It is my understanding that nothing in this bill would preempt or otherwise affect existing state laws or private rights of action, unless there is an actual conflict between a federal requirement and a state requirement. Is that correct? Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, Yes it is. H.R. 2576 contains protection for existing state laws and existing citizen enforcement actions. No existing state requirements will be preempted unless they actually conflict with federal requirements. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, as you know, over twenty-five years ago, the people of California enacted a landmark ballot measure known as Proposition 65. Proposition 65 requires persons who expose individuals to certain chemicals that are known to cause cancer or reproductive harm to display a clear and reasonable warning. Proposition 65 enforcement actions by the state and by private parties have played a crucial role in reducing childhood exposure to harmful chemicals. This state law operates somewhat differently from other state laws related to chemicals, so I want to ask specifically about the protection for Proposition 65 in the bill. It is my understanding that nothing in this bill would preempt or otherwise impact enforcement of Proposition 65 or the ability of the State to continue to authorize citizen enforcement of Proposition 65, unless there is an actual conflict. Is that correct? Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, that is correct. We do not intend to interfere with operation of Proposition 65 unless a requirement under that law actually conflicts with a federal requirement under TSCA. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, and just to be clear, the waiver provision in Section 18(b) of current law, which could protect additional state laws, is not changed by this bill? Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, that is correct. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, this is a long time coming. The breakthrough bipartisan bill before us today is the culmination of a multi-year, multi-Congress effort to modernize our decades-old chemical safety laws. The Toxic Substances Control Act, which was signed into law by Michigan's own President Jerry Ford, needs to be updated for the 21st century. And this thoughtful bill improves chemical safety while encouraging continued innovation and economic growth and gives the public greater confidence in the safety of American-made chemicals and the products that contain them. There are six core elements that form the basis of the TSCA Modernization Act. First, this bill helps markets work and provides certainty. Chemicals will get reviewed and will be ruled either safe for intended uses, or in need of a risk management rule. Once a decision is made by EPA, that decision will apply in all the states. Manufacturers won't have to produce 50 different product versions for 50 different states. Second, the bill respects the role of states and individual rights of action. Tort and contract claims are explicitly protected in the pre- emption section. Third, any regulation of a chemical will be guided by common sense. Is the regulation cost effective? If use in an article were restricted, will exposure actually go down? Is there a feasible replacement? Is the transition period fair? Without good answers to these questions regulation will not move forward. Fourth, the bill will build confidence for consumers and the general public that chemicals on the market anywhere in the U.S. are safe, and not just because EPA says so. EPA must evaluate risk against the most stringent science standards we've ever enacted for chemicals. And the science has to be transparent and hold up to objective peer review. Fifth, the bill lets government and industry actually collaborate. Chemical manufacturers are given the choice to ask for and get a chemical evaluated. And EPA must meet strict action deadlines. If the science indicates the chemical is safe, then EPA must say so, and that determination will be the law in all 50 states. Finally, the bill encourages innovation, largely by protecting confidential business information. New technology is not likely to appear if the secret formula can be stolen and [[Page H4560]] copied the minute a new product appears. This bill would prevent that from happening. Each of the elements of the bill are not trade-offs, each provision works to the support the others. It would not accomplish much good for EPA to evaluate all these chemicals if the results were not going to apply in all the states. It does not make sense for the government to be writing safety regulations if the result is no real improvement in safety. And a manufacturer is not likely to cooperate with the government in chemical evaluation if to do so means giving up a trade secret. The TSCA Modernization Act solves each of these concerns, as all these safeguards work together. Mr. Speaker, this is a big day. The TSCA Modernization Act is good for consumers, good for trade, and good for the environment. I especially commend Mr. Shimkus, Mr. Pallone, Mr. Tonko, and Mr. Latta for their dedication and hard work in putting together a bill that can be signed into law. Let's put jobs and the economy first and vote yes. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2576, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",package_114_266.csv,79452,79452,79520,"[congressional record volume 161, number 101 (tuesday, june 23, 2015)] [house] [pages h4551-h4560] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] tsca modernization act of 2015 mr. shimkus. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 2576) to modernize the toxic substances control act, and for other purposes, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 2576 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title; table of contents.

leave mr. shimkus. i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the record on the bill. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from illinois? there was no objection. mr. shimkus. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, the tsca modernization act has been a long time in coming. we actually started work on this bill in the last congress. we held a total of eight hearings and received testimony from a broad range of stakeholders, including the administration; but most importantly, we worked with each other, member to member, across the aisle. the bill before you, mr. speaker, reflects lessons learned over the course of the last 3 years in which we worked on tsca reform. first, the bill is clear and understandable. despite the highly technical nature of chemical regulation, members can pick up this bill, read it from beginning to end, and understand what it does and how it works. second, the bill does not try to be all things for all people. major sections of tsca are not amended at all. for example, we leave the process for new chemical review in tsca section 5 unchanged because it is working pretty well right now, and changes could make it worse. the heart of the bill is our approach to regulating chemicals already on the market. thousands of these chemicals have been in commerce for many years, and they pose no known risks and really don't need to be regulated at all. we leave those alone. but we do allow some existing chemicals to be scientifically evaluated for risk and, if necessary, to have that risk managed through a rule by the epa. chemicals may be chosen for risk evaluation in one of two ways: either epa may select a chemical for risk evaluation based on what epa knows may pose an unreasonable risk, or the manufacturer may designate a chemical for epa to evaluate for risk. now, why would a manufacturer invite epa scrutiny of its product? there are several reasons. first, some interest or even a retailer may be raising concerns about a product, and the manufacturer wants to put those concerns to rest. or one or two states may be thinking about regulating the chemical. the state-by-state approach can spell disaster for someone trying to capture economies of scale in a national market. what better way to put these concerns to rest than to have epa, with the scientific standards that we require, perform an objective risk evaluation? then the epa decision on that chemical will apply in all the states, and consumers and the public can have the confidence that the chemical is safe for its intended uses. another area in the legislation that required careful discussion and negotiation is preemption. of course, we want to make sure national markets are just that and not a patchwork of restrictions varying state to state. at the same time, we did not want to deny anyone a legitimate cause of action under state tort or contract law. so that is what we said: as long as the state law does not conflict with the federal ruling, the state action may continue. mr. speaker, the bill has strict but attainable deadlines for action. if epa initiates a risk evaluation, it must finish in 3 years. if a manufacturer initiates one and includes information epa needs to make a decision, epa should finish that in 2 years. once the risk evaluation is complete, if epa decides a rule is needed to manage the risk, epa must propose the rule within a year. the risk evaluation itself only asks does the chemical present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. that is a science question based on a combination of hazard and actual exposure. if there is an unreasonable risk, the agency's decision on how to manage it is based on many other factors such as cost effectiveness, whether restricting an article will actually reduce exposure, whether replacements are available, and many other concerns. h.r. 2576 permits epa to regulate articles in those areas where regulation of chemical substances and mixtures alone would not be effective to reduce the identified risk, but requires epa to be careful in addressing replacement parts that serve a commercially intended function or the original product or are needed to maintain the functionality of the original product. we think this system sets a new standard for quality regulation. of course, we want to be protected from harm, but we do not want needless, expensive regulations. consumers want safe choices, not no choice at all. mr. speaker, we are on the brink of setting up a commonsense approach to protecting people from unsafe chemical exposure that will become the standard of the world. {time} 1515 we want our constituents to be safe, and we want markets to work. this bill delivers both. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. nearly four decades ago, congress enacted the toxic substances control act to identify and regulate risks from dangerous chemicals. unfortunately, the statute has never worked. improvements to the law are long overdue, and i am happy to be here today with my energy and commerce colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this landmark reform legislation. mr. speaker, what brought us together is the failure of the current statute to keep the american public safe and to provide confidence in the safety of american products. toxic chemicals can be found in the products we use every day and are steadily building up in our bodies and the environment. consumers are worried about chemicals like bpa and triclosan, but they don't know how to avoid them. it seems like every day there is a new study about how chemicals are negatively affecting our health, and something needs to change. the energy and commerce committee has held many hearings over the last 6 years to understand why tsca isn't working. some critical flaws were built into the statute, like the grandfathering of over 60,000 chemicals in 1976 without any safety review. other flaws came to light only through litigation, like the impossible analytical burden of the statute's ``least burdensome'' clause. even though we have recognized these flaws, forward progress has been elusive. when chairman shimkus and chairman upton approached ranking member tonko and myself about working on a streamlined approach to address the essential components of reform, i was hopeful. the result is a bipartisan bill that will remove major obstacles to epa action and give the agency new authority and new resources. it will offer more protection and more implementation than current law. it is a strong compromise, and i urge all of my colleagues to support it. mr. speaker, h.r. 2576 will empower epa to regulate the universe of chemicals that were grandfathered in 1976 by removing the requirement that epa impose the ``least burdensome'' regulatory option and by establishing a [[page h4557]] risk-based standard for risk management, instead of a cost-benefit standard. for the first time, the decision of whether a chemical needs to be regulated will be based purely on the risk it poses. h.r. 2576 will improve epa's access to information about potentially dangerous chemicals by allowing epa to require testing through orders and consent agreements, not just rulemakings, and by authorizing epa to seek data when needed for a risk evaluation without first demonstrating risk. h.r. 2576 will provide expedited action for the worst chemicals, those that are persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic. under this bill, we can expect quick action to get these chemicals out of our environment and out of our bodies. mr. speaker, h.r. 2576 will explicitly and directly protect vulnerable populations like children, workers, the elderly, and hotspot communities. the bill will provide more resources for epa to carry out this important program by removing outdated caps on user fees. it would also ensure that those fees are deposited in a dedicated trust fund for tsca implementation. under the bill, all future confidential business information claims by industry would have to be substantiated, preventing abuse and ensuring greater transparency. h.r. 2576 would ensure that states maintain their important role as partners in chemical regulation. under the bill, preemption of state laws would be more limited than current law and other proposals. no state law would be preempted until federal requirements are in effect. many state laws would be protected from preemption, including existing state laws, new state laws adopted to address air and water quality or implement other federal laws, state tort claims, and state laws regulating uses not evaluated by epa. in response to concerns raised by stakeholders and members, a few additional important clarifications have been made following committee markup, and i thank the chairman for working with us to make those changes. there is now clear authority for epa to set a schedule if manufacturer-requested risk evaluations exceed epa's capacity, ensuring that such requests won't overwhelm the program. the grandfathering provision for existing state laws has also been clarified based on feedback from state attorneys general. mr. speaker, strong committee report language further clarifies the limited role of costs in risks management, the preservation of state monitoring and reporting requirements, and the expansion of epa's testing authority. i know that tomorrow, we will get back to disagreeing on the importance of environmental protection and the essential role epa plays in keeping america safe, but for today, we can all agree on the need for a strong and protective federal regulatory program for chemicals. i want to thank chairman shimkus and chairman upton for their leadership and their willingness to work with democrats and stakeholders to craft this legislation. i would also like to thank jackie cohen of my staff for her hard work on this legislation, as well as dave mccarthy of the majority staff for his efforts. this is a true testament to what we can achieve when we work together. i look forward to supporting this bill, and i hope all my colleagues will join me in supporting this landmark legislation. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. shimkus. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from indiana (mr. bucshon), my colleague. mr. bucshon. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h.r. 2576, the tsca modernization act of 2015, which updates the toxic substances control act, tsca, of 1976. this legislation will benefit the eighth district of indiana and our nation by improving the regulation of chemicals in commerce. indiana's eighth district has a strong and diverse manufacturing sector, including plastics, fertilizer production, automobiles, and medical devices, which play pivotal roles in the local and state economy. h.r. 2576 will improve the epa's outdated regulatory process for these industries and manufacturers, fostering conditions for stronger interstate commerce, and ensure robust protections for public health and the environment. i urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from new york (mr. tonko), the ranking member of the subcommittee. mr. tonko. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman from new jersey and our ranking member on the energy and commerce committee, representative pallone, for yielding. mr. speaker, 40 years ago, congress passed the toxic substances control act, which created a federal program to manage the risks associated with our nation's industrial chemicals. that law, tsca, has never met that need. as a result, the public has lost confidence in this federal program. the many failings of the current law have been pointed out in reports, reports issued by the government accountability office and others. well-intentioned attempts over the years to address some of the problems administratively or through voluntary agreements amongst the environmental protection agency, the chemical industry, and the environmental and public health communities have failed. the public has too little information about the safety of chemicals that they are exposed to every day in virtually every product that they use. even in the face of overwhelming evidence of harm to people's health, epa is unable to regulate exposure to toxic chemicals. congress had to step in and explicitly legislate to gain public health and environmental protections from pcbs, for instance, and asbestos. because of the regulatory vacuum at the federal level, some states have legislated to secure protections for their citizens. in some cases, large retailers have initiated their own chemical policies to respond to what are consumers' concerns. forty years of ineffective federal policy is enough. h.r. 2576, the tsca modernization act, amends tsca and corrects the fundamental flaws that exist in our law. when my colleague chairman shimkus began the effort to reform tsca in the last congress, i knew the committee could produce a bill. i believed we could. i was not convinced, however, that we could pass a law; but h.r. 2576 is a decisive step, i believe, in that direction. i thank chairman shimkus, chairman upton, and ranking member pallone for their continued cooperation and dedicated effort on behalf of this legislation. this truly has been a productive partnership, and the result is a good bill, a bill that i am pleased to support. h.r. 2576 is the result of much discussion, much work, and compromise by all parties involved. while no one group gets all that they might have hoped for in this legislation, every stakeholder group gets something that they need. frankly, we all need a functional, fair, and reliable federal program of chemical regulation. industry gains a fair, predictable federal program for chemical regulation, a program that will inspire public confidence in the safety of their products. in the context of our global economy, that is an important asset for doing business both here and in other countries. the public health and environmental communities gain a federal program in which epa evaluates chemicals and, based on those evaluations, will act to regulate chemicals the agency determines present a risk to health or a risk to the environment. under current law, in order to regulate a chemical, epa must demonstrate that the benefits of regulating outweigh the costs. under h.r. 2576, epa's evaluation and decision on whether to act will be based solely on risk factors, risk factors alone. considerations of cost will be addressed when the agency selects among different regulatory options to reduce chemical exposures. that is a major gain--a major gain--for public health and a major gain for the environment. h.r. 2576 is a good bill. it offers significant improvements over our current law. i know many members have concerns about states' rights and state preemption provisions in tsca. i share those concerns. there is state preemption in current law, and there is state preemption in h.r. 2576, but state preemption only [[page h4558]] occurs when epa takes final--final--action on a chemical, either finding it safe or regulating its risks. h.r. 2576 maintains a strong role for the states. with those changes in tsca, the states will have a more active and credible partner in this effort at the federal level. again, i want to thank chairman shimkus, chairman upton, and ranking member pallone for their excellent work on this bill. i appreciate the constructive partnership that we formed in working together on this legislation. we worked through many difficult issues and found that common ground. i look forward to continuing to work together as this bill moves on to the senate. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. pallone. i yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds. mr. tonko. i thank the gentleman. i urge my colleagues to end the ineffective chemical policy that we have had for four decades and to support h.r. 2576. i, too, would like to thank some individuals who are very pertinent to this discussion and final product. i thank david mccarthy from the subcommittee staff on the majority side and jerry couri from the subcommittee staff, jackie cohen from our subcommittee staff on the democratic side, and chris sarley of chairman shimkus' personal office staff, and jean fruci of my personal staff, the legislative director for my congressional office. mr. shimkus. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, could i ask how much time is remaining? the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from new jersey has 9\1/2\ minutes remaining. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from texas (mr. gene green). mr. gene green of texas. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 2576, the tsca modernization act. i am a proud cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation that will update the toxic substances control act, our nation's primary statute regulating the use and safety of commercial chemicals for the first time since it was enacted in 1976. this legislation will directly address many of current tsca's biggest flaws, including eliminating the ``least burdensome'' requirement and explicitly clarifying the law's safety standard excludes any consideration of costs. this bill would require epa to consider the risks to vulnerable subpopulations, like children, pregnant women, workers, and set restrictions if necessary to protect them. the tsca modernization act will go a long way towards ensuring that all american families--especially for families of chemical facility workers and fence line communities in our congressional district in houston and harris county, texas--are protected from potentially harmful chemicals and bring needed regulatory clarity to this important sector of our nation's economy. i would like to thank both chairman shimkus and ranking member tonko of the subcommittee on the environment and the economy and chairman upton and ranking member pallone of the committee on energy and commerce and their staffs for the hard work and willingness to work together to make tsca reform a reality. i would also like to personally thank my legislative director, sergio espinosa, who has worked on this for three terms, i think, mr. speaker. i want to ask my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to join us and vote in support of this important legislation. {time} 1530 mr. shimkus. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from california (mrs. capps). mrs. capps. mr. speaker, we all know that our chemical regulatory system is badly broken and that it has been broken for a very long time. when it comes to chemicals, weak statutory authority and limited resources have prevented the epa from fulfilling its mission of protecting public health and the environment. current law is so weak that the epa famously could not even use it to ban the use of asbestos despite overwhelming evidence that asbestos poses serious risks to human health. even when the epa can successfully regulate a chemical under the toxic substances control act, which we know as tsca--which has happened only five times--they must do so using a flawed cost-benefit analysis that prioritizes profits over health and safety. these are just a few of the many serious flaws of the current system. while the tsca modernization act does not address all of these problems, it does take several important steps forward that will help improve the health and safety of consumers and their families. it finally ensures that health, not cost, is the standard by which the safety of chemicals is evaluated; it maintains critical state chemical safety laws, such as california's landmark proposition 65; and for the first time, it includes explicit protections for vulnerable populations, such as pregnant mothers, children, and seniors. i want to commend chairmen upton and shimkus, ranking members pallone and tonko, and the committee staffs for all of their hard work and commitment for making this a truly bipartisan bill. it is far from perfect, but it has improved at every step of the process, and i hope that continues. should the senate pass its tsca reform package, i hope this cooperation continues in conference so we can produce an even stronger bill. mr. speaker, for far too long, our chemical laws have prioritized profits over human health and safety. this bill would put an end to this inequity and to many other serious failings of the current system. the tsca modernization act is a good compromise and is a major step forward. that is why i will be voting for it today, and i urge my colleagues to do the same. mr. shimkus. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from colorado (ms. degette). ms. degette. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 2576, the tsca modernization act. since the 111th congress, a lot of us have been wrestling very seriously with how to reform the epa's current regime for reviewing and regulating chemicals. everyone agrees that the statute has been broken for most of the decades that it has been in effect. devising a new program, though, that would both enable the epa to take meaningful action on the chemicals that truly need regulation and that will protect the health of our citizens was an uphill battle in deeply partisan times; yet what we have come up with is a true compromise. we have focused on the aspects of current law that really need to be addressed, and we have developed language that will move the ball forward. as all of the other speakers have said, our work is not done after the vote later today. the senate, in working its own will, has come up with a reform bill that takes a distinctly different approach. we have a lot to reconcile. it is important that legislation makes it to the president's desk that will equip the epa to protect us from toxic chemicals over the long term. ultimately, we will be judged by how well the new law works, not only over the next few years, but over the coming decade. i want to add my thanks, mr. speaker, to congressman frank pallone, congressman shimkus, congressman tonko, congressman gene green, all of our staffs, and, in particular, to my legislative director, eleanor bastian, who has been working on this bill ever since we really started seriously negotiating. one last thing--and i think it is important--is that congresswoman capps mentioned that this bill will not preempt state law and that it will not preempt proposition 65. this was an important provision, and i want to thank congressman shimkus and his staff for working on it with us because it is important that we have these kinds of protections that we need. mr. shimkus. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. in closing, i will just say thank you again to mr. shimkus, in particular, for reaching out to me and to mr. tonko on this legislation and for making it bipartisan. [[page h4559]] i almost feel anticlimactic today because i know how much hard work has gone into getting this bill to the floor. i know we are going to work hard after it passes in the house to get it passed in the senate and to have a law that goes to the president, so i urge all of my colleagues to support the bill. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. shimkus. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. this is a good bill, and i am going to give my thanks to my colleagues, too. we want a good vote today because we want to make sure we have a strong house position as we go into negotiations with the senate, and i think we are going to have that. i also appreciate the leadership for bringing this up on the suspension calendar, which, i think, shows a lot of support right at the outset. as everyone else has done, i want to take a moment to thank our colleagues. this has been a multiyear, multi-congress approach. as a former high school teacher in government history, so far, the system is working on this bill, and we are hoping for good things as we move forward with conference and get something to the president's desk. i harken back to paul tonko's comment and frank pallone's comment that we could pass a bill but that, if we wanted to pass a law, we really needed to open up the process a little bit. that was very helpful to me, and i appreciate that. i also want to thank chairman upton, obviously, for his leadership and for his friendship. diana degette, who just spoke, and gene green have both been with me, slaving away, over the last couple of years. we have learned a lot about each other, and we have learned a lot about the law, and it is a very difficult law to understand. we also started getting help from bob latta, from ohio, and from bill johnson, and i want to thank them for their help. h.r. 2576 has also gained letters of support from a variety of stakeholders, which include--and sometimes this shocks people to know that we have this group of diverse interests--the american chemistry council, the american alliance for innovation, the american cleaning institute, the consumer specialty products association, the national association of chemical distributors, the national wildlife federation, just to name a few. i also want to thank two people who never promoted any particular policy but who were responsible for exceptional quality in the legislation before us--tim brown and kakuti lin, who are our house legislative counsel. they make sure that the words in the bill do what we intend them to do. that is a part of this process that really goes unrecognized, the people who are legislative counsel. they spend long hours, and we ask them to do heavy lifting on short notice, so we want to make sure that we thank them here today. in a highly technical field such as chemical risk management, that is not an easy task. i thank them for their skill, dedication, and hard work. finally, i would like to recognize the dedicated staffs on both sides of the aisle who helped us craft this legislation--david mccarthy, who has already been mentioned, along with jerry couri on the energy and commerce staff. understanding our chemical regulations has helped members navigate through the complex nature of tsca reform from our very first informational hearing in the last congress. i know, over there, we have got jackie cohen, who in the last congress was a real pain in the rear end to me, but, this year, we have been able to work together, which has been helpful. jean fruci also was a calming influence, and we appreciate her steady guidance. they have both provided quality input to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle throughout this process. i appreciate their dedication, oftentimes through nights and weekends, to help us get to where we are today. i urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes'' on h.r. 2576 to send a strong signal that the time is now to update this outdated law and to keep the momentum and the bipartisan spirit moving forward until the president signs it into law. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ms. eshoo. mr. speaker, i rise today for the purpose of engaging chairman shimkus in colloquy. first, i would like to thank mr. shimkus for working with me during and after markup to make sure that the important role of states in chemical regulation is preserved. in the absence of a strong federal chemical regulatory program, many states have taken action to protect their citizens from toxic chemicals. strong laws are in place in many states to address chemicals including bpa, flame retardants, and more. through the committee process, explicit protections have been added for state laws and state common laws, including important changes taken from the amendment that i offered at markup. my amendment was drafted in response to the letter sent by 12 state attorneys general, which i would like to introduce now into the record. again, i appreciate you working with me to address the points they raised. it is my understanding that nothing in this bill would preempt or otherwise affect existing state laws or private rights of action, unless there is an actual conflict between a federal requirement and a state requirement. is that correct? mr. shimkus. mr. speaker, yes it is. h.r. 2576 contains protection for existing state laws and existing citizen enforcement actions. no existing state requirements will be preempted unless they actually conflict with federal requirements. ms. eshoo. mr. speaker, as you know, over twenty-five years ago, the people of california enacted a landmark ballot measure known as proposition 65. proposition 65 requires persons who expose individuals to certain chemicals that are known to cause cancer or reproductive harm to display a clear and reasonable warning. proposition 65 enforcement actions by the state and by private parties have played a crucial role in reducing childhood exposure to harmful chemicals. this state law operates somewhat differently from other state laws related to chemicals, so i want to ask specifically about the protection for proposition 65 in the bill. it is my understanding that nothing in this bill would preempt or otherwise impact enforcement of proposition 65 or the ability of the state to continue to authorize citizen enforcement of proposition 65, unless there is an actual conflict. is that correct? mr. shimkus. mr. speaker, that is correct. we do not intend to interfere with operation of proposition 65 unless a requirement under that law actually conflicts with a federal requirement under tsca. ms. eshoo. mr. speaker, and just to be clear, the waiver provision in section 18(b) of current law, which could protect additional state laws, is not changed by this bill? mr. shimkus. mr. speaker, that is correct. mr. upton. mr. speaker, this is a long time coming. the breakthrough bipartisan bill before us today is the culmination of a multi-year, multi-congress effort to modernize our decades-old chemical safety laws. the toxic substances control act, which was signed into law by michigan's own president jerry ford, needs to be updated for the 21st century. and this thoughtful bill improves chemical safety while encouraging continued innovation and economic growth and gives the public greater confidence in the safety of american-made chemicals and the products that contain them. there are six core elements that form the basis of the tsca modernization act. first, this bill helps markets work and provides certainty. chemicals will get reviewed and will be ruled either safe for intended uses, or in need of a risk management rule. once a decision is made by epa, that decision will apply in all the states. manufacturers won't have to produce 50 different product versions for 50 different states. second, the bill respects the role of states and individual rights of action. tort and contract claims are explicitly protected in the pre- emption section. third, any regulation of a chemical will be guided by common sense. is the regulation cost effective? if use in an article were restricted, will exposure actually go down? is there a feasible replacement? is the transition period fair? without good answers to these questions regulation will not move forward. fourth, the bill will build confidence for consumers and the general public that chemicals on the market anywhere in the u.s. are safe, and not just because epa says so. epa must evaluate risk against the most stringent science standards we've ever enacted for chemicals. and the science has to be transparent and hold up to objective peer review. fifth, the bill lets government and industry actually collaborate. chemical manufacturers are given the choice to ask for and get a chemical evaluated. and epa must meet strict action deadlines. if the science indicates the chemical is safe, then epa must say so, and that determination will be the law in all 50 states. finally, the bill encourages innovation, largely by protecting confidential business information. new technology is not likely to appear if the secret formula can be stolen and [[page h4560]] copied the minute a new product appears. this bill would prevent that from happening. each of the elements of the bill are not trade-offs, each provision works to the support the others. it would not accomplish much good for epa to evaluate all these chemicals if the results were not going to apply in all the states. it does not make sense for the government to be writing safety regulations if the result is no real improvement in safety. and a manufacturer is not likely to cooperate with the government in chemical evaluation if to do so means giving up a trade secret. the tsca modernization act solves each of these concerns, as all these safeguards work together. mr. speaker, this is a big day. the tsca modernization act is good for consumers, good for trade, and good for the environment. i especially commend mr. shimkus, mr. pallone, mr. tonko, and mr. latta for their dedication and hard work in putting together a bill that can be signed into law. let's put jobs and the economy first and vote yes. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from illinois (mr. shimkus) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 2576, as amended. the question was taken. the speaker pro tempore. in the opinion of the chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",79452

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. [[Page H4561]] General Leave Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 893, the Boys Town Centennial Commemorative Coin Act, introduced by the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry), and I seek its immediate passage. Mr. Speaker, on December 12, 2017, Boys Town will celebrate 100 years of saving children and healing families. Boys Town was founded in 1917 by a young Irish priest, Father Edward Flanagan, who believed that every child could be a productive citizen if given love, a home, an education, and a trade. He accepted boys of every race, color, and creed--an amazing thing back in 1917. Boys Town first opened on December 12 of 1917 in a rundown Victorian mansion in downtown Omaha, Nebraska. In 1921, the home later moved to Overlook Farm on the outskirts of Omaha, where it remains located today. A number of years ago, I had the privilege of visiting Boys Town. By the 1930s, hundreds of boys lived at Boys Town, which grew to include dormitories and administrative buildings, and the boys even elected their own government, which included a mayor, a council, and commissioners. News of Father Flanagan's work spread worldwide, and even Hollywood took notice with the very famous 1938 movie ``Boys Town,'' with Spencer Tracy, who won an Academy Award for his portrayal of Father Flanagan. At the request of President Truman, he even traveled the world, visiting orphans and advising government leaders on how to care for displaced children after the war. Although Father Flanagan died in 1948, his work at Boys Town, which Flanagan called ``God's work''--and I think most of us would agree with that--continued. Today, although Boys Town is still headquartered in Nebraska, it continues to expand its care across America. It is one of the largest nonprofit child care agencies in the country, providing treatment for behavioral, emotional, and physical problems for children and their families, helping as many as 2 million people annually. Additionally, the Boys Town National Research Hospital is a global leader in the research of Usher syndrome. Mr. Speaker, I can't think of a better way to commemorate Father Flanagan and Boys Town than by creating this commemorative coin. The spirit of Boys Town truly embodies the best of America. This bill would help recognize and continue to nurture that spirit. I commend the gentleman from Nebraska for his hard work on this issue, and I ask for the immediate passage of the bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC, June 19, 2015. Hon. Jeb Hensarling, Chairman, Committee on Financial Services, Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Hensarling: I am writing with respect to H.R. 893, the Boys Town Centennial Commemorative Coin Act. I wanted to notify you that the Committee on Ways and Means will forgo action on H.R. 893 so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for consideration. This is done with the understanding that the jurisdictional interests of the Committee on Ways and Means over this and similar legislation are in no way diminished or altered. In addition, the Committee reserves the right to seek conferees on H.R. 893 and requests your support when such a request is made. I would appreciate your response confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 893 and ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during consideration of the bill on the House floor. Sincerely, Paul Ryan, Chairman. ____ Committee on Financial Services, House of Representatives, Washington, DC, June 22, 2015. Hon. Paul Ryan, Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Ryan: Thank you for your letter of June 19th regarding H.R. 893, the Boys Town Centennial Commemorative Coin Act. I am most appreciative of your decision to forego action on H.R. 893 so that it may move expeditiously to the House floor. I acknowledge that by forgoing such action the Committee on Ways and Means is not waiving its jurisdictional interest in this or similar legislation. In addition, if a conference is necessary on this legislation, I will support any request that your committee be represented therein. Finally, I shall be pleased to include your letter and this letter in the Congressional Record during floor consideration of this measure. Sincerely, Jeb Hensarling, Chairman. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 893, the Boys Town Centennial Commemorative Coin Act. I was pleased to be an original sponsor in the last Congress and a cosponsor in this one. This bill appropriately recognizes the outstanding work done by Boys Town, a nonprofit organization headquartered in the village of Boys Town, Nebraska, that selflessly promotes the interest of children and their families across this Nation. {time} 1545 Boys Town, which takes its name from Father Flanagan's Boys' Home, impacts the lives of more than 2 million families across America each year through its counseling services, outreach, and education. I am also pleased to report that each year, Boys Town directly touches the lives of thousands of New Yorkers through its community support services and homes for troubled youth. Father Flanagan, the founder of Boys Town, focused on the inherent good in children and built a world class organization that emphasized the rehabilitation of troubled youth, rather than punishment. President Franklin Roosevelt once said that America needs 49 more Father Flanagans. It is this compassionate approach and commitment to love, training, and guidance, regardless of race or religion, that has made Boys Town such a success story and a lifeline for countless children and their families. In commemoration of their centennial anniversary, the bill before us today will require the U.S. Treasury Department to mint and issue $5 gold, $1 silver, and half-dollar clad commemorative coins. Surcharges from the sale of the coins will allow Boys Town to raise needed funds that will be dedicated to making a positive impact on the lives of children and families from underserved communities across America. It is also important to note that the passage of this bill comes at absolutely no cost to the taxpayer. I would urge my colleagues to join me in passing this commonsense bipartisan bill without further delay. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry), the sponsor of this bill. Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, first let me thank Mr. Huizenga and Mrs. Maloney for their very thoughtful reflections on the history and importance of Boys Town. I greatly appreciate the sentiments offered. I am very happy and proud to stand here in support of the centennial commemorative coin. As was mentioned, Boys Town was founded in 1917 by Father Edward Flanagan and has since grown from a small local home for children who found themselves in difficult circumstances in Omaha to one of the largest nonprofit, nonsectarian child and family service organizations in America. Boys Town offers a remarkable model of academic and spiritual engagement. Students learn more than math and grammar, as important as that is. Their teachers and caregivers provide them with solid formation. Graduates are equipped to succeed not only professionally, but are also given the life skills to stay on the right path. Boys Town is so impactful that about 90 percent of the children who come there integrate successfully back into [[Page H4562]] their communities; and historically, many, over time, have joined the military. What is this extraordinary model of intervention? It starts with a family. Each child is placed into a family with a caring, nurturing mother and a protective, giving father, where there are rules and expectations, discipline, and love. The success of Nebraska's Boys Town has recently been duplicated across many, many communities in our country. Their network of 11 national sites and national hotlines touches the lives of more than 2 million Americans each year. On December 2, 2017, Boys Town will celebrate 100 years of saving children and helping to heal families. In honor of this 100-year anniversary, this legislation, again, would authorize the U.S. Mint to produce a series of commemorative coins with a design emblematic of Boys Town's 100-year history. These coins, of course, will be available to the general public for sale and will more than offset the cost of minting by the Treasury. As was mentioned earlier, there will be no cost to the taxpayer. Mr. Speaker, Boys Town is a quiet institution nestled in the heartland, my home. It does great service to America by helping to heal wounds during this socially fractured time. A quick story, Mr. Speaker: last year, I had the privilege of participating as a commencement speaker at Boys Town. After I finished my address, the young people were called forward to receive their diplomas in a ceremony marked with great dignity and formality and even lightheartedness. Even though family and friends and those visiting were told to please hold their applause, the excitement couldn't be contained. As each graduate crossed the stage, shouts of joy and encouragement and clapping continued throughout the whole event. Prior to the graduation, students had gathered for a retreat, giving them the opportunity for reflection and recommitment. During their last time together, the seniors discussed what they had to say. Here are quotes from a few of them. I ran in the wrong crowd, hated my family, kept running away from home, and inflicted self-harm. At Boys Town, I am a member of the Junior ROTC and learned to like myself and my family. I look forward to returning home and being a good example to my younger brother. Another said: I lived on the streets from age 10 to 13 and stole to eat. I ended up in prison, and my cousin got shot in the face. I never played sports, let alone attended school, but at Boys Town, I just finished playing baseball this year and signed on with a college to study business. Another child said this: My mom and dad were both in prison, and I had trouble since kindergarten. In junior high, I was locked up myself for 2 years, and when I got out, my mom died. My dad was still in prison. Since I have lived at Boys Town, I chose to get myself on the right track and graduate and made a promise to myself that I would never do anything that would land me in prison. Boys Town saved my life. Mr. Speaker, fortunately, most children do not experience such trauma in their lives, but some do. These are the kids who bear the scars of fraying social and familial bonds, destructive choices, and legal difficulty. Through no fault of their own, the great problems of our time fall most heavily on our young people. Economic hardship and broken families destroy the sense of safety and possibility that is a necessary antidote to social alienation. Every child needs a nurturing environment of compassionate challenge and genuine promise. Education should cultivate that creativity, as well as dignity, allowing all boys and girls to realize their full potential. Today, we have an opportunity to celebrate the lives of remarkable young men and women and the extraordinary institution that is serving them so well. By authorizing this Boys Town commemorative coin, we are investing in the future of our children in a simple but I think really impactful way. I want to thank the nearly 300 bipartisan Members of this Congress who have signed on as cosponsors of this bill. I think that is an important statement. I would also like to thank Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters as well for their leadership on the committee. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Ashford), whose father and grandfather served on the board of Boys Town. Mr. ASHFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time. I would like to commend my colleague Congressman Fortenberry for his work on this issue and his words, which are right on. I would like to thank as well the chairman for his words, which accurately describe the history of Boys Town. Let me also thank the ranking member for her comments that so accurately reflect what Boys Town means to our community and to the entire country. I grew up around Boys Town. I grew up playing sports at Boys Town. The high school that I went to, Boys Town was in our conference; and we spent many very difficult nights playing basketball against the Boys Town basketball team which, quite frankly, was better than we were on most every occasion. In my years in the legislature that lasted until last year, I had the opportunity to work with a colleague of mine, Senator Bob Krist from Omaha, who spearheaded significant juvenile justice reform in our State. The child welfare system in Nebraska was in deep trouble; and Senator Krist, along with Father Boes, who is the acclaimed and incredibly competent leader at Boys Town, we passed significant juvenile justice legislation that helps families throughout the State of Nebraska, that deals with brain development, that deals with wraparound services, family services, as was so aptly described by my colleague Congressman Fortenberry. Mr. Speaker, we are changing lives in Nebraska; and, as has been mentioned, Boys Town is changing lives throughout the country. Their unique approach to juvenile justice issues, the wraparound family- centered services that deal with not only the parents but the siblings to help bring these young people into a productive life, is what Boys Town has been about for the 100 years that it has been in existence. It is no longer there, but I remember as a child in the 1950s actually seeing the first Boys Town facility in downtown Omaha. When I was growing up, Boys Town was way out of town. It had a farm around it. The farm is still there, but now, it is in the middle of Omaha, as Omaha grows. Though it is in a different place in the world today than it was in 1917 with Father Flanagan, by bringing business leaders in Omaha together and others to create Boys Town, it serves that grand purpose that Father Flanagan envisioned in 1917. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I thank the ranking member for giving me this opportunity to speak. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I thank Mr. Thornberry for his beautiful statement, as well as Mr. Ashford, from the great State of Nebraska. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I, too, want to express my thanks to both Congressman Fortenberry and Congressman Ashford for their dedication and desire to highlight Boys Town and what an amazing thing that has happened out there and really the impact that it has had. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Jenkins of West Virginia). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 893, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [House] [Pages H4560-H4562] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BOYS TOWN CENTENNIAL COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. [[Page H4561]] General Leave Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 893, the Boys Town Centennial Commemorative Coin Act, introduced by the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry), and I seek its immediate passage. Mr. Speaker, on December 12, 2017, Boys Town will celebrate 100 years of saving children and healing families. Boys Town was founded in 1917 by a young Irish priest, Father Edward Flanagan, who believed that every child could be a productive citizen if given love, a home, an education, and a trade. He accepted boys of every race, color, and creed--an amazing thing back in 1917. Boys Town first opened on December 12 of 1917 in a rundown Victorian mansion in downtown Omaha, Nebraska. In 1921, the home later moved to Overlook Farm on the outskirts of Omaha, where it remains located today. A number of years ago, I had the privilege of visiting Boys Town. By the 1930s, hundreds of boys lived at Boys Town, which grew to include dormitories and administrative buildings, and the boys even elected their own government, which included a mayor, a council, and commissioners. News of Father Flanagan's work spread worldwide, and even Hollywood took notice with the very famous 1938 movie ``Boys Town,'' with Spencer Tracy, who won an Academy Award for his portrayal of Father Flanagan. At the request of President Truman, he even traveled the world, visiting orphans and advising government leaders on how to care for displaced children after the war. Although Father Flanagan died in 1948, his work at Boys Town, which Flanagan called ``God's work''--and I think most of us would agree with that--continued. Today, although Boys Town is still headquartered in Nebraska, it continues to expand its care across America. It is one of the largest nonprofit child care agencies in the country, providing treatment for behavioral, emotional, and physical problems for children and their families, helping as many as 2 million people annually. Additionally, the Boys Town National Research Hospital is a global leader in the research of Usher syndrome. Mr. Speaker, I can't think of a better way to commemorate Father Flanagan and Boys Town than by creating this commemorative coin. The spirit of Boys Town truly embodies the best of America. This bill would help recognize and continue to nurture that spirit. I commend the gentleman from Nebraska for his hard work on this issue, and I ask for the immediate passage of the bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC, June 19, 2015. Hon. Jeb Hensarling, Chairman, Committee on Financial Services, Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Hensarling: I am writing with respect to H.R. 893, the Boys Town Centennial Commemorative Coin Act. I wanted to notify you that the Committee on Ways and Means will forgo action on H.R. 893 so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for consideration. This is done with the understanding that the jurisdictional interests of the Committee on Ways and Means over this and similar legislation are in no way diminished or altered. In addition, the Committee reserves the right to seek conferees on H.R. 893 and requests your support when such a request is made. I would appreciate your response confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 893 and ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during consideration of the bill on the House floor. Sincerely, Paul Ryan, Chairman. ____ Committee on Financial Services, House of Representatives, Washington, DC, June 22, 2015. Hon. Paul Ryan, Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Ryan: Thank you for your letter of June 19th regarding H.R. 893, the Boys Town Centennial Commemorative Coin Act. I am most appreciative of your decision to forego action on H.R. 893 so that it may move expeditiously to the House floor. I acknowledge that by forgoing such action the Committee on Ways and Means is not waiving its jurisdictional interest in this or similar legislation. In addition, if a conference is necessary on this legislation, I will support any request that your committee be represented therein. Finally, I shall be pleased to include your letter and this letter in the Congressional Record during floor consideration of this measure. Sincerely, Jeb Hensarling, Chairman. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 893, the Boys Town Centennial Commemorative Coin Act. I was pleased to be an original sponsor in the last Congress and a cosponsor in this one. This bill appropriately recognizes the outstanding work done by Boys Town, a nonprofit organization headquartered in the village of Boys Town, Nebraska, that selflessly promotes the interest of children and their families across this Nation. {time} 1545 Boys Town, which takes its name from Father Flanagan's Boys' Home, impacts the lives of more than 2 million families across America each year through its counseling services, outreach, and education. I am also pleased to report that each year, Boys Town directly touches the lives of thousands of New Yorkers through its community support services and homes for troubled youth. Father Flanagan, the founder of Boys Town, focused on the inherent good in children and built a world class organization that emphasized the rehabilitation of troubled youth, rather than punishment. President Franklin Roosevelt once said that America needs 49 more Father Flanagans. It is this compassionate approach and commitment to love, training, and guidance, regardless of race or religion, that has made Boys Town such a success story and a lifeline for countless children and their families. In commemoration of their centennial anniversary, the bill before us today will require the U.S. Treasury Department to mint and issue $5 gold, $1 silver, and half-dollar clad commemorative coins. Surcharges from the sale of the coins will allow Boys Town to raise needed funds that will be dedicated to making a positive impact on the lives of children and families from underserved communities across America. It is also important to note that the passage of this bill comes at absolutely no cost to the taxpayer. I would urge my colleagues to join me in passing this commonsense bipartisan bill without further delay. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry), the sponsor of this bill. Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, first let me thank Mr. Huizenga and Mrs. Maloney for their very thoughtful reflections on the history and importance of Boys Town. I greatly appreciate the sentiments offered. I am very happy and proud to stand here in support of the centennial commemorative coin. As was mentioned, Boys Town was founded in 1917 by Father Edward Flanagan and has since grown from a small local home for children who found themselves in difficult circumstances in Omaha to one of the largest nonprofit, nonsectarian child and family service organizations in America. Boys Town offers a remarkable model of academic and spiritual engagement. Students learn more than math and grammar, as important as that is. Their teachers and caregivers provide them with solid formation. Graduates are equipped to succeed not only professionally, but are also given the life skills to stay on the right path. Boys Town is so impactful that about 90 percent of the children who come there integrate successfully back into [[Page H4562]] their communities; and historically, many, over time, have joined the military. What is this extraordinary model of intervention? It starts with a family. Each child is placed into a family with a caring, nurturing mother and a protective, giving father, where there are rules and expectations, discipline, and love. The success of Nebraska's Boys Town has recently been duplicated across many, many communities in our country. Their network of 11 national sites and national hotlines touches the lives of more than 2 million Americans each year. On December 2, 2017, Boys Town will celebrate 100 years of saving children and helping to heal families. In honor of this 100-year anniversary, this legislation, again, would authorize the U.S. Mint to produce a series of commemorative coins with a design emblematic of Boys Town's 100-year history. These coins, of course, will be available to the general public for sale and will more than offset the cost of minting by the Treasury. As was mentioned earlier, there will be no cost to the taxpayer. Mr. Speaker, Boys Town is a quiet institution nestled in the heartland, my home. It does great service to America by helping to heal wounds during this socially fractured time. A quick story, Mr. Speaker: last year, I had the privilege of participating as a commencement speaker at Boys Town. After I finished my address, the young people were called forward to receive their diplomas in a ceremony marked with great dignity and formality and even lightheartedness. Even though family and friends and those visiting were told to please hold their applause, the excitement couldn't be contained. As each graduate crossed the stage, shouts of joy and encouragement and clapping continued throughout the whole event. Prior to the graduation, students had gathered for a retreat, giving them the opportunity for reflection and recommitment. During their last time together, the seniors discussed what they had to say. Here are quotes from a few of them. I ran in the wrong crowd, hated my family, kept running away from home, and inflicted self-harm. At Boys Town, I am a member of the Junior ROTC and learned to like myself and my family. I look forward to returning home and being a good example to my younger brother. Another said: I lived on the streets from age 10 to 13 and stole to eat. I ended up in prison, and my cousin got shot in the face. I never played sports, let alone attended school, but at Boys Town, I just finished playing baseball this year and signed on with a college to study business. Another child said this: My mom and dad were both in prison, and I had trouble since kindergarten. In junior high, I was locked up myself for 2 years, and when I got out, my mom died. My dad was still in prison. Since I have lived at Boys Town, I chose to get myself on the right track and graduate and made a promise to myself that I would never do anything that would land me in prison. Boys Town saved my life. Mr. Speaker, fortunately, most children do not experience such trauma in their lives, but some do. These are the kids who bear the scars of fraying social and familial bonds, destructive choices, and legal difficulty. Through no fault of their own, the great problems of our time fall most heavily on our young people. Economic hardship and broken families destroy the sense of safety and possibility that is a necessary antidote to social alienation. Every child needs a nurturing environment of compassionate challenge and genuine promise. Education should cultivate that creativity, as well as dignity, allowing all boys and girls to realize their full potential. Today, we have an opportunity to celebrate the lives of remarkable young men and women and the extraordinary institution that is serving them so well. By authorizing this Boys Town commemorative coin, we are investing in the future of our children in a simple but I think really impactful way. I want to thank the nearly 300 bipartisan Members of this Congress who have signed on as cosponsors of this bill. I think that is an important statement. I would also like to thank Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters as well for their leadership on the committee. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Ashford), whose father and grandfather served on the board of Boys Town. Mr. ASHFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time. I would like to commend my colleague Congressman Fortenberry for his work on this issue and his words, which are right on. I would like to thank as well the chairman for his words, which accurately describe the history of Boys Town. Let me also thank the ranking member for her comments that so accurately reflect what Boys Town means to our community and to the entire country. I grew up around Boys Town. I grew up playing sports at Boys Town. The high school that I went to, Boys Town was in our conference; and we spent many very difficult nights playing basketball against the Boys Town basketball team which, quite frankly, was better than we were on most every occasion. In my years in the legislature that lasted until last year, I had the opportunity to work with a colleague of mine, Senator Bob Krist from Omaha, who spearheaded significant juvenile justice reform in our State. The child welfare system in Nebraska was in deep trouble; and Senator Krist, along with Father Boes, who is the acclaimed and incredibly competent leader at Boys Town, we passed significant juvenile justice legislation that helps families throughout the State of Nebraska, that deals with brain development, that deals with wraparound services, family services, as was so aptly described by my colleague Congressman Fortenberry. Mr. Speaker, we are changing lives in Nebraska; and, as has been mentioned, Boys Town is changing lives throughout the country. Their unique approach to juvenile justice issues, the wraparound family- centered services that deal with not only the parents but the siblings to help bring these young people into a productive life, is what Boys Town has been about for the 100 years that it has been in existence. It is no longer there, but I remember as a child in the 1950s actually seeing the first Boys Town facility in downtown Omaha. When I was growing up, Boys Town was way out of town. It had a farm around it. The farm is still there, but now, it is in the middle of Omaha, as Omaha grows. Though it is in a different place in the world today than it was in 1917 with Father Flanagan, by bringing business leaders in Omaha together and others to create Boys Town, it serves that grand purpose that Father Flanagan envisioned in 1917. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I thank the ranking member for giving me this opportunity to speak. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I thank Mr. Thornberry for his beautiful statement, as well as Mr. Ashford, from the great State of Nebraska. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I, too, want to express my thanks to both Congressman Fortenberry and Congressman Ashford for their dedication and desire to highlight Boys Town and what an amazing thing that has happened out there and really the impact that it has had. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Jenkins of West Virginia). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 893, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [House] [Pages H4560-H4562] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BOYS TOWN CENTENNIAL COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan.

I never played sports, let alone attended school, but at Boys Town, I just finished playing baseball this year and signed on with a college to study business. Another child said this: My mom and dad were both in prison, and I had trouble since kindergarten. In junior high, I was locked up myself for 2 years, and when I got out, my mom died. My dad was still in prison. Since I have lived at Boys Town, I chose to get myself on the right track and graduate and made a promise to myself that I would never do anything that would land me in prison. Boys Town saved my life. Mr. Speaker, fortunately, most children do not experience such trauma in their lives, but some do. These are the kids who bear the scars of fraying social and familial bonds, destructive choices, and legal difficulty. Through no fault of their own, the great problems of our time fall most heavily on our young people. Economic hardship and broken families destroy the sense of safety and possibility that is a necessary antidote to social alienation. Every child needs a nurturing environment of compassionate challenge and genuine promise. Education should cultivate that creativity, as well as dignity, allowing all boys and girls to realize their full potential. Today, we have an opportunity to celebrate the lives of remarkable young men and women and the extraordinary institution that is serving them so well. By authorizing this Boys Town commemorative coin, we are investing in the future of our children in a simple but I think really impactful way. I want to thank the nearly 300 bipartisan Members of this Congress who have signed on as cosponsors of this bill. I think that is an important statement. I would also like to thank Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters as well for their leadership on the committee. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Ashford), whose father and grandfather served on the board of Boys Town. Mr. ASHFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time. I would like to commend my colleague Congressman Fortenberry for his work on this issue and his words, which are right on. I would like to thank as well the chairman for his words, which accurately describe the history of Boys Town. Let me also thank the ranking member for her comments that so accurately reflect what Boys Town means to our community and to the entire country. I grew up around Boys Town. I grew up playing sports at Boys Town. The high school that I went to, Boys Town was in our conference; and we spent many very difficult nights playing basketball against the Boys Town basketball team which, quite frankly, was better than we were on most every occasion. In my years in the legislature that lasted until last year, I had the opportunity to work with a colleague of mine, Senator Bob Krist from Omaha, who spearheaded significant juvenile justice reform in our State. The child welfare system in Nebraska was in deep trouble; and Senator Krist, along with Father Boes, who is the acclaimed and incredibly competent leader at Boys Town, we passed significant juvenile justice legislation that helps families throughout the State of Nebraska, that deals with brain development, that deals with wraparound services, family services, as was so aptly described by my colleague Congressman Fortenberry. Mr. Speaker, we are changing lives in Nebraska; and, as has been mentioned, Boys Town is changing lives throughout the country. Their unique approach to juvenile justice issues, the wraparound family- centered services that deal with not only the parents but the siblings to help bring these young people into a productive life, is what Boys Town has been about for the 100 years that it has been in existence. It is no longer there, but I remember as a child in the 1950s actually seeing the first Boys Town facility in downtown Omaha. When I was growing up, Boys Town was way out of town. It had a farm around it. The farm is still there, but now, it is in the middle of Omaha, as Omaha grows. Though it is in a different place in the world today than it was in 1917 with Father Flanagan, by bringing business leaders in Omaha together and others to create Boys Town, it serves that grand purpose that Father Flanagan envisioned in 1917. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I thank the ranking member for giving me this opportunity to speak. Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I thank Mr. Thornberry for his beautiful statement, as well as Mr. Ashford, from the great State of Nebraska. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I, too, want to express my thanks to both Congressman Fortenberry and Congressman Ashford for their dedication and desire to highlight Boys Town and what an amazing thing that has happened out there and really the impact that it has had. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Jenkins of West Virginia). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 893, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_266.csv,23642,23642,23710,"[congressional record volume 161, number 101 (tuesday, june 23, 2015)] [house] [pages h4560-h4562] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] boys town centennial commemorative coin act mr. huizenga of michigan. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 893) to require the secretary of the treasury to mint coins in commemoration of the centennial of boys town, and for other purposes, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 893 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``boys town centennial commemorative coin act''. sec. 2. findings. congress finds that-- (1) boys town is a nonprofit organization dedicated to saving children and healing families, nationally headquartered in the village of boys town, nebraska; (2) father flanagan's boys home, known as ``boys town'', was founded on december 12, 1917, by servant of god father edward flanagan; (3) boys town was created to serve children of all races and religions; (4) news of the work of father flanagan spread worldwide with the success of the 1938 movie, ``boys town''; (5) after world war ii, president truman asked father flanagan to take his message to the world, and father flanagan traveled the globe visiting war orphans and advising government leaders on how to care for displaced children; (6) boys town has grown exponentially, and now provides care to children and families across the country in 11 regions, including california, nevada, texas, nebraska, iowa, louisiana, north florida, central florida, south florida, washington, dc, new york, and new england; (7) the boys town national hotline provides counseling to more than 150,000 callers each year; (8) the boys town national research hospital is a national leader in the field of hearing care and research of usher syndrome; (9) boys town programs impact the lives of more than 2,000,000 children and families across america each year; and (10) december 12th, 2017, will mark the 100th anniversary of boys town, nebraska. sec. 3. coin specifications.

[[page h4561]] general leave mr. huizenga of michigan. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this bill. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from michigan? there was no objection. mr. huizenga of michigan. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise today in support of h.r. 893, the boys town centennial commemorative coin act, introduced by the gentleman from nebraska (mr. fortenberry), and i seek its immediate passage. mr. speaker, on december 12, 2017, boys town will celebrate 100 years of saving children and healing families. boys town was founded in 1917 by a young irish priest, father edward flanagan, who believed that every child could be a productive citizen if given love, a home, an education, and a trade. he accepted boys of every race, color, and creed--an amazing thing back in 1917. boys town first opened on december 12 of 1917 in a rundown victorian mansion in downtown omaha, nebraska. in 1921, the home later moved to overlook farm on the outskirts of omaha, where it remains located today. a number of years ago, i had the privilege of visiting boys town. by the 1930s, hundreds of boys lived at boys town, which grew to include dormitories and administrative buildings, and the boys even elected their own government, which included a mayor, a council, and commissioners. news of father flanagan's work spread worldwide, and even hollywood took notice with the very famous 1938 movie ``boys town,'' with spencer tracy, who won an academy award for his portrayal of father flanagan. at the request of president truman, he even traveled the world, visiting orphans and advising government leaders on how to care for displaced children after the war. although father flanagan died in 1948, his work at boys town, which flanagan called ``god's work''--and i think most of us would agree with that--continued. today, although boys town is still headquartered in nebraska, it continues to expand its care across america. it is one of the largest nonprofit child care agencies in the country, providing treatment for behavioral, emotional, and physical problems for children and their families, helping as many as 2 million people annually. additionally, the boys town national research hospital is a global leader in the research of usher syndrome. mr. speaker, i can't think of a better way to commemorate father flanagan and boys town than by creating this commemorative coin. the spirit of boys town truly embodies the best of america. this bill would help recognize and continue to nurture that spirit. i commend the gentleman from nebraska for his hard work on this issue, and i ask for the immediate passage of the bill. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. committee on ways and means, house of representatives, washington, dc, june 19, 2015. hon. jeb hensarling, chairman, committee on financial services, rayburn house office building, washington, dc. dear chairman hensarling: i am writing with respect to h.r. 893, the boys town centennial commemorative coin act. i wanted to notify you that the committee on ways and means will forgo action on h.r. 893 so that it may proceed expeditiously to the house floor for consideration. this is done with the understanding that the jurisdictional interests of the committee on ways and means over this and similar legislation are in no way diminished or altered. in addition, the committee reserves the right to seek conferees on h.r. 893 and requests your support when such a request is made. i would appreciate your response confirming this understanding with respect to h.r. 893 and ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the congressional record during consideration of the bill on the house floor. sincerely, paul ryan, chairman. ____ committee on financial services, house of representatives, washington, dc, june 22, 2015. hon. paul ryan, chairman, committee on ways and means, longworth house office building, washington, dc. dear chairman ryan: thank you for your letter of june 19th regarding h.r. 893, the boys town centennial commemorative coin act. i am most appreciative of your decision to forego action on h.r. 893 so that it may move expeditiously to the house floor. i acknowledge that by forgoing such action the committee on ways and means is not waiving its jurisdictional interest in this or similar legislation. in addition, if a conference is necessary on this legislation, i will support any request that your committee be represented therein. finally, i shall be pleased to include your letter and this letter in the congressional record during floor consideration of this measure. sincerely, jeb hensarling, chairman. mrs. carolyn b. maloney of new york. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in support of h.r. 893, the boys town centennial commemorative coin act. i was pleased to be an original sponsor in the last congress and a cosponsor in this one. this bill appropriately recognizes the outstanding work done by boys town, a nonprofit organization headquartered in the village of boys town, nebraska, that selflessly promotes the interest of children and their families across this nation. {time} 1545 boys town, which takes its name from father flanagan's boys' home, impacts the lives of more than 2 million families across america each year through its counseling services, outreach, and education. i am also pleased to report that each year, boys town directly touches the lives of thousands of new yorkers through its community support services and homes for troubled youth. father flanagan, the founder of boys town, focused on the inherent good in children and built a world class organization that emphasized the rehabilitation of troubled youth, rather than punishment. president franklin roosevelt once said that america needs 49 more father flanagans. it is this compassionate approach and commitment to love, training, and guidance, regardless of race or religion, that has made boys town such a success story and a lifeline for countless children and their families. in commemoration of their centennial anniversary, the bill before us today will require the u.s. treasury department to mint and issue $5 gold, $1 silver, and half-dollar clad commemorative coins. surcharges from the sale of the coins will allow boys town to raise needed funds that will be dedicated to making a positive impact on the lives of children and families from underserved communities across america. it is also important to note that the passage of this bill comes at absolutely no cost to the taxpayer. i would urge my colleagues to join me in passing this commonsense bipartisan bill without further delay. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. huizenga of michigan. mr. speaker, i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from nebraska (mr. fortenberry), the sponsor of this bill. mr. fortenberry. mr. speaker, first let me thank mr. huizenga and mrs. maloney for their very thoughtful reflections on the history and importance of boys town. i greatly appreciate the sentiments offered. i am very happy and proud to stand here in support of the centennial commemorative coin. as was mentioned, boys town was founded in 1917 by father edward flanagan and has since grown from a small local home for children who found themselves in difficult circumstances in omaha to one of the largest nonprofit, nonsectarian child and family service organizations in america. boys town offers a remarkable model of academic and spiritual engagement. students learn more than math and grammar, as important as that is. their teachers and caregivers provide them with solid formation. graduates are equipped to succeed not only professionally, but are also given the life skills to stay on the right path. boys town is so impactful that about 90 percent of the children who come there integrate successfully back into [[page h4562]] their communities; and historically, many, over time, have joined the military. what is this extraordinary model of intervention? it starts with a family. each child is placed into a family with a caring, nurturing mother and a protective, giving father, where there are rules and expectations, discipline, and love. the success of nebraska's boys town has recently been duplicated across many, many communities in our country. their network of 11 national sites and national hotlines touches the lives of more than 2 million americans each year. on december 2, 2017, boys town will celebrate 100 years of saving children and helping to heal families. in honor of this 100-year anniversary, this legislation, again, would authorize the u.s. mint to produce a series of commemorative coins with a design emblematic of boys town's 100-year history. these coins, of course, will be available to the general public for sale and will more than offset the cost of minting by the treasury. as was mentioned earlier, there will be no cost to the taxpayer. mr. speaker, boys town is a quiet institution nestled in the heartland, my home. it does great service to america by helping to heal wounds during this socially fractured time. a quick story, mr. speaker: last year, i had the privilege of participating as a commencement speaker at boys town. after i finished my address, the young people were called forward to receive their diplomas in a ceremony marked with great dignity and formality and even lightheartedness. even though family and friends and those visiting were told to please hold their applause, the excitement couldn't be contained. as each graduate crossed the stage, shouts of joy and encouragement and clapping continued throughout the whole event. prior to the graduation, students had gathered for a retreat, giving them the opportunity for reflection and recommitment. during their last time together, the seniors discussed what they had to say. here are quotes from a few of them. i ran in the wrong crowd, hated my family, kept running away from home, and inflicted self-harm. at boys town, i am a member of the junior rotc and learned to like myself and my family. i look forward to returning home and being a good example to my younger brother. another said: i lived on the streets from age 10 to 13 and stole to eat. i ended up in prison, and my cousin got shot in the face. i never played sports, let alone attended school, but at boys town, i just finished playing baseball this year and signed on with a college to study business. another child said this: my mom and dad were both in prison, and i had trouble since kindergarten. in junior high, i was locked up myself for 2 years, and when i got out, my mom died. my dad was still in prison. since i have lived at boys town, i chose to get myself on the right track and graduate and made a promise to myself that i would never do anything that would land me in prison. boys town saved my life. mr. speaker, fortunately, most children do not experience such trauma in their lives, but some do. these are the kids who bear the scars of fraying social and familial bonds, destructive choices, and legal difficulty. through no fault of their own, the great problems of our time fall most heavily on our young people. economic hardship and broken families destroy the sense of safety and possibility that is a necessary

boys town. mr. ashford. mr. speaker, i thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time. i would like to commend my colleague congressman fortenberry for his work on this issue and his words, which are

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules [[Page H4563]] and pass the bill (H.R. 1698) to amend design and content requirements for certain gold and silver coins, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 1698 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Bullion and Collectible Coin Production Efficiency and Cost Savings Act''. SEC. 2. TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS. Title 31, United States Code, is amended-- (1) in section 5112-- (A) in subsection (q)-- (i) by striking paragraphs (3) and (8); and (ii) by redesignating paragraphs (4), (5), (6), and (7) as paragraphs (3), (4), (5), and (6), respectively; (B) in subsection (t)(6)(B), by striking ``90 percent silver and 10 percent copper'' and inserting ``not less than 90 percent silver''; and (C) in subsection (v)-- (i) in paragraph (1), by striking ``Subject to'' and all that follows through ``the Secretary shall'' and inserting ``The Secretary shall''; (ii) in paragraph (2)(A), by striking ``The Secretary'' and inserting ``To the greatest extent possible, the Secretary''; (iii) in paragraph (5), by inserting after ``may issue'' the following: ``collectible versions of''; and (iv) by striking paragraph (8); and (2) in section 5132(a)(2)(B)(i), by striking ``90 percent silver and 10 percent copper'' and inserting ``not less than 90 percent silver''.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. General Leave Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1698, the Bullion and Collectible Coin Production Efficiency and Cost Savings Act, a bipartisan bill which I introduced in March, along with the gentlewoman from New York, Representative Maloney. This simple piece of legislation would make minor changes to four existing coin programs. Each change saves money for the United States Mint, and it makes it easier to produce the coins or make the coins more attractive to investors and collectors. The changes include: first, making it less expensive to package gold investment coins; second, it allows the Mint to buy standard coinage silver for collectible coins instead of the more expensive custom alloy; third, it removes the requirement for an already completed study on the production of an investor coin made of palladium; and, fourth, it allows collector versions of the widely popular American eagle silver investment coin to bear an inscription noting that next year is the 30th anniversary of the first issuance of those coins. These small changes will have an impact on saving taxpayer dollars over the next few years. Mr. Speaker, I ask for immediate passage of H.R. 1698. I reserve the balance of my time. {time} 1600 Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this cost-saving legislation, which I was proud to cosponsor with my friend from Michigan. People who see the big things that Congress does, they often forget that we have to pay attention to the little things, too, and these little things are important. This is a very good example of that. This is a small bill which makes the government better, saves some taxpayers' money, and makes our coin programs better for collectors and for investors. For years, the laws that specify the production of silver coins made by the Mint have required them to be 90 percent silver. Today, the standard silver used in coins is 91 percent silver.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2620) to amend the United States Cotton Futures Act to exclude certain cotton futures contracts from coverage under such Act, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 2620 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. EXCLUDING CERTAIN COTTON FUTURES CONTRACTS FROM COVERAGE UNDER UNITED STATES COTTON FUTURES ACT. (a) In General.--Subsection (c)(1) of the United States Cotton Futures Act (7 U.S.C. 15B(c)(1)) is amended-- (1) by striking ``except that any cotton futures contract'' and inserting the following: ``except that-- ``(A) any cotton futures contract''; (2) in subparagraph (A) (as designated by paragraph (1)), by striking the period at the end and inserting ``; and''; and (3) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph: ``(B) any cotton futures contract that permits tender of cotton grown outside of the United States is excluded from the coverage of this paragraph and section to the extent that the cotton grown outside of the United States is tendered for delivery under the cotton futures contract.''. (b) Application.--The amendments made by subsection (a) shall apply with respect to cotton futures contracts entered into on or after the date of the enactment of this Act. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott) and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. David Scott) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott). General Leave Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H.R. 2620. This bill would amend the United States Cotton Futures Act to allow for the creation of a world cotton contract listed on the United States exchange. [[Page H4564]] Current law, which requires sampling and classing by the USDA of every bale of cotton tendered under contracts listed on a U.S. exchange reflects an antiquated picture of the global cotton market. Some market participants need to hedge price fluctuations in foreign markets, and the current law limits their ability to do so. We need to update our law to reflect the modern nature of this marketplace. H.R. 2620 accomplishes this by providing an option for cotton produced and delivered in foreign markets to be classed by rating facilities closer to the point of delivery rather than by the United States Department of Agriculture. It makes no changes to the treatment of domestically produced and delivered cotton. This legislation will allow any willing exchange to meet industry demand to design a world cotton contract. For example, ICE Futures U.S., which has already worked with market participants, has publicly announced their intention and preference to list a world cotton contract side by side with the domestically focused Cotton No. 2 contract they already list. H.R. 2620 allows for an important new contract for cotton hedging to be developed, which would be beneficial to commercial hedgers. However, it is important specifically to me and to others to note, it would not disrupt the industry's benchmark hedging contract, the No. 2 contract, which is relied upon by U.S. cotton producers in my district and around the country. Before I close, I would like to thank Chairman Conaway both for his continued leadership on the Agriculture Committee and his efforts on this legislation. Additionally, I want to thank Ranking Member David Scott for working with me on this issue over the last few months. And I would like to acknowledge Lynn Westmoreland's work in this as well. He was instrumental in advancing this issue. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 2620. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I, too, have enjoyed working with my colleague from Georgia, the chairman of our Subcommittee on Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit, Congressman Austin Scott. Mr. Speaker, our bill, H.R. 2620, will modernize the way in which cotton futures contracts are listed and regulated under the 1916 Cotton Futures Act. More specifically, as many of you know, the main tool used in the marketplace for hedging cotton is the No. 2 contract. Currently, the No. 2 contract only permits cotton grown within the United States. That cotton is delivered to only five United States cities: Galveston, Texas; Houston, Texas; Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas; Greenville, South Carolina; and Memphis, Tennessee. Now, under the 1916 Cotton Futures Act, every bale of cotton tendered under a contract listed on a U.S. exchange must be sampled and classed or graded by the United States Department of Agriculture. However, seeing that cotton is grown all over the world, my bill targets cotton that is grown and delivered outside of the United States' borders. Now, Mr. Speaker, here is the problem, the concern that our bill is solving. As I mentioned earlier, because of the fact that there are only five domestic cities that are cotton delivery points listed under the 1916 Cotton Futures Act, there has been much concern that the Cotton No. 2 contract cannot accurately reflect price movement in foreign markets and, therefore, cannot provide an effective risk management tool. That is simply the problem. Now, to solve this problem, what our bill will do is simply allow U.S.-based future exchanges flexibility in how they handle foreign- grown cotton and foreign delivery points that will never touch the United States at all. Mr. Speaker, we live now and we operate in a rapidly changing global economy. It is very important that we not put our cotton producers or our commodities exchanges into a disadvantaged position competitively when it comes to being able to get the price fluctuations that occur in foreign markets, thereby providing our businesses with the most effective tool by which they can manage their risk. So because the United States Department of Agriculture does not have the manpower to deploy personnel all over the world at one time, our bill will allow cotton grown outside the United States to be classed by either a United States Department of Agriculture testing lab inside the United States or an international lab deemed to have comparable comprehensive rules and regulations equivalent to the United States. That is it. It is clean and simple. Our bill solves this problem. It gives our cotton producers and it gives our exchanges that ability to be able to know how prices are sliding in each foreign country that is producing cotton while, at the same time, our producers and our exchanges, without that, cannot apply good risk management. That is why this is so essential. So let me state again, as my colleague from Georgia, Mr. Austin Scott, made clear, I, too, want to make clear that our bill does not change the fact that 100 percent of all domestically produced and delivered cotton will be classed by the United States Department of Agriculture. There is absolutely no change here. Furthermore, the bill does not change or alter the Cotton No. 2 contract. What our bill does is simply allow our U.S.-based futures exchanges that much-needed flexibility that is needed in order to list cotton that will never touch the United States through a world cotton contract. As I said, we live in a global marketplace. It is important that our rules and regulations reflect the modernization that has happened in our global markets since this act was written 100 years ago. It is important, Mr. Speaker, that we keep the United States economy the strongest economy in the world, and our bill, H.R. 2620, will do just. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 2620. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, as my colleague, Mr. Scott, and I have said, this is simply a necessary, minor change. I would just ask all Members to support passage of H.R. 2620. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2620, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [House] [Pages H4563-H4564] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] UNITED STATES COTTON FUTURES ACT AMENDMENTS Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia.

That is simply the problem. Now, to solve this problem, what our bill will do is simply allow U.S.-based future exchanges flexibility in how they handle foreign- grown cotton and foreign delivery points that will never touch the United States at all. Mr. Speaker, we live now and we operate in a rapidly changing global economy. It is very important that we not put our cotton producers or our commodities exchanges into a disadvantaged position competitively when it comes to being able to get the price fluctuations that occur in foreign markets, thereby providing our businesses with the most effective tool by which they can manage their risk. So because the United States Department of Agriculture does not have the manpower to deploy personnel all over the world at one time, our bill will allow cotton grown outside the United States to be classed by either a United States Department of Agriculture testing lab inside the United States or an international lab deemed to have comparable comprehensive rules and regulations equivalent to the United States. That is it. It is clean and simple. Our bill solves this problem. It gives our cotton producers and it gives our exchanges that ability to be able to know how prices are sliding in each foreign country that is producing cotton while, at the same time, our producers and our exchanges, without that, cannot apply good risk management. That is why this is so essential. So let me state again, as my colleague from Georgia, Mr. Austin Scott, made clear, I, too, want to make clear that our bill does not change the fact that 100 percent of all domestically produced and delivered cotton will be classed by the United States Department of Agriculture. There is absolutely no change here. Furthermore, the bill does not change or alter the Cotton No. 2 contract. What our bill does is simply allow our U.S.-based futures exchanges that much-needed flexibility that is needed in order to list cotton that will never touch the United States through a world cotton contract. As I said, we live in a global marketplace. It is important that our rules and regulations reflect the modernization that has happened in our global markets since this act was written 100 years ago. It is important, Mr. Speaker, that we keep the United States economy the strongest economy in the world, and our bill, H.R. 2620, will do just. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 2620. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, as my colleague, Mr. Scott, and I have said, this is simply a necessary, minor change. I would just ask all Members to support passage of H.R. 2620. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2620, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [House] [Pages H4563-H4564] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] UNITED STATES COTTON FUTURES ACT AMENDMENTS Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2620) to amend the United States Cotton Futures Act to exclude certain cotton futures contracts from coverage under such Act, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 2620 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. EXCLUDING CERTAIN COTTON FUTURES CONTRACTS FROM COVERAGE UNDER UNITED STATES COTTON FUTURES ACT. (a) In General.--Subsection (c)(1) of the United States Cotton Futures Act (7 U.S.C. 15B(c)(1)) is amended-- (1) by striking ``except that any cotton futures contract'' and inserting the following: ``except that-- ``(A) any cotton futures contract''; (2) in subparagraph (A) (as designated by paragraph (1)), by striking the period at the end and inserting ``; and''; and (3) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph: ``(B) any cotton futures contract that permits tender of cotton grown outside of the United States is excluded from the coverage of this paragraph and section to the extent that the cotton grown outside of the United States is tendered for delivery under the cotton futures contract.''. (b) Application.--The amendments made by subsection (a) shall apply with respect to cotton futures contracts entered into on or after the date of the enactment of this Act. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott) and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. David Scott) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott). General Leave Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H.R. 2620. This bill would amend the United States Cotton Futures Act to allow for the creation of a world cotton contract listed on the United States exchange. [[Page H4564]] Current law, which requires sampling and classing by the USDA of every bale of cotton tendered under contracts listed on a U.S. exchange reflects an antiquated picture of the global cotton market. Some market participants need to hedge price fluctuations in foreign markets, and the current law limits their ability to do so. We need to update our law to reflect the modern nature of this marketplace. H.R. 2620 accomplishes this by providing an option for cotton produced and delivered in foreign markets to be classed by rating facilities closer to the point of delivery rather than by the United States Department of Agriculture. It makes no changes to the treatment of domestically produced and delivered cotton. This legislation will allow any willing exchange to meet industry demand to design a world cotton contract. For example, ICE Futures U.S., which has already worked with market participants, has publicly announced their intention and preference to list a world cotton contract side by side with the domestically focused Cotton No. 2 contract they already list. H.R. 2620 allows for an important new contract for cotton hedging to be developed, which would be beneficial to commercial hedgers. However, it is important specifically to me and to others to note, it would not disrupt the industry's benchmark hedging contract, the No. 2 contract, which is relied upon by U.S. cotton producers in my district and around the country. Before I close, I would like to thank Chairman Conaway both for his continued leadership on the Agriculture Committee and his efforts on this legislation. Additionally, I want to thank Ranking Member David Scott for working with me on this issue over the last few months. And I would like to acknowledge Lynn Westmoreland's work in this as well. He was instrumental in advancing this issue. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 2620. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I, too, have enjoyed working with my colleague from Georgia, the chairman of our Subcommittee on Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit, Congressman Austin Scott. Mr. Speaker, our bill, H.R. 2620, will modernize the way in which cotton futures contracts are listed and regulated under the 1916 Cotton Futures Act. More specifically, as many of you know, the main tool used in the marketplace for hedging cotton is the No. 2 contract. Currently, the No. 2 contract only permits cotton grown within the United States. That cotton is delivered to only five United States cities: Galveston, Texas; Houston, Texas; Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas; Greenville, South Carolina; and Memphis, Tennessee. Now, under the 1916 Cotton Futures Act, every bale of cotton tendered under a contract listed on a U.S. exchange must be sampled and classed or graded by the United States Department of Agriculture. However, seeing that cotton is grown all over the world, my bill targets cotton that is grown and delivered outside of the United States' borders. Now, Mr. Speaker, here is the problem, the concern that our bill is solving. As I mentioned earlier, because of the fact that there are only five domestic cities that are cotton delivery points listed under the 1916 Cotton Futures Act, there has been much concern that the Cotton No. 2 contract cannot accurately reflect price movement in foreign markets and, therefore, cannot provide an effective risk management tool.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1640. Mr. Speaker, since 2006, the Department of Homeland Security and the General Services Administration have been working towards completing a consolidated headquarters on the historic St. Elizabeths campus in Washington, D.C. However, as with many other Federal projects, the consolidation has run up against cost overruns and construction delays, at times estimated to be more than $1 billion over budget and 12 years behind schedule. Earlier this year, I visited the site personally to see firsthand the progress being made and the immense challenges that lie ahead. I remain concerned that taxpayers' dollars will be put at risk without better management. This bill, H.R. 1640, the DHS Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act of 2015, would require the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Administrator of General Services, to investigate and submit a report on the estimated costs and property needs of the project. While we were encouraged by the updated DHS St. Elizabeths plans published earlier this year, we still believe that increased oversight of the consolidation project will help ensure accountability and the efficient use of our constituents' taxpayer dollars. Mr. Speaker, accountability is a fundamental aspect of citizen-ruled government and something that our constituents expect their representatives to uphold. H.R. 1640 does just this, and I look forward to the bipartisan support this legislation will receive. I reserve the balance of my time. Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of Representatives, Washington, DC, June 15, 2015. Hon. Michael McCaul, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Ford House Office Building, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman McCaul: I write concerning H.R. 1640, the Department of Homeland Security Headquarters Consolidation Accountably Act of 2015. This legislation includes matters that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 1640, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will forgo action on this bill. However, this is conditional on our mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill does not prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation that fall within the Committee's Rule X jurisdiction. I request you urge the Speaker to name members of the Committee to any conference committee named to consider such provisions. Please place a copy of this letter and your response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on the house floor. Sincerely, Bill Shuster, Chairman. ____ Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, Washington, DC, June 17, 2015 Hon. Bill Shuster, Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Shuster, Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 1640, the ``Department of Homeland Security Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act of 2015.'' I appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will not seek a sequential referral on the bill. The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual understanding that by foregoing a sequential referral of this bill at this time, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would support a request by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for conferees on those provisions within your jurisdiction. I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, Michael T. McCaul, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in strong support of H.R. 1640, the Department of Homeland Security Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act of 2015. Mr. Speaker, in 2006, 3 years into the Department of Homeland Security's existence, President Bush proposed consolidating the headquarters functions of the Department and its components from the more than 50 locations to the St. Elizabeths campus in southeast Washington, D.C. Construction began in 2009, but between sequestration and tightening budgets, appropriations for the project have been $1.2 billion less than President Bush and President Obama requested. Naturally, Congress' failure to consistently and adequately fund the project has greatly slowed construction and led to increased costs. It has also forced DHS to revisit its master plan and reduce the scope of the project. At this juncture, it is important that the Department have a realistic and [[Page H4566]] achievable plan. The legislation under consideration seeks to do just that. If enacted, this legislation would require the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit to Congress an updated plan for St. Elizabeths to inform future funding decisions. Importantly, H.R. 1640 requires the submission of a proposed occupancy plan for St. Elizabeths that includes a list of components and offices to be housed there. A key consequence of the Department having to scale down the breadth of its consolidation plans is the reality that its portfolio of leased space will need to remain large. In fact, with up to 69 percent of DHS' commercial leases in the national capital region expiring between fiscal years 2016 to 2020, we should all be aware that DHS will be forced to embark on the expensive process of recompeting and possibly relocating its operations and personnel. Before I reserve the balance of my time, I would like to acknowledge that I am pleased that the bill includes an amendment I offered to give the Department adequate time to engage the General Services Administration, the construction manager for the project, in preparing the updated plans, assessments, and estimates. GSA's participation in the development of these key materials is essential to ensuring that what is transmitted to Congress is realistic and achievable. As a supporter of the St. Elizabeths project and DHS' Unity of Effort initiative, I urge passage of H.R. 1640. Colocation of DHS' personnel in one headquarters has the potential of not only achieving cost savings, but fostering an environment where integration and collaboration drives more effective and efficient operations. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I appreciate the bipartisan approach taken on this legislation. The St. Elizabeths project is about more than real estate; it is about ensuring the Department of Homeland Security has a home where diverse components can come together. That is the thinking behind the Secretary's Unity of Effort initiative. Enactment of this legislation will help to ensure that DHS has a realistic plan for St. Elizabeths. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman McCaul and the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker) for their work on this legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I, once again, urge my colleagues to support this strong bipartisan piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1640, the ``Department of Homeland Security Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act of 2015.'' I support this bipartisan legislation which directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit to Congress a report on the Department of Homeland Security headquarters consolidation project in the National Capital Region. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the Homeland Security Committee for unanimously supporting the inclusion of my amendments to H.R. 1640. Together, the Jackson Lee amendments offered a comprehensive look at the Department's real estate obligations related to its headquarters consolidation project at St. Elizabeths, as well as its leased portfolio in the National Capital Region. Further, the Jackson Lee amendments help clarify how DHS will relocate its personnel and operations at the headquarters level and across its components at St. Elizabeths as construction continues on the headquarters consolidation project. Mr. Speaker, since DHS initiated its headquarters consolidation in 2006, it has progressed despite changes in senior leadership and waning funding support from Congress. As a result, in April 2015, DHS and GSA announced that the construction sequence and timetable for the headquarters consolidation would be adjusted to reflect reduced funding by Congress. DHS must now re-compete up to 69 percent of its commercial leases in the National Capital Region as they are scheduled to expire between 2016 and 2020. My first amendment directs DHS to provide information related to the expected timing and terms of any lease renewals in the National Capital Region. My second amendment requires the Department to report on the numbers of its full-time equivalents who are expected to occupy each DHS-leased or owned property, which will guide the Department in adjusting its expenditures on the headquarters consolidation project. Together, they will ensure that DHS and GSA develop a comprehensive picture of which employees and operations will migrate to St. Elizabeths and which will not. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in strong support of the suspension bill, H.R. 1640, the ``Department of Homeland Security Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act of 2015.'' The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1640, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [House] [Pages H4564-H4566] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY HEADQUARTERS CONSOLIDATION ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2015 Mr. WALKER.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina. {time} 1615 General Leave Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina? There was no objection. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1640. Mr. Speaker, since 2006, the Department of Homeland Security and the General Services Administration have been working towards completing a consolidated headquarters on the historic St. Elizabeths campus in Washington, D.C. However, as with many other Federal projects, the consolidation has run up against cost overruns and construction delays, at times estimated to be more than $1 billion over budget and 12 years behind schedule. Earlier this year, I visited the site personally to see firsthand the progress being made and the immense challenges that lie ahead. I remain concerned that taxpayers' dollars will be put at risk without better management. This bill, H.R. 1640, the DHS Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act of 2015, would require the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Administrator of General Services, to investigate and submit a report on the estimated costs and property needs of the project. While we were encouraged by the updated DHS St. Elizabeths plans published earlier this year, we still believe that increased oversight of the consolidation project will help ensure accountability and the efficient use of our constituents' taxpayer dollars. Mr. Speaker, accountability is a fundamental aspect of citizen-ruled government and something that our constituents expect their representatives to uphold. H.R. 1640 does just this, and I look forward to the bipartisan support this legislation will receive. I reserve the balance of my time. Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of Representatives, Washington, DC, June 15, 2015. Hon. Michael McCaul, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Ford House Office Building, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman McCaul: I write concerning H.R. 1640, the Department of Homeland Security Headquarters Consolidation Accountably Act of 2015. This legislation includes matters that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 1640, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will forgo action on this bill. However, this is conditional on our mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill does not prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation that fall within the Committee's Rule X jurisdiction. I request you urge the Speaker to name members of the Committee to any conference committee named to consider such provisions. Please place a copy of this letter and your response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on the house floor. Sincerely, Bill Shuster, Chairman. ____ Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, Washington, DC, June 17, 2015 Hon. Bill Shuster, Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Shuster, Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 1640, the ``Department of Homeland Security Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act of 2015.'' I appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will not seek a sequential referral on the bill. The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual understanding that by foregoing a sequential referral of this bill at this time, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would support a request by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for conferees on those provisions within your jurisdiction. I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, Michael T. McCaul, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in strong support of H.R. 1640, the Department of Homeland Security Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act of 2015. Mr. Speaker, in 2006, 3 years into the Department of Homeland Security's existence, President Bush proposed consolidating the headquarters functions of the Department and its components from the more than 50 locations to the St. Elizabeths campus in southeast Washington, D.C. Construction began in 2009, but between sequestration and tightening budgets, appropriations for the project have been $1.2 billion less than President Bush and President Obama requested. Naturally, Congress' failure to consistently and adequately fund the project has greatly slowed construction and led to increased costs. It has also forced DHS to revisit its master plan and reduce the scope of the project. At this juncture, it is important that the Department have a realistic and [[Page H4566]] achievable plan. The legislation under consideration seeks to do just that. If enacted, this legislation would require the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit to Congress an updated plan for St. Elizabeths to inform future funding decisions. Importantly, H.R. 1640 requires the submission of a proposed occupancy plan for St. Elizabeths that includes a list of components and offices to be housed there. A key consequence of the Department having to scale down the breadth of its consolidation plans is the reality that its portfolio of leased space will need to remain large. In fact, with up to 69 percent of DHS' commercial leases in the national capital region expiring between fiscal years 2016 to 2020, we should all be aware that DHS will be forced to embark on the expensive process of recompeting and possibly relocating its operations and personnel. Before I reserve the balance of my time, I would like to acknowledge that I am pleased that the bill includes an amendment I offered to give the Department adequate time to engage the General Services Administration, the construction manager for the project, in preparing the updated plans, assessments, and estimates. GSA's participation in the development of these key materials is essential to ensuring that what is transmitted to Congress is realistic and achievable. As a supporter of the St. Elizabeths project and DHS' Unity of Effort initiative, I urge passage of H.R. 1640. Colocation of DHS' personnel in one headquarters has the potential of not only achieving cost savings, but fostering an environment where integration and collaboration drives more effective and efficient operations. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I appreciate the bipartisan approach taken on this legislation. The St. Elizabeths project is about more than real estate; it is about ensuring the Department of Homeland Security has a home where diverse components can come together. That is the thinking behind the Secretary's Unity of Effort initiative. Enactment of this legislation will help to ensure that DHS has a realistic plan for St. Elizabeths. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman McCaul and the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker) for their work on this legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I, once again, urge my colleagues to support this strong bipartisan piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1640, the ``Department of Homeland Security Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act of 2015.'' I support this bipartisan legislation which directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit to Congress a report on the Department of Homeland Security headquarters consolidation project in the National Capital Region. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the Homeland Security Committee for unanimously supporting the inclusion of my amendments to H.R. 1640. Together, the Jackson Lee amendments offered a comprehensive look at the Department's real estate obligations related to its headquarters consolidation project at St. Elizabeths, as well as its leased portfolio in the National Capital Region. Further, the Jackson Lee amendments help clarify how DHS will relocate its personnel and operations at the headquarters level and across its components at St. Elizabeths as construction continues on the headquarters consolidation project. Mr. Speaker, since DHS initiated its headquarters consolidation in 2006, it has progressed despite changes in senior leadership and waning funding support from Congress. As a result, in April 2015, DHS and GSA announced that the construction sequence and timetable for the headquarters consolidation would be adjusted to reflect reduced funding by Congress. DHS must now re-compete up to 69 percent of its commercial leases in the National Capital Region as they are scheduled to expire between 2016 and 2020. My first amendment directs DHS to provide information related to the expected timing and terms of any lease renewals in the National Capital Region. My second amendment requires the Department to report on the numbers of its full-time equivalents who are expected to occupy each DHS-leased or owned property, which will guide the Department in adjusting its expenditures on the headquarters consolidation project. Together, they will ensure that DHS and GSA develop a comprehensive picture of which employees and operations will migrate to St. Elizabeths and which will not. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in strong support of the suspension bill, H.R. 1640, the ``Department of Homeland Security Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act of 2015.'' The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1640, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [House] [Pages H4564-H4566] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY HEADQUARTERS CONSOLIDATION ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2015 Mr. WALKER.

rise in strong support of h.r. 1640. mr. speaker, since 2006, the department of homeland security and the general services administration have been working towards completing a consolidated headquarters on the historic st. elizabeths campus in washington, d.c. however, as with many other federal projects, the consolidation has run up against cost overruns and construction delays, at times estimated to be more than $1 billion over budget and 12 years behind schedule. earlier this year, i visited the site personally to see firsthand the progress being made and the immense challenges that lie ahead. i remain concerned that taxpayers' dollars will be put at risk without better management. this bill, h.r. 1640, the dhs headquarters consolidation accountability act of 2015, would require the secretary of homeland security, in coordination with the administrator of general services, to investigate and submit a report on the estimated costs and property needs of the project. while we were encouraged by the updated dhs st. elizabeths plans published earlier this year, we still believe that increased oversight of the consolidation project will help ensure accountability and the efficient use of our constituents' taxpayer dollars. mr. speaker, accountability is a fundamental aspect of citizen-ruled government and something that our constituents expect their representatives to uphold. h.r. 1640 does just this, and i look forward to the bipartisan support this legislation will receive. i reserve the balance of my time. committee on transportation and infrastructure, house of representatives, washington, dc, june 15, 2015. hon. michael mccaul, chairman, committee on homeland security, ford house office building, washington, dc. dear chairman mccaul: i write concerning h.r. 1640, the department of homeland security headquarters consolidation accountably act of 2015. this legislation includes matters that fall within the rule x jurisdiction of the committee on transportation and infrastructure. in order to expedite floor consideration of h.r. 1640, the committee on transportation and infrastructure will forgo action on this bill. however, this is conditional on our mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill does not prejudice the committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation that fall within the committee's rule x jurisdiction. i request you urge the speaker to name members of the committee to any conference committee named to consider such provisions. please place a copy of this letter and your response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the congressional record during consideration of the measure on the house floor. sincerely, bill shuster, chairman. ____ committee on homeland security, house of representatives, washington, dc, june 17, 2015 hon. bill shuster, chairman, committee on transportation and infrastructure, rayburn house office building, washington, dc. dear chairman shuster, thank you for your letter regarding h.r. 1640, the ``department of homeland security headquarters consolidation accountability act of 2015.'' i appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before the house of representatives, and accordingly, understand that the committee on transportation and infrastructure will not seek a sequential referral on the bill. the committee on homeland security concurs with the mutual understanding that by foregoing a sequential referral of this bill at this time, the committee on transportation and infrastructure does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation in the future. in addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, i would support a request by the committee on transportation and infrastructure for conferees on those provisions within your jurisdiction. i will insert copies of this exchange in the congressional record during consideration of this bill on the house floor. i thank you for your cooperation in this matter. sincerely, michael t. mccaul, chairman, committee on homeland security. mrs. watson coleman. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume, and i rise in strong support of h.r. 1640, the department of homeland security headquarters consolidation accountability act of 2015. mr. speaker, in 2006, 3 years into the department of homeland security's existence, president bush proposed consolidating the headquarters functions of the department and its components from the more than 50 locations to the st. elizabeths campus in southeast washington, d.c. construction began in 2009, but between sequestration and tightening budgets, appropriations for the project have been $1.2 billion less than president bush and president obama requested. naturally, congress' failure to consistently and adequately fund the project has greatly slowed construction and led to increased costs. it has also forced dhs to revisit its master plan and reduce the scope of the project. at this juncture, it is important that the department have a realistic and [[page h4566]] achievable plan. the legislation under consideration seeks to do just that. if enacted, this legislation would require the secretary of homeland security to submit to congress an updated plan for st. elizabeths to inform future funding decisions. importantly, h.r. 1640 requires the submission of a proposed occupancy plan for st. elizabeths that includes a list of components and offices to be housed there. a key consequence of the department having to scale down the breadth of its consolidation plans is the reality that its portfolio of leased space will need to remain large. in fact, with up to 69 percent of dhs' commercial leases in the national capital region expiring between fiscal years 2016 to 2020, we should all be aware that dhs will be forced to embark on the expensive process of recompeting and possibly relocating its operations and personnel. before i reserve the balance of my time, i would like to acknowledge that i am pleased that the bill includes an amendment i offered to give the department adequate time to engage the general services administration, the construction manager for the project, in preparing the updated plans, assessments, and estimates. gsa's participation in the development of these key materials is essential to ensuring that what is transmitted to congress is realistic and achievable. as a supporter of the st. elizabeths project and dhs' unity of effort initiative, i urge passage of h.r. 1640. colocation of dhs' personnel in one headquarters has the potential of not only achieving cost savings, but fostering an environment where integration and collaboration drives more effective and efficient operations. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. walker. mr. speaker, i have no more speakers, and i reserve the balance of my time. mrs. watson coleman. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. i appreciate the bipartisan approach taken on this legislation. the st. elizabeths project is about more than real estate; it is about ensuring the department of homeland security has a home where diverse components can come together. that is the thinking behind the secretary's unity of effort initiative. enactment of this legislation will help to ensure that dhs has a realistic plan for st. elizabeths. mr. speaker, i would like to thank chairman mccaul and the gentleman from north carolina (mr. walker) for their work on this legislation. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. walker. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. i, once again, urge my colleagues to support this strong bipartisan piece of legislation, and i yield back the balance of my time. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, as a senior member of the homeland security committee, i rise in strong support of h.r. 1640, the ``department of homeland security headquarters consolidation accountability act of 2015.'' i support this bipartisan legislation which directs the secretary of homeland security to submit to congress a report on the department of homeland security headquarters consolidation project in the national capital region. mr. speaker, i thank my colleagues on the homeland security committee for unanimously supporting the inclusion of my amendments to h.r. 1640. together, the jackson lee amendments offered a comprehensive look at the department's real estate obligations related to its headquarters consolidation project at st. elizabeths, as well as its leased portfolio in the national capital region. further, the jackson lee amendments help clarify how dhs will relocate its personnel and operations at the headquarters level and across its components at st. elizabeths as construction continues on the headquarters consolidation project. mr. speaker, since dhs initiated its headquarters consolidation in 2006, it has progressed despite changes in senior leadership and waning funding support from congress. as a result, in april 2015, dhs and gsa announced that the construction sequence and timetable for the headquarters consolidation would be adjusted to reflect reduced funding by congress. dhs must now re-compete up to 69 percent of its commercial leases in the national capital region as they are scheduled to expire between 2016 and 2020. my first amendment directs dhs to provide information related to the expected timing and terms of any lease renewals in the national capital region. my second amendment requires the department to report on the numbers of its full-time equivalents who are expected to occupy each dhs-leased or owned property, which will guide the department in adjusting its expenditures on the headquarters consolidation project. together, they will ensure that dhs and gsa develop a comprehensive picture of which employees and operations will migrate to st. elizabeths and which will not. i urge all of my colleagues to join me in strong support of the suspension bill, h.r. 1640, the ``department of homeland security headquarters consolidation accountability act of 2015.'' the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from north carolina (mr. walker) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 1640, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",16308
CREC-2015-06-23-pt1-PgH4569,CREC-2015-06-23,114,HOMELAND SECURITY DRONE ASSESSMENT AND ANALYSIS ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [House] [Pages H4569-H4570] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HOMELAND SECURITY DRONE ASSESSMENT AND ANALYSIS ACT Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1646) to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to research how small- and medium-sized unmanned aerial systems could be used in an attack, how to prevent or mitigate the effects of such an attack, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 1646 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Homeland Security Drone Assessment and Analysis Act''. SEC. 2. DRONE ASSESSMENT AND ANALYSIS. (a) In General.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Energy, and the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission research how commercially available small and medium sized unmanned aircraft, excluding aircraft over 1,300 pounds could be used to perpetuate an attack and, based on such research, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall develop policies, guidance, and protocols for the Department of Homeland Security to prevent such an attack or mitigate the risks of such an attack. Not later than 180 days after the completion of the research required under this subsection, the Secretary of Homeland Security may provide, as appropriate, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Energy, and the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission information, based on such research, regarding how to best prevent and mitigate the risk of such an attack. (b) Dissemination to State and Local Officials.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall disseminate information to State, local, and tribal law enforcement officials and State and major urban area fusion centers, as appropriate, regarding how such officials may bolster preparedness for and responses to attacks perpetrated by commercially available small and medium sized unmanned aircraft, excluding aircraft over 1,300 pounds. (c) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation of the Senate an assessment of the security risk associated with commercially available small and medium sized unmanned aircraft, excluding aircraft over 1,300 pounds. Such assessment shall be informed by research conducted in accordance with subsection (a), shall contain recommendations, if applicable, to prevent and mitigate the risk of an unmanned aircraft system attack, and may be developed in coordination with the Centers of Excellence of the Department of Homeland Security and other academic institutions. (d) Prohibition on New Funding.--No funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act. This Act shall be carried out using amounts appropriated or otherwise made available for such purposes. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. General Leave Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1646. The rapid increase of commercially available small-and medium-sized unmanned aerial systems, or UAS, most often referred to as drones, poses an emerging security threat. This is further evidenced by recent high-profile events at the White House, French nuclear power plants, and numerous airports and sports venues. Drones have been a part of foiled terrorist plots, used to smuggle drugs across our borders, and the negligent use of this technology presents a public safety risk. During this Congress, bills have been introduced that focus on topics such as the commercial uses of drones and the privacy concerns associated with their use. However, nobody has tackled the security implications of expanding the use of drones. H.R. 1646, the Homeland Security Drone Assessment and Analysis Act, requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to research how commercially available small- and medium-sized drones could be used in an attack and to develop policies, guidance, and protocols for the Department of Homeland Security to prevent an attack. By the end of fiscal year 2015, the Federal Aviation Administration is expected to establish new rules to remove the waiver requirement and allow the operation of drones for nonrecreational purposes in U.S. airspace. Undoubtedly, these regulations would be better informed by a DHS assessment of the potential security risks associated with the expanded use of small- and medium-sized drones. H.R. 1646 is a good first step towards protecting the country and the American people from this emerging threat. I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Washington, DC, June 9, 2015. Hon. Michael T. McCaul Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman McCaul: I write concerning H.R. 1646, the Homeland Security Drone Assessment and Analysis Act. This legislation includes matters that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 1646, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will forgo action on this bill. However, this is conditional on our mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill does not prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation that fall within the Committee's Rule X jurisdiction. In addition, the bill's sponsor and the Committee on Homeland Security have agreed to include two changes to the bill in a Manager's Amendment on the House Floor. Finally, I request you urge the Speaker to name members of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to any conference committee named to consider H.R. 1646. Please place a copy of this letter and your response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Sincerely, Bill Shuster, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC, June 10, 2015. Hon. Bill Shuster, Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Shuster, Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 1646, the ``Homeland Security Drone Assessment and Analysis Act.'' I appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will forego further action on the bill. The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual understanding that by foregoing further action on this bill at this time, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure represented on the conference committee. I will insert copies of this exchange in the report on the bill and in the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the house floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, Michael T. McCaul, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H.R. 1646, the Homeland Security Drone Assessment and Analysis Act, and in support of the House's adoption of H.R. 1646. I introduced this legislation in response to testimony that we received in committee this past March on gaps in our [[Page H4570]] understanding of the security implications of unmanned aerial systems, UAS, in domestic airspace. For example, off-the-shelf systems widely available today, in the wrong hands, can jam transmitted signals, take surveillance imagery, and carry dangerous weapons. Given these systems' capabilities, it is important that there be a comprehensive study of the security risks and plans to address them. To that end, H.R. 1646 directs the Department of Homeland Security to research how a commercially available small- and medium-sized drone could be used to perpetrate an attack, and to develop policies, guidance, and protocols to prevent such an attack or mitigate the risk of such an attack. As amended in committee, my legislation directs DHS to work with the U.S. Departments of Transportation and Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to carry out this research, and allows for DHS to share advice and information based on that research with these key Federal partners. Mr. Speaker, drone technology holds great promise, with significant social and economic benefits not yet fully realized. However, given the rapid growth in the domestic drone market, it is important that we identify and have strategies to mitigate the associated security risk. If enacted, H.R. 1646 will enhance our Nation's security while, at the same time, clarifying the framework for Americans' legitimate interest in producing and using drones lawfully and safely. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, H.R. 1646, to further the Department of Homeland Security's efforts to work with other agencies on the security risks of small- and medium-sized drones in domestic airspace. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, once again, I urge my colleagues to support this strong, bipartisan piece of legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1646, the ``Homeland Security Drone Assessment and Analysis Act.'' I support this bipartisan legislation because it addresses the potential terrorist threat posed by small and medium-sized drones throughout our country. I thank my colleague, Congresswoman Watson Coleman of New Jersey, for introducing this thoughtful and necessary legislation that will assist the Department of Homeland Security. The Homeland Security Drone Assessment and Analysis Act would require the Department of Homeland Security to research how commercially available small and medium-sized drones could be used to perpetrate an attack. Agencies will be tasked with the responsibility of taking the lead for developing effective policies and guidance along with the proper protocols which will assist in preventing an attack perpetrated with a drone. Information regarding how to properly respond to the potential threats from these drones will be distributed to state and local law enforcement agencies to allow them to develop approaches to mitigate identified threats. The protocols that will be developed as a result of this legislation will assist every level of law enforcement in coordinated responses to a drone related emergency. Recent news reports of small drones crashing in areas such as on the White House lawn and incidents including near misses with commercial aircraft demonstrate the need for this legislation. Mr. Speaker, one of the most important things that can and must continue to be done is to protect our homeland from evolving threats. Mr. Speaker, this is why I join my colleagues in working to strengthen the laws that allow the Department of Homeland Security to create policies that will address emergency protocol threats such as the proliferation of commercial use of drones. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting passage of H.R. 1646. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H. R. 1646, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1646) to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to research how small- and medium-sized unmanned aerial systems could be used in an attack, how to prevent or mitigate the effects of such an attack, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 1646 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Homeland Security Drone Assessment and Analysis Act''. SEC. 2. DRONE ASSESSMENT AND ANALYSIS. (a) In General.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Energy, and the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission research how commercially available small and medium sized unmanned aircraft, excluding aircraft over 1,300 pounds could be used to perpetuate an attack and, based on such research, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall develop policies, guidance, and protocols for the Department of Homeland Security to prevent such an attack or mitigate the risks of such an attack. Not later than 180 days after the completion of the research required under this subsection, the Secretary of Homeland Security may provide, as appropriate, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Energy, and the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission information, based on such research, regarding how to best prevent and mitigate the risk of such an attack. (b) Dissemination to State and Local Officials.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall disseminate information to State, local, and tribal law enforcement officials and State and major urban area fusion centers, as appropriate, regarding how such officials may bolster preparedness for and responses to attacks perpetrated by commercially available small and medium sized unmanned aircraft, excluding aircraft over 1,300 pounds. (c) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation of the Senate an assessment of the security risk associated with commercially available small and medium sized unmanned aircraft, excluding aircraft over 1,300 pounds. Such assessment shall be informed by research conducted in accordance with subsection (a), shall contain recommendations, if applicable, to prevent and mitigate the risk of an unmanned aircraft system attack, and may be developed in coordination with the Centers of Excellence of the Department of Homeland Security and other academic institutions. (d) Prohibition on New Funding.--No funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act. This Act shall be carried out using amounts appropriated or otherwise made available for such purposes. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. General Leave Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1646. The rapid increase of commercially available small-and medium-sized unmanned aerial systems, or UAS, most often referred to as drones, poses an emerging security threat. This is further evidenced by recent high-profile events at the White House, French nuclear power plants, and numerous airports and sports venues. Drones have been a part of foiled terrorist plots, used to smuggle drugs across our borders, and the negligent use of this technology presents a public safety risk. During this Congress, bills have been introduced that focus on topics such as the commercial uses of drones and the privacy concerns associated with their use. However, nobody has tackled the security implications of expanding the use of drones. H.R. 1646, the Homeland Security Drone Assessment and Analysis Act, requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to research how commercially available small- and medium-sized drones could be used in an attack and to develop policies, guidance, and protocols for the Department of Homeland Security to prevent an attack. By the end of fiscal year 2015, the Federal Aviation Administration is expected to establish new rules to remove the waiver requirement and allow the operation of drones for nonrecreational purposes in U.S. airspace. Undoubtedly, these regulations would be better informed by a DHS assessment of the potential security risks associated with the expanded use of small- and medium-sized drones. H.R. 1646 is a good first step towards protecting the country and the American people from this emerging threat. I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Washington, DC, June 9, 2015. Hon. Michael T. McCaul Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman McCaul: I write concerning H.R. 1646, the Homeland Security Drone Assessment and Analysis Act. This legislation includes matters that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 1646, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will forgo action on this bill. However, this is conditional on our mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill does not prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation that fall within the Committee's Rule X jurisdiction. In addition, the bill's sponsor and the Committee on Homeland Security have agreed to include two changes to the bill in a Manager's Amendment on the House Floor. Finally, I request you urge the Speaker to name members of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to any conference committee named to consider H.R. 1646. Please place a copy of this letter and your response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Sincerely, Bill Shuster, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC, June 10, 2015. Hon. Bill Shuster, Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Shuster, Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 1646, the ``Homeland Security Drone Assessment and Analysis Act.'' I appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will forego further action on the bill. The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual understanding that by foregoing further action on this bill at this time, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure represented on the conference committee. I will insert copies of this exchange in the report on the bill and in the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the house floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, Michael T. McCaul, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H.R. 1646, the Homeland Security Drone Assessment and Analysis Act, and in support of the House's adoption of H.R. 1646. I introduced this legislation in response to testimony that we received in committee this past March on gaps in our [[Page H4570]] understanding of the security implications of unmanned aerial systems, UAS, in domestic airspace. For example, off-the-shelf systems widely available today, in the wrong hands, can jam transmitted signals, take surveillance imagery, and carry dangerous weapons. Given these systems' capabilities, it is important that there be a comprehensive study of the security risks and plans to address them. To that end, H.R. 1646 directs the Department of Homeland Security to research how a commercially available small- and medium-sized drone could be used to perpetrate an attack, and to develop policies, guidance, and protocols to prevent such an attack or mitigate the risk of such an attack. As amended in committee, my legislation directs DHS to work with the U.S. Departments of Transportation and Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to carry out this research, and allows for DHS to share advice and information based on that research with these key Federal partners. Mr. Speaker, drone technology holds great promise, with significant social and economic benefits not yet fully realized. However, given the rapid growth in the domestic drone market, it is important that we identify and have strategies to mitigate the associated security risk. If enacted, H.R. 1646 will enhance our Nation's security while, at the same time, clarifying the framework for Americans' legitimate interest in producing and using drones lawfully and safely. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, H.R. 1646, to further the Department of Homeland Security's efforts to work with other agencies on the security risks of small- and medium-sized drones in domestic airspace. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, once again, I urge my colleagues to support this strong, bipartisan piece of legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1646, the ``Homeland Security Drone Assessment and Analysis Act.'' I support this bipartisan legislation because it addresses the potential terrorist threat posed by small and medium-sized drones throughout our country. I thank my colleague, Congresswoman Watson Coleman of New Jersey, for introducing this thoughtful and necessary legislation that will assist the Department of Homeland Security. The Homeland Security Drone Assessment and Analysis Act would require the Department of Homeland Security to research how commercially available small and medium-sized drones could be used to perpetrate an attack. Agencies will be tasked with the responsibility of taking the lead for developing effective policies and guidance along with the proper protocols which will assist in preventing an attack perpetrated with a drone. Information regarding how to properly respond to the potential threats from these drones will be distributed to state and local law enforcement agencies to allow them to develop approaches to mitigate identified threats. The protocols that will be developed as a result of this legislation will assist every level of law enforcement in coordinated responses to a drone related emergency. Recent news reports of small drones crashing in areas such as on the White House lawn and incidents including near misses with commercial aircraft demonstrate the need for this legislation. Mr. Speaker, one of the most important things that can and must continue to be done is to protect our homeland from evolving threats. Mr. Speaker, this is why I join my colleagues in working to strengthen the laws that allow the Department of Homeland Security to create policies that will address emergency protocol threats such as the proliferation of commercial use of drones. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting passage of H.R. 1646. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H. R. 1646, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: A bill to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to research how certain commercially available small and medium sized unmanned aircraft systems could be used in an attack, how to prevent or mitigate the risk of such an attack, and for other purposes.''.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. General Leave Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1615. In November of 2014, it was reported that DHS had received and processed the most FOIA requests out of any Federal department. It holds the largest backlog of unprocessed FOIA requests of any Federal agency. In fact, since 2010, DHS FOIA requests have increased by over 65 percent, and DHS currently holds almost half of all Federal FOIA requests of any government agency--about 50,000 of 95,000 requests. In addition, 3 weeks ago, I was informed that the increase in DHS FOIA requests was partly due to requests for immigration records for people requesting information for their future deferred action cases. My bill, H.R. 1615, the DHS FOIA Efficiency Act of 2015, streamlines the process to address the tremendous workload and backlog and bring transparency to the cost of FOIA requests to the Department. In the recent past, DHS has received poor evaluations regarding its efficiency in handling FOIA requests. For these reasons, my bill directs the chief FOIA officer of DHS to work with other officers within the Department to update their capabilities in handling the large amount of FOIA requests and identify the total annual costs associated with processing these requests. By updating their capabilities and reporting to Congress on how the Department is addressing their poor performance, my bill will direct the Department to address its backlog and inefficiencies in an appropriate and quick manner. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H.R. 1615, the DHS FOIA Efficiency Act. {time} 1645 Mr. Speaker, this legislation, which was unanimously approved by the committee on May 20, seeks to improve the Department's processing of Freedom of Information Act requests. In November 2014, the Comptroller General reported that DHS faces the largest backlog of unprocessed FOIA requests of any Federal agency. While resource challenges and inefficiencies in DHS' internal processes help explain in part the backlog, we must not be complacent and accept these challenges as excuses for the backlog. A cornerstone of our democracy is that the government is accountable to its citizens. The FOIA process is a key mechanism to ensure accountability. I am pleased that the approach taken under this bill is consistent with the Department's unity of effort initiative. Specifically, H.R. 1615 requires that the Department's chief FOIA officer collaborate with FOIA officials in component agencies to track the total annual costs associated with processing FOIA requests, identify and adopt cost-savings measures, and strategize on addressing the backlog. Mr. Speaker, I would also note that in committee, measures authored by Democratic members to promote automation and address staffing resources were adopted with bipartisan support. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 1615, a bipartisan bill that seeks to improve the responsiveness of the Department of Homeland Security to the American public, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, timely compliance with FOIA requests is imperative to an open government. The DHS FOIA backlog has existed for too long and needs to be addressed. I thank Representative Carter and Chairman McCaul for their bipartisan efforts on the DHS FOIA Efficiency Act, which marks an important first step in addressing this FOIA backlog and promoting greater automation in the processing of requests. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, once again, I urge my colleagues to support this strong, bipartisan piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees, and I rise in strong support of H.R. 1615, the ``DHS FOIA Efficiency Act of 2015.'' I support this bipartisan legislation, which addresses DHS' FOIA backlog by requiring the department's chief FOIA officer to issue updated regulations on obtaining records under the Act. I am pleased that H.R. 1615 incorporates two key Jackson Lee amendments offered during the committee markup of the bill. In 2014, DHS had 67,097 FOIA requests that carried over from 2013; added 291,242 requests; and processed 238,031 FOIA requests. The agency still had 120,308 FOIA requests that were carried over into 2015. Because FOIA is a critical component of creating our nation's open and transparent government, the process of citizens getting access to information regarding government matters of personal or public interest is important. DHS's ability to meet public demands for information through FOIA should not be hampered by a lack of technology. One of the Jackson Lee Amendments included in the bill directs that the agency include information on how to adopt automated processing to meet FOIA obligations triggered by agency: Public Notices published in the Federal Register; Final rules; decisions, outcome of adjudicated matters or other agency actions; and obligations to reply to citizen FOIA request. Another Jackson Lee Amendment included in H.R. 1615 directs that a report be drafted that provides an assessment of DHS progress made toward automating the FOIA process. That Jackson Lee amendment also provides that upon completion of the FOIA automation plan that the Chief FOIA officer provides the plan to the heads of the components of the Department. Mr. Speaker, it is true as Justice Brandeis famously observed that ``sunshine is the best disinfectant.'' He was speaking of the power of knowledge to illuminate and to enhance the ability of people to understand and evaluate government actions when presented with information. I agree with Justice Brandeis that ``the most important political office is that of the private citizen.'' I support H.R. 1615 and urge my colleagues to join me in voting for its passage.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. General Leave Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1615. In November of 2014, it was reported that DHS had received and processed the most FOIA requests out of any Federal department. It holds the largest backlog of unprocessed FOIA requests of any Federal agency. In fact, since 2010, DHS FOIA requests have increased by over 65 percent, and DHS currently holds almost half of all Federal FOIA requests of any government agency--about 50,000 of 95,000 requests. In addition, 3 weeks ago, I was informed that the increase in DHS FOIA requests was partly due to requests for immigration records for people requesting information for their future deferred action cases. My bill, H.R. 1615, the DHS FOIA Efficiency Act of 2015, streamlines the process to address the tremendous workload and backlog and bring transparency to the cost of FOIA requests to the Department. In the recent past, DHS has received poor evaluations regarding its efficiency in handling FOIA requests. For these reasons, my bill directs the chief FOIA officer of DHS to work with other officers within the Department to update their capabilities in handling the large amount of FOIA requests and identify the total annual costs associated with processing these requests. By updating their capabilities and reporting to Congress on how the Department is addressing their poor performance, my bill will direct the Department to address its backlog and inefficiencies in an appropriate and quick manner. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H.R. 1615, the DHS FOIA Efficiency Act. {time} 1645 Mr. Speaker, this legislation, which was unanimously approved by the committee on May 20, seeks to improve the Department's processing of Freedom of Information Act requests. In November 2014, the Comptroller General reported that DHS faces the largest backlog of unprocessed FOIA requests of any Federal agency. While resource challenges and inefficiencies in DHS' internal processes help explain in part the backlog, we must not be complacent and accept these challenges as excuses for the backlog. A cornerstone of our democracy is that the government is accountable to its citizens. The FOIA process is a key mechanism to ensure accountability. I am pleased that the approach taken under this bill is consistent with the Department's unity of effort initiative. Specifically, H.R. 1615 requires that the Department's chief FOIA officer collaborate with FOIA officials in component agencies to track the total annual costs associated with processing FOIA requests, identify and adopt cost-savings measures, and strategize on addressing the backlog.

the gentleman from georgia (mr. carter) and the gentlewoman from new jersey (mrs. watson coleman) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from georgia. general leave mr. carter of georgia. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from georgia? there was no objection. mr. carter of georgia. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of h.r. 1615. in november of 2014, it was reported that dhs had received and processed the most foia requests out of any federal department. it holds the largest backlog of unprocessed foia requests of any federal agency. in fact, since 2010, dhs foia requests have increased by over 65 percent, and dhs currently holds almost half of all federal foia requests of any government agency--about 50,000 of 95,000 requests. in addition, 3 weeks ago, i was informed that the increase in dhs foia requests was partly due to requests for immigration records for people requesting information for their future deferred action cases. my bill, h.r. 1615, the dhs foia efficiency act of 2015, streamlines the process to address the tremendous workload and backlog and bring transparency to the cost of foia requests to the department. in the recent past, dhs has received poor evaluations regarding its efficiency in handling foia requests. for these reasons, my bill directs the chief foia officer of dhs to work with other officers within the department to update their capabilities in handling the large amount of foia requests and identify the total annual costs associated with processing these requests. by updating their capabilities and reporting to congress on how the department is addressing their poor performance, my bill will direct the department to address its backlog and inefficiencies in an appropriate and quick manner. i reserve the balance of my time. mrs. watson coleman. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in strong support of h.r. 1615, the dhs foia efficiency act. {time} 1645 mr. speaker, this legislation, which was unanimously approved by the committee on may 20, seeks to improve the department's processing of freedom of information act requests. in november 2014, the comptroller general reported that dhs faces the largest backlog of unprocessed foia requests of any federal agency. while resource challenges and inefficiencies in dhs' internal processes help explain in part the backlog, we must not be complacent and accept these challenges as excuses for the backlog. a cornerstone of our democracy is that the government is accountable to its citizens. the foia process is a key mechanism to ensure accountability. i am pleased that the approach taken under this bill is consistent with the department's unity of effort initiative. specifically, h.r. 1615 requires that the department's chief foia officer collaborate with foia officials in component agencies to track the total annual costs associated with processing foia requests, identify and adopt cost-savings measures, and strategize on addressing the backlog. mr. speaker, i would also note that in committee, measures authored by democratic members to promote automation and address staffing resources were adopted with bipartisan support. mr. speaker, i urge passage of h.r. 1615, a bipartisan bill that seeks to improve the responsiveness of the department of homeland security to the american public, and i reserve the balance of my time. mr. carter of georgia. mr. speaker, i have no more speakers, and i reserve the balance of my time mrs. watson coleman. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. mr. speaker, timely compliance with foia requests is imperative to an open government. the dhs foia backlog has existed for too long and needs to be addressed. i thank representative carter and chairman mccaul for their bipartisan efforts on the dhs foia efficiency act, which marks an important first step in addressing this foia backlog and promoting greater automation in the processing of requests. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. carter of georgia. mr. speaker, once again, i urge my colleagues to support this strong, bipartisan piece of legislation, and i yield back the balance of my time. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, as a senior member of the judiciary and homeland security committees, and i rise in strong support of h.r. 1615, the ``dhs foia efficiency act of 2015.'' i support this bipartisan legislation, which addresses dhs' foia backlog by requiring the department's chief foia officer to issue updated regulations on obtaining records under the act. i am pleased that h.r. 1615 incorporates two key jackson lee amendments offered during the committee markup of the bill. in 2014, dhs had 67,097 foia requests that carried over from 2013; added 291,242 requests; and processed 238,031 foia requests. the agency still had 120,308 foia requests that were carried over into 2015. because foia is a critical component of creating our nation's open and transparent government, the process of citizens getting access to information regarding government matters of personal or public interest is important. dhs's ability to meet public demands for information through foia should not be hampered by a lack of technology. one of the jackson lee amendments included in the bill directs that the agency include information on how to adopt automated processing to meet foia obligations triggered by agency: public notices published in the federal register; final rules; decisions, outcome of adjudicated matters or other agency actions; and obligations to reply to citizen foia request. another jackson lee amendment included in h.r. 1615 directs that a report be drafted that provides an assessment of dhs progress made toward automating the foia process. that jackson lee amendment also provides that upon completion of the foia automation plan that the chief foia officer provides the plan to the heads of the components of the department. mr. speaker, it is true as justice brandeis famously observed that ``sunshine is the best disinfectant.'' he was speaking of the power of knowledge to illuminate and to enhance the ability of people to understand and evaluate government actions when presented with information. i agree with justice brandeis that ``the most important political office is that of the private citizen.'' i support h.r. 1615 and urge my colleagues to join me in voting for its passage. [[page h4572]] the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from georgia (mr. carter) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 1615, as amended. the question was taken. the speaker pro tempore. in the opinion of the chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. mrs. watson coleman. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",13959

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1633) to provide for certain improvements relating to the tracking and reporting of employees of the Department of Homeland Security placed on administrative leave, or any other type of paid non- duty status without charge to leave, for personnel matters, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 1633 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``DHS Paid Administrative Leave Accountability Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY IMPROVED INTERNAL TRACKING AND REPORTING OF ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE FOR PERSONNEL MATTERS. (a) In General.--Title I of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-296; 6 U.S.C. 101 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new section: ``SEC. 104. INTERNAL TRACKING AND REPORTING OF ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE FOR PERSONNEL MATTERS. ``(a) Internal Reporting.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of the DHS Paid Administrative Leave Accountability Act of 2015, and quarterly thereafter, the head of each component of the Department shall submit to the Chief Human Capital Officer of the Department-- ``(1) the number of employees of the component who had been on administrative leave, or any other type of paid non-duty status without charge to leave, for personnel matters for a period of six consecutive months or longer as of the last day of the period covered by the report; ``(2) the total cost to the component associated with such administrative leave and such paid non-duty status (including salary and benefits) for the period covered by the report; and ``(3) the average duration that employees are placed on administrative leave, or any other type of paid non-duty status without charge to leave, for personnel matters for a period of six consecutive months or longer, as of the last day of the period covered by the report for the component. ``(b) CHCO Tracking.--The Chief Human Capital Officer shall-- ``(1) maintain records of the number of employees of the Department who are placed on administrative leave or paid non-duty status without charge to leave for personnel matters and the costs (including salary and benefits) associated with such leave or non-duty status; and ``(2) in consultation with the head of each of the components of the Department, determine any appropriate actions to be taken by the Department to resolve any personnel matter objectively, appropriately, and expeditiously or to reduce the use of administrative leave and paid non-duty status without charge to leave in addressing any personnel matter. ``(c) Personnel Matters Defined.--In this section, the term `personnel matters' means, with respect to an employee, any personnel investigation (including any investigation into misconduct and any national security or suitability investigation), any criminal matter, or any adverse action proposed or taken by the Department, including any action under chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code. ``(d) Leverage of Existing Systems.--In carrying out this section, the Secretary is [[Page H4567]] encouraged to leverage systems and operations in use on the date of enactment of the DHS Paid Administrative Leave Accountability Act of 2015 to implement the requirements of this section.''.

Such policy shall include the responsibilities of the components of the Department for reporting information relating to such administrative leave and such paid non-duty status to the Chief Human Capital Officer, as required under section 104(a) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-296), as added by section 2. Such policy shall provide guidance on expediting the resolution of a personnel matter for which an employee has been on administrative leave or any other type of paid non-duty status without charge to leave for a period of six consecutive months or longer in an objective and appropriate manner. SEC. 4. REPORTS TO CONGRESS ON DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY EMPLOYEES ON ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE FOR PERSONNEL MATTERS.

Each such report shall include-- (1) the costs to the Department associated with the placement of such employees on administrative leave or such paid non-duty status (including salary and benefits) for the period covered by the report; and (2) a description of any actions taken by the Department to resolve any personnel matter for which an employee has been placed on administrative leave or paid non-duty status without charge to leave. (b) Personnel Matters.--In this section, the term ``personnel matters'' has the meaning given such term in section 104(c) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-296), as added by section 2. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. General Leave Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I believe our children and grandchildren deserve a better government than the one that we are passing on to them. Families are struggling due to a lagging economy. Government intrusion and senseless regulations on businesses are pushing jobs overseas. With the recent rash of scandals within our Federal Government, the American people are continually losing their faith in representatives of our government. I know we can do better, and the American people expect to see change. I came to Congress to make a difference, to cut spending, to eliminate waste, and to hold Big Government bureaucrats accountable and make this Nation a place that is more free, safe, and full of opportunity. This is what the American people expect from us, and now is the time for us to take bold and decisive action, and that is why I am standing here today. The Department of Homeland Security has roughly 240,000 employees who work around the clock to protect the lives and liberties of Americans, and I am grateful for their dedicated service. However, due to a lack of proper management and accountability, there are numbers of DHS employees who are staying at home and drawing a paycheck while being investigated for acts of misconduct. In May of 2014, the former deputy inspector general at the Department of Homeland Security was accused of altering reports and delaying investigations. One of those investigations was the Secret Service prostitution scandal that occurred in 2012. The Senate Subcommittee on Financial and Contracting Oversight delved into this case, which also led to further investigations. However, even though the former deputy inspector general was being investigated for gross misconduct, he was placed on administrative leave, receiving full pay and benefits for almost an entire year. We all know that there are occasional incidents like this in any organization. However, if this was an isolated case, I would not be standing here today presenting this bill, but there are numerous cases like it. The Government Accountability Office reported that from 2011 to 2013, the Department of Homeland Security provided its employees with over 1.5 million days of paid administrative leave, equating to over $380 million in taxpayer dollars. Most of this paid leave was granted to employees who were on administrative leave for reasons of misconduct. Unfortunately, the Department has no agencywide standards or reporting policies regarding paid administrative leave for employees being investigated for misconduct. This lack of management and accountability allows employees with disciplinary issues, like the former deputy inspector general, to fall through the cracks. This bill, H.R. 1633, the DHS Paid Administrative Leave Accountability Act of 2015, requires the Chief Human Capital Officer to implement an agencywide policy regarding those who are on paid administrative leave for more than 6 months being investigated for misconduct. In addition, it requires the Department to report to Congress the number of employees on administrative leave during investigation, as well as the associated costs. Having a commonsense policy, as mandated by this bill, will potentially save the Department millions of dollars and provide for critical oversight and accountability. The bill will also require the Chief Human Capital Officer to submit quarterly reports to the House and Senate Homeland Security Committees. These reports will allow more oversight by Congress and ensure DHS is no longer squandering hard-working taxpayer dollars. DHS must do a better job of tracking employees under investigation for misconduct and, in a timely manner, take appropriate action to hold them accountable. Employees who tarnish the Department's reputation do not deserve paid vacations at taxpayer expense. Americans are tired of government carelessly giving away their future through mismanagement and thoughtless spending habits. I encourage my colleagues to support passage of H.R. 1633, a commonsense bill that will help prevent fraud, alleviate waste, and better safeguard taxpayer dollars. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and rise in strong support of H.R. 1633, the DHS Paid Administrative Leave Accountability Act of 2015. Mr. Speaker, this measure which was unanimously approved in committee, seeks to enhance how certain paid administrative leave is tracked and managed by the Department of Homeland Security. H.R. 1633 was introduced in response to a 2014 Government Accountability Office report that looked at paid administrative leave expenditures across government between fiscal years 2011 and 2014. In that report, GAO found that, overall, agencies spent $3.1 billion on paid administrative leave. Of that amount, the Department of Homeland Security spent $380 million on this category of leave. Agencies approve administrative leave for a variety of reasons, from severe weather events, to jury duty, to voting, to disciplinary matters subject to investigation. [[Page H4568]] H.R. 1633 focuses on helping to improve DHS' management of just one segment of paid administrative leave expenditures, leave that is paid for 6 or more consecutive months to an employee that is under investigation by the Department for a conduct or criminal matter. This legislation directs the Department's Chief Human Capital Officer to maintain records from throughout the Department on the number of employees who are paid leave for 6 or more consecutive months during a DHS personnel investigation; the total costs, including salaries and benefits associated with this leave; and the average length of time that an employee in these circumstances is on paid administrative leave. H.R. 1633 also directs the Department's Chief Human Capital Officer to develop and implement departmentwide policy on how components can comply with this recordkeeping requirement and guidance and on how components can expedite the resolution of personnel matters for an employee in these circumstances. In committee, language I authored was accepted to ensure that when a component expeditiously works to resolve personnel matters, as directed by this bill, that component must do so in a way that is objective and fair. {time} 1630 The addition of this language is important because we do not want to create the impression that Congress values expediency and cost-cutting over fairness. Even as we look to foster greater accountability, we must not lose sight of the fact that we are talking about people's careers here. Before I close, I would add that this legislation does nothing to disturb the discretion that the Department has to make leave decisions, and this bill should not impact the availability of paid administrative leave to the DHS workforce. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott), my good friend. Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1633, the DHS Paid Administrative Leave Accountability Act of 2015, introduced by my colleague from Georgia, Barry Loudermilk. Over the span of 2 years, Department of Homeland Security employees racked up approximately 1.5 million days of paid administrative leave, which amounts to hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars. Some of these employees were placed on leave due to investigations into alleged misconduct. Stopping wasteful government spending has been a top priority for me during my time in Congress, which is why I am proud to cosponsor this piece of legislation. This bill increases government transparency by establishing an accountability system within the Department of Homeland Security. This system is essential in safeguarding against waste, fraud, and abuse. I am glad that it is a bipartisan measure. I look forward to its passage, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1633 and stand with this commonsense legislation that saves taxpayer dollars. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter), my colleague, friend, and fellow member of the Homeland Security Committee. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1633. From 2011 to 2013, over 200 DHS employees were placed on paid administrative leave. While administrative leave may be necessary on a case-by-case basis, more frequently, we hear of Federal employees who are under investigation for conduct-related actions. These investigations can last for several months, which can result in a substantial cost to taxpayers. For example, in 2013, a DHS employee was placed on paid administrative leave for running a Web site that predicted and advocated a race war. Such action should not involve paid leave. It clearly should involve termination of employment. Another example involves former Acting and Deputy DHS Inspector General Charles Edwards. Mr. Edwards was placed on paid leave in May of 2014. As of October 2014, he was still on paid administrative leave. This bill protects precious taxpayer dollars by requiring DHS to track and report on employees placed on administrative leave for personnel matters. By keeping track of who is on paid administrative leave, we can better ensure we are not using the taxpayers' dime to pay for DHS employee misconduct. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned before, this legislation would do nothing to disturb the availability of paid administrative leave for DHS workers who need it to vote or to serve on a jury. It is narrowly focused on getting a handle on how much the Department is spending on paid administrative leave for individuals under investigation for 6 or more months. These circumstances are often tough for all involved. The sooner there is an appropriate resolution, the better it is for everyone involved. If enacted, H.R. 1633 would help to ensure that such matters are resolved in a timely and appropriate manner. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, once again, I urge my colleagues to support this strong, commonsense, and bipartisan piece of legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1633, the ``DHS Paid Administrative Leave Accountability Act of 2015.'' This bill makes needed improvements relating to the tracking and reporting of employees of the Department of Homeland Security including administrative leave, or any other type of paid non-duty status without charge to leave, and personal matters, and for other purposes. I support this bipartisan legislation, which amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the head of each component of the Department of Homeland Security to submit on a quarterly basis two reports to the Chief Human Capital Officer of DHS. Mr. Speaker, Title I of Homeland Security Act would be amended by adding Section 104 which provides for the improvement of internal tracking and reporting for administrative leave. First, this bill directs that the number of employees who had been on administrative leave, or any other type of paid non-duty status without charge to leave, for personnel matters for six consecutive months or longer be reported. Second, DHS agency heads must report the total cost to the component associated with such leave and paid non-duty status for that quarter. The Chief Human Capital Officer is responsible for determining appropriate actions to be taken by DHS to resolve any personnel matter expeditiously or to eliminate or reduce the use of such leave and paid non-duty status in addressing any personnel matter. The Chief HCO is also to develop and implement a department-wide policy in accordance with existing federal guidance specifically related to the use of such leave of paid non-duty status for personnel matters. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1633 enhances transparency and allows for more fiscally conservative policy in regards to the costs associated with paid administrative leave. However, it may be more difficult to accomplish this level of transparency in regards to how data for leave is extracted and recorded. These are time sensitive additions which will require that within 90 days of the enactment of this Act, and quarterly thereafter, the department heads are required to submit their reports to the Chief Officer. In that same time span the Chief HC Officer is to promulgate a department-wide policy in accordance with existing Federal guidance specifically related to the use of administrative leave. I join my colleagues in working to strengthen efficiency in all areas of government and supporting fiscally conservative methods to achieve this goal. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting the passage of H.R. 1633. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1633, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the [[Page H4569]] rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [House] [Pages H4566-H4569] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DHS PAID ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2015 Mr. LOUDERMILK.

INTERNAL TRACKING AND REPORTING OF ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE FOR PERSONNEL MATTERS. ``(a) Internal Reporting.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of the DHS Paid Administrative Leave Accountability Act of 2015, and quarterly thereafter, the head of each component of the Department shall submit to the Chief Human Capital Officer of the Department-- ``(1) the number of employees of the component who had been on administrative leave, or any other type of paid non-duty status without charge to leave, for personnel matters for a period of six consecutive months or longer as of the last day of the period covered by the report; ``(2) the total cost to the component associated with such administrative leave and such paid non-duty status (including salary and benefits) for the period covered by the report; and ``(3) the average duration that employees are placed on administrative leave, or any other type of paid non-duty status without charge to leave, for personnel matters for a period of six consecutive months or longer, as of the last day of the period covered by the report for the component. ``(b) CHCO Tracking.--The Chief Human Capital Officer shall-- ``(1) maintain records of the number of employees of the Department who are placed on administrative leave or paid non-duty status without charge to leave for personnel matters and the costs (including salary and benefits) associated with such leave or non-duty status; and ``(2) in consultation with the head of each of the components of the Department, determine any appropriate actions to be taken by the Department to resolve any personnel matter objectively, appropriately, and expeditiously or to reduce the use of administrative leave and paid non-duty status without charge to leave in addressing any personnel matter. ``(c) Personnel Matters Defined.--In this section, the term `personnel matters' means, with respect to an employee, any personnel investigation (including any investigation into misconduct and any national security or suitability investigation), any criminal matter, or any adverse action proposed or taken by the Department, including any action under chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code. ``(d) Leverage of Existing Systems.--In carrying out this section, the Secretary is [[Page H4567]] encouraged to leverage systems and operations in use on the date of enactment of the DHS Paid Administrative Leave Accountability Act of 2015 to implement the requirements of this section.''. (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section 1(b) of such Act is amended by inserting after the item relating to section 103 the following new item: ``Sec. 104. Internal tracking and reporting of administrative leave for personnel matters.''. SEC. 3. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY POLICY RELATING TO EMPLOYEES ON ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE. By not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Chief Human Capital Officer of the Department of Homeland Security shall develop and implement a Department-wide policy in accordance with existing Federal guidance specifically related to the use of administrative leave, or any other type of paid non-duty status without charge to leave, for personnel matters. Such policy shall include the responsibilities of the components of the Department for reporting information relating to such administrative leave and such paid non-duty status to the Chief Human Capital Officer, as required under section 104(a) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-296), as added by section 2. Such policy shall provide guidance on expediting the resolution of a personnel matter for which an employee has been on administrative leave or any other type of paid non-duty status without charge to leave for a period of six consecutive months or longer in an objective and appropriate manner. SEC. 4. REPORTS TO CONGRESS ON DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY EMPLOYEES ON ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE FOR PERSONNEL MATTERS. (a) Quarterly Reports.--Not later than 30 days after the last day of each calendar quarter of 2016, 2017, and 2018, the Chief Human Capital Officer of the Department of Homeland Security shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate a report on the number of Department employees on administrative leave, and any other type of paid non-duty status without charge to leave, for personnel matters for a period of six consecutive months or longer as of the last day of the quarter covered by the report. Each such report shall include-- (1) the costs to the Department associated with the placement of such employees on administrative leave or such paid non-duty status (including salary and benefits) for the period covered by the report; and (2) a description of any actions taken by the Department to resolve any personnel matter for which an employee has been placed on administrative leave or paid non-duty status without charge to leave. (b) Personnel Matters.--In this section, the term ``personnel matters'' has the meaning given such term in section 104(c) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-296), as added by section 2. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. General Leave Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? There was no objection. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I believe our children and grandchildren deserve a better government than the one that we are passing on to them. Families are struggling due to a lagging economy. Government intrusion and senseless regulations on businesses are pushing jobs overseas. With the recent rash of scandals within our Federal Government, the American people are continually losing their faith in representatives of our government. I know we can do better, and the American people expect to see change. I came to Congress to make a difference, to cut spending, to eliminate waste, and to hold Big Government bureaucrats accountable and make this Nation a place that is more free, safe, and full of opportunity. This is what the American people expect from us, and now is the time for us to take bold and decisive action, and that is why I am standing here today. The Department of Homeland Security has roughly 240,000 employees who work around the clock to protect the lives and liberties of Americans, and I am grateful for their dedicated service. However, due to a lack of proper management and accountability, there are numbers of DHS employees who are staying at home and drawing a paycheck while being investigated for acts of misconduct. In May of 2014, the former deputy inspector general at the Department of Homeland Security was accused of altering reports and delaying investigations. One of those investigations was the Secret Service prostitution scandal that occurred in 2012. The Senate Subcommittee on Financial and Contracting Oversight delved into this case, which also led to further investigations. However, even though the former deputy inspector general was being investigated for gross misconduct, he was placed on administrative leave, receiving full pay and benefits for almost an entire year. We all know that there are occasional incidents like this in any organization. However, if this was an isolated case, I would not be standing here today presenting this bill, but there are numerous cases like it. The Government Accountability Office reported that from 2011 to 2013, the Department of Homeland Security provided its employees with over 1.5 million days of paid administrative leave, equating to over $380 million in taxpayer dollars. Most of this paid leave was granted to employees who were on administrative leave for reasons of misconduct. Unfortunately, the Department has no agencywide standards or reporting policies regarding paid administrative leave for employees being investigated for misconduct. This lack of management and accountability allows employees with disciplinary issues, like the former deputy inspector general, to fall through the cracks. This bill, H.R. 1633, the DHS Paid Administrative Leave Accountability Act of 2015, requires the Chief Human Capital Officer to implement an agencywide policy regarding those who are on paid administrative leave for more than 6 months being investigated for misconduct. In addition, it requires the Department to report to Congress the number of employees on administrative leave during investigation, as well as the associated costs. Having a commonsense policy, as mandated by this bill, will potentially save the Department millions of dollars and provide for critical oversight and accountability. The bill will also require the Chief Human Capital Officer to submit quarterly reports to the House and Senate Homeland Security Committees. These reports will allow more oversight by Congress and ensure DHS is no longer squandering hard-working taxpayer dollars. DHS must do a better job of tracking employees under investigation for misconduct and, in a timely manner, take appropriate action to hold them accountable. Employees who tarnish the Department's reputation do not deserve paid vacations at taxpayer expense. Americans are tired of government carelessly giving away their future through mismanagement and thoughtless spending habits. I encourage my colleagues to support passage of H.R. 1633, a commonsense bill that will help prevent fraud, alleviate waste, and better safeguard taxpayer dollars. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and rise in strong support of H.R. 1633, the DHS Paid Administrative Leave Accountability Act of 2015. Mr. Speaker, this measure which was unanimously approved in committee, seeks to enhance how certain paid administrative leave is tracked and managed by the Department of Homeland Security. H.R. 1633 was introduced in response to a 2014 Government Accountability Office report that looked at paid administrative leave expenditures across government between fiscal years 2011 and 2014. In that report, GAO found that, overall, agencies spent $3.1 billion on paid administrative leave. Of that amount, the Department of Homeland Security spent $380 million on this category of leave. Agencies approve administrative leave for a variety of reasons, from severe weather events, to jury duty, to voting, to disciplinary matters subject to investigation. [[Page H4568]] H.R. 1633 focuses on helping to improve DHS' management of just one segment of paid administrative leave expenditures, leave that is paid for 6 or more consecutive months to an employee that is under investigation by the Department for a conduct or criminal matter. This legislation directs the Department's Chief Human Capital Officer to maintain records from throughout the Department on the number of employees who are paid leave for 6 or more consecutive months during a DHS personnel investigation; the total costs, including salaries and benefits associated with this leave; and the average length of time that an employee in these circumstances is on paid administrative leave. H.R. 1633 also directs the Department's Chief Human Capital Officer to develop and implement departmentwide policy on how components can comply with this recordkeeping requirement and guidance and on how components can expedite the resolution of personnel matters for an employee in these circumstances. In committee, language I authored was accepted to ensure that when a component expeditiously works to resolve personnel matters, as directed by this bill, that component must do so in a way that is objective and fair. {time} 1630 The addition of this language is important because we do not want to create the impression that Congress values expediency and cost-cutting over fairness. Even as we look to foster greater accountability, we must not lose sight of the fact that we are talking about people's careers here. Before I close, I would add that this legislation does nothing to disturb the discretion that the Department has to make leave decisions, and this bill should not impact the availability of paid administrative leave to the DHS workforce. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott), my good friend. Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1633, the DHS Paid Administrative Leave Accountability Act of 2015, introduced by my colleague from Georgia, Barry Loudermilk. Over the span of 2 years, Department of Homeland Security employees racked up approximately 1.5 million days of paid administrative leave, which amounts to hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars. Some of these employees were placed on leave due to investigations into alleged misconduct. Stopping wasteful government spending has been a top priority for me during my time in Congress, which is why I am proud to cosponsor this piece of legislation. This bill increases government transparency by establishing an accountability system within the Department of Homeland Security. This system is essential in safeguarding against waste, fraud, and abuse. I am glad that it is a bipartisan measure. I look forward to its passage, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1633 and stand with this commonsense legislation that saves taxpayer dollars. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter), my colleague, friend, and fellow member of the Homeland Security Committee. Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1633. From 2011 to 2013, over 200 DHS employees were placed on paid administrative leave. While administrative leave may be necessary on a case-by-case basis, more frequently, we hear of Federal employees who are under investigation for conduct-related actions. These investigations can last for several months, which can result in a substantial cost to taxpayers. For example, in 2013, a DHS employee was placed on paid administrative leave for running a Web site that predicted and advocated a race war. Such action should not involve paid leave. It clearly should involve termination of employment. Another example involves former Acting and Deputy DHS Inspector General Charles Edwards. Mr. Edwards was placed on paid leave in May of 2014. As of October 2014, he was still on paid administrative leave. This bill protects precious taxpayer dollars by requiring DHS to track and report on employees placed on administrative leave for personnel matters. By keeping track of who is on paid administrative leave, we can better ensure we are not using the taxpayers' dime to pay for DHS employee misconduct. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned before, this legislation would do nothing to disturb the availability of paid administrative leave for DHS workers who need it to vote or to serve on a jury. It is narrowly focused on getting a handle on how much the Department is spending on paid administrative leave for individuals under investigation for 6 or more months. These circumstances are often tough for all involved. The sooner there is an appropriate resolution, the better it is for everyone involved. If enacted, H.R. 1633 would help to ensure that such matters are resolved in a timely and appropriate manner. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, once again, I urge my colleagues to support this strong, commonsense, and bipartisan piece of legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1633, the ``DHS Paid Administrative Leave Accountability Act of 2015.'' This bill makes needed improvements relating to the tracking and reporting of employees of the Department of Homeland Security including administrative leave, or any other type of paid non-duty status without charge to leave, and personal matters, and for other purposes. I support this bipartisan legislation, which amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the head of each component of the Department of Homeland Security to submit on a quarterly basis two reports to the Chief Human Capital Officer of DHS. Mr. Speaker, Title I of Homeland Security Act would be amended by adding Section 104 which provides for the improvement of internal tracking and reporting for administrative leave. First, this bill directs that the number of employees who had been on administrative leave, or any other type of paid non-duty status without charge to leave, for personnel matters for six consecutive months or longer be reported. Second, DHS agency heads must report the total cost to the component associated with such leave and paid non-duty status for that quarter. The Chief Human Capital Officer is responsible for determining appropriate actions to be taken by DHS to resolve any personnel matter expeditiously or to eliminate or reduce the use of such leave and paid non-duty status in addressing any personnel matter. The Chief HCO is also to develop and implement a department-wide policy in accordance with existing federal guidance specifically related to the use of such leave of paid non-duty status for personnel matters. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1633 enhances transparency and allows for more fiscally conservative policy in regards to the costs associated with paid administrative leave. However, it may be more difficult to accomplish this level of transparency in regards to how data for leave is extracted and recorded. These are time sensitive additions which will require that within 90 days of the enactment of this Act, and quarterly thereafter, the department heads are required to submit their reports to the Chief Officer. In that same time span the Chief HC Officer is to promulgate a department-wide policy in accordance with existing Federal guidance specifically related to the use of administrative leave. I join my colleagues in working to strengthen efficiency in all areas of government and supporting fiscally conservative methods to achieve this goal. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting the passage of H.R. 1633. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1633, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the [[Page H4569]] rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [House] [Pages H4566-H4569] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DHS PAID ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2015 Mr. LOUDERMILK.

I support this bipartisan legislation, which amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the head of each component of the Department of Homeland Security to submit on a quarterly basis two reports to the Chief Human Capital Officer of DHS. Mr. Speaker, Title I of Homeland Security Act would be amended by adding Section 104 which provides for the improvement of internal tracking and reporting for administrative leave. First, this bill directs that the number of employees who had been on administrative leave, or any other type of paid non-duty status without charge to leave, for personnel matters for six consecutive months or longer be reported. Second, DHS agency heads must report the total cost to the component associated with such leave and paid non-duty status for that quarter. The Chief Human Capital Officer is responsible for determining appropriate actions to be taken by DHS to resolve any personnel matter expeditiously or to eliminate or reduce the use of such leave and paid non-duty status in addressing any personnel matter. The Chief HCO is also to develop and implement a department-wide policy in accordance with existing federal guidance specifically related to the use of such leave of paid non-duty status for personnel matters. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1633 enhances transparency and allows for more fiscally conservative policy in regards to the costs associated with paid administrative leave. However, it may be more difficult to accomplish this level of transparency in regards to how data for leave is extracted and recorded. These are time sensitive additions which will require that within 90 days of the enactment of this Act, and quarterly thereafter, the department heads are required to submit their reports to the Chief Officer. In that same time span the Chief HC Officer is to promulgate a department-wide policy in accordance with existing Federal guidance specifically related to the use of administrative leave. I join my colleagues in working to strengthen efficiency in all areas of government and supporting fiscally conservative methods to achieve this goal. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting the passage of H.R. 1633. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1633, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the [[Page H4569]] rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_266.csv,20675,20675,20743,"[congressional record volume 161, number 101 (tuesday, june 23, 2015)] [house] [pages h4566-h4569] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] dhs paid administrative leave accountability act of 2015 mr. loudermilk. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 1633) to provide for certain improvements relating to the tracking and reporting of employees of the department of homeland security placed on administrative leave, or any other type of paid non- duty status without charge to leave, for personnel matters, and for other purposes, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 1633 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``dhs paid administrative leave accountability act of 2015''. sec. 2. department of homeland security improved internal tracking and reporting of administrative leave for personnel matters.

2. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from georgia (mr. loudermilk) and the gentlewoman from new jersey (mrs. watson coleman) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from georgia. general leave mr. loudermilk. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from georgia? there was no objection. mr. loudermilk. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i believe our children and grandchildren deserve a better government than the one that we are passing on to them. families are struggling due to a lagging economy. government intrusion and senseless regulations on businesses are pushing jobs overseas. with the recent rash of scandals within our federal government, the american people are continually losing their faith in representatives of our government. i know we can do better, and the american people expect to see change. i came to congress to make a difference, to cut spending, to eliminate waste, and to hold big government bureaucrats accountable and make this nation a place that is more free, safe, and full of opportunity. this is what the american people expect from us, and now is the time for us to take bold and decisive action, and that is why i am standing here today. the department of homeland security has roughly 240,000 employees who work around the clock to protect the lives and liberties of americans, and i am grateful for their dedicated service. however, due to a lack of proper management and accountability, there are numbers of dhs employees who are staying at home and drawing a paycheck while being investigated for acts of misconduct. in may of 2014, the former deputy inspector general at the department of homeland security was accused of altering reports and delaying investigations. one of those investigations was the secret service prostitution scandal that occurred in 2012. the senate subcommittee on financial and contracting oversight delved into this case, which also led to further investigations. however, even though the former deputy inspector general was being investigated for gross misconduct, he was placed on administrative leave, receiving full pay and benefits for almost an entire year. we all know that there are occasional incidents like this in any organization. however, if this was an isolated case, i would not be standing here today presenting this bill, but there are numerous cases like it. the government accountability office reported that from 2011 to 2013, the department of homeland security provided its employees with over 1.5 million days of paid administrative leave, equating to over $380 million in taxpayer dollars. most of this paid leave was granted to employees who were on administrative leave for reasons of misconduct. unfortunately, the department has no agencywide standards or reporting policies regarding paid administrative leave for employees being investigated for misconduct. this lack of management and accountability allows employees with disciplinary issues, like the former deputy inspector general, to fall through the cracks. this bill, h.r. 1633, the dhs paid administrative leave accountability act of 2015, requires the chief human capital officer to implement an agencywide policy regarding those who are on paid administrative leave for more than 6 months being investigated for misconduct. in addition, it requires the department to report to congress the number of employees on administrative leave during investigation, as well as the associated costs. having a commonsense policy, as mandated by this bill, will potentially save the department millions of dollars and provide for critical oversight and accountability. the bill will also require the chief human capital officer to submit quarterly reports to the house and senate homeland security committees. these reports will allow more oversight by congress and ensure dhs is no longer squandering hard-working taxpayer dollars. dhs must do a better job of tracking employees under investigation for misconduct and, in a timely manner, take appropriate action to hold them accountable. employees who tarnish the department's reputation do not deserve paid vacations at taxpayer expense. americans are tired of government carelessly giving away their future through mismanagement and thoughtless spending habits. i encourage my colleagues to support passage of h.r. 1633, a commonsense bill that will help prevent fraud, alleviate waste, and better safeguard taxpayer dollars. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mrs. watson coleman. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume, and rise in strong support of h.r. 1633, the dhs paid administrative leave accountability act of 2015. mr. speaker, this measure which was unanimously approved in committee, seeks to enhance how certain paid administrative leave is tracked and managed by the department of homeland security. h.r. 1633 was introduced in response to a 2014 government accountability office report that looked at paid administrative leave expenditures across government between fiscal years 2011 and 2014. in that report, gao found that, overall, agencies spent $3.1 billion on paid administrative leave. of that amount, the department of homeland security spent $380 million on this category of leave. agencies approve administrative leave for a variety of reasons, from severe weather events, to jury duty, to voting, to disciplinary matters subject to investigation. [[page h4568]] h.r. 1633 focuses on helping to improve dhs' management of just one segment of paid administrative leave expenditures, leave that is paid for 6 or more consecutive months to an employee that is under investigation by the department for a conduct or criminal matter. this legislation directs the department's chief human capital officer to maintain records from throughout the department on the number of employees who are paid leave for 6 or more consecutive months during a dhs personnel investigation; the total costs, including salaries and benefits associated with this leave; and the average length of time that an employee in these circumstances is on paid administrative leave. h.r. 1633 also directs the department's chief human capital officer to develop and implement departmentwide policy on how components can comply with this recordkeeping requirement and guidance and on how components can expedite the resolution of personnel matters for an employee in these circumstances. in committee, language i authored was accepted to ensure that when a component expeditiously works to resolve personnel matters, as directed by this bill, that component must do so in a way that is objective and fair. {time} 1630 the addition of this language is important because we do not want to create the impression that congress values expediency and cost-cutting over fairness. even as we look to foster greater accountability, we must not lose sight of the fact that we are talking about people's careers here. before i close, i would add that this legislation does nothing to disturb the discretion that the department has to make leave decisions, and this bill should not impact the availability of paid administrative leave to the dhs workforce. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. loudermilk. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from georgia (mr. austin scott), my good friend. mr. austin scott of georgia. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h.r. 1633, the dhs paid administrative leave accountability act of 2015, introduced by my colleague from georgia, barry loudermilk. over the span of 2 years, department of homeland security employees racked up approximately 1.5 million days of paid administrative leave, which amounts to hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars. some of these employees were placed on leave due to investigations into alleged misconduct. stopping wasteful government spending has been a top priority for me during my time in congress, which is why i am proud to cosponsor this piece of legislation. this bill increases government transparency by establishing an accountability system within the department of homeland security. this system is essential in safeguarding against waste, fraud, and abuse. i am glad that it is a bipartisan measure. i look forward to its passage, and i urge my colleagues to support h.r. 1633 and stand with this commonsense legislation that saves taxpayer dollars. mrs. watson coleman. mr. speaker, i have no further speakers, and i reserve the balance of my time. mr. loudermilk. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from georgia (mr. carter), my colleague, friend, and fellow member of the homeland security committee. mr. carter of georgia. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h.r. 1633. from 2011 to 2013, over 200 dhs employees were placed on paid administrative leave. while administrative leave may be necessary on a case-by-case basis, more frequently, we hear of federal employees who are under investigation for conduct-related actions. these investigations can last for several months, which can result in a substantial cost to taxpayers. for example, in 2013, a dhs employee was placed on paid administrative leave for running a web site that predicted and advocated a race war. such action should not involve paid leave. it clearly should involve termination of employment. another example involves former acting and deputy dhs inspector general charles edwards. mr. edwards was placed on paid leave in may of 2014. as of october 2014, he was still on paid administrative leave. this bill protects precious taxpayer dollars by requiring dhs to track and report on employees placed on administrative leave for personnel matters. by keeping track of who is on paid administrative leave, we can better ensure we are not using the taxpayers' dime to pay for dhs employee misconduct. i urge my colleagues to support this bill. mrs. watson coleman. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, as i mentioned before, this legislation would do nothing to disturb the availability of paid administrative leave for dhs workers who need it to vote or to serve on a jury. it is narrowly focused on getting a handle on how much the department is spending on paid administrative leave for individuals under investigation for 6 or more months. these circumstances are often tough for all involved. the sooner there is an appropriate resolution, the better it is for everyone involved. if enacted, h.r. 1633 would help to ensure that such matters are resolved in a timely and appropriate manner. mr. speaker, i urge passage, and i yield back the balance of my time. mr. loudermilk. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, once again, i urge my colleagues to support this strong, commonsense, and bipartisan piece of legislation. i yield back the balance of my time. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, as a senior member of the homeland security committee, i rise in strong support of h.r. 1633, the ``dhs paid administrative leave accountability act of 2015.'' this bill makes needed improvements relating to the tracking and reporting of employees of the department of homeland security including administrative leave, or any other type of paid non-duty status without charge to leave, and personal matters, and for other purposes. i support this bipartisan legislation, which amends the homeland security act of 2002 to direct the head of each component of the department of homeland security to submit on a quarterly basis two reports to the chief human capital officer of dhs. mr. speaker, title i of homeland security act would be amended by adding section 104 which provides for the improvement of internal tracking and reporting for administrative leave. first, this bill directs that the number of employees who had been on administrative leave, or any other type of paid non-duty status without charge to leave, for personnel matters for six

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1626. Call me crazy, but it just doesn't make sense to me to have Federal agencies using multiple IT systems that do the same thing. As chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Information Technology Subcommittee and a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I see these cost overruns and hear stories of duplicative systems on a daily basis. It is a ridiculous and outrageous waste of taxpayer dollars. This year, the GAO's annual High Risk report designated information technology as a new area of high risk within the government. Federal agencies spend nearly $80 billion a year on IT projects, and nearly 80 percent of them are on outdated and legacy systems. In the Department of Homeland Security, there are more than 600 IT systems in FEMA alone. The DHS IT Duplication Reduction Act is designed to change that. My bill requires the DHS Chief Information Officer to identify all IT systems in the Department, figure out which ones are redundant, and then come up with a strategy to reduce their number. Mr. Speaker, when I was building a cybersecurity firm in the private sector, things like this didn't happen because there is no way that a small business trying to grow would ever waste their money like this. Washington should have the same mentality, especially since this money being wasted isn't Washington's in the first place. I believe Washington can and should be much better stewards of the dollars taxpayers have entrusted to them. It is past time to change the ``it is not my money, so let's spend it'' culture here in Washington that leads to this kind of waste. Taxpayers should be able to trust that every dollar is being used carefully and thoughtfully on effective and efficient government that works for them. I believe this legislation is a good start in reining in Federal IT spending and getting our government back on track. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in strong support of H.R. 1626, the DHS IT Duplication Reduction Act of 2015. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1626 seeks to address duplication or fragmentation within the Department of Homeland Security's information technology systems. Specifically, H.R. 1626 requires the Department's Chief Information Officer to report on the number of IT systems throughout the Department and identify and address those areas where duplication or fragmentation may exist. This undertaking at the headquarters level should help inform the Department's IT budget planning which, in light of sequestration and the downward trend of the Department's budget, becomes all the more important when considered in the critical missions entrusted to DHS. This legislation is in the spirit of the Department's Unity of Effort initiative and has the potential of fostering more coordinated IT planning and management among the Department's components. In committee, a number of technical refinements authored by Democrats were accepted to ensure that reducing redundancy frees up resources for DHS' operations. Mr. Speaker, I do urge support for this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I, once again, want to point out the bipartisan efforts in regards to this measure.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1626) to reduce duplication of information technology at the Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 1626 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``DHS IT Duplication Reduction Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. DHS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DUPLICATION REDUCTION. (a) Information Technology Duplication Reduction.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Chief Information Officer of the Department of Homeland Security shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate a report that includes the following: (1) The number of information technology systems at the Department of Homeland Security. (2) An assessment of the number of such systems exhibiting duplication or fragmentation. (3) A strategy for reducing such duplicative systems, including an assessment of potential cost savings or cost avoidance as a result of such reduction. (4) A methodology for determining which system should be eliminated when there is duplication or fragmentation. (b) Definitions.--In this Act: (1) The term ``duplication or fragmentation'' of information technology systems means two or more systems or programs that deliver similar functionality to similar user populations. (2) The term ``information technology'' has the meaning given such term in section 11101 of title 40, United States Code. (c) No New Authorization of Funding.--This section shall be carried out using amounts otherwise appropriated or made available to the Department of Homeland Security. No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hurd) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. General Leave Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1626. Call me crazy, but it just doesn't make sense to me to have Federal agencies using multiple IT systems that do the same thing. As chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Information Technology Subcommittee and a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I see these cost overruns and hear stories of duplicative systems on a daily basis. It is a ridiculous and outrageous waste of taxpayer dollars. This year, the GAO's annual High Risk report designated information technology as a new area of high risk within the government. Federal agencies spend nearly $80 billion a year on IT projects, and nearly 80 percent of them are on outdated and legacy systems. In the Department of Homeland Security, there are more than 600 IT systems in FEMA alone. The DHS IT Duplication Reduction Act is designed to change that. My bill requires the DHS Chief Information Officer to identify all IT systems in the Department, figure out which ones are redundant, and then come up with a strategy to reduce their number. Mr. Speaker, when I was building a cybersecurity firm in the private sector, things like this didn't happen because there is no way that a small business trying to grow would ever waste their money like this. Washington should have the same mentality, especially since this money being wasted isn't Washington's in the first place. I believe Washington can and should be much better stewards of the dollars taxpayers have entrusted to them. It is past time to change the ``it is not my money, so let's spend it'' culture here in Washington that leads to this kind of waste. Taxpayers should be able to trust that every dollar is being used carefully and thoughtfully on effective and efficient government that works for them. I believe this legislation is a good start in reining in Federal IT spending and getting our government back on track. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in strong support of H.R. 1626, the DHS IT Duplication Reduction Act of 2015. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1626 seeks to address duplication or fragmentation within the Department of Homeland Security's information technology systems. Specifically, H.R. 1626 requires the Department's Chief Information Officer to report on the number of IT systems throughout the Department and identify and address those areas where duplication or fragmentation may exist. This undertaking at the headquarters level should help inform the Department's IT budget planning which, in light of sequestration and the downward trend of the Department's budget, becomes all the more important when considered in the critical missions entrusted to DHS. This legislation is in the spirit of the Department's Unity of Effort initiative and has the potential of fostering more coordinated IT planning and management among the Department's components. In committee, a number of technical refinements authored by Democrats were accepted to ensure that reducing redundancy frees up resources for DHS' operations. Mr. Speaker, I do urge support for this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I, once again, want to point out the bipartisan efforts in regards to this measure.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1637) to require annual reports on the activities and accomplishments of federally funded research and [[Page H4573]] development centers within the Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 1637 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Federally Funded Research and Development Sunshine Act of 2015''. SEC. 2.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1637, the Federally Funded Research and Development Sunshine Act of 2015. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to represent 700,000 north and east Texans. They have sent me here to Washington to pull the curtain back and shine a light into this Federal bureaucracy. Mr. Speaker, we all know that Federal agencies can be inefficient, ineffective, and resistant to oversight. They don't like to be held accountable, not by the American people or by individuals like me who are elected to represent those folks here in Congress. As a committed conservative who is fighting to secure the American homeland, I believe that increased transparency is a national security issue, and because of that, every taxpayer dollar that we spend must be scrutinized. We have to evaluate the government's programs and activities to see if they are worthwhile and to craft reforms that eliminate waste and bolster our national defense. A sluggish national security apparatus simply won't suffice. The American people deserve more. Congress can't even begin to conduct effective oversight and cut waste, fraud, and abuse if we don't know what is going on behind closed doors. That is why I introduced H.R. 1637. This bill will increase transparency at the Department of Homeland Security by directing the Secretary to give Congress a detailed account each year of the ongoing and completed projects that federally funded research and development centers, or FFRDCs, within the Department of Homeland Security have been assigned. FFRDCs conduct specialized research and development for the Federal Government. The two FFRDCs within the Department of Homeland Security provide independent analysis of homeland security issues. Currently, the Homeland Security Committee is expected to oversee these FFRDCs; yet the committee doesn't even receive an account of the status of ongoing or completed projects. It is hard to be a vigilant steward of hard-earned taxpayer dollars when you have a blindfold on. My legislation will enable the committee to have visibility into the scope of FFRDC projects that the DHS has tasked them to meet their mission needs. This detailed accounting will allow committee members to have insight into current research and development projects and be able to further scrutinize them, thereby increasing oversight and transparency of the entire Science and Technology Directorate operation at DHS. Mr. Speaker, it is important that Congress is aware of the Department of Homeland Security's research and development efforts and funding priorities to ensure that it is meeting the mission needs of its components, and this bill today will shed light on those activities. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill. I think that we all agree that we can support increased transparency and a stronger, more secure homeland. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Washington, DC, June 23, 2015. Hon. Michael T. McCaul, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.R. 1637, the ``Federally Funded Research and Development Sunshine Act of 2015,'' which your Committee ordered reported on May 20, 2015. H.R. 1637 contains provisions within the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology's Rule X jurisdiction. As a result of your having consulted with the Committee and in order to expedite this bill for floor consideration, the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology will not seek a sequential referral. This is being done on the basis of our mutual understanding that doing so will in no way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology with respect to the appointment of conferees, or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation. I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming this understanding, and would request that you include a copy of this letter and your response in the Congressional Record during the floor consideration of this bill. Thank you in advance for your cooperation. Sincerely, Lamar Smith, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC, June 23, 2015. Hon. Lamar Smith, Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Smith: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 1637, the ``Federally Funded Research and Development Sunshine Act.'' I appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology will not seek a sequential referral on the bill. The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual understanding that by foregoing a sequential referral of this bill at this time, the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would support a request by the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology for conferees on those provisions within your jurisdiction. I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, Michael T. McCaul, Chairman. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in strong support of H.R. 1637, the Federally Funded Research and Development Act of 2015, and. Mr. Speaker, this legislation would require the Department of Homeland Security to prepare annual status reports on the research activities of federally funded research and development centers, or FFRDCs, on behalf of the Department. {time} 1700 DHS looks to these institutions that are largely operated by universities and not-for-profit organizations to help meet special long-term research and development needs. In addition to the two FFRDCs that DHS sponsors, there are 17 national labs managed by the Department of Energy that provide research and technical assistance in support of the Nation's homeland security. Among the areas of research expertise offered by these labs are critical [[Page H4574]] infrastructure protection; cybersecurity; chemical, biological, and nuclear forensics; biodefense countermeasures; biodetection; and emergency preparedness. I believe that timely and regular information about how DHS is utilizing these institutions is important to assessing progress on a wide range of homeland security challenges. That is why I support H.R. 1631 and urge passage. I want to commend members of the Homeland Security Committee on the bipartisan nature in which this legislation has been crafted. It is important for us to know how DHS is using federally funded research and development centers to address homeland security challenges. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I, once again, urge my colleagues to support this strong, commonsense bipartisan piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1637, the ``Federally Funded Research and Development Sunshine Act of 2015.'' I support this bipartisan legislation which requires annual reports on the activities and accomplishments of federally funded research and development centers within the department of Homeland Security. The bill requires that the secretary of Homeland Security annually submit to Congressional oversight committees a list of ongoing and completed projects lead by federally funded research and development centers within the Department of Homeland Security have been assigned or completed. Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) act as a vehicle for special research and development contracting within the federal government. The FFRDCs provide DHS with independent and objective advice and quick response on critical issues throughout the Homeland Security Enterprise. Homeland Security Systems Engineering and Development Institute (HSSEDI) and Homeland Security Studies and Analysis Institute (HSSAI) perform high-quality research and provide advice that is authoritative, objective and free from conflicts of interest caused by competition. I support H.R. 1637, which provides much needed transparency on the research conducted by the Department of Homeland security. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in strong support of the suspension bill, H.R. 1637, the ``Federally Funded Research and Development Sunshine Act of 2015.'' The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1637. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed.

It is important for us to know how DHS is using federally funded research and development centers to address homeland security challenges. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I, once again, urge my colleagues to support this strong, commonsense bipartisan piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1637, the ``Federally Funded Research and Development Sunshine Act of 2015.'' I support this bipartisan legislation which requires annual reports on the activities and accomplishments of federally funded research and development centers within the department of Homeland Security. The bill requires that the secretary of Homeland Security annually submit to Congressional oversight committees a list of ongoing and completed projects lead by federally funded research and development centers within the Department of Homeland Security have been assigned or completed. Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) act as a vehicle for special research and development contracting within the federal government. The FFRDCs provide DHS with independent and objective advice and quick response on critical issues throughout the Homeland Security Enterprise. Homeland Security Systems Engineering and Development Institute (HSSEDI) and Homeland Security Studies and Analysis Institute (HSSAI) perform high-quality research and provide advice that is authoritative, objective and free from conflicts of interest caused by competition. I support H.R. 1637, which provides much needed transparency on the research conducted by the Department of Homeland security. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in strong support of the suspension bill, H.R. 1637, the ``Federally Funded Research and Development Sunshine Act of 2015.'' The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1637. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [House] [Pages H4572-H4574] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SUNSHINE ACT OF 2015 Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1637) to require annual reports on the activities and accomplishments of federally funded research and [[Page H4573]] development centers within the Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 1637 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Federally Funded Research and Development Sunshine Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. ANNUAL REPORTS ON PROJECTS OF FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTERS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. (a) In General.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall annually submit to the Committee on Homeland Security, the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate a list of ongoing and completed projects that federally funded research and development centers within the Department of Homeland Security have been tasked to complete. (b) Prohibition on New Authorization of Funding.--This section shall be carried out using amounts otherwise appropriated or made available to the Department of Homeland Security. No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. General Leave Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1637, the Federally Funded Research and Development Sunshine Act of 2015. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to represent 700,000 north and east Texans. They have sent me here to Washington to pull the curtain back and shine a light into this Federal bureaucracy. Mr. Speaker, we all know that Federal agencies can be inefficient, ineffective, and resistant to oversight. They don't like to be held accountable, not by the American people or by individuals like me who are elected to represent those folks here in Congress. As a committed conservative who is fighting to secure the American homeland, I believe that increased transparency is a national security issue, and because of that, every taxpayer dollar that we spend must be scrutinized. We have to evaluate the government's programs and activities to see if they are worthwhile and to craft reforms that eliminate waste and bolster our national defense. A sluggish national security apparatus simply won't suffice. The American people deserve more. Congress can't even begin to conduct effective oversight and cut waste, fraud, and abuse if we don't know what is going on behind closed doors. That is why I introduced H.R. 1637. This bill will increase transparency at the Department of Homeland Security by directing the Secretary to give Congress a detailed account each year of the ongoing and completed projects that federally funded research and development centers, or FFRDCs, within the Department of Homeland Security have been assigned. FFRDCs conduct specialized research and development for the Federal Government. The two FFRDCs within the Department of Homeland Security provide independent analysis of homeland security issues. Currently, the Homeland Security Committee is expected to oversee these FFRDCs; yet the committee doesn't even receive an account of the status of ongoing or completed projects. It is hard to be a vigilant steward of hard-earned taxpayer dollars when you have a blindfold on. My legislation will enable the committee to have visibility into the scope of FFRDC projects that the DHS has tasked them to meet their mission needs. This detailed accounting will allow committee members to have insight into current research and development projects and be able to further scrutinize them, thereby increasing oversight and transparency of the entire Science and Technology Directorate operation at DHS. Mr. Speaker, it is important that Congress is aware of the Department of Homeland Security's research and development efforts and funding priorities to ensure that it is meeting the mission needs of its components, and this bill today will shed light on those activities. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill. I think that we all agree that we can support increased transparency and a stronger, more secure homeland. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Washington, DC, June 23, 2015. Hon. Michael T. McCaul, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.R. 1637, the ``Federally Funded Research and Development Sunshine Act of 2015,'' which your Committee ordered reported on May 20, 2015. H.R. 1637 contains provisions within the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology's Rule X jurisdiction. As a result of your having consulted with the Committee and in order to expedite this bill for floor consideration, the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology will not seek a sequential referral. This is being done on the basis of our mutual understanding that doing so will in no way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology with respect to the appointment of conferees, or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation. I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming this understanding, and would request that you include a copy of this letter and your response in the Congressional Record during the floor consideration of this bill.

In addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would support a request by the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology for conferees on those provisions within your jurisdiction. I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, Michael T. McCaul, Chairman. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in strong support of H.R. 1637, the Federally Funded Research and Development Act of 2015, and. Mr. Speaker, this legislation would require the Department of Homeland Security to prepare annual status reports on the research activities of federally funded research and development centers, or FFRDCs, on behalf of the Department. {time} 1700 DHS looks to these institutions that are largely operated by universities and not-for-profit organizations to help meet special long-term research and development needs. In addition to the two FFRDCs that DHS sponsors, there are 17 national labs managed by the Department of Energy that provide research and technical assistance in support of the Nation's homeland security. Among the areas of research expertise offered by these labs are critical [[Page H4574]] infrastructure protection; cybersecurity; chemical, biological, and nuclear forensics; biodefense countermeasures; biodetection; and emergency preparedness. I believe that timely and regular information about how DHS is utilizing these institutions is important to assessing progress on a wide range of homeland security challenges.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation. Sincerely, Lamar Smith, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC, June 17, 2015. Hon. Lamar Smith, Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Smith: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 2390, the ``Homeland Security University-based Centers Review Act.'' I appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology will forego further action on the bill.

In addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology represented on the conference committee. I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, Michael T. McCaul, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2390, the Homeland Security University-based Centers Review Act. I introduced H.R. 2390, the Homeland Security University-based Centers Review Act, with my colleague Mr. Richmond, to provide Congress with the full picture of the Department's management of the Centers of Excellence program. This program dates back to the Department's earliest days. It was authorized in the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to be ``a coordinated, university-based system to enhance the Nation's homeland security.'' Since that time, however, we have not had a comprehensive review of the Department's management of this vital research and development program. H.R. 2390 marks the most significant effort to assess the Centers of Excellence program to date. The measure directs the Government Accountability Office to issue a comprehensive report that, among other things, evaluates how the Department aligns decisions about establishing, maintaining, or eliminating a center with its research needs; how DHS identifies, prioritizes, and funds projects; and how DHS measures progress on its research goals. The bill also directs GAO to examine how DHS promotes collaboration among the centers, as well as with institutions outside of the network, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other minority-serving institutions. I have the privilege of representing Jackson State University, which is part of the Department's Coastal Resilience Center of Excellence program. I am proud that in its capacity, Jackson State has contributed research and modeling that informed realtime operational decisions at the Coast Guard and FEMA in the wake of Hurricane Sandy and other disasters. I know that throughout this country, there are other institutions that could benefit from and bring unique knowledge and expertise to DHS' ten standing Centers of Excellence. Mr. Speaker, the Homeland Security Committee has been involved in vigorous oversight of the Centers of Excellence, particularly encouraging the Department to adopt policies that help diversify university and student participation in the homeland security enterprise. In my opinion, the DHS Science and Technology Directorate's robust outreach effort to universities and institutions of recent years is that direct result of our oversight, but we need to understand whether S&T's outreach, along with its effort to better manage the Centers of Excellence, are really working. H.R. 2390 is an important first step in effectively assessing the value of the Centers of Excellence and evaluating whether or not the research and development potential of our Nation's universities are being effectively leveraged. Mr. Speaker, again, I am grateful for the cooperation of the subcommittee chairman, Mr. Ratcliffe, and the full committee chairman, Mr. McCaul, for their help to improve the Department's Centers of Excellence; and I urge passage of this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson for their leadership on this bill. I, once again, urge my colleagues to support this bill. It is a strong bipartisan piece of legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2390 ``Homeland Security University-based Centers Review Act.'' I support this bipartisan legislation which requires an annual report be sent to Congress to assess the university-based centers for homeland security program and provide recommendations for appropriate improvements. Mr. Speaker, the research that our designated institutions conduct is imperative to the current progress and future success of protecting our nation's greatest asset, the American people. I join my colleagues in working to safeguard our investment by requiting annual reports that give detailed reviews of how our funding is being spent and more effective ways we can use the information yielded from these studies in a real world applicable way. This bill requires a review of the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) efforts to identify key areas of study needed to support the homeland security mission, and criteria that the Department utilized to determine those key areas for which the Department should maintain, establish, or eliminate university-based centers. DHS's mission is to ensure a homeland that is safe, secure, and resilient against terrorism and other hazards. H.R. 2390 supports that mission by overseeing the funding of a university-based research program that invests in the homeland security, science and technology of the DHS. It is imperative that we have oversight of how the funds are being used to meet DHS's university program criteria and this bill requires a review of how university-based research is identified, prioritized, and funded. The Centers of Excellence (COE) network is an extended consortium of hundreds of universities conducting groundbreaking research to address homeland security challenges. Sponsored by the Office of University Programs, the COEs work closely with the homeland security community to develop customer-driven, innovative tools and technologies to solve real-world challenges. The Institute for Infectious Animal Diseases (IIAD) and Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station, have used this program to develop a mobile Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (CVI) application to support veterinary practitioners submitting animal health certificate records from the field. This real-time information sharing is an alternative to email or web- based systems, and helps improve communication between veterinarians and state animal health offices by supporting certificate submission from the field. The Homeland Security University-based Centers Review Act requires a review of the Department of Homeland Security's criteria and metrics to measure demonstrable progress achieved by university-based centers in fulfilling Department taskings, and mechanisms for delivering and disseminating the research results of designated university-based centers within the Department and to other Federal, State, and local agencies. Mr. Speaker, because these funds are used to enrich our future generations of leaders and [[Page H4576]] it is important that the different university-based centers reach out and collaborate among a diverse array of academic institutions, particularly with historically Black colleges and universities (HBCU) and minority serving institutions. I applaud Rankin Member Thompson for including specific language that reaches out to diverse universities, specifically often overshadowed historically Black colleges and universities. HBCU such as Texas Southern University, in my Congressional district, is preparing technically savvy Homeland Security professionals for Maritime Transportation Security. All educational institutions who meet criteria should be eligible to participate in the Department of Homeland Security's University Program. This bill supports the program's mission needs of building a stable community of homeland security researchers and educators at U.S. colleges and universities. Fostering a homeland security culture within the academic community through research and educational programs is a great partnership between government and our education institutions. Strengthening U.S. scientific leadership in homeland security research and education giving our students a competitive ranking on a global level. Generating and disseminating knowledge and technical advances to advance the homeland security mission helps to recruit future partners and participants. Integrating homeland security activities across agencies engaged in relevant academic research will help partners work in concert to develop critical technologies and analyses to secure the nation's security interest. The Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Centers of Excellence develop multidisciplinary, customer-driven, homeland security science and technology solutions and help train the next generation of homeland security experts. The Homeland Security University-based Centers Review Act regulates the institutions designated with this distinguished honor of training the next generation of leaders in the scientific and technological fields. Raising the visibility and status of the government sponsored programs creates an environment where each institution has to take responsibility for the use of their funds and prove those uses furthered the mission needs of DHS. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this bipartisan bill and strongly urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2390. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2390, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [House] [Pages H4574-H4576] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HOMELAND SECURITY UNIVERSITY-BASED CENTERS REVIEW ACT Mr. RATCLIFFE.

Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.R. 2390, the ``Homeland Security University-based Centers Review Act,'' which your Committee reported on May 20, 2015. H.R. 2390 contains provisions within the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology's Rule X jurisdiction. As a result of your having consulted with the Committee and in order to expedite this bill for floor consideration, the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology will forego action on the bill. This is being done on the basis of our mutual understanding that doing so will in no way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology with respect to the appointment of conferees, or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation. I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming this understanding, and would request that you include a copy of this letter and your response in the Committee Report and in the Congressional Record during the floor consideration of this bill. Thank you in advance for your cooperation. Sincerely, Lamar Smith, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC, June 17, 2015. Hon. Lamar Smith, Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Smith: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 2390, the ``Homeland Security University-based Centers Review Act.'' I appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology will forego further action on the bill. The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual understanding that by foregoing further action on this bill at this time, the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology represented on the conference committee. I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, Michael T. McCaul, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2390, the Homeland Security University-based Centers Review Act. I introduced H.R. 2390, the Homeland Security University-based Centers Review Act, with my colleague Mr. Richmond, to provide Congress with the full picture of the Department's management of the Centers of Excellence program. This program dates back to the Department's earliest days. It was authorized in the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to be ``a coordinated, university-based system to enhance the Nation's homeland security.'' Since that time, however, we have not had a comprehensive review of the Department's management of this vital research and development program. H.R. 2390 marks the most significant effort to assess the Centers of Excellence program to date. The measure directs the Government Accountability Office to issue a comprehensive report that, among other things, evaluates how the Department aligns decisions about establishing, maintaining, or eliminating a center with its research needs; how DHS identifies, prioritizes, and funds projects; and how DHS measures progress on its research goals. The bill also directs GAO to examine how DHS promotes collaboration among the centers, as well as with institutions outside of the network, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other minority-serving institutions. I have the privilege of representing Jackson State University, which is part of the Department's Coastal Resilience Center of Excellence program. I am proud that in its capacity, Jackson State has contributed research and modeling that informed realtime operational decisions at the Coast Guard and FEMA in the wake of Hurricane Sandy and other disasters. I know that throughout this country, there are other institutions that could benefit from and bring unique knowledge and expertise to DHS' ten standing Centers of Excellence. Mr. Speaker, the Homeland Security Committee has been involved in vigorous oversight of the Centers of Excellence, particularly encouraging the Department to adopt policies that help diversify university and student participation in the homeland security enterprise. In my opinion, the DHS Science and Technology Directorate's robust outreach effort to universities and institutions of recent years is that direct result of our oversight, but we need to understand whether S&T's outreach, along with its effort to better manage the Centers of Excellence, are really working. H.R. 2390 is an important first step in effectively assessing the value of the Centers of Excellence and evaluating whether or not the research and development potential of our Nation's universities are being effectively leveraged. Mr. Speaker, again, I am grateful for the cooperation of the subcommittee chairman, Mr. Ratcliffe, and the full committee chairman, Mr. McCaul, for their help to improve the Department's Centers of Excellence; and I urge passage of this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson for their leadership on this bill. I, once again, urge my colleagues to support this bill. It is a strong bipartisan piece of legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE.

conference committee. i will insert copies of this exchange in the congressional record during consideration of this bill on the house floor. i thank you for your cooperation in this matter. sincerely, michael t. mccaul, chairman, committee on homeland security. mr. thompson of mississippi. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of h.r. 2390, the homeland security university-based centers review act. i introduced h.r. 2390, the homeland security university-based centers review act, with my colleague mr. richmond, to provide congress with the full picture of the department's management of the centers of excellence program. this program dates back to the department's earliest days. it was authorized in the homeland security act of 2002 to be ``a coordinated, university-based system to enhance the nation's homeland security.'' since that time, however, we have not had a comprehensive review of the department's management of this vital research and development program. h.r. 2390 marks the most significant effort to assess the centers of excellence program to date. the measure directs the government accountability office to issue a comprehensive report that, among other things, evaluates how the department aligns decisions about establishing, maintaining, or eliminating a center with its research needs; how dhs identifies, prioritizes, and funds projects; and how dhs measures progress on its research goals. the bill also directs gao to examine how dhs promotes collaboration among the centers, as well as with institutions outside of the network, including historically black colleges and universities and other minority-serving institutions. i have the privilege of representing jackson state university, which is part of the department's coastal resilience center of excellence program. i am proud that in its capacity, jackson state has contributed research and modeling that informed realtime operational decisions at the coast guard and fema in the wake of hurricane sandy and other disasters. i know that throughout this country, there are other institutions that could benefit from and bring unique knowledge and expertise to dhs' ten standing centers of excellence. mr. speaker, the homeland security committee has been involved in vigorous oversight of the centers of excellence, particularly encouraging the department to adopt policies that help diversify university and student participation in the homeland security enterprise. in my opinion, the dhs science and technology directorate's robust outreach effort to universities and institutions of recent years is that direct result of our oversight, but we need to understand whether s&t's outreach, along with its effort to better manage the centers of excellence, are really working. h.r. 2390 is an important first step in effectively assessing the value of the centers of excellence and evaluating whether or not the research and development potential of our nation's universities are being effectively leveraged. mr. speaker, again, i am grateful for the cooperation of the subcommittee chairman, mr. ratcliffe, and the full committee chairman, mr. mccaul, for their help to improve the department's centers of excellence; and i urge passage of this legislation. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. ratcliffe. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. mr. speaker, i thank chairman mccaul and ranking member thompson for their leadership on this bill. i, once again, urge my colleagues to support this bill. it is a strong bipartisan piece of legislation. i yield back the balance of my time. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, as a senior member of the homeland security committee, i rise in strong support of h.r. 2390 ``homeland security university-based centers review act.'' i support this bipartisan legislation which requires an annual report be sent to congress to assess the university-based centers for homeland security program and provide recommendations for appropriate improvements. mr. speaker, the research that our designated institutions conduct is imperative to the current progress and future success of protecting our nation's greatest asset, the american people. i join my colleagues in working to safeguard our investment by requiting annual reports that give detailed reviews of how our funding is being spent and more effective ways we can use the information yielded from these studies in a real world applicable way. this bill requires a review of the department of homeland security's (dhs) efforts to identify key areas of study needed to support the homeland security mission, and criteria that the department utilized to determine those key areas for which the department should maintain, establish, or eliminate university-based centers. dhs's mission is to ensure a homeland that is safe, secure, and resilient against terrorism and other hazards. h.r. 2390 supports that mission by overseeing the funding of a university-based research program that invests in the homeland security, science and technology of the dhs. it is imperative that we have oversight of how the funds are being used to meet dhs's university program criteria and this bill requires a review of how university-based research is identified, prioritized, and funded. the centers of excellence (coe) network is an extended consortium of hundreds of universities conducting groundbreaking research to address homeland security challenges. sponsored by the office of university programs, the coes work closely with the homeland security community to develop customer-driven, innovative tools and technologies to solve real-world challenges. the institute for infectious animal diseases (iiad) and texas a&m engineering experiment station, have used this program to develop a mobile certificate of veterinary inspection (cvi) application to support veterinary practitioners submitting animal health certificate records from the field. this real-time information sharing is an alternative to email or web- based systems, and helps improve communication between veterinarians and state animal health offices by supporting certificate submission from the field. the homeland security university-based centers review act requires a review of the department of homeland security's criteria and metrics to measure demonstrable progress achieved by university-based centers in fulfilling department taskings, and mechanisms for delivering and disseminating the research results of designated university-based centers within the department and to other federal, state, and local agencies. mr. speaker, because these funds are used to enrich our future generations of leaders and [[page h4576]] it is important that the different university-based centers reach out and collaborate among a diverse array of academic institutions, particularly with historically black colleges and universities (hbcu) and minority serving institutions. i applaud rankin member thompson for including specific language that reaches out to diverse universities, specifically often overshadowed historically black colleges and universities. hbcu such as texas southern university, in my congressional district, is preparing technically savvy homeland security professionals for maritime transportation security. all educational institutions who meet criteria should be eligible to participate in the department of homeland security's university program. this bill supports the program's mission needs of building a stable community of homeland security researchers and educators at u.s. colleges and universities. fostering a homeland security culture within the academic community through research and educational programs is a great partnership between government and our education institutions. strengthening u.s. scientific leadership in homeland security research and education giving our students a competitive ranking on a global level. generating and disseminating knowledge and technical advances to advance the homeland security mission helps to recruit future partners and participants. integrating homeland security activities across agencies engaged in relevant academic research will help partners work in concert to develop critical technologies and analyses to secure the nation's security interest. the department of homeland security's science and technology centers of excellence develop multidisciplinary, customer-driven, homeland security science and technology solutions and help train the next generation of homeland security experts. the homeland security university-based centers review act regulates the institutions designated with this distinguished honor of training the next generation of leaders in the scientific and technological fields. raising the visibility and status of the government sponsored programs creates an environment where each institution has to take responsibility for the use of their funds and prove those uses furthered the mission needs of dhs. mr. speaker, i am proud to support this

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona. General Leave Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. [[Page H4577]] The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Arizona? There was no objection. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I rise today in support of H.R. 2200, the CBRN Intelligence and Information Sharing Act of 2015. We know that terrorists have long strived to employ chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear--or CBRN--materials in their attacks. ISIS and other terror organizations have attempted to use chemical weapons, and experts suggest that terrorist interest in utilizing chemical agents has increased. In fact, reports indicate that ISIS may be currently using chemical weapons in Syria and Iraq. Since the procedures and equipment required to develop biological weapons are the same as those used for legitimate research purposes and are readily available, it is imperative that intelligence information related to bio threats is appropriately analyzed and shared with those who would be on the front lines of response in the event of a biological attack. Furthermore, events such as the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 illustrated the need for better information sharing between Federal and local officials. H.R. 2200 will enhance intelligence analysis and information sharing to fill this need and will work to ensure that State and local officials get the actionable intelligence information necessary to stop or mitigate a CBRN attack. This legislation considers information garnered from the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications hearings on the threat of chemical and biological terrorism. During two hearings earlier this year, we heard from numerous stakeholders that information sharing with appropriate State and local officials and emergency response providers about these threats is critical. Specifically, this budget neutral bill requires the Office of Intelligence and Analysis at DHS to support homeland security focused intelligence analysis of CBRN threats, including emerging infectious diseases, working in coordination with the Department's National Biosurveillance Integration Center and the intelligence community. As information and intelligence is only useful if it is shared with those who can take action, such as State, local, tribal, and private entities, H.R. 2200 directs the Office of Intelligence and Analysis to not only share information with these partners, but also engage with them and get their feedback on mechanisms for two-way sharing of information. Finally, H.R. 2200 directs the Secretary of DHS to report annually for 5 years on the Department's intelligence and information sharing activities to counter the threat from weapons of mass destruction and DHS's activities in accordance with relevant intelligence strategies. The House passed nearly identical bills during the 112th and 113th Congresses with bipartisan support. I urge Members to join me in supporting this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H.R. 2200, the CBRN Intelligence and Information Sharing Act. Mr. Speaker, in the years following the September 11 attacks, Congress worked to address many of the preparedness gaps identified by the 9/11 Commission, including the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction. Pursuant to the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, Congress established the Weapons of Mass Destruction, or WMD Commission. In 2008, the WMD Commission issued a series of recommendations to counter the proliferation of WMDs and build a more robust national capability to respond to such attacks. {time} 1715 Subsequently, the WMD Commission and its legacy organization, the WMD Center, issued a series of report cards evaluating the Federal Government's progress in implementing the WMD Commission's recommendations. Unfortunately, each report card found that the Federal Government was not acting quickly enough. In the years since the WMD Center issued its final bio-response report card in 2011, WMD threats have continued to evolve. What we know now is that the threats posed by WMDs are more dynamic and that our enemies are growing more agile. H.R. 2200 focuses on an important aspect of our Nation's ability to prevent, to prepare for, and to respond to a WMD attack--information sharing. At the full committee and subcommittee levels, the Committee on Homeland Security has devoted significant time and resources to assessing Federal activities to address the threat of WMDs. I have heard one message consistently from the witnesses who have come before us: we need to improve coordination and information sharing with State and local governments and emergency responders. Situational awareness is essential to ensuring a robust response to a CBRN incident and to saving lives; and I appreciate Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications Subcommittee Chairwoman McSally's efforts to improve CBRN threat-related intelligence and information sharing. If we learned anything from the 9/11 attacks, it is that information sharing saves lives. From putting desperate pieces of information together, to stopping an attack, to ensuring that first responders are equipped to respond safely and effectively, information sharing plays an essential role in complete situational awareness. H.R. 2200 will improve the way we use information related to evolving threats posed by chemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological agents. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2200. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I, once again, urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation that will enhance the sharing of CBRN-related threat information. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2200, the CBRN Intelligence and Information Sharing Act of 2015. I would like to begin by thanking my colleague, Martha McSally, for her work on this important bill. This bipartisan piece of legislation would direct the Department of Homeland Security to analyze terrorist intentions with respect to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear material, and share this information with state, local and federal entities. The bill includes my amendment, which was accepted in Committee, to require DHS to assess the specific risks presented by transporting these materials, addressing a key concern in Western New York. The Department of Energy plans to begin shipping highly-enriched uranium liquid from Canada to South Carolina next year. This material, which is far more radioactive than spent nuclear fuel, would be shipped in casks that have never been certified to carry highly-enriched uranium liquid. The Department proposes to transport this waste across the Northern Border at the Peace Bridge, the second busiest crossing for cargo and the busiest crossing for passengers on the Northern Border. The Peace Bridge crosses the Niagara River which connects two Great Lakes, the contamination of which could endanger the world's largest fresh water supply. The nuclear casks would then proceed from the Peace Bridge through downtown Buffalo, a high-density urban area. The Department of Energy approved this route nearly twenty years ago, and it reflects the pre-nine-eleven mindset on the threat and consequences of terrorism. The legislation before us today would allow the Department of Energy to reconsider the wisdom of transporting dangerously radioactive material through high-risk areas like Buffalo. Again, I want to thank my colleague, Martha McSally, for her work and leadership on this issue and urge passage of this bill. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2200, the ``CBRN Intelligence and Information Sharing Act of 2015.'' I support this bipartisan legislation which amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the Office of Intelligence and Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to: (1) support homeland security-focused intelligence analysis of terrorist actors, their claims, and their plans to conduct attacks involving chemical, biological, radiological, and [[Page H4578]] nuclear materials against the nation and of global infectious disease, public health, food, agricultural, and veterinary issues; (2) support homeland security-focused risk analysis and risk assessments of such homeland security hazards by providing relevant quantitative and no quantitative threat information; (3) leverage homeland security intelligence capabilities and structures to enhance prevention, protection, response, and recovery efforts with respect to a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear attack; and (4) share information and provide tailored analytical support on these threats to state, local, and tribal authorities as well as other national biosecurity and biodefense stakeholders. I am pleased that H.R. 2200 incorporates an amendment by Congresswoman McSally that directs the department to establish chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) intelligence and information sharing functions of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security and to require dissemination of information analyzed by the Department to entities with responsibilities relating to homeland security. The Nation's chemical facilities represent a terrorist target that must be protected. It is my hope that this bill will improve upon current legislation authorizing the Department of Homeland Security to regulate security practices at the Nation's chemical facilities. Mr. Speaker, it is clear that we must equip ourselves to be able to detect attacks of a CBRN nature. H.R. 2200 ensures a standardized communication platform for need to know industries dealing with such sensitive information. There is no room for error when it comes to our nation's security. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting to pass, H.R. 2200, the ``CBRN Intelligence and Information Sharing Act of 2015.'' The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2200, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [House] [Pages H4576-H4578] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CBRN INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION SHARING ACT OF 2015 Ms. McSALLY.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona. General Leave Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. [[Page H4577]] The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Arizona? There was no objection. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, as the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I rise today in support of H.R. 2200, the CBRN Intelligence and Information Sharing Act of 2015. We know that terrorists have long strived to employ chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear--or CBRN--materials in their attacks. ISIS and other terror organizations have attempted to use chemical weapons, and experts suggest that terrorist interest in utilizing chemical agents has increased. In fact, reports indicate that ISIS may be currently using chemical weapons in Syria and Iraq. Since the procedures and equipment required to develop biological weapons are the same as those used for legitimate research purposes and are readily available, it is imperative that intelligence information related to bio threats is appropriately analyzed and shared with those who would be on the front lines of response in the event of a biological attack. Furthermore, events such as the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 illustrated the need for better information sharing between Federal and local officials. H.R. 2200 will enhance intelligence analysis and information sharing to fill this need and will work to ensure that State and local officials get the actionable intelligence information necessary to stop or mitigate a CBRN attack. This legislation considers information garnered from the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications hearings on the threat of chemical and biological terrorism. During two hearings earlier this year, we heard from numerous stakeholders that information sharing with appropriate State and local officials and emergency response providers about these threats is critical. Specifically, this budget neutral bill requires the Office of Intelligence and Analysis at DHS to support homeland security focused intelligence analysis of CBRN threats, including emerging infectious diseases, working in coordination with the Department's National Biosurveillance Integration Center and the intelligence community. As information and intelligence is only useful if it is shared with those who can take action, such as State, local, tribal, and private entities, H.R. 2200 directs the Office of Intelligence and Analysis to not only share information with these partners, but also engage with them and get their feedback on mechanisms for two-way sharing of information. Finally, H.R. 2200 directs the Secretary of DHS to report annually for 5 years on the Department's intelligence and information sharing activities to counter the threat from weapons of mass destruction and DHS's activities in accordance with relevant intelligence strategies. The House passed nearly identical bills during the 112th and 113th Congresses with bipartisan support. I urge Members to join me in supporting this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H.R. 2200, the CBRN Intelligence and Information Sharing Act. Mr. Speaker, in the years following the September 11 attacks, Congress worked to address many of the preparedness gaps identified by the 9/11 Commission, including the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction. Pursuant to the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, Congress established the Weapons of Mass Destruction, or WMD Commission. In 2008, the WMD Commission issued a series of recommendations to counter the proliferation of WMDs and build a more robust national capability to respond to such attacks. {time} 1715 Subsequently, the WMD Commission and its legacy organization, the WMD Center, issued a series of report cards evaluating the Federal Government's progress in implementing the WMD Commission's recommendations. Unfortunately, each report card found that the Federal Government was not acting quickly enough. In the years since the WMD Center issued its final bio-response report card in 2011, WMD threats have continued to evolve. What we know now is that the threats posed by WMDs are more dynamic and that our enemies are growing more agile. H.R. 2200 focuses on an important aspect of our Nation's ability to prevent, to prepare for, and to respond to a WMD attack--information sharing. At the full committee and subcommittee levels, the Committee on Homeland Security has devoted significant time and resources to assessing Federal activities to address the threat of WMDs. I have heard one message consistently from the witnesses who have come before us: we need to improve coordination and information sharing with State and local governments and emergency responders. Situational awareness is essential to ensuring a robust response to a CBRN incident and to saving lives; and I appreciate Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications Subcommittee Chairwoman McSally's efforts to improve CBRN threat-related intelligence and information sharing. If we learned anything from the 9/11 attacks, it is that information sharing saves lives. From putting desperate pieces of information together, to stopping an attack, to ensuring that first responders are equipped to respond safely and effectively, information sharing plays an essential role in complete situational awareness. H.R. 2200 will improve the way we use information related to evolving threats posed by chemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological agents. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2200. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I, once again, urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation that will enhance the sharing of CBRN-related threat information. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2200, the CBRN Intelligence and Information Sharing Act of 2015. I would like to begin by thanking my colleague, Martha McSally, for her work on this important bill. This bipartisan piece of legislation would direct the Department of Homeland Security to analyze terrorist intentions with respect to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear material, and share this information with state, local and federal entities. The bill includes my amendment, which was accepted in Committee, to require DHS to assess the specific risks presented by transporting these materials, addressing a key concern in Western New York. The Department of Energy plans to begin shipping highly-enriched uranium liquid from Canada to South Carolina next year. This material, which is far more radioactive than spent nuclear fuel, would be shipped in casks that have never been certified to carry highly-enriched uranium liquid. The Department proposes to transport this waste across the Northern Border at the Peace Bridge, the second busiest crossing for cargo and the busiest crossing for passengers on the Northern Border. The Peace Bridge crosses the Niagara River which connects two Great Lakes, the contamination of which could endanger the world's largest fresh water supply. The nuclear casks would then proceed from the Peace Bridge through downtown Buffalo, a high-density urban area. The Department of Energy approved this route nearly twenty years ago, and it reflects the pre-nine-eleven mindset on the threat and consequences of terrorism. The legislation before us today would allow the Department of Energy to reconsider the wisdom of transporting dangerously radioactive material through high-risk areas like Buffalo. Again, I want to thank my colleague, Martha McSally, for her work and leadership on this issue and urge passage of this bill. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2200, the ``CBRN Intelligence and Information Sharing Act of 2015.'' I support this bipartisan legislation which amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the Office of Intelligence and Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to: (1) support homeland security-focused intelligence analysis of terrorist actors, their claims, and their plans to conduct attacks involving chemical, biological, radiological, and [[Page H4578]] nuclear materials against the nation and of global infectious disease, public health, food, agricultural, and veterinary issues; (2) support homeland security-focused risk analysis and risk assessments of such homeland security hazards by providing relevant quantitative and no quantitative threat information; (3) leverage homeland security intelligence capabilities and structures to enhance prevention, protection, response, and recovery efforts with respect to a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear attack; and (4) share information and provide tailored analytical support on these threats to state, local, and tribal authorities as well as other national biosecurity and biodefense stakeholders. I am pleased that H.R. 2200 incorporates an amendment by Congresswoman McSally that directs the department to establish chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) intelligence and information sharing functions of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security and to require dissemination of information analyzed by the Department to entities with responsibilities relating to homeland security. The Nation's chemical facilities represent a terrorist target that must be protected. It is my hope that this bill will improve upon current legislation authorizing the Department of Homeland Security to regulate security practices at the Nation's chemical facilities. Mr. Speaker, it is clear that we must equip ourselves to be able to detect attacks of a CBRN nature. H.R. 2200 ensures a standardized communication platform for need to know industries dealing with such sensitive information. There is no room for error when it comes to our nation's security. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting to pass, H.R. 2200, the ``CBRN Intelligence and Information Sharing Act of 2015.'' The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2200, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [House] [Pages H4576-H4578] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CBRN INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION SHARING ACT OF 2015 Ms. McSALLY.

[[page h4577]] the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from arizona? there was no objection. ms. mcsally. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, as the chairman of the committee on homeland security's subcommittee on emergency preparedness, response, and communications, i rise today in support of h.r. 2200, the cbrn intelligence and information sharing act of 2015. we know that terrorists have long strived to employ chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear--or cbrn--materials in their attacks. isis and other terror organizations have attempted to use chemical weapons, and experts suggest that terrorist interest in utilizing chemical agents has increased. in fact, reports indicate that isis may be currently using chemical weapons in syria and iraq. since the procedures and equipment required to develop biological weapons are the same as those used for legitimate research purposes and are readily available, it is imperative that intelligence information related to bio threats is appropriately analyzed and shared with those who would be on the front lines of response in the event of a biological attack. furthermore, events such as the boston marathon bombing in 2013 illustrated the need for better information sharing between federal and local officials. h.r. 2200 will enhance intelligence analysis and information sharing to fill this need and will work to ensure that state and local officials get the actionable intelligence information necessary to stop or mitigate a cbrn attack. this legislation considers information garnered from the subcommittee on emergency preparedness, response, and communications hearings on the threat of chemical and biological terrorism. during two hearings earlier this year, we heard from numerous stakeholders that information sharing with appropriate state and local officials and emergency response providers about these threats is critical. specifically, this budget neutral bill requires the office of intelligence and analysis at dhs to support homeland security focused intelligence analysis of cbrn threats, including emerging infectious diseases, working in coordination with the department's national biosurveillance integration center and the intelligence community. as information and intelligence is only useful if it is shared with those who can take action, such as state, local, tribal, and private entities, h.r. 2200 directs the office of intelligence and analysis to not only share information with these partners, but also engage with them and get their feedback on mechanisms for two-way sharing of information. finally, h.r. 2200 directs the secretary of dhs to report annually for 5 years on the department's intelligence and information sharing activities to counter the threat from weapons of mass destruction and dhs's activities in accordance with relevant intelligence strategies. the house passed nearly identical bills during the 112th and 113th congresses with bipartisan support. i urge members to join me in supporting this bill, and i reserve the balance of my time. mr. thompson of mississippi. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in strong support of h.r. 2200, the cbrn intelligence and information sharing act. mr. speaker, in the years following the september 11 attacks, congress worked to address many of the preparedness gaps identified by the 9/11 commission, including the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction. pursuant to the 9/11 commission's recommendations, congress established the weapons of mass destruction, or wmd commission. in 2008, the wmd commission issued a series of recommendations to counter the proliferation of wmds and build a more robust national capability to respond to such attacks. {time} 1715 subsequently, the wmd commission and its legacy organization, the wmd center, issued a series of report cards evaluating the federal government's progress in implementing the wmd commission's recommendations. unfortunately, each report card found that the federal government was not acting quickly enough. in the years since the wmd center issued its final bio-response report card in 2011, wmd threats have continued to evolve. what we know now is that the threats posed by wmds are more dynamic and that our enemies are growing more agile. h.r. 2200 focuses on an important aspect of our nation's ability to prevent, to prepare for, and to respond to a wmd attack--information sharing. at the full committee and subcommittee levels, the committee on homeland security has devoted significant time and resources to assessing federal activities to address the threat of wmds. i have heard one message consistently from the witnesses who have come before us: we need to improve coordination and information sharing with state and local governments and emergency responders. situational awareness is essential to ensuring a robust response to a cbrn incident and to saving lives; and i appreciate emergency preparedness, response, and communications subcommittee chairwoman mcsally's efforts to improve cbrn threat-related intelligence and information sharing. if we learned anything from the 9/11 attacks, it is that information sharing saves lives. from putting desperate pieces of information together, to stopping an attack, to ensuring that first responders are equipped to respond safely and effectively, information sharing plays an essential role in complete situational awareness. h.r. 2200 will improve the way we use information related to evolving threats posed by chemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological agents. i urge my colleagues to support h.r. 2200. i yield back the balance of my time. ms. mcsally. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i, once again, urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation that will enhance the sharing of cbrn-related threat information. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. higgins. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 2200, the cbrn intelligence and information sharing act of 2015. i would like to begin by thanking my colleague, martha mcsally, for her work on this important bill. this bipartisan piece of legislation would direct the department of homeland security to analyze terrorist intentions with respect to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear material, and share this information with state, local and federal entities. the bill includes my amendment, which was accepted in committee, to require dhs to assess the specific risks presented by transporting these materials, addressing a key concern in western new york. the department of energy plans to begin shipping highly-enriched uranium liquid from canada to south carolina next year. this material, which is far more radioactive than spent nuclear fuel, would be shipped in casks that have never been certified to carry highly-enriched uranium liquid. the department proposes to transport this waste across the northern border at the peace bridge, the second busiest crossing for cargo and the busiest crossing for passengers on the northern border. the peace bridge crosses the niagara river which connects two great lakes, the contamination of which could endanger the world's largest fresh water supply. the nuclear casks would then proceed from the peace bridge through downtown buffalo, a high-density urban area. the department of energy approved this route nearly twenty years ago, and it reflects the pre-nine-eleven mindset on the threat and consequences of terrorism. the legislation before us today would allow the department of energy to reconsider the wisdom of transporting dangerously radioactive material through high-risk areas like buffalo. again, i want to thank my colleague, martha mcsally, for her work and leadership on this issue and urge passage of this bill. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, as a senior member of the homeland security committee, i rise in strong support of h.r. 2200, the ``cbrn intelligence and information sharing act of 2015.'' i support this bipartisan legislation which amends the homeland security act of 2002 to direct the office of intelligence and analysis of the department of homeland security (dhs) to: (1) support homeland security-focused intelligence analysis of terrorist actors, their claims, and their plans to conduct attacks involving chemical, biological, radiological, and [[page h4578]] nuclear materials against the nation and of global infectious disease, public health, food, agricultural, and veterinary issues; (2) support homeland security-focused risk analysis and risk assessments of such homeland security hazards by providing relevant quantitative and no quantitative threat information; (3) leverage homeland security intelligence capabilities and structures to enhance prevention, protection, response, and recovery efforts with respect to a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear attack; and (4) share information and provide tailored analytical support on these threats to state, local, and tribal authorities as well as other national biosecurity and biodefense stakeholders. i am pleased that h.r. 2200 incorporates an amendment by congresswoman mcsally that directs the department to establish chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (cbrn) intelligence and information sharing functions of the office of intelligence and analysis of the department of homeland security and to require dissemination of information analyzed by the department to entities with responsibilities relating to homeland security. the nation's chemical facilities represent a terrorist target that must be protected. it is my hope that this bill will improve upon current legislation authorizing the department of homeland security to regulate security practices at the nation's chemical facilities. mr. speaker, it is clear that we must equip ourselves to be able to detect attacks of a cbrn nature. h.r. 2200 ensures a standardized communication platform for need to know industries dealing with such sensitive information. there is no room for error when it comes to our nation's security. i urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting to pass, h.r. 2200, the ``cbrn intelligence and information sharing act of 2015.'' the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from arizona (ms. mcsally) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 2200, as amended. the question was taken. the speaker pro tempore. in the opinion of the chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. mr. thompson of mississippi. mr. speaker, on that i demand

CREC-2015-06-23-pt1-PgH4578,CREC-2015-06-23,114,DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY INTEROPERABLE COMMUNICATIONS ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [House] [Pages H4578-H4579] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY INTEROPERABLE COMMUNICATIONS ACT Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 615) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Under Secretary for Management of the Department of Homeland Security to take administrative action to achieve and maintain interoperable communications capabilities among the components of the Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the Senate amendment is as follows: Senate amendment: Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert: SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Homeland Security Interoperable Communications Act'' or the ``DHS Interoperable Communications Act''. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona. General Leave Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Arizona? There was no objection. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. As the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I rise today in support of H.R. 615, the Department of Homeland Security Interoperable Communications Act, of which I am proud [[Page H4579]] to be a cosponsor. This bill was introduced by the gentleman from New Jersey, the subcommittee's ranking member, Mr. Payne. The bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to include, among the responsibilities of the Department of Homeland Security's Under Secretary for Management, achieving and maintaining interoperable communications among the Department's components. H.R. 615 addresses the findings and recommendations of a November 2012 DHS Office of Inspector General report, which stated that the Department does not have the appropriate oversight or governance structure to ensure communications interoperability among its components. It is vital that the Department's components are able to effectively communicate day to day and, most importantly, during emergencies. In response to the findings of this inspector general's report, I joined Chairman McCaul and Oversight and Management Efficiency Subcommittee Chairman Perry in requesting a review of this issue by the Government Accountability Office. Their report, which was released in March, found that nearly 3 years after the inspector general's report, communications problems persist in the Department and among its components. In particular, Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel reported to the GAO that the lack of interoperability in some cases along the border resulted in missed apprehensions and jeopardized agent safety. My district is on the southwest border. I know the challenges our Border Patrol agents, CBP officers, and ICE agents face in meeting their vital missions. It is unacceptable that they lack the tools and training necessary to communicate with each other. This bill seeks to make this more of a priority at the headquarters level. In order to ensure the Department is taking the necessary steps to achieve and maintain interoperable communications capabilities, H.R. 615 requires the Department's Under Secretary for Management to submit an interoperable communications strategy to the Committee on Homeland Security no later than 180 days after enactment and to periodically report to Congress on efforts to implement this strategy. This bill passed the House in February by a vote of 379-0. I appreciate the swift action of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee under the leadership of my friend, Chairman Johnson. Their thoughtful additions have served to further improve this bill. I urge all Members to join me in supporting it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of the Senate amendment to H.R. 615, the Department of Homeland Security Interoperable Communications Act. In November 2012, the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security issued an assessment of the interoperable communications capability among DHS components. The inspector general found that, of the 479 field radios that attempted to communicate on a specific common channel, only one user could do so. That is a 99 percent failure rate. In short, DHS, which is the Federal entity charged with providing guidance to State and local governments to improve interoperable emergency communications, was not practicing what it preached. The inspector general found that DHS' interoperable challenges were not technological in nature. Rather, they were attributed to the fact that there was no one leading the effort to drive changes in the field. Further, there were no policies in place to ensure that the 123,000 radio users at DHS understood how to use the communications equipment issued to them. Throughout my tenure on the Committee on Homeland Security, I have repeatedly sought opportunities to drive home the message that interoperable communications are critical to the Homeland Security mission at the Federal, State, and local levels. Addressing this fundamental operational challenge is consistent with the DHS Unity of Effort initiative. So it would seem that the timing is right for real progress. However, late last month, we learned from the inspector general that, nearly 3 years after the issuance of the first report, DHS' components' inability to communicate effectively on the DHS common channel persists and that DHS has not completed the corrective actions necessary to resolve the problem. The inspector general's most recent findings confirm that it is going to take directing the Department in law to get this done. That is why I was happy to support Ranking Member Donald Payne, Jr., when he introduced this legislation. H.R. 615 would put DHS components on the path to achieving interoperable communications by directing the Department's Under Secretary for Management to develop a strategy to achieve interoperability. The taxpayers have spent $430 million on interoperable communications capabilities at the Department so far. In this austere fiscal climate, we cannot afford to waste more money investing in communications capabilities when DHS lacks the policies that are sure to be effective. With the help of full committee Chairman McCaul and subcommittee Chairwoman McSally, the Department of Homeland Security Interoperable Communications Act passed the House unanimously earlier this year. Subsequently, our Senate counterparts approved H.R. 615 by unanimous consent with some enhancements. I urge my colleagues to concur with the Senate amendment to H.R. 615 and send this bill to the President's desk. The inspector general's report identifying the urgent interoperable communications problem at DHS came out 3 years ago. A comprehensive solution is long overdue. Unfortunately, the Department has still not implemented appropriate corrective action. I commend subcommittee Ranking Member Payne for introducing this important legislation and for his efforts to get it enacted into law. I urge my colleagues to concur with the Senate amendment of H.R. 615. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I, once again, urge my colleagues to support H.R. 615, which seeks to enhance interoperable communications at the Department of Homeland Security. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) that the House suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 615. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the Senate amendment was concurred in. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [House] [Pages H4578-H4579] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY INTEROPERABLE COMMUNICATIONS ACT Ms. McSALLY.

In this austere fiscal climate, we cannot afford to waste more money investing in communications capabilities when DHS lacks the policies that are sure to be effective. With the help of full committee Chairman McCaul and subcommittee Chairwoman McSally, the Department of Homeland Security Interoperable Communications Act passed the House unanimously earlier this year. Subsequently, our Senate counterparts approved H.R. 615 by unanimous consent with some enhancements. I urge my colleagues to concur with the Senate amendment to H.R. 615 and send this bill to the President's desk. The inspector general's report identifying the urgent interoperable communications problem at DHS came out 3 years ago. A comprehensive solution is long overdue. Unfortunately, the Department has still not implemented appropriate corrective action. I commend subcommittee Ranking Member Payne for introducing this important legislation and for his efforts to get it enacted into law. I urge my colleagues to concur with the Senate amendment of H.R. 615. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I, once again, urge my colleagues to support H.R. 615, which seeks to enhance interoperable communications at the Department of Homeland Security. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) that the House suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 615. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the Senate amendment was concurred in. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [House] [Pages H4578-H4579] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY INTEROPERABLE COMMUNICATIONS ACT Ms. McSALLY.

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona. General Leave Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Arizona? There was no objection. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. As the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I rise today in support of H.R. 615, the Department of Homeland Security Interoperable Communications Act, of which I am proud [[Page H4579]] to be a cosponsor. This bill was introduced by the gentleman from New Jersey, the subcommittee's ranking member, Mr. Payne. The bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to include, among the responsibilities of the Department of Homeland Security's Under Secretary for Management, achieving and maintaining interoperable communications among the Department's components. H.R. 615 addresses the findings and recommendations of a November 2012 DHS Office of Inspector General report, which stated that the Department does not have the appropriate oversight or governance structure to ensure communications interoperability among its components. It is vital that the Department's components are able to effectively communicate day to day and, most importantly, during emergencies. In response to the findings of this inspector general's report, I joined Chairman McCaul and Oversight and Management Efficiency Subcommittee Chairman Perry in requesting a review of this issue by the Government Accountability Office. Their report, which was released in March, found that nearly 3 years after the inspector general's report, communications problems persist in the Department and among its components. In particular, Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel reported to the GAO that the lack of interoperability in some cases along the border resulted in missed apprehensions and jeopardized agent safety. My district is on the southwest border. I know the challenges our Border Patrol agents, CBP officers, and ICE agents face in meeting their vital missions. It is unacceptable that they lack the tools and training necessary to communicate with each other. This bill seeks to make this more of a priority at the headquarters level. In order to ensure the Department is taking the necessary steps to achieve and maintain interoperable communications capabilities, H.R. 615 requires the Department's Under Secretary for Management to submit an interoperable communications strategy to the Committee on Homeland Security no later than 180 days after enactment and to periodically report to Congress on efforts to implement this strategy. This bill passed the House in February by a vote of 379-0. I appreciate the swift action of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee under the leadership of my friend, Chairman Johnson. Their thoughtful additions have served to further improve this bill. I urge all Members to join me in supporting it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of the Senate amendment to H.R. 615, the Department of Homeland Security Interoperable Communications Act. In November 2012, the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security issued an assessment of the interoperable communications capability among DHS components. The inspector general found that, of the 479 field radios that attempted to communicate on a specific common channel, only one user could do so. That is a 99 percent failure rate. In short, DHS, which is the Federal entity charged with providing guidance to State and local governments to improve interoperable emergency communications, was not practicing what it preached. The inspector general found that DHS' interoperable challenges were not technological in nature. Rather, they were attributed to the fact that there was no one leading the effort to drive changes in the field. Further, there were no policies in place to ensure that the 123,000 radio users at DHS understood how to use the communications equipment issued to them. Throughout my tenure on the Committee on Homeland Security, I have repeatedly sought opportunities to drive home the message that interoperable communications are critical to the Homeland Security mission at the Federal, State, and local levels. Addressing this fundamental operational challenge is consistent with the DHS Unity of Effort initiative. So it would seem that the timing is right for real progress. However, late last month, we learned from the inspector general that, nearly 3 years after the issuance of the first report, DHS' components' inability to communicate effectively on the DHS common channel persists and that DHS has not completed the corrective actions necessary to resolve the problem. The inspector general's most recent findings confirm that it is going to take directing the Department in law to get this done. That is why I was happy to support Ranking Member Donald Payne, Jr., when he introduced this legislation. H.R. 615 would put DHS components on the path to achieving interoperable communications by directing the Department's Under Secretary for Management to develop a strategy to achieve interoperability. The taxpayers have spent $430 million on interoperable communications capabilities at the Department so far. In this austere fiscal climate, we cannot afford to waste more money investing in communications capabilities when DHS lacks the policies that are sure to be effective. With the help of full committee Chairman McCaul and subcommittee Chairwoman McSally, the Department of Homeland Security Interoperable Communications Act passed the House unanimously earlier this year.

Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Speaker, in just a moment, I will request a moment of silence, but before I do, I stand here with other Members of the South Carolina delegation to say our colleague Jim Clyburn, who right now is back home visiting with aggrieved families on the coast of South Carolina, and many of us, like Senator Scott and others, will be going back during this week to visit with those same families. I am joined as well by members of the Congressional Black Caucus and Members of this body who have been deeply shaken by the events of this last week in Charleston, South Carolina. I rise with this group on behalf of the nine families who have been impacted back home, on behalf of the people of the First District of South Carolina, and on behalf of the people of South Carolina who have shown a whole lot of heart and a whole lot of love here over the last week. I say this because, less than a week ago, as we all know, a young man with incomprehensible malice came into the Mother Emanuel AME Church on Calhoun Street in Charleston, South Carolina, and did the unthinkable as he joined a Bible study and he gunned down nine of the members, the parishioners, there in the church. Fortunately, our story doesn't end there because the family members of the victims also did the unthinkable. I say that because there, at the bond hearing, they did the unimaginable, the incomprehensible in, I guess, showing human grace is a reflection of God's grace and what is talked about in Romans in not repaying evil with evil, but repaying evil with good because, at the bond hearing, the first family comes up, and they say: ``I am in incomprehensible pain, but I forgive you.'' The next family comes up: ``I am in incredible pain, but I forgive you.'' Those were the words that were repeated by each of the nine families: ``I forgive you, I forgive you, and I forgive you.'' That set in motion and, if you will, set the stage this last week in Charleston for a level of community that I have never before seen in my life and amazing things done at the church and in the community at large. It is for that reason that we all stand here to remember the names of the nine victims and to pause for a moment of silence here in just a moment. If I might, let me read the names of the victims: Reverend Clementa Pinckney; Tywanza Sanders; Cynthia Hurd; [[Page H4581]] Reverend Sharonda Coleman-Singleton; Myra Thompson; Ethel Lance; Reverend Daniel Simmons, Sr.; Reverend Depayne Middleton-Doctor; and Susie Jackson.

Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Speaker, in just a moment, I will request a moment of silence, but before I do, I stand here with other Members of the South Carolina delegation to say our colleague Jim Clyburn, who right now is back home visiting with aggrieved families on the coast of South Carolina, and many of us, like Senator Scott and others, will be going back during this week to visit with those same families. I am joined as well by members of the Congressional Black Caucus and Members of this body who have been deeply shaken by the events of this last week in Charleston, South Carolina. I rise with this group on behalf of the nine families who have been impacted back home, on behalf of the people of the First District of South Carolina, and on behalf of the people of South Carolina who have shown a whole lot of heart and a whole lot of love here over the last week. I say this because, less than a week ago, as we all know, a young man with incomprehensible malice came into the Mother Emanuel AME Church on Calhoun Street in Charleston, South Carolina, and did the unthinkable as he joined a Bible study and he gunned down nine of the members, the parishioners, there in the church. Fortunately, our story doesn't end there because the family members of the victims also did the unthinkable. I say that because there, at the bond hearing, they did the unimaginable, the incomprehensible in, I guess, showing human grace is a reflection of God's grace and what is talked about in Romans in not repaying evil with evil, but repaying evil with good because, at the bond hearing, the first family comes up, and they say: ``I am in incomprehensible pain, but I forgive you.'' The next family comes up: ``I am in incredible pain, but I forgive you.'' Those were the words that were repeated by each of the nine families: ``I forgive you, I forgive you, and I forgive you.'' That set in motion and, if you will, set the stage this last week in Charleston for a level of community that I have never before seen in my life and amazing things done at the church and in the community at large. It is for that reason that we all stand here to remember the names of the nine victims and to pause for a moment of silence here in just a moment. If I might, let me read the names of the victims: Reverend Clementa Pinckney; Tywanza Sanders; Cynthia Hurd; [[Page H4581]] Reverend Sharonda Coleman-Singleton; Myra Thompson; Ethel Lance; Reverend Daniel Simmons, Sr.; Reverend Depayne Middleton-Doctor; and Susie Jackson.

Recently, I attended the dedication of a new Minnesota military family tribute that is now part of the Capitol Mall area in St. Paul at our State Capitol. It was built entirely with private donations. It commemorates the military Gold Star families, Blue Star families, and families of our veterans. This memorial is the first of its kind in the country, and it recognizes the military family members that do so much to support our servicemen and -women and our veterans. Being a member of a military family comes with many sacrifices. It means many sleepless nights during deployment. It means unexpected moves around the country and serving as the frontline resource when our soldiers transition into a new life. Every military family does this proudly.

Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, many of my colleagues on the House floor today may not know that June is National Dairy Month. As a dairy farmer myself, I believe this month is a perfect opportunity to recognize how important the dairy industry is to the Central Valley. Not only are there dairy farms in all 50 States, but dairy is the number one agriculture business in 10 States, including Idaho, New York, and Wisconsin. However, my home State of California is the biggest dairy producer in the country and is responsible for 21.3 percent of the U.S. milk supply. My own district, California 21, produces the most dairy of any congressional district in the Nation. However, dairy isn't just important to farmers. Not only do Americans consume at least two cups of dairy products each and every day, but America's dairy industry is important to our Nation's agriculture market and our entire economy. Dairy farms across the country improve our national economy. The U.S. dairy industry creates an estimated $140 billion in economic output, $29 billion in household earnings, and is responsible for creating more than 900,000 jobs.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) for 30 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it has been a tough week, for all Christians in the country have lost three brothers and six sisters in the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. The whole country mourns--well, probably not everybody. Evil has those who support it and wallow in it, as did the evil perpetrator of the killings. Our prayers continue to go out to the immediate family members and to the church family members for their peace and for their comfort because those of us who are believers know that those we have lost are at the foot of the Saviour in Paradise. I learned today that the President will be going to speak at the funeral. I recall a speech in Arizona, and so as I encouraged our prayer caucus tonight, we should be praying for the President to be a uniter as he speaks. I thought about the way a great President named Abraham Lincoln concluded his second inaugural address. The war was not over; there was great hatred and bitterness. Of course, he mentioned in his inaugural address--talking about North and South--both read the same Bible, both pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the other. He goes on to give what is one of the great theological treatises on the nature of God; he quotes from the Old Testament a couple of times, but with all the killing that occurred during the Civil War, he ended trying to encourage uniting. I know there are those who advise the President that he should not let a good crisis go to waste, but for many of us, the hope and prayer is that at this week's funeral, he will be a uniter. Mr. Speaker, President Lincoln closed his second inaugural with the words: ``With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the Nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.'' Mr. Speaker, that was a man who sought to unite, who knew there was a Heavenly Father to Whom we could pray and Who would answer our prayers. I hope and pray that will be the outcome at the funeral of my brothers and sisters in Charleston, South Carolina. Of course, then there is the judge side of me. Having sentenced people both to prison and to death, the judge side of me says, from what we know, it sure cries out for the death penalty, but we will let the justice system in South Carolina take care of that. In the meantime, as we think about injustice, it is also hard not to think of our friends and our allies in Israel who have trouble finding any friends. They are persecuted on every side. We got this report from the U.N., an article talking about it from Marissa Newman of The Times of Israel: ``Israel slams `politically motivated and morally flawed' U.N. Gaza report.'' The article says: ``Israel on Monday said it would `seriously' evaluate the United Nations Human Rights Council inquiry on the Gaza conflict, while politicians from left and right slammed the international body for bias and declared that the international investigators lacked access to evidence.'' The article goes on down further: `` `The report is biased,' said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in response. `Israel is not perpetrating war crimes but rather protecting itself from an organization that carries out war crimes. We won't sit back with our arms crossed as our citizens are attacked by thousands of missiles.' '' The article says: ``The Human Rights Council `in practice does everything but worry about human rights,' the prime minister charged. `The commission spends more time condemning Israel than Iran, Syria and North Korea put together.' '' It seems that these are the times that cry out for a moral, pragmatic, and unified response to the anti-Semitism that is growing-- it is just unbelievable--in Europe and in the United States colleges and universities. It is incredible. Mr. Speaker, the Bible talks about times when right will be wrong and wrong will be right; perhaps we are entering such an era. A country like Israel is under attack from virtually every front, every side; and Palestinians, radical Islamists, and Iranians declare that they will see that it is annihilated. Their leaders make statements such as ``we are glad that they are gathered in Israel so that we can annihilate them all at once,'' and the U.N. basically sees somehow level parties on the same plane: terrorists and people who promote democratic beliefs and carry them out, allow people to vote, believe [[Page H4589]] in the rights of women, and believe in equal rights. Israel is a place where Muslims can freely vote and don't have to worry about a radical Islamist killing them if he or she doesn't believe and perform exactly like their radical Islamist leader tells them to. The article says that the Israeli Foreign Ministry also castigated the U.N. Human Rights Council investigation for failing to distinguish between the Israeli military and Hamas: ``It is regrettable that the report fails to recognize the profound difference between Israel's moral behavior during Operation Protective Edge and the terror organizations it confronted.'' ``Likud minister Yuval Steinitz compared the conflict to a Palestinian suicide bomber commandeering a bus full of Palestinian civilians and ramming it into an Israeli tank. `Many Palestinian civilians would die,' he told Army Radio. `But that doesn't mean the tank is to blame.' The U.N. panel's approach was `absurd,' he said, in that it would require Israel not to fire back when terrorists fire at its civilians `because the terrorists are hiding behind their civilians.' ``Steinitz also said the U.N. Human Rights Commission's obsessive focus on Israel points to anti-Semitism. Asked whether Israel would have done better to cooperate with the panel, he said, `You can't explain to people who are not prepared to listen.' ``Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid also rejected the idea that Israel should have cooperated, saying the panel had drawn its conclusions before it even began its probe.'' It goes on to discuss the report from the so-called Human Rights Council. The United Nations Human Rights Council is an abomination. It should be an affront as it is an outrage to anyone who cares about human rights. What has happened at the United Nations? We have had so many nations join the United Nations that don't care about human rights, and they don't care about women. Of course, they are so brutal in the treatment of those who would oppose it, that apparently it scares off feminist groups who are afraid to attack those who really are inhumane in their treatment of women, enough so the feminist liberal groups are afraid to take them on. Hopefully, some day, they will gain the courage to see where women are truly being abused in horrendous ways, and they will join with some of the rest of us in trying to stop that, instead of going after Christian groups or groups who believe that everyone, once conceived, should have a right to live. Maybe if some of those groups quit attacking those who are pro-life and spent a little time attacking those who are true abusers of women, then we would find common footing, and we would be able to work better together. There is another article here from Anne Bayefsky. This one is headlined: ``U.N. report denies Israel's right of self-defense, advocates arrest of Israelis instead.'' It really is outrageous, and the United States, as has been suggested by some writers, should withdraw from participation in the Human Rights Commission. The ICC, International Criminal Court, obviously from its actions and its efforts, is quite anti-Semitic. The United States has no business supporting the efforts of those who support the effort and abuse of Israelis and the effort to eliminate them from off of the globe. Mr. Speaker, if there had been an Israel during the Holocaust, Jews would have had a place to go, and there would not have been 6 million killed in the Holocaust. This is no time for anyone who cares about world peace and the avoidance of suffering to stand up and decry Israel. This is a time to stand with Israel. Israel is an actual democratic republic in the middle of the Middle East that respects women like no nation around in the Middle East and supports the value of life and private property. How in the world are we not a better friend to them? I would like to see, as some writers have suggested, that we withdraw from anything that might lend our support to the International Criminal Court because of its anti-Semitic views. Mr. Speaker, I realized, as I was reading these articles about additional anti-Semitic efforts by the United Nations, that the U.N. has been overtaken by so many countries that don't believe in human rights for their people. {time} 2030 Many of them, they are abusive, have no problem with torturing those with whom they disagree, have no problem killing people who convert from, for example, Islamic beliefs to Christian beliefs--get the death penalty in some of these countries. You know, it is time to begin a new organization of democratic republics that respect the rights of women, men, children, and who have fair elections. Let's have an international community like that. Let's have an international group that, when it speaks, it is not with blood dripping off of the votes of its members. It would mean something. A human rights commission, for example, for a while had Libya as the head. Are you kidding me? This is outrageous. Mr. Speaker, I realized, in reviewing these articles, I have not yet filed the bill that I normally file, the U.N. Voting Accountability Act. What I have learned around this body is, if you keep filing a bill long enough, even if it requires somebody else putting their name on it to get it to the floor, you get that done; you get it passed, and you don't care who gets the credit. The U.N. Voting Accountability bill is very simple. It basically says any nation that votes against the United States more than half of the time in the preceding year would get no assistance from the United States of any kind whatsoever. As I have said for years, you don't have to pay people to hate you. They will do it for free. It is still true. It is time to leave that money here. It is time for this administration to stop sending weapons that it knows have continuously fallen in the hands of the Islamic State and made it extremely difficult for the courageous Kurdish fighters to fight and defeat the radical Islamic State. Let's start sending those weapons directly to the Kurds. Baghdad is not letting them get them. They cannot easily defeat the weapons, the up-armored vehicles, the things that we have sent that we knew ultimately were falling into Islamic State hands. As some Muslim friends, leaders in Middle Eastern states have continued to ask: Why is it that the United States administration keeps helping the Muslim Brotherhood? Don't they know that is who is at war with the United States? They ask: Why do you keep helping your enemies? It is time that we quit helping our enemies. It is time that we help those here at home. I applaud our conference passing the bills we did tonight. One is going to make it easier for seniors to get access to the health care that ObamaCare has made it very difficult for them to get, so there is some good news. Our prayers continue so that, by the end of the week, there will be even better news. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [House] [Pages H4588-H4589] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INJUSTICE AT HOME AND ABROAD The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) for 30 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it has been a tough week, for all Christians in the country have lost three brothers and six sisters in the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. The whole country mourns--well, probably not everybody. Evil has those who support it and wallow in it, as did the evil perpetrator of the killings. Our prayers continue to go out to the immediate family members and to the church family members for their peace and for their comfort because those of us who are believers know that those we have lost are at the foot of the Saviour in Paradise. I learned today that the President will be going to speak at the funeral. I recall a speech in Arizona, and so as I encouraged our prayer caucus tonight, we should be praying for the President to be a uniter as he speaks. I thought about the way a great President named Abraham Lincoln concluded his second inaugural address. The war was not over; there was great hatred and bitterness. Of course, he mentioned in his inaugural address--talking about North and South--both read the same Bible, both pray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the other. He goes on to give what is one of the great theological treatises on the nature of God; he quotes from the Old Testament a couple of times, but with all the killing that occurred during the Civil War, he ended trying to encourage uniting. I know there are those who advise the President that he should not let a good crisis go to waste, but for many of us, the hope and prayer is that at this week's funeral, he will be a uniter. Mr. Speaker, President Lincoln closed his second inaugural with the words: ``With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the Nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.'' Mr. Speaker, that was a man who sought to unite, who knew there was a Heavenly Father to Whom we could pray and Who would answer our prayers. I hope and pray that will be the outcome at the funeral of my brothers and sisters in Charleston, South Carolina. Of course, then there is the judge side of me. Having sentenced people both to prison and to death, the judge side of me says, from what we know, it sure cries out for the death penalty, but we will let the justice system in South Carolina take care of that. In the meantime, as we think about injustice, it is also hard not to think of our friends and our allies in Israel who have trouble finding any friends. They are persecuted on every side. We got this report from the U.N., an article talking about it from Marissa Newman of The Times of Israel: ``Israel slams `politically motivated and morally flawed' U.N. Gaza report.'' The article says: ``Israel on Monday said it would `seriously' evaluate the United Nations Human Rights Council inquiry on the Gaza conflict, while politicians from left and right slammed the international body for bias and declared that the international investigators lacked access to evidence.'' The article goes on down further: `` `The report is biased,' said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in response. `Israel is not perpetrating war crimes but rather protecting itself from an organization that carries out war crimes. We won't sit back with our arms crossed as our citizens are attacked by thousands of missiles.' '' The article says: ``The Human Rights Council `in practice does everything but worry about human rights,' the prime minister charged. `The commission spends more time condemning Israel than Iran, Syria and North Korea put together.' '' It seems that these are the times that cry out for a moral, pragmatic, and unified response to the anti-Semitism that is growing-- it is just unbelievable--in Europe and in the United States colleges and universities. It is incredible. Mr. Speaker, the Bible talks about times when right will be wrong and wrong will be right; perhaps we are entering such an era. A country like Israel is under attack from virtually every front, every side; and Palestinians, radical Islamists, and Iranians declare that they will see that it is annihilated. Their leaders make statements such as ``we are glad that they are gathered in Israel so that we can annihilate them all at once,'' and the U.N. basically sees somehow level parties on the same plane: terrorists and people who promote democratic beliefs and carry them out, allow people to vote, believe [[Page H4589]] in the rights of women, and believe in equal rights. Israel is a place where Muslims can freely vote and don't have to worry about a radical Islamist killing them if he or she doesn't believe and perform exactly like their radical Islamist leader tells them to. The article says that the Israeli Foreign Ministry also castigated the U.N. Human Rights Council investigation for failing to distinguish between the Israeli military and Hamas: ``It is regrettable that the report fails to recognize the profound difference between Israel's moral behavior during Operation Protective Edge and the terror organizations it confronted.'' ``Likud minister Yuval Steinitz compared the conflict to a Palestinian suicide bomber commandeering a bus full of Palestinian civilians and ramming it into an Israeli tank. `Many Palestinian civilians would die,' he told Army Radio. `But that doesn't mean the tank is to blame.' The U.N. panel's approach was `absurd,' he said, in that it would require Israel not to fire back when terrorists fire at its civilians `because the terrorists are hiding behind their civilians.' ``Steinitz also said the U.N. Human Rights Commission's obsessive focus on Israel points to anti-Semitism. Asked whether Israel would have done better to cooperate with the panel, he said, `You can't explain to people who are not prepared to listen.' ``Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid also rejected the idea that Israel should have cooperated, saying the panel had drawn its conclusions before it even began its probe.'' It goes on to discuss the report from the so-called Human Rights Council. The United Nations Human Rights Council is an abomination. It should be an affront as it is an outrage to anyone who cares about human rights. What has happened at the United Nations? We have had so many nations join the United Nations that don't care about human rights, and they don't care about women. Of course, they are so brutal in the treatment of those who would oppose it, that apparently it scares off feminist groups who are afraid to attack those who really are inhumane in their treatment of women, enough so the feminist liberal groups are afraid to take them on.

we have had so many nations join the united nations that don't care about human rights, and they don't care about women. of course, they are so brutal in the treatment of those who would oppose it, that apparently it scares off feminist groups who are afraid to attack those who really are inhumane in their treatment of women, enough so the feminist liberal groups are afraid to take them on. hopefully, some day, they will gain the courage to see where women are truly being abused in horrendous ways, and they will join with some of the rest of us in trying to stop that, instead of going after christian groups or groups who believe that everyone, once conceived, should have a right to live. maybe if some of those groups quit attacking those who are pro-life and spent a little time attacking those who are true abusers of women, then we would find common footing, and we would be able to work better together. there is another article here from anne bayefsky. this one is headlined: ``u.n. report denies israel's right of self-defense, advocates arrest of israelis instead.'' it really is outrageous, and the united states, as has been suggested by some writers, should withdraw from participation in the human rights commission. the icc, international criminal court, obviously from its actions and its efforts, is quite anti-semitic. the united states has no business supporting the efforts of those who support the effort and abuse of israelis and the effort to eliminate them from off of the globe. mr. speaker, if there had been an israel during the holocaust, jews would have had a place to go, and there would not have been 6 million killed in the holocaust. this is no time for anyone who cares about world peace and the avoidance of suffering to stand up and decry israel. this is a time to stand with israel. israel is an actual democratic republic in the middle of the middle east that respects women like no nation around in the middle east and supports the value of life and private property. how in the world are we not a better friend to them? i would like to see, as some writers have suggested, that we withdraw from anything that might lend our support to the international criminal court because of its anti-semitic views. mr. speaker, i realized, as i was reading these articles about additional anti-semitic efforts by the united nations, that the u.n. has been overtaken by so many countries that don't believe in human rights for their people. {time} 2030 many of them, they are abusive, have no problem with torturing those with whom they disagree, have no problem killing people who convert from, for example, islamic beliefs to christian beliefs--get the death penalty in some of these countries. you know, it is time to begin a new organization of democratic republics that respect the rights of women, men, children, and who have fair elections. let's have an international community like that. let's have an international group that, when it speaks, it is not with blood dripping off of the votes of its members. it would mean something. a human rights commission, for example, for a while had libya as the head. are you kidding me? this is outrageous. mr. speaker, i realized, in reviewing these articles, i have not yet filed the bill that i normally file, the u.n. voting accountability act. what i have learned around this body is, if you keep filing a bill long enough, even if it requires somebody else putting their name on it to get it to the floor, you get that done; you get it passed, and you don't care who gets the credit. the u.n. voting accountability bill is very simple. it basically says any nation that votes against the united states more than half of the time in the preceding year would get no assistance from the united states of any kind whatsoever. as i have said for years, you don't have to pay people to hate you. they will do it for free. it is still true. it is time to leave that money here. it is time for this administration to stop sending weapons that it knows have continuously fallen in the hands of the islamic state and made it extremely difficult for the courageous kurdish fighters to fight and defeat the radical islamic state. let's start sending those weapons directly to the kurds. baghdad is not letting them get them. they cannot easily defeat the weapons, the up-armored vehicles, the things that we have sent that we knew ultimately were falling into islamic state hands. as some muslim friends, leaders in middle eastern states have continued to ask: why is it that the united states administration keeps helping the muslim brotherhood? don't they know that is who is at war with the united states? they ask: why do you keep helping your enemies? it is time that we quit helping our enemies. it is time that we help those here at home. i applaud our conference passing the bills we did tonight. one is going to make it easier for seniors to get access to the health care that obamacare has made it very difficult for them to get, so there is some good news. our prayers continue so that, by the end of the week, there will be even better news. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",12020
CREC-2015-06-23-pt1-PgH4584-2,CREC-2015-06-23,114,CALIFORNIA DROUGHT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [House] [Pages H4584-H4588] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CALIFORNIA DROUGHT The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on the subject of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I am not at all sure it is going to be that controversial, but I was just looking outside the Capitol before I came in to make this presentation, and it is raining. It is a downpour. For those of us from California, it has been a long time since we have seen a downpour. The Golden State, the seventh largest economy in the world and home to over 35 million people, is in the throes of a historic drought. This is the fourth year, and it is a world of hurt in California. The economy is moving along. We are not complaining about the economy. Many parts of it are moving along. But for everyone in the State of California, whether you are in the far north up near Mount Shasta or way down here in the San Diego area, we are hurting. There is a lot of talk. Water restrictions are taking place in every city, whether you are on the coast, up in the north, or in the far south at Laguna Beach. Wherever you happen to be in the State of California, these restrictions are tightening up on the ability of communities to prosper, grow, and keep their lawns green, but more important in some communities, to even live there. In some parts of the Central Valley, down here in the Fresno area, there are communities that are out of water. Communities of 3,000, 5,000, maybe even 10,000 people, have virtually no water at all. This is a problem today. As we look to the future, we are going to see the State's economy and population grow and the demand for water will ever increase, unless we do something. What we must do is develop a water plan for all of California. Unfortunately, what we do most of the time in California is fight over water. There is the famous saying from Mark Twain: ``Whiskey is for drinking. Water is for fighting over.'' And so it has been ever since my great-great-grandfather came to California in the early days of the Gold Rush up here in the mother lode region. You couldn't mine without water. And fighting over that water was the order of the day, and it is today. So as this entire State and much of the Southwest region--Nevada, southern Oregon, Utah, New Mexico, and even the western parts of Texas--suffer through this historic drought, we have taken to fighting in California. And I want to spend a few moments this evening talking about what we must do immediately and then a long-term solution for the State of California. Immediate, we are going to have to seek help. The State of California is using some bond money from past bond acts and some bond money from the historic passage of Proposition 1 last November to immediately try to fix problems that exist in those communities without water. And so that money will begin to flow to those communities, wherever they happen to be. There are a couple up here in the Sacramento Valley and further down in the San Joaquin Valley. The deserts have always been without water, so this is not new to them, although it is more extreme. It is good that the bond act can provide immediate relief, but the rest of the short-term solutions will come from Washington. I want to congratulate and thank the administration for providing $110 million of money for a variety of projects. Some of those projects are to dig deeper wells for those communities without water, to find ways to improve the conservation immediately, and to set about other programs that are short-term in nature--all to the good. And that should continue. In the days ahead, we are going to take up the appropriations bill for water. In that appropriations bill, we should direct the administration to do what it is doing--and to continue doing it through this drought--and that is to focus all of those resources on the immediate drought that is occurring. Whether it is aid for ranchers and farmers or cities, it makes no difference. It is broad and it needs to be done, and it should line up with Proposition 1 of the last November ballot. That is both short-term and long-term. So the Federal Government supports those projects that would be funded under that $7 billion bond act that the citizens of California voted for in an overwhelming majority. But I would also like to talk about the long-term here. Because droughts will come and go, and we must be prepared not only in California, but across the West. For many years, the Department of Water Resources in California has looked at the problem and has made many, many suggestions; but until about 4 years ago, those suggestions were never put together in a comprehensive plan. I am familiar with this. I am a water warrior in California. I have represented this part of California for nearly 40 years, the great Central Valley of California. I will put up another map so you can get a better look at it. So the plans that were put together by the California Department of Water Resources deal with the Sacramento River, which flows south, and the San Joaquin River, which flows north from the Fresno area. This is way beyond Sacramento. Mount Shasta and Oregon, it is way up there. These are the two great rivers of California, together with the Colorado, which is way to the south. It flows into an area here which is called the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. This is the [[Page H4585]] largest estuary of the Western Hemisphere, which is on the West Coast. From Alaska to Chile, there is no other estuary as important to fish and species of all kinds and to the environment and the economy of California. As this water flows down the Sacramento River and the San Joaquin River, it is collected here and pumped south into the San Joaquin Valley and over the Tehachapi Mountains way down here to southern California. That is the Great Southern water project and the Federal water project. But the result of that pumping is an extreme decline in the environment of the delta, Suisun Bay, and San Francisco Bay. Along with it, the salmon and other species have been largely decimated by those projects. So what are we to do? We will take the information that has been developed over these many years by the California Department of Water Resources and develop a comprehensive plan. One plan, which actually dates back some 60 years now, is one that would take the water around the delta and deliver it to the pumps down here at Tracy. That plan, first proposed in the forties and then in the fifties, was taken up by our current Governor, Governor Jerry Brown, in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was called the Peripheral Canal-- peripheral, that is around the delta, delivering water to the pumps. I represented the delta at that time, and I said: Governor, what you have managed to create here is the great vampire ditch. The Peripheral Canal was big enough to take the water from the Sacramento, depriving the delta of the freshwater that it needed for its environment, and deliver it to the pumps. So we had another great water war. It actually went on the ballot, and the people of California decided not to build that canal. And so there it sat until the second iteration of our current Governor, and he decided it was time to address this problem. And so now his suggestion is, instead of a canal, bury it underground so nobody can see it. He said: Don't worry about the canal. Don't worry. You will never see it. I said: Because it is not going to get built? He said: No, no. Because it will be underground. Two massive tunnels, each 40 feet in diameter--about as tall as this Chamber, actually, if we consider this is probably 50 feet in here--big enough to take all of the water out of the Sacramento River half of the year, creating an existential threat to the delta. Something needs to be done, no doubt about it. So by cobbling together the plans that were developed by the Department of Water Resources and others, I put together what I called, a Water Plan for All California. By the way, this tunnel was first priced at $25 billion and did not create 1 gallon of new water--not 1 gallon of new water. {time} 1945 What it did was to create an existential threat to the delta, in that it was big enough to deprive the delta of the fresh water half of the year. I said: Governor, that doesn't work. Let's look at this in a serious way that can create water for California's future. This proposal was put together from plans that the State agencies had developed in the past. I commend this to anybody that really wants to look at what California's water future could be. Instead of a battle royal, which we are now commenced with as we fight over these tunnels, and $25 billion--oh, by the way, there is a new iteration of it, and they are throwing aside most of the habitat restoration and most of the environmental restoration and just going for the straight tunnels and just a little bit of mitigation. Let's do something different. Let's create water that California will need in its future. Let's build a system that will actually deliver more water for California, while protecting the environment, and that is what this plan is all about, a water plan for all California. There are the following elements in it: conservation; recycling; storage; fixing the delta, which actually has to be fixed; letting science run the process rather than politics; and make sure you protect the water rights that have been in existence for more than a decade and a half--excuse me--a century and a half. These are the principal elements, and we are going to go through them one at a time and explain why, if we were to spend, let's say, the full $17 billion, the current cost of the tunnels, and that is the first bid; that is not the final cost. Let's say we would spend that $17 billion. Let's allocate some of it for conservation, agricultural conservation. Now, every agriculturalist--and I am one--in California will say, Yes, but we are already conserving water. Indeed, we are, and a lot of water conservation has taken place, but that much more can be done again. There are somewhere, by the estimates of the State, 3 to 4 million acre feet of new water, available simply through conservation, and that does not include the urban conservation. Now, understand, in today's drought, conservation is on everybody's mind, and in fact, it is mandated by law and executive order, but we can do maybe 3 million acre feet of new water. That is enough for over 120,000 homes a year per million acre feet. Secondly, recycling--I often say, and I think this is more or less accurate, that the fifth largest river on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere are the sanitation plants in Southern California. Whoa, what do you mean the fifth biggest river? Well, consider this: the Colorado River, over here, abutting Arizona and Nevada, water is taken from the Colorado River, 200 miles into the Los Angeles Basin. Water is taken from northern California, the Sacramento River, in a canal, pumps here at the delta, in a canal, 5,000 feet over the Tehachapi Mountains, into the Los Angeles Basin. That water is cleaned once. It is used in the Los Angeles Basin, cleaned again, in most cases, to a higher standard than the day it arrives in southern California; and nearly all of it is dumped into the ocean. What? You do that in California? Well, we do. Fortunately, Orange County, a bastion of conservatism, is far ahead of the rest of the State and probably the Nation in water recycling. We need to do more of it. For a few million, a couple of million dollars--excuse me, a couple of billion dollars, we could recycle at least a million acre feet of new water in southern California, water that is already there, water that is not being used. In northern California, the San Francisco Bay area, for my friends in San Francisco, you are taking what you tell the world is the cleanest water in America, right out of Yosemite National Park, piping it across the Central Valley into the San Francisco area, clean it--well, you really don't have to do much cleaning because it is already clean--use it once, then you pipe it a mile offshore and dump it in the ocean. Recycling is necessary in every part of California. Another million, perhaps, more acre feet of water could be available through recycling. So conservation, recycling, 3, 4 million acre feet--we are getting close to what California needs in the future. So where are you going to put the water? Even in the midst of a drought, we have had heavy rain flows--no place to put the water. My colleague from northern California, the Sacramento Valley, Mr. LaMalfa and I have introduced a bill to build an off-stream storage reservoir here on the west side of the Sacramento Valley, a reservoir that could hold 2 million acre feet of water--well, slightly less--and that water would be available when needed. It could flow down the Sacramento River, sweetening, pushing back the saltwater in the delta; or it could be used for agricultural purposes in the Sacramento Valley or down in the San Joaquin Valley. It also gives flexibilities to the great reservoirs of Shasta, the Oroville Reservoir on the Feather River, and the Folsom Reservoir here on the Sacramento River, giving flexibility to the water managers. When it is needed for salmon and other species, you could use the water out of Sites Reservoir. When it is needed for agriculture or for water quality in the delta, you could use it out of Sites Reservoir, keeping the cold water in Shasta, Oroville, or Folsom that is [[Page H4586]] necessary for the salmon that spawn in those rivers. Storage, off-stream storage, off-stream storage here, just east of Contra Costa, in Los Vaqueros Reservoir, off-stream storage further south down here in Los Banos at the San Luis Reservoir, and the biggest off-stream reservoir of all, the great aquifer of the Sacramento, San Joaquin Valley, the great Central Valley of California, arguably, the second or third largest aquifer anywhere in the world, one that is now seriously overdrafted, as Californians, agriculture, cities, and others thirst for the water in this drought. These storage reservoirs in northern California are just one part of the storage systems that are needed for the future. The other part actually exists here in southern California, out here along the coast, the West Basin, the San Fernando Valley, the San Gabriel Valley, the Santa Ana in Orange County, and as you move east into Riverside and San Bernardino. These are all historic aquifers that could be available to take that recycled water, put it back in the ground, pull it out, clean it, and recycle and recycle and eventually, these aquifers, many of which are contaminated, would be clean and available for the future. We could probably add all of the capacity of these aquifers in southern California and have greater storage capacity than the largest reservoir in the State of California, which is Shasta Reservoir, way up here in northern California. By using the aquifers as a storage facility in what we call conjunctive water management, when you have a lot of rain, you store it--store it off-stream, store it below ground in the aquifers. Then when you have your dry periods, as California historically does, you can take that water out, but you cannot take out as much as currently being taken from these aquifers in California. We are seeing the collapse of the aquifers in the San Joaquin Valley. We are seeing the land subsiding in some places, as much as a foot a year as the water is extracted, so we have to stop that, and so water management becomes extremely important in the process. I want to now turn to the delta, put this delta map back up and remind us, the Sacramento River coming down, the San Joaquin River coming north. From the north, the Sacramento, from the south, the San Joaquin, meeting here in the great delta of California--this delta is seriously at risk, as I said a moment ago. What to do about this? The Governor's plan, to take water around it, to deliver it to the pumps down here, I think, creates an existential threat. Don't build something that could destroy the largest estuary on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere. Instead, build something that is the right size, recognizing that while the delta is imperiled, perhaps by earthquakes, perhaps by sea level rise, nonetheless, all the plants call for water to be pumped out of the delta, even if it is taken around the delta. The first thing to do, right now, is to armor, strengthen those key levees in the delta that are necessary for the transfer of water to the pumps, for the protection of the cities here on the eastern side, and to make sure that you are able to always be able to take that water through the delta. It is called the armored delta. Under the Governor's plan or my plan or any other plan, those levees are going to be used for at least the next two decades, if not for a much longer period of time. Improve the delta, levees, and that is a job for the Federal Government. I talked earlier about what could be done immediately by the Federal Government, and that is to secure some of these key delta channels by improving the levees on those channels. That is step one. Step two is what I call science. This area, the richest estuary on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere, home and nursery to salmon, to other species, such as the delta smelt and many other species, requires very careful attention and very careful scientific study. We are talking over here, in a place called Rio Vista, about building a science center, bringing together all the State and Federal agencies so they can work in a collaborative science program. That is a great program called the Rivers Program. There are other science studies that are underway. You have to let science drive this process. You cannot allow politics to drive it; otherwise, you put at risk the communities in this area; you put at risk the environment; you put at risk the fish species, and you put at risk the largest estuary on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere. Keep in mind that the Congress of the United States, twice in the last 4 years, has passed legislation that removes the environmental protections for this estuarine system and simply grabs 800,000 acre feet of water that was meant for the environment and sends it into the southern valley, into the southern valley here. It is a rip-off. It is part of what has taken place in California since the gold miners came in the 1850s, and that is, if you want water, you simply take it from somebody. In this case, you are taking it from the delta, from the environment, from the agriculture; and you are pushing aside the environmental protections. Don't do it. It is not necessary. There is another thing, in addition to fixing the levees, and I call it the ``Little Sip, Big Gulp.'' Here it is. This is a map of the delta of California. Sacramento is up here, the confluence of the American River and the Sacramento River. That is the State capital. This is the delta here. We were talking about it in the larger map. San Francisco Bay is over here, Suisun Bay and the rest. This is the heart of the delta. Stockton is down here. Tracy and the big massive pumps at Tracy, capable of taking well over 15,000 cubic feet per second, are down here in this area. The tunnels that the Governor wants to build would start here, travel through some of the richest agricultural land in the delta, or in the Nation, agricultural land that has been in production since the 1850s and 1860s, along the Sacramento River, displacing, oh, maybe 4 or 5 miles of habitat and agriculture and communities along this area. The tunnel would come down into this--the tunnels would come down into this area. $17 billion--why would you do something that, first of all, is large enough to allow for the destruction of the delta? Why would you spend all that money, when a good portion of that project is already built? This is it. This is the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel, an ocean, a channel that begins at San Francisco Bay, comes up the Sacramento River, and then, in a channel that was built by the Army Corps of Engineers, all the way up to the Port of Sacramento here in West Sacramento, on the other side of the State capital. This is a deep water shipping channel. Ocean ships come into San Francisco Bay and come all the way up here. It is a pretty good economic activity. Agricultural products are shipped out. I was over that way this last weekend, and they have log decks. I guess these are logs from the various fires that have occurred in California, and those are going to be shipped off to China. I sometimes wonder why we don't use those logs for the things that we should be making in America, but that is another subject for another day. So what is an alternative? I call this the little sip solution, ``Little Sip, Big Gulp solution.'' Take the water out of the Sacramento River here, 3,000--not 15,000--3,000 cubic feet per second. We know how to do that. Fish screens are already built to do that. {time} 2000 Let it flow down the Deep Water Channel to about here, just north of Rio Vista. Put in a single ship lock and a pump. Alternative one: put it in a small pipe through the delta down here to this area; and then, in an open channel along what is called Old River, take it down to the pumps at Tracy, 3,000 cubic feet per second. You could do that most every day of the year, and it could deliver 2 million acre-feet of water to the pumps at Tracy in most years. In this drought year, it wouldn't be possible. A second alternative would be to take it down the Deep Water Channel, 3,000 cubic feet, to the shipping lock and the pump, put it into a canal that [[Page H4587]] goes behind Rio Vista here, crosses Sherman Island at the confluence of the Sacramento and the San Joaquin Rivers, and over to Contra Costa County to the pumps. This is a very interesting solution because this solution creates a fail-safe solution for about 7 million people that live in the San Francisco Bay area, because this particular route intersects six aqueducts: the Solano aqueduct here, this would intersect it down here in Contra Costa; East Bay Municipal Utility aqueduct; the Contra Costa County aqueduct; the Los Vaqueros aqueduct for the Los Vaqueros river; zone seven, down here in the Livermore area, over here in this area; and also the South Bay aqueduct, going all the way down to Silicon Valley. What has happened, if this solution were chosen, should the need ever arise for some reason, these critical water districts that supply the water to this entire Bay area could get access to the Sacramento River water. So if, for some reason, the delta was to become saline as a result of a collapse of a levee system or any other reason, we have a fail-safe solution for the entire Bay region, except Marin County, which has its own water system. Either of these is a system that would be right-sized. That is a Little Sip big enough to provide 2 million acre-feet of water, which is roughly 40, 45 percent of the amount of water needed south of the delta for southern California, for Los Angeles, and for the San Joaquin Valley. That is the Little Sip solution: a route through the delta, a pipeline from here to Old River, and then an open channel on the east side of Old River to the pumps, or a canal across Contra Costa and Solano County. Either of them would work. And it would be a fraction of the cost of the massive twin tunnels that would come this direction, destroying the agricultural communities here in Portland and Clarksburg and putting at risk the entire delta because of the enormous size. This is a 15,000-cubic-foot-per-second tunnel system. Now, granted, they are only going to build three of the intakes here on the Sacramento River. Okay. It is good to have only three. That gives you 9,000, which is roughly two-thirds of the water going down the Sacramento River half of the year. So what does that mean for the delta? It means the delta is going to be salty and deprived of the freshwater that this estuary needs. And all they need to do is to put in one more intake, and then they can take all of the water half of the year. Don't do it. Never build something that could be so destructive of such a precious natural resource as the delta. So this is the Little Sip. Where does the rest of the water come? It is called the Big Gulp. Even in this drought year, there have been two very heavy rains that have sent a surge of water down the San Joaquin and down the Sacramento. The pumps were turned on--not to their full might, but the pumps were turned on, and the water was shipped to the south. Okay. It worked. Can it work in the future in normal years? There is sufficient water in the delta in a normal year to get another 2, 2.5 million acre-feet of water out of the delta, itself, and that is the Big Gulp. So you combine a small facility with a Big Gulp when the water is available in the delta. Now, keep in mind, this project and the twin tunnel project that the Governor is proposing both require storage south of the delta. Neither project will work. And, in fact, the California water system today will not work without storage south of the delta. That is why--to back up to a map of all California--we have to have storage offsite, at Sites Reservoir. There is talk of enlarging Shasta Reservoir, way up here in this area. There is talk of building a new reservoir here on the San Joaquin River at Hanford's flat. There is talk of enlarging--in fact, this one is almost certain to happen-- enlarging Los Vaqueros Reservoir. The San Luis Reservoir down here needs to be rebuilt because of earthquake safety, and it could be expanded. There is another reservoir site just south of it, Los Banos Grande. That is another large reservoir. And, of course, the aquifers in the entire Central Valley of California, and we have already talked about the aquifers in southern California. So you have to have storage south of the delta. If you have storage south of the delta, then the Governor's plan or my plan, the Little Sip, Big Gulp plan will work. Storage is absolutely essential in all of these configurations. Fail to do the storage, and nothing is going to work. Let me just review what we have been talking about here. We have been talking about a water plant for all California. Conservation, to be sure, the great agricultural areas--even over here in the Salinas Valley--conservation along this entire area, conservation in southern California, the great metropolitan areas, and in the Bay area. In doing so, the State's own estimate was 5 million. Let's just say you get 3 million acre-feet. Agricultural conservation, urban conservation, 3 million acre-feet of new water, water that is currently unavailable but there. Recycling, we talked about recycling here in southern California. A $2 to $3 billion investment will give you 1 million acre-feet of water, and you already have the storage systems in place, the underground aquifers of southern California. Similarly, recycling in the Bay area. Sacramento, right here, starting just a month ago, a new recycling program, a $2 billion recycling program in Sacramento to recycle water--some for that area, the rest to put clean water down the river rather than some of the water, which is a little shady. So recycling, another million acre-feet at least, maybe more, as you bring on the recycling in the Bay area. Now we have got 3 to 4 million acre-feet of water. Storage systems, it is estimated that the Sites Reservoir can add in this drought here, were it available, would have been 900,000 acre-feet of water in this drought year. Of course it is not built; it is not available. But on average, it should provide some 500,000--400,000 to 600,000 acre-feet of water annually out of Sites Reservoir; plus, as I described earlier, the ability to reoperate the great reservoirs and, together, be able to perhaps get even more water as a result of Sites Reservoir. The other reservoirs can provide additional water also. So we ought to be able, through these processes, to get somewhere near 5 million acre-feet of new water for California. If we have conservation, if we have the storage and we are able to get through the current drought, it is a safe bet that 5 million acre-feet of annual water yield will carry California into the next 30 to 50 years and beyond that, depending on population growth and technologies. I had not mentioned the use of this water out here. Well, that is the Pacific Ocean. Desalinization and recycling use exactly the same technology. Recycling happens to be cheaper, in that it takes less energy to clean recycled water than to clean the ocean water because the ocean water has a lot of salts and other things in it, and it is just more expensive. But clearly, desalinization is also in our future. Down here, in the San Diego area, a new recycling plant is going online this year. They have been talking about one in Santa Barbara that actually was built but then mothballed because it rained again. But that one in Santa Barbara is likely to go back online as a result of the current drought and in anticipation of future droughts. So desalinization is also in California's future. Those are the basic elements: conservation; recycling; creation of new storage systems; fixing the delta, the levees; Little Sip, Big Gulp strategy; science-driven process. Keep in mind, you have got to be right on the science; otherwise, you are going to destroy this extraordinarily valuable habitat of the delta and other places. Finally, you had better be paying attention to the water rights and the laws of California, which, unfortunately, in the first iteration of the bill that passed Congress 4 years ago, just blew aside California water rights. So if you want to start a big, big water war, if you want to heighten and enflame a water war in California, push aside the water rights which, incidentally, is now taking place as a result of the drought. That is a Water Plan for All of California. It is here. It is available. My Web site has it. I recommend it to anybody that is interested in a solution for [[Page H4588]] California's long-term water problems; and also, I recommend to people that we have the Federal Government in the short term align its water policy programs from the EPA--the Environmental Protection Agency--the Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Interior, the Army Corps of Engineers, that those water programs in the short term be aligned with the State of California's bond act so that we can promote, augment, and advance the projects that would be undertaken in the $7 billion water bond that the California voters passed last November. My plea to those who think the tunnels are the solution is: stop, take another look. Take another look at the Little Sip, Big Gulp solution. This actually was something that was first proposed by the Natural Resources Defense Council. We were working with this about 5 years ago. They came up with the Little Sip, Big Gulp name, and with some modification, it is now a proposal that would cost a fraction of what the twin, massive, 40-foot-in-diameter tunnels would cost. So, for California, there is a future. It is the Golden State. It is an economy unmatched by any other in the United States. It is an economy particularly--well, actually, the entire State's economy is stressed as a result of the drought. And if we take the kind of steps that I have been talking about here, we will be able to provide the water that California needs in the next drought and in the years to come as the population grows and as the economy grows. So that is the water plan for all California. There are many other pieces of the puzzle, one of which I am going to take just a second to talk about. And that is this week, as we take up the appropriations for water programs in the State of California--actually, water plans for the United States, not just the State of California--we ought to be mindful of a project called the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a program that has been in effect for half a century. It takes the royalties from the offshore oil and minerals onshore and allows much of that royalty to be spent on preserving the special places of America-- the wildlife refuges, very unique habitat areas--setting aside those areas, using that money to buy up the land and, in some cases, to buy up easements so that the land will forever remain available to future generations in a more natural state. That is the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Unfortunately, the authorization for it expires this year, and at the moment, there is no perceived movement by the Congress of the United States to reinstitute and reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund. When I was deputy Secretary of the Department of the Interior in the mid-nineties, we used this fund to set aside redwood forest off along the coast of California, to protect the Everglades of Florida, to set aside some of the land along the sand dunes on the Great Lakes. This is a project for all of America, one that is worthy of being reauthorized and properly funded. With that, Mr. Speaker, perhaps enough about California's drought. No, I will take that back. {time} 2015 Mr. Speaker, we have got a problem in California, short term and long term, and it deserves the attention of the Congress of the United States because California is the seventh largest economy in the world and critically important to the future of this Nation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [House] [Pages H4584-H4588] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CALIFORNIA DROUGHT The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on the subject of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I am not at all sure it is going to be that controversial, but I was just looking outside the Capitol before I came in to make this presentation, and it is raining. It is a downpour. For those of us from California, it has been a long time since we have seen a downpour. The Golden State, the seventh largest economy in the world and home to over 35 million people, is in the throes of a historic drought. This is the fourth year, and it is a world of hurt in California. The economy is moving along. We are not complaining about the economy. Many parts of it are moving along. But for everyone in the State of California, whether you are in the far north up near Mount Shasta or way down here in the San Diego area, we are hurting. There is a lot of talk. Water restrictions are taking place in every city, whether you are on the coast, up in the north, or in the far south at Laguna Beach. Wherever you happen to be in the State of California, these restrictions are tightening up on the ability of communities to prosper, grow, and keep their lawns green, but more important in some communities, to even live there. In some parts of the Central Valley, down here in the Fresno area, there are communities that are out of water. Communities of 3,000, 5,000, maybe even 10,000 people, have virtually no water at all. This is a problem today. As we look to the future, we are going to see the State's economy and population grow and the demand for water will ever increase, unless we do something. What we must do is develop a water plan for all of California. Unfortunately, what we do most of the time in California is fight over water. There is the famous saying from Mark Twain: ``Whiskey is for drinking. Water is for fighting over.'' And so it has been ever since my great-great-grandfather came to California in the early days of the Gold Rush up here in the mother lode region. You couldn't mine without water. And fighting over that water was the order of the day, and it is today. So as this entire State and much of the Southwest region--Nevada, southern Oregon, Utah, New Mexico, and even the western parts of Texas--suffer through this historic drought, we have taken to fighting in California. And I want to spend a few moments this evening talking about what we must do immediately and then a long-term solution for the State of California. Immediate, we are going to have to seek help. The State of California is using some bond money from past bond acts and some bond money from the historic passage of Proposition 1 last November to immediately try to fix problems that exist in those communities without water. And so that money will begin to flow to those communities, wherever they happen to be. There are a couple up here in the Sacramento Valley and further down in the San Joaquin Valley. The deserts have always been without water, so this is not new to them, although it is more extreme. It is good that the bond act can provide immediate relief, but the rest of the short-term solutions will come from Washington. I want to congratulate and thank the administration for providing $110 million of money for a variety of projects. Some of those projects are to dig deeper wells for those communities without water, to find ways to improve the conservation immediately, and to set about other programs that are short-term in nature--all to the good. And that should continue. In the days ahead, we are going to take up the appropriations bill for water. In that appropriations bill, we should direct the administration to do what it is doing--and to continue doing it through this drought--and that is to focus all of those resources on the immediate drought that is occurring. Whether it is aid for ranchers and farmers or cities, it makes no difference. It is broad and it needs to be done, and it should line up with Proposition 1 of the last November ballot. That is both short-term and long-term. So the Federal Government supports those projects that would be funded under that $7 billion bond act that the citizens of California voted for in an overwhelming majority. But I would also like to talk about the long-term here. Because droughts will come and go, and we must be prepared not only in California, but across the West. For many years, the Department of Water Resources in California has looked at the problem and has made many, many suggestions; but until about 4 years ago, those suggestions were never put together in a comprehensive plan. I am familiar with this. I am a water warrior in California. I have represented this part of California for nearly 40 years, the great Central Valley of California. I will put up another map so you can get a better look at it. So the plans that were put together by the California Department of Water Resources deal with the Sacramento River, which flows south, and the San Joaquin River, which flows north from the Fresno area. This is way beyond Sacramento. Mount Shasta and Oregon, it is way up there. These are the two great rivers of California, together with the Colorado, which is way to the south. It flows into an area here which is called the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. This is the [[Page H4585]] largest estuary of the Western Hemisphere, which is on the West Coast. From Alaska to Chile, there is no other estuary as important to fish and species of all kinds and to the environment and the economy of California. As this water flows down the Sacramento River and the San Joaquin River, it is collected here and pumped south into the San Joaquin Valley and over the Tehachapi Mountains way down here to southern California. That is the Great Southern water project and the Federal water project. But the result of that pumping is an extreme decline in the environment of the delta, Suisun Bay, and San Francisco Bay. Along with it, the salmon and other species have been largely decimated by those projects. So what are we to do? We will take the information that has been developed over these many years by the California Department of Water Resources and develop a comprehensive plan. One plan, which actually dates back some 60 years now, is one that would take the water around the delta and deliver it to the pumps down here at Tracy. That plan, first proposed in the forties and then in the fifties, was taken up by our current Governor, Governor Jerry Brown, in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was called the Peripheral Canal-- peripheral, that is around the delta, delivering water to the pumps. I represented the delta at that time, and I said: Governor, what you have managed to create here is the great vampire ditch. The Peripheral Canal was big enough to take the water from the Sacramento, depriving the delta of the freshwater that it needed for its environment, and deliver it to the pumps. So we had another great water war. It actually went on the ballot, and the people of California decided not to build that canal. And so there it sat until the second iteration of our current Governor, and he decided it was time to address this problem. And so now his suggestion is, instead of a canal, bury it underground so nobody can see it. He said: Don't worry about the canal. Don't worry. You will never see it. I said: Because it is not going to get built? He said: No, no. Because it will be underground. Two massive tunnels, each 40 feet in diameter--about as tall as this Chamber, actually, if we consider this is probably 50 feet in here--big enough to take all of the water out of the Sacramento River half of the year, creating an existential threat to the delta. Something needs to be done, no doubt about it. So by cobbling together the plans that were developed by the Department of Water Resources and others, I put together what I called, a Water Plan for All California. By the way, this tunnel was first priced at $25 billion and did not create 1 gallon of new water--not 1 gallon of new water. {time} 1945 What it did was to create an existential threat to the delta, in that it was big enough to deprive the delta of the fresh water half of the year. I said: Governor, that doesn't work. Let's look at this in a serious way that can create water for California's future. This proposal was put together from plans that the State agencies had developed in the past. I commend this to anybody that really wants to look at what California's water future could be. Instead of a battle royal, which we are now commenced with as we fight over these tunnels, and $25 billion--oh, by the way, there is a new iteration of it, and they are throwing aside most of the habitat restoration and most of the environmental restoration and just going for the straight tunnels and just a little bit of mitigation. Let's do something different. Let's create water that California will need in its future. Let's build a system that will actually deliver more water for California, while protecting the environment, and that is what this plan is all about, a water plan for all California. There are the following elements in it: conservation; recycling; storage; fixing the delta, which actually has to be fixed; letting science run the process rather than politics; and make sure you protect the water rights that have been in existence for more than a decade and a half--excuse me--a century and a half. These are the principal elements, and we are going to go through them one at a time and explain why, if we were to spend, let's say, the full $17 billion, the current cost of the tunnels, and that is the first bid; that is not the final cost. Let's say we would spend that $17 billion. Let's allocate some of it for conservation, agricultural conservation. Now, every agriculturalist--and I am one--in California will say, Yes, but we are already conserving water. Indeed, we are, and a lot of water conservation has taken place, but that much more can be done again. There are somewhere, by the estimates of the State, 3 to 4 million acre feet of new water, available simply through conservation, and that does not include the urban conservation. Now, understand, in today's drought, conservation is on everybody's mind, and in fact, it is mandated by law and executive order, but we can do maybe 3 million acre feet of new water. That is enough for over 120,000 homes a year per million acre feet. Secondly, recycling--I often say, and I think this is more or less accurate, that the fifth largest river on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere are the sanitation plants in Southern California. Whoa, what do you mean the fifth biggest river? Well, consider this: the Colorado River, over here, abutting Arizona and Nevada, water is taken from the Colorado River, 200 miles into the Los Angeles Basin. Water is taken from northern California, the Sacramento River, in a canal, pumps here at the delta, in a canal, 5,000 feet over the Tehachapi Mountains, into the Los Angeles Basin. That water is cleaned once. It is used in the Los Angeles Basin, cleaned again, in most cases, to a higher standard than the day it arrives in southern California; and nearly all of it is dumped into the ocean. What? You do that in California? Well, we do. Fortunately, Orange County, a bastion of conservatism, is far ahead of the rest of the State and probably the Nation in water recycling. We need to do more of it. For a few million, a couple of million dollars--excuse me, a couple of billion dollars, we could recycle at least a million acre feet of new water in southern California, water that is already there, water that is not being used. In northern California, the San Francisco Bay area, for my friends in San Francisco, you are taking what you tell the world is the cleanest water in America, right out of Yosemite National Park, piping it across the Central Valley into the San Francisco area, clean it--well, you really don't have to do much cleaning because it is already clean--use it once, then you pipe it a mile offshore and dump it in the ocean. Recycling is necessary in every part of California. Another million, perhaps, more acre feet of water could be available through recycling. So conservation, recycling, 3, 4 million acre feet--we are getting close to what California needs in the future. So where are you going to put the water? Even in the midst of a drought, we have had heavy rain flows--no place to put the water. My colleague from northern California, the Sacramento Valley, Mr. LaMalfa and I have introduced a bill to build an off-stream storage reservoir here on the west side of the Sacramento Valley, a reservoir that could hold 2 million acre feet of water--well, slightly less--and that water would be available when needed. It could flow down the Sacramento River, sweetening, pushing back the saltwater in the delta; or it could be used for agricultural purposes in the Sacramento Valley or down in the San Joaquin Valley. It also gives flexibilities to the great reservoirs of Shasta, the Oroville Reservoir on the Feather River, and the Folsom Reservoir here on the Sacramento River, giving flexibility to the water managers. When it is needed for salmon and other species, you could use the water out of Sites Reservoir. When it is needed for agriculture or for water quality in the delta, you could use it out of Sites Reservoir, keeping the cold water in Shasta, Oroville, or Folsom that is [[Page H4586]] necessary for the salmon that spawn in those rivers. Storage, off-stream storage, off-stream storage here, just east of Contra Costa, in Los Vaqueros Reservoir, off-stream storage further south down here in Los Banos at the San Luis Reservoir, and the biggest off-stream reservoir of all, the great aquifer of the Sacramento, San Joaquin Valley, the great Central Valley of California, arguably, the second or third largest aquifer anywhere in the world, one that is now seriously overdrafted, as Californians, agriculture, cities, and others thirst for the water in this drought. These storage reservoirs in northern California are just one part of the storage systems that are needed for the future. The other part actually exists here in southern California, out here along the coast, the West Basin, the San Fernando Valley, the San Gabriel Valley, the Santa Ana in Orange County, and as you move east into Riverside and San Bernardino. These are all historic aquifers that could be available to take that recycled water, put it back in the ground, pull it out, clean it, and recycle and recycle and eventually, these aquifers, many of which are contaminated, would be clean and available for the future. We could probably add all of the capacity of these aquifers in southern California and have greater storage capacity than the largest reservoir in the State of California, which is Shasta Reservoir, way up here in northern California. By using the aquifers as a storage facility in what we call conjunctive water management, when you have a lot of rain, you store it--store it off-stream, store it below ground in the aquifers. Then when you have your dry periods, as California historically does, you can take that water out, but you cannot take out as much as currently being taken from these aquifers in California. We are seeing the collapse of the aquifers in the San Joaquin Valley. We are seeing the land subsiding in some places, as much as a foot a year as the water is extracted, so we have to stop that, and so water management becomes extremely important in the process. I want to now turn to the delta, put this delta map back up and remind us, the Sacramento River coming down, the San Joaquin River coming north. From the north, the Sacramento, from the south, the San Joaquin, meeting here in the great delta of California--this delta is seriously at risk, as I said a moment ago. What to do about this? The Governor's plan, to take water around it, to deliver it to the pumps down here, I think, creates an existential threat. Don't build something that could destroy the largest estuary on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere. Instead, build something that is the right size, recognizing that while the delta is imperiled, perhaps by earthquakes, perhaps by sea level rise, nonetheless, all the plants call for water to be pumped out of the delta, even if it is taken around the delta. The first thing to do, right now, is to armor, strengthen those key levees in the delta that are necessary for the transfer of water to the pumps, for the protection of the cities here on the eastern side, and to make sure that you are able to always be able to take that water through the delta. It is called the armored delta. Under the Governor's plan or my plan or any other plan, those levees are going to be used for at least the next two decades, if not for a much longer period of time. Improve the delta, levees, and that is a job for the Federal Government. I talked earlier about what could be done immediately by the Federal Government, and that is to secure some of these key delta channels by improving the levees on those channels. That is step one. Step two is what I call science. This area, the richest estuary on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere, home and nursery to salmon, to other species, such as the delta smelt and many other species, requires very careful attention and very careful scientific study. We are talking over here, in a place called Rio Vista, about building a science center, bringing together all the State and Federal agencies so they can work in a collaborative science program. That is a great program called the Rivers Program. There are other science studies that are underway. You have to let science drive this process. You cannot allow politics to drive it; otherwise, you put at risk the communities in this area; you put at risk the environment; you put at risk the fish species, and you put at risk the largest estuary on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere. Keep in mind that the Congress of the United States, twice in the last 4 years, has passed legislation that removes the environmental protections for this estuarine system and simply grabs 800,000 acre feet of water that was meant for the environment and sends it into the southern valley, into the southern valley here. It is a rip-off. It is part of what has taken place in California since the gold miners came in the 1850s, and that is, if you want water, you simply take it from somebody. In this case, you are taking it from the delta, from the environment, from the agriculture; and you are pushing aside the environmental protections. Don't do it. It is not necessary. There is another thing, in addition to fixing the levees, and I call it the ``Little Sip, Big Gulp.'' Here it is. This is a map of the delta of California. Sacramento is up here, the confluence of the American River and the Sacramento River. That is the State capital. This is the delta here. We were talking about it in the larger map. San Francisco Bay is over here, Suisun Bay and the rest. This is the heart of the delta. Stockton is down here. Tracy and the big massive pumps at Tracy, capable of taking well over 15,000 cubic feet per second, are down here in this area. The tunnels that the Governor wants to build would start here, travel through some of the richest agricultural land in the delta, or in the Nation, agricultural land that has been in production since the 1850s and 1860s, along the Sacramento River, displacing, oh, maybe 4 or 5 miles of habitat and agriculture and communities along this area. The tunnel would come down into this--the tunnels would come down into this area. $17 billion--why would you do something that, first of all, is large enough to allow for the destruction of the delta? Why would you spend all that money, when a good portion of that project is already built? This is it. This is the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel, an ocean, a channel that begins at San Francisco Bay, comes up the Sacramento River, and then, in a channel that was built by the Army Corps of Engineers, all the way up to the Port of Sacramento here in West Sacramento, on the other side of the State capital. This is a deep water shipping channel. Ocean ships come into San Francisco Bay and come all the way up here. It is a pretty good economic activity. Agricultural products are shipped out. I was over that way this last weekend, and they have log decks. I guess these are logs from the various fires that have occurred in California, and those are going to be shipped off to China. I sometimes wonder why we don't use those logs for the things that we should be making in America, but that is another subject for another day. So what is an alternative? I call this the little sip solution, ``Little Sip, Big Gulp solution.'' Take the water out of the Sacramento River here, 3,000--not 15,000--3,000 cubic feet per second. We know how to do that. Fish screens are already built to do that. {time} 2000 Let it flow down the Deep Water Channel to about here, just north of Rio Vista. Put in a single ship lock and a pump. Alternative one: put it in a small pipe through the delta down here to this area; and then, in an open channel along what is called Old River, take it down to the pumps at Tracy, 3,000 cubic feet per second. You could do that most every day of the year, and it could deliver 2 million acre-feet of water to the pumps at Tracy in most years. In this drought year, it wouldn't be possible. A second alternative would be to take it down the Deep Water Channel, 3,000 cubic feet, to the shipping lock and the pump, put it into a canal that [[Page H4587]] goes behind Rio Vista here, crosses Sherman Island at the confluence of the Sacramento and the San Joaquin Rivers, and over to Contra Costa County to the pumps. This is a very interesting solution because this solution creates a fail-safe solution for about 7 million people that live in the San Francisco Bay area, because this particular route intersects six aqueducts: the Solano aqueduct here, this would intersect it down here in Contra Costa; East Bay Municipal Utility aqueduct; the Contra Costa County aqueduct; the Los Vaqueros aqueduct for the Los Vaqueros river; zone seven, down here in the Livermore area, over here in this area; and also the South Bay aqueduct, going all the way down to Silicon Valley. What has happened, if this solution were chosen, should the need ever arise for some reason, these critical water districts that supply the water to this entire Bay area could get access to the Sacramento River water. So if, for some reason, the delta was to become saline as a result of a collapse of a levee system or any other reason, we have a fail-safe solution for the entire Bay region, except Marin County, which has its own water system. Either of these is a system that would be right-sized. That is a Little Sip big enough to provide 2 million acre-feet of water, which is roughly 40, 45 percent of the amount of water needed south of the delta for southern California, for Los Angeles, and for the San Joaquin Valley. That is the Little Sip solution: a route through the delta, a pipeline from here to Old River, and then an open channel on the east side of Old River to the pumps, or a canal across Contra Costa and Solano County. Either of them would work. And it would be a fraction of the cost of the massive twin tunnels that would come this direction, destroying the agricultural communities here in Portland and Clarksburg and putting at risk the entire delta because of the enormous size. This is a 15,000-cubic-foot-per-second tunnel system. Now, granted, they are only going to build three of the intakes here on the Sacramento River. Okay. It is good to have only three. That gives you 9,000, which is roughly two-thirds of the water going down the Sacramento River half of the year. So what does that mean for the delta? It means the delta is going to be salty and deprived of the freshwater that this estuary needs. And all they need to do is to put in one more intake, and then they can take all of the water half of the year. Don't do it. Never build something that could be so destructive of such a precious natural resource as the delta. So this is the Little Sip. Where does the rest of the water come? It is called the Big Gulp. Even in this drought year, there have been two very heavy rains that have sent a surge of water down the San Joaquin and down the Sacramento. The pumps were turned on--not to their full might, but the pumps were turned on, and the water was shipped to the south. Okay. It worked. Can it work in the future in normal years? There is sufficient water in the delta in a normal year to get another 2, 2.5 million acre-feet of water out of the delta, itself, and that is the Big Gulp. So you combine a small facility with a Big Gulp when the water is available in the delta. Now, keep in mind, this project and the twin tunnel project that the Governor is proposing both require storage south of the delta. Neither project will work. And, in fact, the California water system today will not work without storage south of the delta. That is why--to back up to a map of all California--we have to have storage offsite, at Sites Reservoir. There is talk of enlarging Shasta Reservoir, way up here in this area. There is talk of building a new reservoir here on the San Joaquin River at Hanford's flat. There is talk of enlarging--in fact, this one is almost certain to happen-- enlarging Los Vaqueros Reservoir. The San Luis Reservoir down here needs to be rebuilt because of earthquake safety, and it could be expanded. There is another reservoir site just south of it, Los Banos Grande. That is another large reservoir. And, of course, the aquifers in the entire Central Valley of California, and we have already talked about the aquifers in southern California. So you have to have storage south of the delta. If you have storage south of the delta, then the Governor's plan or my plan, the Little Sip, Big Gulp plan will work. Storage is absolutely essential in all of these configurations. Fail to do the storage, and nothing is going to work. Let me just review what we have been talking about here. We have been talking about a water plant for all California. Conservation, to be sure, the great agricultural areas--even over here in the Salinas Valley--conservation along this entire area, conservation in southern California, the great metropolitan areas, and in the Bay area. In doing so, the State's own estimate was 5 million. Let's just say you get 3 million acre-feet. Agricultural conservation, urban conservation, 3 million acre-feet of new water, water that is currently unavailable but there. Recycling, we talked about recycling here in southern California. A $2 to $3 billion investment will give you 1 million acre-feet of water, and you already have the storage systems in place, the underground aquifers of southern California. Similarly, recycling in the Bay area. Sacramento, right here, starting just a month ago, a new recycling program, a $2 billion recycling program in Sacramento to recycle water--some for that area, the rest to put clean water down the river rather than some of the water, which is a little shady. So recycling, another million acre-feet at least, maybe more, as you bring on the recycling in the Bay area. Now we have got 3 to 4 million acre-feet of water. Storage systems, it is estimated that the Sites Reservoir can add in this drought here, were it available, would have been 900,000 acre-feet of water in this drought year. Of course it is not built; it is not available. But on average, it should provide some 500,000--400,000 to 600,000 acre-feet of water annually out of Sites Reservoir; plus, as I described earlier, the ability to reoperate the great reservoirs and, together, be able to perhaps get even more water as a result of Sites Reservoir. The other reservoirs can provide additional water also. So we ought to be able, through these processes, to get somewhere near 5 million acre-feet of new water for California. If we have conservation, if we have the storage and we are able to get through the current drought, it is a safe bet that 5 million acre-feet of annual water yield will carry California into the next 30 to 50 years and beyond that, depending on population growth and technologies. I had not mentioned the use of this water out here. Well, that is the Pacific Ocean. Desalinization and recycling use exactly the same technology. Recycling happens to be cheaper, in that it takes less energy to clean recycled water than to clean the ocean water because the ocean water has a lot of salts and other things in it, and it is just more expensive. But clearly, desalinization is also in our future. Down here, in the San Diego area, a new recycling plant is going online this year. They have been talking about one in Santa Barbara that actually was built but then mothballed because it rained again. But that one in Santa Barbara is likely to go back online as a result of the current drought and in anticipation of future droughts. So desalinization is also in California's future. Those are the basic elements: conservation; recycling; creation of new storage systems; fixing the delta, the levees; Little Sip, Big Gulp strategy; science-driven process. Keep in mind, you have got to be right on the science; otherwise, you are going to destroy this extraordinarily valuable habitat of the delta and other places. Finally, you had better be paying attention to the water rights and the laws of California, which, unfortunately, in the first iteration of the bill that passed Congress 4 years ago, just blew aside California water rights. So if you want to start a big, big water war, if you want to heighten and enflame a water war in California, push aside the water rights which, incidentally, is now taking place as a result of the drought. That is a Water Plan for All of California. It is here. It is available. My Web site has it. I recommend it to anybody that is interested in a solution for [[Page H4588]] California's long-term water problems; and also, I recommend to people that we have the Federal Government in the short term align its water policy programs from the EPA--the Environmental Protection Agency--the Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Interior, the Army Corps of Engineers, that those water programs in the short term be aligned with the State of California's bond act so that we can promote, augment, and advance the projects that would be undertaken in the $7 billion water bond that the California voters passed last November. My plea to those who think the tunnels are the solution is: stop, take another look. Take another look at the Little Sip, Big Gulp solution. This actually was something that was first proposed by the Natural Resources Defense Council. We were working with this about 5 years ago. They came up with the Little Sip, Big Gulp name, and with some modification, it is now a proposal that would cost a fraction of what the twin, massive, 40-foot-in-diameter tunnels would cost. So, for California, there is a future. It is the Golden State. It is an economy unmatched by any other in the United States. It is an economy particularly--well, actually, the entire State's economy is stressed as a result of the drought. And if we take the kind of steps that I have been talking about here, we will be able to provide the water that California needs in the next drought and in the years to come as the population grows and as the economy grows. So that is the water plan for all California. There are many other pieces of the puzzle, one of which I am going to take just a second to talk about. And that is this week, as we take up the appropriations for water programs in the State of California--actually, water plans for the United States, not just the State of California--we ought to be mindful of a project called the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a program that has been in effect for half a century. It takes the royalties from the offshore oil and minerals onshore and allows much of that royalty to be spent on preserving the special places of America-- the wildlife refuges, very unique habitat areas--setting aside those areas, using that money to buy up the land and, in some cases, to buy up easements so that the land will forever remain available to future generations in a more natural state. That is the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Unfortunately, the authorization for it expires this year, and at the moment, there is no perceived movement by the Congress of the United States to reinstitute and reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund. When I was deputy Secretary of the Department of the Interior in the mid-nineties, we used this fund to set aside redwood forest off along the coast of California, to protect the Everglades of Florida, to set aside some of the land along the sand dunes on the Great Lakes. This is a project for all of America, one that is worthy of being reauthorized and properly funded. With that, Mr. Speaker, perhaps enough about California's drought. No, I will take that back. {time} 2015 Mr. Speaker, we have got a problem in California, short term and long term, and it deserves the attention of the Congress of the United States because California is the seventh largest economy in the world and critically important to the future of this Nation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [House] [Pages H4584-H4588] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CALIFORNIA DROUGHT The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on the subject of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I am not at all sure it is going to be that controversial, but I was just looking outside the Capitol before I came in to make this presentation, and it is raining. It is a downpour. For those of us from California, it has been a long time since we have seen a downpour. The Golden State, the seventh largest economy in the world and home to over 35 million people, is in the throes of a historic drought. This is the fourth year, and it is a world of hurt in California. The economy is moving along. We are not complaining about the economy. Many parts of it are moving along. But for everyone in the State of California, whether you are in the far north up near Mount Shasta or way down here in the San Diego area, we are hurting. There is a lot of talk. Water restrictions are taking place in every city, whether you are on the coast, up in the north, or in the far south at Laguna Beach. Wherever you happen to be in the State of California, these restrictions are tightening up on the ability of communities to prosper, grow, and keep their lawns green, but more important in some communities, to even live there. In some parts of the Central Valley, down here in the Fresno area, there are communities that are out of water. Communities of 3,000, 5,000, maybe even 10,000 people, have virtually no water at all. This is a problem today. As we look to the future, we are going to see the State's economy and population grow and the demand for water will ever increase, unless we do something. What we must do is develop a water plan for all of California. Unfortunately, what we do most of the time in California is fight over water. There is the famous saying from Mark Twain: ``Whiskey is for drinking. Water is for fighting over.'' And so it has been ever since my great-great-grandfather came to California in the early days of the Gold Rush up here in the mother lode region. You couldn't mine without water. And fighting over that water was the order of the day, and it is today. So as this entire State and much of the Southwest region--Nevada, southern Oregon, Utah, New Mexico, and even the western parts of Texas--suffer through this historic drought, we have taken to fighting in California. And I want to spend a few moments this evening talking about what we must do immediately and then a long-term solution for the State of California. Immediate, we are going to have to seek help. The State of California is using some bond money from past bond acts and some bond money from the historic passage of Proposition 1 last November to immediately try to fix problems that exist in those communities without water. And so that money will begin to flow to those communities, wherever they happen to be. There are a couple up here in the Sacramento Valley and further down in the San Joaquin Valley. The deserts have always been without water, so this is not new to them, although it is more extreme. It is good that the bond act can provide immediate relief, but the rest of the short-term solutions will come from Washington. I want to congratulate and thank the administration for providing $110 million of money for a variety of projects. Some of those projects are to dig deeper wells for those communities without water, to find ways to improve the conservation immediately, and to set about other programs that are short-term in nature--all to the good. And that should continue. In the days ahead, we are going to take up the appropriations bill for water. In that appropriations bill, we should direct the administration to do what it is doing--and to continue doing it through this drought--and that is to focus all of those resources on the immediate drought that is occurring. Whether it is aid for ranchers and farmers or cities, it makes no difference. It is broad and it needs to be done, and it should line up with Proposition 1 of the last November ballot. That is both short-term and long-term. So the Federal Government supports those projects that would be funded under that $7 billion bond act that the citizens of California voted for in an overwhelming majority. But I would also like to talk about the long-term here. Because droughts will come and go, and we must be prepared not only in California, but across the West. For many years, the Department of Water Resources in California has looked at the problem and has made many, many suggestions; but until about 4 years ago, those suggestions were never put together in a comprehensive plan. I am familiar with this. I am a water warrior in California. I have represented this part of California for nearly 40 years, the great Central Valley of California. I will put up another map so you can get a better look at it. So the plans that were put together by the California Department of Water Resources deal with the Sacramento River, which flows south, and the San Joaquin River, which flows north from the Fresno area. This is way beyond Sacramento. Mount Shasta and Oregon, it is way up there. These are the two great rivers of California, together with the Colorado, which is way to the south. It flows into an area here which is called the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. This is the [[Page H4585]] largest estuary of the Western Hemisphere, which is on the West Coast. From Alaska to Chile, there is no other estuary as important to fish and species of all kinds and to the environment and the economy of California. As this water flows down the Sacramento River and the San Joaquin River, it is collected here and pumped south into the San Joaquin Valley and over the Tehachapi Mountains way down here to southern California. That is the Great Southern water project and the Federal water project. But the result of that pumping is an extreme decline in the environment of the delta, Suisun Bay, and San Francisco Bay. Along with it, the salmon and other species have been largely decimated by those projects. So what are we to do? We will take the information that has been developed over these many years by the California Department of Water Resources and develop a comprehensive plan. One plan, which actually dates back some 60 years now, is one that would take the water around the delta and deliver it to the pumps down here at Tracy. That plan, first proposed in the forties and then in the fifties, was taken up by our current Governor, Governor Jerry Brown, in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was called the Peripheral Canal-- peripheral, that is around the delta, delivering water to the pumps. I represented the delta at that time, and I said: Governor, what you have managed to create here is the great vampire ditch. The Peripheral Canal was big enough to take the water from the Sacramento, depriving the delta of the freshwater that it needed for its environment, and deliver it to the pumps. So we had another great water war. It actually went on the ballot, and the people of California decided not to build that canal. And so there it sat until the second iteration of our current Governor, and he decided it was time to address this problem. And so now his suggestion is, instead of a canal, bury it underground so nobody can see it. He said: Don't worry about the canal. Don't worry. You will never see it. I said: Because it is not going to get built? He said: No, no. Because it will be underground. Two massive tunnels, each 40 feet in diameter--about as tall as this Chamber, actually, if we consider this is probably 50 feet in here--big enough to take all of the water out of the Sacramento River half of the year, creating an existential threat to the delta. Something needs to be done, no doubt about it. So by cobbling together the plans that were developed by the Department of Water Resources and others, I put together what I called, a Water Plan for All California. By the way, this tunnel was first priced at $25 billion and did not create 1 gallon of new water--not 1 gallon of new water. {time} 1945 What it did was to create an existential threat to the delta, in that it was big enough to deprive the delta of the fresh water half of the year. I said: Governor, that doesn't work. Let's look at this in a serious way that can create water for California's future. This proposal was put together from plans that the State agencies had developed in the past. I commend this to anybody that really wants to look at what California's water future could be. Instead of a battle royal, which we are now commenced with as we fight over these tunnels, and $25 billion--oh, by the way, there is a new iteration of it, and they are throwing aside most of the habitat restoration and most of the environmental restoration and just going for the straight tunnels and just a little bit of mitigation. Let's do something different. Let's create water that California will need in its future. Let's build a system that will actually deliver more water for California, while protecting the environment, and that is what this plan is all about, a water plan for all California. There are the following elements in it: conservation; recycling; storage; fixing the delta, which actually has to be fixed; letting science run the process rather than politics; and make sure you protect the water rights that have been in existence for more than a decade and a half--excuse me--a century and a half. These are the principal elements, and we are going to go through them one at a time and explain why, if we were to spend, let's say, the full $17 billion, the current cost of the tunnels, and that is the first bid; that is not the final cost. Let's say we would spend that $17 billion. Let's allocate some of it for conservation, agricultural conservation. Now, every agriculturalist--and I am one--in California will say, Yes, but we are already conserving water. Indeed, we are, and a lot of water conservation has taken place, but that much more can be done again. There are somewhere, by the estimates of the State, 3 to 4 million acre feet of new water, available simply through conservation, and that does not include the urban conservation. Now, understand, in today's drought, conservation is on everybody's mind, and in fact, it is mandated by law and executive order, but we can do maybe 3 million acre feet of new water. That is enough for over 120,000 homes a year per million acre feet. Secondly, recycling--I often say, and I think this is more or less accurate, that the fifth largest river on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere are the sanitation plants in Southern California. Whoa, what do you mean the fifth biggest river? Well, consider this: the Colorado River, over here, abutting Arizona and Nevada, water is taken from the Colorado River, 200 miles into the Los Angeles Basin. Water is taken from northern California, the Sacramento River, in a canal, pumps here at the delta, in a canal, 5,000 feet over the Tehachapi Mountains, into the Los Angeles Basin. That water is cleaned once. It is used in the Los Angeles Basin, cleaned again, in most cases, to a higher standard than the day it arrives in southern California; and nearly all of it is dumped into the ocean. What? You do that in California? Well, we do. Fortunately, Orange County, a bastion of conservatism, is far ahead of the rest of the State and probably the Nation in water recycling. We need to do more of it. For a few million, a couple of million dollars--excuse me, a couple of billion dollars, we could recycle at least a million acre feet of new water in southern California, water that is already there, water that is not being used. In northern California, the San Francisco Bay area, for my friends in San Francisco, you are taking what you tell the world is the cleanest water in America, right out of Yosemite National Park, piping it across the Central Valley into the San Francisco area, clean it--well, you really don't have to do much cleaning because it is already clean--use it once, then you pipe it a mile offshore and dump it in the ocean. Recycling is necessary in every part of California. Another million, perhaps, more acre feet of water could be available through recycling. So conservation, recycling, 3, 4 million acre feet--we are getting close to what California needs in the future. So where are you going to put the water? Even in the midst of a drought, we have had heavy rain flows--no place to put the water. My colleague from northern California, the Sacramento Valley, Mr. LaMalfa and I have introduced a bill to build an off-stream storage reservoir here on the west side of the Sacramento Valley, a reservoir that could hold 2 million acre feet of water--well, slightly less--and that water would be available when needed. It could flow down the Sacramento River, sweetening, pushing back the saltwater in the delta; or it could be used for agricultural purposes in the Sacramento Valley or down in the San Joaquin Valley. It also gives flexibilities to the great reservoirs of Shasta, the Oroville Reservoir on the Feather River, and the Folsom Reservoir here on the Sacramento River, giving flexibility to the water managers. When it is needed for salmon and other species, you could use the water out of Sites Reservoir. When it is needed for agriculture or for water quality in the delta, you could use it out of Sites Reservoir, keeping the cold water in Shasta, Oroville, or Folsom that is [[Page H4586]] necessary for the salmon that spawn in those rivers. Storage, off-stream storage, off-stream storage here, just east of Contra Costa, in Los Vaqueros Reservoir, off-stream storage further south down here in Los Banos at the San Luis Reservoir, and the biggest off-stream reservoir of all, the great aquifer of the Sacramento, San Joaquin Valley, the great Central Valley of California, arguably, the second or third largest aquifer anywhere in the world, one that is now seriously overdrafted, as Californians, agriculture, cities, and others thirst for the water in this drought. These storage reservoirs in northern California are just one part of the storage systems that are needed for the future. The other part actually exists here in southern California, out here along the coast, the West Basin, the San Fernando Valley, the San Gabriel Valley, the Santa Ana in Orange County, and as you move east into Riverside and San Bernardino. These are all historic aquifers that could be available to take that recycled water, put it back in the ground, pull it out, clean it, and recycle and recycle and eventually, these aquifers, many of which are contaminated, would be clean and available for the future. We could probably add all of the capacity of these aquifers in southern California and have greater storage capacity than the largest reservoir in the State of California, which is Shasta Reservoir, way up here in northern California. By using the aquifers as a storage facility in what we call conjunctive water management, when you have a lot of rain, you store it--store it off-stream, store it below ground in the aquifers. Then when you have your dry periods, as California historically does, you can take that water out, but you cannot take out as much as currently being taken from these aquifers in California. We are seeing the collapse of the aquifers in the San Joaquin Valley. We are seeing the land subsiding in some places, as much as a foot a year as the water is extracted, so we have to stop that, and so water management becomes extremely important in the process. I want to now turn to the delta, put this delta map back up and remind us, the Sacramento River coming down, the San Joaquin River coming north. From the north, the Sacramento, from the south, the San Joaquin, meeting here in the great delta of California--this delta is seriously at risk, as I said a moment ago. What to do about this? The Governor's plan, to take water around it, to deliver it to the pumps down here, I think, creates an existential threat. Don't build something that could destroy the largest estuary on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere. Instead, build something that is the right size, recognizing that while the delta is imperiled, perhaps by earthquakes, perhaps by sea level rise, nonetheless, all the plants call for water to be pumped out of the delta, even if it is taken around the delta. The first thing to do, right now, is to armor, strengthen those key levees in the delta that are necessary for the transfer of water to the pumps, for the protection of the cities here on the eastern side, and to make sure that you are able to always be able to take that water through the delta. It is called the armored delta. Under the Governor's plan or my plan or any other plan, those levees are going to be used for at least the next two decades, if not for a much longer period of time. Improve the delta, levees, and that is a job for the Federal Government. I talked earlier about what could be done immediately by the Federal Government, and that is to secure some of these key delta channels by improving the levees on those channels. That is step one. Step two is what I call science. This area, the richest estuary on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere, home and nursery to salmon, to other species, such as the delta smelt and many other species, requires very careful attention and very careful scientific study. We are talking over here, in a place called Rio Vista, about building a science center, bringing together all the State and Federal agencies so they can work in a collaborative science program. That is a great program called the Rivers Program. There are other science studies that are underway. You have to let science drive this process. You cannot allow politics to drive it; otherwise, you put at risk the communities in this area; you put at risk the environment; you put at risk the fish species, and you put at risk the largest estuary on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere. Keep in mind that the Congress of the United States, twice in the last 4 years, has passed legislation that removes the environmental protections for this estuarine system and simply grabs 800,000 acre feet of water that was meant for the environment and sends it into the southern valley, into the southern valley here. It is a rip-off. It is part of what has taken place in California since the gold miners came in the 1850s, and that is, if you want water, you simply take it from somebody. In this case, you are taking it from the delta, from the environment, from the agriculture; and you are pushing aside the environmental protections. Don't do it. It is not necessary. There is another thing, in addition to fixing the levees, and I call it the ``Little Sip, Big Gulp.'' Here it is. This is a map of the delta of California. Sacramento is up here, the confluence of the American River and the Sacramento River. That is the State capital. This is the delta here. We were talking about it in the larger map. San Francisco Bay is over here, Suisun Bay and the rest. This is the heart of the delta. Stockton is down here. Tracy and the big massive pumps at Tracy, capable of taking well over 15,000 cubic feet per second, are down here in this area. The tunnels that the Governor wants to build would start here, travel through some of the richest agricultural land in the delta, or in the Nation, agricultural land that has been in production since the 1850s and 1860s, along the Sacramento River, displacing, oh, maybe 4 or 5 miles of habitat and agriculture and communities along this area. The tunnel would come down into this--the tunnels would come down into this area. $17 billion--why would you do something that, first of all, is large enough to allow for the destruction of the delta? Why would you spend all that money, when a good portion of that project is already built? This is it. This is the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel, an ocean, a channel that begins at San Francisco Bay, comes up the Sacramento River, and then, in a channel that was built by the Army Corps of Engineers, all the way up to the Port of Sacramento here in West Sacramento, on the other side of the State capital. This is a deep water shipping channel. Ocean ships come into San Francisco Bay and come all the way up here. It is a pretty good economic activity. Agricultural products are shipped out. I was over that way this last weekend, and they have log decks. I guess these are logs from the various fires that have occurred in California, and those are going to be shipped off to China. I sometimes wonder why we don't use those logs for the things that we should be making in America, but that is another subject for another day. So what is an alternative? I call this the little sip solution, ``Little Sip, Big Gulp solution.'' Take the water out of the Sacramento River here, 3,000--not 15,000--3,000 cubic feet per second. We know how to do that. Fish screens are already built to do that. {time} 2000 Let it flow down the Deep Water Channel to about here, just north of Rio Vista. Put in a single ship lock and a pump. Alternative one: put it in a small pipe through the delta down here to this area; and then, in an open channel along what is called Old River, take it down to the pumps at Tracy, 3,000 cubic feet per second. You could do that most every day of the year, and it could deliver 2 million acre-feet of water to the pumps at Tracy in most years. In this drought year, it wouldn't be possible. A second alternative would be to take it down the Deep Water Channel, 3,000 cubic feet, to the shipping lock and the pump, put it into a canal that [[Page H4587]] goes behind Rio Vista here, crosses Sherman Island at the confluence of the Sacramento and the San Joaquin Rivers, and over to Contra Costa County to the pumps. This is a very interesting solution because this solution creates a fail-safe solution for about 7 million people that live in the San Francisco Bay area, because this particular route intersects six aqueducts: the Solano aqueduct here, this would intersect it down here in Contra Costa; East Bay Municipal Utility aqueduct; the Contra Costa County aqueduct; the Los Vaqueros aqueduct for the Los Vaqueros river; zone seven, down here in the Livermore area, over here in this area; and also the South Bay aqueduct, going all the way down to Silicon Valley. What has happened, if this solution were chosen, should the need ever arise for some reason, these critical water districts that supply the water to this entire Bay area could get access to the Sacramento River water. So if, for some reason, the delta was to become saline as a result of a collapse of a levee system or any other reason, we have a fail-safe solution for the entire Bay region, except Marin County, which has its own water system. Either of these is a system that would be right-sized. That is a Little Sip big enough to provide 2 million acre-feet of water, which is roughly 40, 45 percent of the amount of water needed south of the delta for southern California, for Los Angeles, and for the San Joaquin Valley. That is the Little Sip solution: a route through the delta, a pipeline from here to Old River, and then an open channel on the east side of Old River to the pumps, or a canal across Contra Costa and Solano County. Either of them would work. And it would be a fraction of the cost of the massive twin tunnels that would come this direction, destroying the agricultural communities here in Portland and Clarksburg and putting at risk the entire delta because of the enormous size. This is a 15,000-cubic-foot-per-second tunnel system. Now, granted, they are only going to build three of the intakes here on the Sacramento River. Okay. It is good to have only three. That gives you 9,000, which is roughly two-thirds of the water going down the Sacramento River half of the year. So what does that mean for the delta? It means the delta is going to be salty and deprived of the freshwater that this estuary needs. And all they need to do is to put in one more intake, and then they can take all of the water half of the year. Don't do it. Never build something that could be so destructive of such a precious natural resource as the delta. So this is the Little Sip. Where does the rest of the water come? It is called the Big Gulp. Even in this drought year, there have been two very heavy rains that have sent a surge of water down the San Joaquin and down the Sacramento. The pumps were turned on--not to their full might, but the pumps were turned on, and the water was shipped to the south. Okay. It worked. Can it work in the future in normal years? There is sufficient water in the delta in a normal year to get another 2, 2.5 million acre-feet of water out of the delta, itself, and that is the Big Gulp. So you combine a small facility with a Big Gulp when the water is available in the delta. Now, keep in mind, this project and the twin tunnel project that the Governor is proposing both require storage south of the delta. Neither project will work. And, in fact, the California water system today will not work without storage south of the delta. That is why--to back up to a map of all California--we have to have storage offsite, at Sites Reservoir. There is talk of enlarging Shasta Reservoir, way up here in this area. There is talk of building a new reservoir here on the San Joaquin River at Hanford's flat. There is talk of enlarging--in fact, this one is almost certain to happen-- enlarging Los Vaqueros Reservoir. The San Luis Reservoir down here needs to be rebuilt because of earthquake safety, and it could be expanded. There is another reservoir site just south of it, Los Banos Grande. That is another large reservoir. And, of course, the aquifers in the entire Central Valley of California, and we have already talked about the aquifers in southern California. So you have to have storage south of the delta. If you have storage south of the delta, then the Governor's plan or my plan, the Little Sip, Big Gulp plan will work. Storage is absolutely essential in all of these configurations. Fail to do the storage, and nothing is going to work. Let me just review what we have been talking about here. We have been talking about a water plant for all California. Conservation, to be sure, the great agricultural areas--even over here in the Salinas Valley--conservation along this entire area, conservation in southern California, the great metropolitan areas, and in the Bay area. In doing so, the State's own estimate was 5 million. Let's just say you get 3 million acre-feet. Agricultural conservation, urban conservation, 3 million acre-feet of new water, water that is currently unavailable but there. Recycling, we talked about recycling here in southern California. A $2 to $3 billion investment will give you 1 million acre-feet of water, and you already have the storage systems in place, the underground aquifers of southern California. Similarly, recycling in the Bay area. Sacramento, right here, starting just a month ago, a new recycling program, a $2 billion recycling program in Sacramento to recycle water--some for that area, the rest to put clean water down the river rather than some of the water, which is a little shady. So recycling, another million acre-feet at least, maybe more, as you bring on the recycling in the Bay area. Now we have got 3 to 4 million acre-feet of water. Storage systems, it is estimated that the Sites Reservoir can add in this drought here, were it available, would have been 900,000 acre-feet of water in this drought year. Of course it is not built; it is not available. But on average, it should provide some 500,000--400,000 to 600,000 acre-feet of water annually out of Sites Reservoir; plus, as I described earlier, the ability to reoperate the great reservoirs and, together, be able to perhaps get even more water as a result of Sites Reservoir. The other reservoirs can provide additional water also. So we ought to be able, through these processes, to get somewhere near 5 million acre-feet of new water for California. If we have conservation, if we have the storage and we are able to get through the current drought, it is a safe bet that 5 million acre-feet of annual water yield will carry California into the next 30 to 50 years and beyond that, depending on population growth and technologies. I had not mentioned the use of this water out here. Well, that is the Pacific Ocean. Desalinization and recycling use exactly the same technology. Recycling happens to be cheaper, in that it takes less energy to clean recycled water than to clean the ocean water because the ocean water has a lot of salts and other things in it, and it is just more expensive. But clearly, desalinization is also in our future. Down here, in the San Diego area, a new recycling plant is going online this year. They have been talking about one in Santa Barbara that actually was built but then mothballed because it rained again. But that one in Santa Barbara is likely to go back online as a result of the current drought and in anticipation of future droughts. So desalinization is also in California's future. Those are the basic elements: conservation; recycling; creation of new storage systems; fixing the delta, the levees; Little Sip, Big Gulp strategy; science-driven process. Keep in mind, you have got to be right on the science; otherwise, you are going to destroy this extraordinarily valuable habitat of the delta and other places. Finally, you had better be paying attention to the water rights and the laws of California, which, unfortunately, in the first iteration of the bill that passed Congress 4 years ago, just blew aside California water rights. So if you want to start a big, big water war, if you want to heighten and enflame a water war in California, push aside the water rights which, incidentally, is now taking place as a result of the drought. That is a Water Plan for All of California. It is here. It is available. My Web site has it. I recommend it to anybody that is interested in a solution for [[Page H4588]] California's long-term water problems; and also, I recommend to people that we have the Federal Government in the short term align its water policy programs from the EPA--the Environmental Protection Agency--the Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Interior, the Army Corps of Engineers, that those water programs in the short term be aligned with the State of California's bond act so that we can promote, augment, and advance the projects that would be undertaken in the $7 billion water bond that the California voters passed last November. My plea to those who think the tunnels are the solution is: stop, take another look. Take another look at the Little Sip, Big Gulp solution. This actually was something that was first proposed by the Natural Resources Defense Council. We were working with this about 5 years ago. They came up with the Little Sip, Big Gulp name, and with some modification, it is now a proposal that would cost a fraction of what the twin, massive, 40-foot-in-diameter tunnels would cost. So, for California, there is a future. It is the Golden State. It is an economy unmatched by any other in the United States. It is an economy particularly--well, actually, the entire State's economy is stressed as a result of the drought. And if we take the kind of steps that I have been talking about here, we will be able to provide the water that California needs in the next drought and in the years to come as the population grows and as the economy grows. So that is the water plan for all California. There are many other pieces of the puzzle, one of which I am going to take just a second to talk about. And that is this week, as we take up the appropriations for water programs in the State of California--actually, water plans for the United States, not just the State of California--we ought to be mindful of a project called the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a program that has been in effect for half a century. It takes the royalties from the offshore oil and minerals onshore and allows much of that royalty to be spent on preserving the special places of America-- the wildlife refuges, very unique habitat areas--setting aside those areas, using that money to buy up the land and, in some cases, to buy up easements so that the land will forever remain available to future generations in a more natural state. That is the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Unfortunately, the authorization for it expires this year, and at the moment, there is no perceived movement by the Congress of the United States to reinstitute and reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund. When I was deputy Secretary of the Department of the Interior in the mid-nineties, we used this fund to set aside redwood forest off along the coast of California, to protect the Everglades of Florida, to set aside some of the land along the sand dunes on the Great Lakes. This is a project for all of America, one that is worthy of being reauthorized and properly funded. With that, Mr. Speaker, perhaps enough about California's drought. No, I will take that back. {time} 2015 Mr. Speaker, we have got a problem in California, short term and long term, and it deserves the attention of the Congress of the United States because California is the seventh largest economy in the world and critically important to the future of this Nation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",package_114_266.csv,34212,34212,34280,"[congressional record volume 161, number 101 (tuesday, june 23, 2015)] [house] [pages h4584-h4588] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] california drought the speaker pro tempore. under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the gentleman from california (mr. garamendi) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. general leave mr. garamendi. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on the subject of my special order. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from california? there was no objection. mr. garamendi. mr. speaker, i am not at all sure it is going to be that controversial, but i was just looking outside the capitol before i came in to make this presentation, and it is raining. it is a downpour. for those of us from california, it has been a long time since we have seen a downpour. the golden state, the seventh largest economy in the world and home to over 35 million people, is in the throes of a historic drought. this is the fourth year, and it is a world of hurt in california. the economy is moving along. we are not complaining about the economy. many parts of it are moving along. but for everyone in the state of california, whether you are in the far north up near mount shasta or way down here in the san diego area, we are hurting. there is a lot of talk. water restrictions are taking place in every city, whether you are on the coast, up in the north, or in the far south at laguna beach. wherever you happen to be in the state of california, these restrictions are tightening up on the ability of communities to prosper, grow, and keep their lawns green, but more important in some communities, to even live there. in some parts of the central valley, down here in the fresno area, there are communities that are out of water. communities of 3,000, 5,000, maybe even 10,000 people, have virtually no water at all. this is a problem today. as we look to the future, we are going to see the state's economy and population grow and the demand for water will ever increase, unless we do something. what we must do is develop a water plan for all of california. unfortunately, what we do most of the time in california is fight over water. there is the famous saying from mark twain: ``whiskey is for drinking. water is for fighting over.'' and so it has been ever since my great-great-grandfather came to california in the early days of the gold rush up here in the mother lode region. you couldn't mine without water. and fighting over that water was the order of the day, and it is today. so as this entire state and much of the southwest region--nevada, southern oregon, utah, new mexico, and even the western parts of texas--suffer through this historic drought, we have taken to fighting in california. and i want to spend a few moments this evening talking about what we must do immediately and then a long-term solution for the state of california. immediate, we are going to have to seek help. the state of california is using some bond money from past bond acts and some bond money from the historic passage of proposition 1 last november to immediately try to fix problems that exist in those communities without water. and so that money will begin to flow to those communities, wherever they happen to be. there are a couple up here in the sacramento valley and further down in the san joaquin valley. the deserts have always been without water, so this is not new to them, although it is more extreme. it is good that the bond act can provide immediate relief, but the rest of the short-term solutions will come from washington. i want to congratulate and thank the administration for providing $110 million of money for a variety of projects. some of those projects are to dig deeper wells for those communities without water, to find ways to improve the conservation immediately, and to set about other programs that are short-term in nature--all to the good. and that should continue. in the days ahead, we are going to take up the appropriations bill for water. in that appropriations bill, we should direct the administration to do what it is doing--and to continue doing it through this drought--and that is to focus all of those resources on the immediate drought that is occurring. whether it is aid for ranchers and farmers or cities, it makes no difference. it is broad and it needs to be done, and it should line up with proposition 1 of the last november ballot. that is both short-term and long-term. so the federal government supports those projects that would be funded under that $7 billion bond act that the citizens of california voted for in an overwhelming majority. but i would also like to talk about the long-term here. because droughts will come and go, and we must be prepared not only in california, but across the west. for many years, the department of water resources in california has looked at the problem and has made many, many suggestions; but until about 4 years ago, those suggestions were never put together in a comprehensive plan. i am familiar with this. i am a water warrior in california. i have represented this part of california for nearly 40 years, the great central valley of california. i will put up another map so you can get a better look at it. so the plans that were put together by the california department of water resources deal with the sacramento river, which flows south, and the san joaquin river, which flows north from the fresno area. this is way beyond sacramento. mount shasta and oregon, it is way up there. these are the two great rivers of california, together with the colorado, which is way to the south. it flows into an area here which is called the sacramento-san joaquin delta. this is the [[page h4585]] largest estuary of the western hemisphere, which is on the west coast. from alaska to chile, there is no other estuary as important to fish and species of all kinds and to the environment and the economy of california. as this water flows down the sacramento river and the san joaquin river, it is collected here and pumped south into the san joaquin valley and over the tehachapi mountains way down here to southern california. that is the great southern water project and the federal water project. but the result of that pumping is an extreme decline in the environment of the delta, suisun bay, and san francisco bay. along with it, the salmon and other species have been largely decimated by those projects. so what are we to do? we will take the information that has been developed over these many years by the california department of water resources and develop a comprehensive plan. one plan, which actually dates back some 60 years now, is one that would take the water around the delta and deliver it to the pumps down here at tracy. that plan, first proposed in the forties and then in the fifties, was taken up by our current governor, governor jerry brown, in the late 1970s and early 1980s. it was called the peripheral canal-- peripheral, that is around the delta, delivering water to the pumps. i represented the delta at that time, and i said: governor, what you have managed to create here is the great vampire ditch. the peripheral canal was big enough to take the water from the sacramento, depriving the delta of the freshwater that it needed for its environment, and deliver it to the pumps. so we had another great water war. it actually went on the ballot, and the people of california decided not to build that canal. and so there it sat until the second iteration of our current governor, and he decided it was time to address this problem. and so now his suggestion is, instead of a canal, bury it underground so nobody can see it. he said: don't worry about the canal. don't worry. you will never see it. i said: because it is not going to get built? he said: no, no. because it will be underground. two massive tunnels, each 40 feet in diameter--about as tall as this chamber, actually, if we consider this is probably 50 feet in here--big enough to take all of the water out of the sacramento river half of the year, creating an existential threat to the delta. something needs to be done, no doubt about it. so by cobbling together the plans that were developed by the department of water resources and others, i put together what i called, a water plan for all california. by the way, this tunnel was first priced at $25 billion and did not create 1 gallon of new water--not 1 gallon of new water. {time} 1945 what it did was to create an existential threat to the delta, in that it was big enough to deprive the delta of the fresh water half of the year. i said: governor, that doesn't work. let's look at this in a serious way that can create water for california's future. this proposal was put together from plans that the state agencies had developed in the past. i commend this to anybody that really wants to look at what california's water future could be. instead of a battle royal, which we are now commenced with as we fight over these tunnels, and $25 billion--oh, by the way, there is a new iteration of it, and they are throwing aside most of the habitat restoration and most of the environmental restoration and just going for the straight tunnels and just a little bit of mitigation. let's do something different. let's create water that california will need in its future. let's build a system that will actually deliver more water for california, while protecting the environment, and that is what this plan is all about, a water plan for all california. there are the following elements in it: conservation; recycling; storage; fixing the delta, which actually has to be fixed; letting science run the process rather than politics; and make sure you protect the water rights that have been in existence for more than a decade and a half--excuse me--a century and a half. these are the principal elements, and we are going to go through them one at a time and explain why, if we were to spend, let's say, the full $17 billion, the current cost of the tunnels, and that is the first bid; that is not the final cost. let's say we would spend that $17 billion. let's allocate some of it for conservation, agricultural conservation. now, every agriculturalist--and i am one--in california will say, yes, but we are already conserving water. indeed, we are, and a lot of water conservation has taken place, but that much more can be done again. there are somewhere, by the estimates of the state, 3 to 4 million acre feet of new water, available simply through conservation, and that does not include the urban conservation. now, understand, in today's drought, conservation is on everybody's mind, and in fact, it is mandated by law and executive order, but we can do maybe 3 million acre feet of new water. that is enough for over 120,000 homes a year per million acre feet. secondly, recycling--i often say, and i think this is more or less accurate, that the fifth largest river on the west coast of the western hemisphere are the sanitation plants in southern california. whoa, what do you mean the fifth biggest river? well, consider this: the colorado river, over here, abutting arizona and nevada, water is taken from the colorado river, 200 miles into the los angeles basin. water is taken from northern california, the sacramento river, in a canal, pumps here at the delta, in a canal, 5,000 feet over the tehachapi mountains, into the los angeles basin. that water is cleaned once. it is used in the los angeles basin, cleaned again, in most cases, to a higher standard than the day it arrives in southern california; and nearly all of it is dumped into the ocean. what? you do that in california? well, we do. fortunately, orange county, a bastion of conservatism, is far ahead of the rest of the state and probably the nation in water recycling. we need to do more of it. for a few million, a couple of million dollars--excuse me, a couple of billion dollars, we could recycle at least a million acre feet of new water in southern california, water that is already there, water that is not being used. in northern california, the san francisco bay area, for my friends in san francisco, you are taking what you tell the world is the cleanest water in america, right out of yosemite national park, piping it across the central valley into the san francisco area, clean it--well, you really don't have to do much cleaning because it is already clean--use it once, then you pipe it a mile offshore and dump it in the ocean. recycling is necessary in every part of california. another million, perhaps, more acre feet of water could be available through recycling. so conservation, recycling, 3, 4 million acre feet--we are getting close to what california needs in the future. so where are you going to put the water? even in the midst of a drought, we have had heavy rain flows--no place to put the water. my colleague from northern california, the sacramento valley, mr. lamalfa and i have introduced a bill to build an off-stream storage reservoir here on the west side of the sacramento valley, a reservoir that could hold 2 million acre feet of water--well, slightly less--and that water would be available when needed. it could flow down the sacramento river, sweetening, pushing back the saltwater in the delta; or it could be used for agricultural purposes in the sacramento valley or down in the san joaquin valley. it also gives flexibilities to the great reservoirs of shasta, the oroville reservoir on the feather river, and the folsom reservoir here on the sacramento river, giving flexibility to the water managers. when it is needed for salmon and other species, you could use the water out of sites reservoir. when it is needed for agriculture or for water quality in the delta, you could use it out of sites reservoir, keeping the cold water in shasta, oroville, or folsom that is [[page h4586]] necessary for the salmon that spawn in those rivers. storage, off-stream storage, off-stream storage here, just east of contra costa, in los vaqueros reservoir, off-stream storage further south down here in los banos at the san luis reservoir, and the biggest off-stream reservoir of all, the great aquifer of the sacramento, san joaquin valley, the great central valley of california, arguably, the second or third largest aquifer anywhere in the world, one that is now seriously overdrafted, as californians, agriculture, cities, and others thirst for the water in this drought. these storage reservoirs in northern california are just one part of the storage systems that are needed for the future. the other part actually exists here in southern california, out here along the coast, the west basin, the san fernando valley, the san gabriel valley, the santa ana in orange county, and as you move east into riverside and san bernardino. these are all historic aquifers that could be available to take that recycled water, put it back in the ground, pull it out, clean it, and recycle and recycle and eventually, these aquifers, many of which are contaminated, would be clean and available for the future. we could probably add all of the capacity of these aquifers in southern california and have greater storage capacity than the largest reservoir in the state of california, which is shasta reservoir, way up here in northern california. by using the aquifers as a storage facility in what we call conjunctive water management, when you have a lot of rain, you store it--store it off-stream, store it below ground in the aquifers. then when you have your dry periods, as california historically does, you can take that water out, but you cannot take out as much as currently being taken from these aquifers in california. we are seeing the collapse of the aquifers in the san joaquin valley. we are seeing the land subsiding in some places, as much as a foot a year as the water is extracted, so we have to stop that, and so water management becomes extremely important in the process. i want to now turn to the delta, put this delta map back up and remind us, the sacramento river coming down, the san joaquin river coming north. from the north, the sacramento, from the south, the san joaquin, meeting here in the great delta of california--this delta is seriously at risk, as i said a moment ago. what to do about this? the governor's plan, to take water around it, to deliver it to the pumps down here, i think, creates an existential threat. don't build something that could destroy the largest estuary on the west coast of the western hemisphere. instead, build something that is the right size, recognizing that while the delta is imperiled, perhaps by earthquakes, perhaps by sea level rise, nonetheless, all the plants call for water to be pumped out of the delta, even if it is taken around the delta. the first thing to do, right now, is to armor, strengthen those key levees in the delta that are necessary for the transfer of water to the pumps, for the protection of the cities here on the eastern side, and to make sure that you are able to always be able to take that water through the delta. it is called the armored delta. under the governor's plan or my plan or any other plan, those levees are going to be used for at least the next two decades, if not for a much longer period of time. improve the delta, levees, and that is a job for the federal government. i talked earlier about what could be done immediately by the federal government, and that is to secure some of these key delta channels by improving the levees on those channels. that is step one. step two is what i call science. this area, the richest estuary on the west coast of the western hemisphere, home and nursery to salmon, to other species, such as the delta smelt and many other species, requires very careful attention and very careful scientific study. we are talking over here, in a place called rio vista, about building a science center, bringing together all the state and federal agencies so they can work in a collaborative science program. that is a great program called the rivers program. there are other science studies that are underway. you have to let science drive this process. you cannot allow politics to drive it; otherwise, you put at risk the communities in this area; you put at risk the environment; you put at risk the fish species, and you put at risk the largest estuary on the west coast of the western hemisphere. keep in mind that the congress of the united states, twice in the last 4 years, has passed legislation that removes the environmental protections for this estuarine system and simply grabs 800,000 acre feet of water that was meant for the environment and sends it into the southern valley, into the southern valley here. it is a rip-off. it is part of what has taken place in california since the gold miners came in the 1850s, and that is, if you want water, you simply take it from somebody. in this case, you are taking it from the delta, from the environment, from the agriculture; and you are pushing aside the environmental protections. don't do it. it is not necessary. there is another thing, in addition to fixing the levees, and i call it the ``little sip, big gulp.'' here it is. this is a map of the delta of california. sacramento is up here, the confluence of the american river and the sacramento river. that is the state capital. this is the delta here. we were talking about it in the larger map. san francisco bay is over here, suisun bay and the rest. this is the heart of the delta. stockton is down here. tracy and the big massive pumps at tracy, capable of taking well over 15,000 cubic feet per second, are down here in this area. the tunnels that the governor wants to build would start here, travel through some of the richest agricultural land in the delta, or in the nation, agricultural land that has been in production since the 1850s and 1860s, along the sacramento river, displacing, oh, maybe 4 or 5 miles of habitat and agriculture and communities along this area. the tunnel would come down into this--the tunnels would come down into this area. $17 billion--why would you do something that, first of all, is large enough to allow for the destruction of the delta? why would you spend all that money, when a good portion of that project is already built? this is it. this is the sacramento deep water ship channel, an ocean, a channel that begins at san francisco bay, comes up the sacramento river, and then, in a channel that was built by the army corps of engineers, all the way up to the port of sacramento here in west sacramento, on the other side of the state capital. this is a deep water shipping channel. ocean ships come into san francisco bay and come all the way up here. it is a pretty good economic activity. agricultural products are shipped out. i was over that way this last weekend, and they have log decks. i guess these are logs from the various fires that have occurred in california, and those are going to be shipped off to china. i sometimes wonder why we don't use those logs for the things that we should be making in america, but that is another subject for another day. so what is an alternative? i call this the little sip solution, ``little sip, big gulp solution.'' take the water out of the sacramento river here, 3,000--not 15,000--3,000 cubic feet per second. we know how to do that. fish screens are already built to do that. {time} 2000 let it flow down the deep water channel to about here, just north of rio vista. put in a single ship lock and a pump. alternative one: put it in a small pipe through the delta down here to this area; and then, in an open channel along what is called old river, take it down to the pumps at tracy, 3,000 cubic feet per second. you could do that most every day of the year, and it could deliver 2 million acre-feet of water to the pumps at tracy in most years. in this drought year, it wouldn't be possible. a second alternative would be to take it down the deep water channel, 3,000 cubic feet, to the shipping lock and the pump, put it into a canal that [[page h4587]] goes behind rio vista here, crosses sherman island at the confluence of the sacramento and the san joaquin rivers, and over to contra costa county to the pumps. this is a very interesting solution because this solution creates a fail-safe solution for about 7 million people that live in the san francisco bay area, because this particular route intersects six aqueducts: the solano aqueduct here, this would intersect it down here in contra costa; east bay municipal utility aqueduct; the contra costa county aqueduct; the los vaqueros aqueduct for the los vaqueros river; zone seven, down here in the livermore area, over here in this area; and also the south bay aqueduct, going all the way down to silicon valley. what has happened, if this solution were chosen, should the need ever arise for some reason, these critical water districts that supply the water to this entire bay area could get access to the sacramento river water. so if, for some reason, the delta was to become saline as a result of a collapse of a levee system or any other reason, we have a fail-safe solution for the entire bay region, except marin county, which has its own water system. either of these is a system that would be right-sized. that is a little sip big enough to provide 2 million acre-feet of water, which is roughly 40, 45 percent of the amount of water needed south of the delta for southern california, for los angeles, and for the san joaquin valley. that is the little sip solution: a route through the delta, a pipeline from here to old river, and then an open channel on the east side of old river to the pumps, or a canal across contra costa and solano county. either of them would work. and it would be a fraction of the cost of the massive twin tunnels that would come this direction, destroying the agricultural communities here in portland and clarksburg and putting at risk the entire delta because of the enormous size. this is a 15,000-cubic-foot-per-second tunnel system. now, granted, they are only going to build three of the intakes here on the sacramento river. okay. it is good to have only three. that gives you 9,000, which is roughly two-thirds of the water going down the sacramento river half of the year. so what does that mean for the delta? it means the delta is going to be salty and deprived of the freshwater that this estuary needs. and all they need to do is to put in one more intake, and then they can take all of the water half of the year. don't do it. never build something that could be so destructive of such a precious natural resource as the delta. so this is the little sip. where does the rest of the water come? it is called the big gulp. even in this drought year, there have been two very heavy rains that have sent a surge of water down the san joaquin and down the sacramento. the pumps were turned on--not to their full might, but the pumps were turned on, and the water was shipped to the south. okay. it worked. can it work in the future in normal years? there is sufficient water in the delta in a normal year to get another 2, 2.5 million acre-feet of water out of the delta, itself, and that is the big gulp. so you combine a small facility with a big gulp when the water is available in the delta. now, keep in mind, this project and the twin tunnel project that the governor is proposing both require storage south of the delta. neither project will work. and, in fact, the california water system today will not work without storage south of the delta. that is why--to back up to a map of all california--we have to have storage offsite, at sites reservoir. there is talk of enlarging shasta reservoir, way up here in this area. there is talk of building a new reservoir here on the san joaquin river at hanford's flat. there is talk of enlarging--in fact, this one is almost certain to happen-- enlarging los vaqueros reservoir. the san luis reservoir down here needs to be rebuilt because of earthquake safety, and it could be expanded. there is another reservoir site just south of it, los banos grande. that is another large reservoir. and, of course, the aquifers in the entire central valley of california, and we have already talked about the aquifers in southern california. so you have to have storage south of the delta. if you have storage south of the delta, then the governor's plan or my plan, the little sip, big gulp plan will work. storage is absolutely essential in all of these configurations. fail to do the storage, and nothing is going to work. let me just review what we have been talking about here. we have been talking about a water plant for all california. conservation, to be sure, the great agricultural areas--even over here in the salinas valley--conservation along this entire area, conservation in southern california, the great metropolitan areas, and in the bay area. in doing so, the state's own estimate was 5 million. let's just say you get 3 million acre-feet. agricultural conservation, urban conservation, 3 million acre-feet of new water, water that is currently unavailable but there. recycling, we talked about recycling here in southern california. a $2 to $3 billion investment will give you 1 million acre-feet of water, and you already have the storage systems in place, the underground aquifers of southern california. similarly, recycling in the bay area. sacramento, right here, starting just a month ago, a new recycling program, a $2 billion recycling program in sacramento to recycle water--some for that area, the rest to put clean water down the river rather than some of the water, which is a little shady. so recycling, another million acre-feet at least, maybe more, as you bring on the recycling in the bay area. now we have got 3 to 4 million acre-feet of water. storage systems, it is estimated that the sites reservoir can add in this drought here, were it available, would have been 900,000 acre-feet of water in this drought year. of course it is not built; it is not available. but on average, it should provide some 500,000--400,000 to 600,000 acre-feet of water annually out of sites reservoir; plus, as i described earlier, the ability to reoperate the great reservoirs and, together, be able to perhaps get even more water as a result of sites reservoir. the other reservoirs can provide additional water also. so we ought to be able, through these processes, to get somewhere near 5 million acre-feet of new water for california. if we have conservation, if we have the storage and we are able to get through the current drought, it is a safe bet that 5 million acre-feet of annual water yield will carry california into the next 30 to 50 years and beyond that, depending on population growth and technologies. i had not mentioned the use of this water out here. well, that is the pacific ocean. desalinization and recycling use exactly the same technology. recycling happens to be cheaper, in that it takes less energy to clean recycled water than to clean the ocean water because the ocean water has a lot of salts and other things in it, and it is just more expensive. but clearly, desalinization is also in our future. down here, in the san diego area, a new recycling plant is going online this year. they have been talking about one in santa barbara that actually was built but then mothballed because it rained again. but that one in santa barbara is likely to go back online as a result of the current drought and in anticipation of future droughts. so desalinization is also in california's future. those are the basic elements: conservation; recycling; creation of new storage systems; fixing the delta, the levees; little sip, big gulp strategy; science-driven process. keep in mind, you have got to be right on the science; otherwise, you are going to destroy this extraordinarily valuable habitat of the delta and other places. finally, you had better be paying attention to the water rights and the laws of california, which, unfortunately, in the first iteration of the bill that passed congress 4 years ago, just blew aside california water rights. so if you want to start a big, big water war, if you want to heighten and enflame a water war in california, push aside the water rights which, incidentally, is now taking place as a result of the drought. that is a water plan for all of california. it is here. it is available. my web site has it. i recommend it to anybody that is interested in a solution for [[page h4588]] california's long-term water problems; and also, i recommend to people that we have the federal government in the short term align its water policy programs from the epa--the environmental protection agency--the department of agriculture, the department of the interior, the army corps of engineers, that those water programs in the short term be aligned with the state of california's bond act so that we can promote, augment, and advance the projects that would be undertaken in the $7 billion water bond that the california voters passed last november. my plea to those who think the tunnels are the solution is: stop, take another look. take another look at the little sip, big gulp solution. this actually was something that was first proposed by the natural resources defense council. we were working with this about 5 years ago. they came up with the little sip, big gulp name, and with some modification, it is now a proposal that would cost a fraction of what the twin, massive, 40-foot-in-diameter tunnels would cost. so, for california, there is a future. it is the golden state. it is an economy unmatched by any other in the united states. it is an economy particularly--well, actually, the entire state's economy is stressed as a result of the drought. and if we take the kind of steps that i have been talking about here, we will be able to provide the water that california needs in the next drought and in the years to come as the population grows and as the economy grows. so that is the water plan for all california. there are many other pieces of the puzzle, one of which i am going to take just a second to talk about. and that is this week, as we take up the appropriations for water programs in the state of california--actually, water plans for the united states, not just the state of california--we ought to be mindful of a project called the land and water conservation fund, a program that has been in effect for half a century. it takes the royalties from the offshore oil and minerals onshore and allows much of that royalty to be spent on preserving the special places of america-- the wildlife refuges, very unique habitat areas--setting aside those areas, using that money to buy up the land and, in some cases, to buy up easements so that the land will forever remain available to future generations in a more natural state. that is the land and water conservation fund. unfortunately, the authorization for it expires this year, and at the moment, there is no perceived movement by the congress of the united states to reinstitute and reauthorize the land and water conservation fund. when i was deputy secretary of the department of the interior in the mid-nineties, we used this fund to set aside redwood forest off along the coast of california, to protect the everglades of florida, to set aside some of the land along the sand dunes on the great lakes. this is a project for all of america, one that is worthy of being reauthorized and properly funded. with that, mr. speaker, perhaps enough about california's drought. no, i will take that back. {time} 2015 mr. speaker, we have got a problem in california, short term and long term, and it deserves the attention of the congress of the united states because california is the seventh largest economy in the world and critically important to the future of this nation. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",34212

Mr. President, I ask that the Chair lay before the Senate the House message accompanying H.R. 644. The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message from the House of Representatives: Resolved, That the House agree to the amendment of the Senate to the title of the bill (H.R. 644) entitled ``An Act to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permanently extend and expand the charitable deduction for contributions of food inventory,'' and further Resolved, That the House agree to the amendment of the Senate, with an amendment.

The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: Cloture Motion We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to insist upon the Senate amendment, agree to the request by the House for a conference, and authorize the Presiding Officer to appoint conferees with respect to H.R. 644.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following leader remarks, the time until 11 a.m. this morning be equally divided between the leaders or their designees, and that the second-degree filing deadline for H.R. 2146 and H.R. 1295 be 10:30 a.m. this morning. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Trade Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate's top Democrat on trade announced his support for the bipartisan trade legislation we will vote on today. It adds to the renewed momentum we are seeing for America's workers. It is showing that Democrats can join Republicans to knock down unfair international barriers that discriminate against America's middle class--barriers that for too long have prevented American workers from selling more of what they make and American farmers from selling more of what they grow. It is demonstrating that both parties can work together to strengthen America's national security at home and America's leadership abroad, instead of simply ceding the future and one of the world's fastest growing regions to Chinese aggression. It is proving that our friends can rally with us and support 1.4 million [[Page S4524]] additional jobs in our country--including over 18,000 in Kentucky alone--as one study estimates new trade agreements with Europe and the Pacific could well support. These are the reasons a bill is gaining steam that would help advance all of these objectives--a bill that would enhance Congress's role in the trade process while ensuring Presidents of either party have the tools to secure strong and enforceable trade agreements. That is the bipartisan trade bill before us today. It passed the Finance Committee with strong bipartisan support in April. It passed the full Senate with strong bipartisan support in May. It just passed the House with backing from across the political spectrum as well, gaining the support of everyone from Chairman Ryan and Representative Hensarling on one side to Representative Kind on the other. Now it is time for the next step. I urge all of our colleagues to vote for cloture on this bipartisan trade bill today. That will open the way for final passage of TPA tomorrow. It will open the way for final passage of TAA and the AGOA and preferences measure the following day, too. Earlier this morning, Speaker Boehner reaffirmed his commitment to taking up TAA once it passes the Senate. He stated his desire to see both TAA and TPA on the President's desk by the end of this week, and he underlined the House's readiness to go to conference on the Customs bill. Speaker Boehner is clearly committed to building trust across the aisle on this issue, and I am as well. That is why I just moved to go to conference on the Customs bill. So this is where we are. Let's vote today. Let's vote today to move ahead on TPA, an important accomplishment for the country. Then we can vote to move ahead on TAA, AGOA, and preferences, and then we can vote to move ahead on Customs. If we all keep working together and trusting each other, then by the end of the week the President will have TPA, TAA, and AGOA and preferences on his desk, with Customs in the process of heading his way as well. Today is a very big vote. It is an important moment for the country. It sets in motion the completion of a project we set out on literally months ago, completing work on all four of the bills reported by the Finance Committee. That is what my friends on the other side have said they wanted, and that is what can be achieved by continuing to work together. Recognition of the Minority Leader The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized. Racism In America Mr. REID. Mr. President, our Nation's heart remains broken over the senseless tragedy last week in Charleston, SC. A young man full of hate took the lives of nine worshippers after they welcomed him into their Bible study. Once again, someone motivated by ignorance and hatred got his hands on a gun and inflicted pain on innocent Americans. Once again, we must witness the people of a community as they struggle to reconnect and put the pieces of their lives back together. Once again, we are looking at our newspapers, watching our TV screens, and talking at our dinner tables about why--why did this happen? As the painful details emerge, we cannot turn away from the hard truth this tragedy lays bare: Racism still exists in our society. We have to accept that reality. If we ever hope to change it, we have to accept that reality. I watched this weekend as pundits and the Nation's thought leaders attempted to address this issue by sidestepping the truth. This violent attack was racially motivated, plain and simple. It was intended to terrorize the African-American community both in Charleston and around this Nation. Fifty years after Dr. Martin Luther King led a March in Washington, 50 years after Congress passed the Civil Rights Act, 50 years after the march for voting rights in Selma, 50 years after Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, we must still face the hard truth about race in America. The truth is that we still have much to do. We must overcome. We have no choice. One cannot ignore this underlying issue. It deeply troubles our Nation that hatred and bigotry exist. The harsh reality of hatred and bigotry in this country, in addition to the consistent lack of opportunities in communities of color, have left far too many men and women of color feel that their lives really don't matter. It is easy to feel that your life doesn't matter when the odds are stacked against you every place you look, on every hand. Here are some of the facts African Americans face on a daily basis. Nearly half of all African-American families have lived in poor neighborhoods for at least two generations--50 percent compared to 7 percent of White families. An African-American man is far more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with crimes, and sentenced to longer prison terms than a White male--10 percent longer for the same crimes in the Federal system. In the State system, the numbers are even more skewed than that. These facts alone illustrate that countless men and women face unprecedented challenges and are still judged by the color of their skin, not the content of their character. We have a moral obligation to change these realities. We must do everything within our power to ensure that all Americans know that their lives matter. This means standing for what is right, calling out bigotry and hatred when it is seen and felt, and then taking action to address the bigotry. It is hard to fathom that even as the community of Charleston grapples with the devastation of this hateful act, African-American men and women have to walk under a Confederate flag when they step on the grounds of the South Carolina statehouse in Columbia, SC. The Confederate flag is a symbol of the dark past from which our country has come. It does not and should not represent our values or the way we treat our fellow Americans. It is a symbol of slavery. It is a symbol of White supremacy. There is no other way to explain it. It often flew high as vile organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan torched African-American churches. This symbol of the past has no place atop buildings that govern Americans. It is just not who we are, and certainly it shouldn't be who we want to be. The flag should be removed and now. Yesterday, Governor Nikki Haley of South Carolina said that in the Capitol of South Carolina the flag should not be flown. She said: We will do this in spite of what the State legislature feels. We have tried this in the past, and the State legislatures have said: No, we are keeping the flag flying. So I applaud her. I appreciate her courageous act so that the Confederate flag has no future in the future of South Carolina. It belongs in the past in every place in America, not just South Carolina. Anyone who desires to fly that flag on private property can do so, of course, but no State in our great Nation should allow this flag to soar above its capitol. It shouldn't soar in public places. We must always stand for what is right. We must stand for equality and justice and act to defend them. We must preserve and protect the rights of every American, not because it is the safe thing to do, not because it is popular or because it has political benefit. We must stand and defend equality and justice because that is the right thing to do. We must take meaningful action to ensure the safety of our citizens. Once again, our hearts are broken as another community struggles to recover from a mass shooting. I am going to mention now just a few of them: Fort Hood, 13 Americans killed, and this was on a military base; Tucson, AZ, 6 Americans killed; Carson City, NV, 4 Americans killed; Newtown, CT, 27 Americans dead, and 22 of them were innocent little children; Aurora, CO, in a movie theater, 12 killed; the Navy Yard, maybe a mile from here at the most, in the District of Columbia, 12 killed; Charleston, SC--of course we know 9 were killed while in a Bible study class. And these are not all of the violent acts; these are but a handful. All of these violent events occurred within the past few years. Our country, the United States, is the only advanced country where this type of mass violence occurs--the only country. Per capita, in America we kill each other with guns at a rate 297 times higher than Japan, 49 times higher than France, 33 times higher than Israel, and we outdistance every other country by far too much. [[Page S4525]] We can do something about this sad, violent reality. Let's do something. We can expand, for example, background checks for people who want to buy guns to prevent the mentally ill and criminals from buying guns. Is that asking too much--the mentally ill and criminals? More than 80 percent of the American people support this. Why can't we in Congress support it? The American people support it. It has bipartisan support. I say it over and over again. The American community is overwhelmingly in support of not giving guns to people who are mentally ill or felons. They shouldn't be able to buy guns. We should act to save lives by expanding these background checks. Isn't that the least we can do? I know people will come and say: Well, he wasn't a felon. Maybe so. But couldn't we do something? Couldn't we at least do this minimal thing to stop people who are sick in the head and people who are criminals from purchasing guns? Couldn't we at least do that? Einstein's definition of insanity is continuing the same thing over and over while expecting a different result, and that is what we are doing. For the future of our country, we have to change. In the face of racism and bigotry, we must act. We can't do nothing. We must prevent felons and the mentally ill from gunning down even more Americans in broad daylight. If we do not, we will be here again. Our hearts will be broken again. Again we will have to ask ourselves how we allowed another senseless tragedy to take place while we stood by doing nothing to prevent other deaths.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following leader remarks, the time until 11 a.m. this morning be equally divided between the leaders or their designees, and that the second-degree filing deadline for H.R. 2146 and H.R. 1295 be 10:30 a.m. this morning. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Trade Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate's top Democrat on trade announced his support for the bipartisan trade legislation we will vote on today. It adds to the renewed momentum we are seeing for America's workers. It is showing that Democrats can join Republicans to knock down unfair international barriers that discriminate against America's middle class--barriers that for too long have prevented American workers from selling more of what they make and American farmers from selling more of what they grow. It is demonstrating that both parties can work together to strengthen America's national security at home and America's leadership abroad, instead of simply ceding the future and one of the world's fastest growing regions to Chinese aggression. It is proving that our friends can rally with us and support 1.4 million [[Page S4524]] additional jobs in our country--including over 18,000 in Kentucky alone--as one study estimates new trade agreements with Europe and the Pacific could well support. These are the reasons a bill is gaining steam that would help advance all of these objectives--a bill that would enhance Congress's role in the trade process while ensuring Presidents of either party have the tools to secure strong and enforceable trade agreements. That is the bipartisan trade bill before us today. It passed the Finance Committee with strong bipartisan support in April. It passed the full Senate with strong bipartisan support in May. It just passed the House with backing from across the political spectrum as well, gaining the support of everyone from Chairman Ryan and Representative Hensarling on one side to Representative Kind on the other. Now it is time for the next step. I urge all of our colleagues to vote for cloture on this bipartisan trade bill today. That will open the way for final passage of TPA tomorrow. It will open the way for final passage of TAA and the AGOA and preferences measure the following day, too. Earlier this morning, Speaker Boehner reaffirmed his commitment to taking up TAA once it passes the Senate. He stated his desire to see both TAA and TPA on the President's desk by the end of this week, and he underlined the House's readiness to go to conference on the Customs bill. Speaker Boehner is clearly committed to building trust across the aisle on this issue, and I am as well. That is why I just moved to go to conference on the Customs bill. So this is where we are. Let's vote today. Let's vote today to move ahead on TPA, an important accomplishment for the country. Then we can vote to move ahead on TAA, AGOA, and preferences, and then we can vote to move ahead on Customs. If we all keep working together and trusting each other, then by the end of the week the President will have TPA, TAA, and AGOA and preferences on his desk, with Customs in the process of heading his way as well. Today is a very big vote. It is an important moment for the country. It sets in motion the completion of a project we set out on literally months ago, completing work on all four of the bills reported by the Finance Committee. That is what my friends on the other side have said they wanted, and that is what can be achieved by continuing to work together. Recognition of the Minority Leader The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized. Racism In America Mr. REID. Mr. President, our Nation's heart remains broken over the senseless tragedy last week in Charleston, SC. A young man full of hate took the lives of nine worshippers after they welcomed him into their Bible study. Once again, someone motivated by ignorance and hatred got his hands on a gun and inflicted pain on innocent Americans. Once again, we must witness the people of a community as they struggle to reconnect and put the pieces of their lives back together. Once again, we are looking at our newspapers, watching our TV screens, and talking at our dinner tables about why--why did this happen? As the painful details emerge, we cannot turn away from the hard truth this tragedy lays bare: Racism still exists in our society. We have to accept that reality. If we ever hope to change it, we have to accept that reality. I watched this weekend as pundits and the Nation's thought leaders attempted to address this issue by sidestepping the truth. This violent attack was racially motivated, plain and simple. It was intended to terrorize the African-American community both in Charleston and around this Nation. Fifty years after Dr. Martin Luther King led a March in Washington, 50 years after Congress passed the Civil Rights Act, 50 years after the march for voting rights in Selma, 50 years after Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, we must still face the hard truth about race in America. The truth is that we still have much to do. We must overcome. We have no choice. One cannot ignore this underlying issue. It deeply troubles our Nation that hatred and bigotry exist. The harsh reality of hatred and bigotry in this country, in addition to the consistent lack of opportunities in communities of color, have left far too many men and women of color feel that their lives really don't matter. It is easy to feel that your life doesn't matter when the odds are stacked against you every place you look, on every hand. Here are some of the facts African Americans face on a daily basis. Nearly half of all African-American families have lived in poor neighborhoods for at least two generations--50 percent compared to 7 percent of White families. An African-American man is far more likely to be stopped and searched by police, charged with crimes, and sentenced to longer prison terms than a White male--10 percent longer for the same crimes in the Federal system. In the State system, the numbers are even more skewed than that. These facts alone illustrate that countless men and women face unprecedented challenges and are still judged by the color of their skin, not the content of their character. We have a moral obligation to change these realities. We must do everything within our power to ensure that all Americans know that their lives matter. This means standing for what is right, calling out bigotry and hatred when it is seen and felt, and then taking action to address the bigotry. It is hard to fathom that even as the community of Charleston grapples with the devastation of this hateful act, African-American men and women have to walk under a Confederate flag when they step on the grounds of the South Carolina statehouse in Columbia, SC. The Confederate flag is a symbol of the dark past from which our country has come. It does not and should not represent our values or the way we treat our fellow Americans. It is a symbol of slavery. It is a symbol of White supremacy. There is no other way to explain it. It often flew high as vile organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan torched African-American churches. This symbol of the past has no place atop buildings that govern Americans. It is just not who we are, and certainly it shouldn't be who we want to be. The flag should be removed and now. Yesterday, Governor Nikki Haley of South Carolina said that in the Capitol of South Carolina the flag should not be flown. She said: We will do this in spite of what the State legislature feels. We have tried this in the past, and the State legislatures have said: No, we are keeping the flag flying. So I applaud her. I appreciate her courageous act so that the Confederate flag has no future in the future of South Carolina. It belongs in the past in every place in America, not just South Carolina. Anyone who desires to fly that flag on private property can do so, of course, but no State in our great Nation should allow this flag to soar above its capitol. It shouldn't soar in public places. We must always stand for what is right. We must stand for equality and justice and act to defend them. We must preserve and protect the rights of every American, not because it is the safe thing to do, not because it is popular or because it has political benefit. We must stand and defend equality and justice because that is the right thing to do. We must take meaningful action to ensure the safety of our citizens. Once again, our hearts are broken as another community struggles to recover from a mass shooting. I am going to mention now just a few of them: Fort Hood, 13 Americans killed, and this was on a military base; Tucson, AZ, 6 Americans killed; Carson City, NV, 4 Americans killed; Newtown, CT, 27 Americans dead, and 22 of them were innocent little children; Aurora, CO, in a movie theater, 12 killed; the Navy Yard, maybe a mile from here at the most, in the District of Columbia, 12 killed; Charleston, SC--of course we know 9 were killed while in a Bible study class. And these are not all of the violent acts; these are but a handful. All of these violent events occurred within the past few years. Our country, the United States, is the only advanced country where this type of mass violence occurs--the only country. Per capita, in America we kill each other with guns at a rate 297 times higher than Japan, 49 times higher than France, 33 times higher than Israel, and we outdistance every other country by far too much. [[Page S4525]] We can do something about this sad, violent reality. Let's do something. We can expand, for example, background checks for people who want to buy guns to prevent the mentally ill and criminals from buying guns. Is that asking too much--the mentally ill and criminals? More than 80 percent of the American people support this. Why can't we in Congress support it? The American people support it. It has bipartisan support. I say it over and over again. The American community is overwhelmingly in support of not giving guns to people who are mentally ill or felons. They shouldn't be able to buy guns. We should act to save lives by expanding these background checks. Isn't that the least we can do? I know people will come and say: Well, he wasn't a felon. Maybe so. But couldn't we do something? Couldn't we at least do this minimal thing to stop people who are sick in the head and people who are criminals from purchasing guns? Couldn't we at least do that? Einstein's definition of insanity is continuing the same thing over and over while expecting a different result, and that is what we are doing. For the future of our country, we have to change. In the face of racism and bigotry, we must act. We can't do nothing. We must prevent felons and the mentally ill from gunning down even more Americans in broad daylight. If we do not, we will be here again. Our hearts will be broken again. Again we will have to ask ourselves how we allowed another senseless tragedy to take place while we stood by doing nothing to prevent other deaths.

CREC-2015-06-23-pt1-PgS4525,CREC-2015-06-23,114,CLOTURE MOTION,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4525-S4529] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CLOTURE MOTION The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 11 a.m. will be equally divided. The Senator from Utah. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, later today the Senate will once again have an opportunity to vote on whether to renew trade promotion authority. The Senate has already considered this issue once and the House has voted on it twice, each time demonstrating strong bipartisan support for TPA. My hope is that we can get to a similar result with today's vote in the Senate. We need to be clear about what is at stake. The United States is currently negotiating a number of trade agreements with some of our most important trading partners in the world. If the Senate fails to approve this bill, neither Congress nor the American people will have a strong voice during these negotiations. As a result, our Nation will not be able to get the best trade agreements possible, if we are able to advance any trade agreements at all. Some people, including some of our colleagues, may be fine with that result. They do not think we need trade agreements to promote a healthy economy. But nothing could be further from the truth. As we all know, most of the world's consumers live outside our borders--95 percent of them. In addition, the vast majority of economic growth in the world is likely to occur outside of the United States over the next decade. If our workers, farmers, ranchers, and service providers are going to be able to compete in these growing markets, we must have open access to these markets and fair trade rules to boot. Without strong trade agreements, neither of these is possible. When it comes to international trade, we cannot stand still. If we don't lead and set the rules of the game, other nations will and our economy will be left behind. The United States continues to be a leader in agricultural exports throughout the world. In fact, we still export more agricultural goods than any other country. In addition, the United States continues to boast an enormous manufacturing base that supplies consumers in every corner of the globe. We also lead the world in technology, digital services, and innovation. Indeed, not only do we lead the world in creation of intellectual property, America essentially created the modern digital landscape. The United States also continues to lead in trade in services, exporting more than $700 billion in services in 2014 alone. That is more than twice as much as the United Kingdom, the world's second highest services exporter. I ask that the Parliamentarian let me know when my 10 minutes has expired. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified. Mr. HATCH. In other words, we know we can compete on the world stage when the rules are fair and the playing field is level. That is why I am such a strong proponent of this TPA legislation. This bill, which is the product of a great deal of work and a lot of bipartisan cooperation, will have a powerful and positive impact on industries throughout our economy, on consumers, and, of course, on American workers as well. In an America that embraces international trade, I believe even those individuals who encounter a temporary setback can find new opportunities, can out-work, out-produce, out-think, and out-innovate our global competition so long as the groundwork has been laid to give them those opportunities. That is why we need strong trade agreements, and that is why we need TPA. As you can surely tell, I feel very passionately about free trade, and I know many of my colleagues are just as passionate in their opposition. But as Congress has considered this legislation, I think we have had a full and fair debate on these issues. We have been transparent on the substance of the bill and in the way things have moved forward. Both sides have been able to make their case to the American people. It is at times such as these when working in Congress is the most rewarding. We have the opportunity to hear so many different accounts, sift through mountains of data and research, meet with hundreds of interested parties representing thousands of our constituents, and work through hotly contested differences. Then, after all of that work, when circumstances are right, we are able to come up with bipartisan legislation that addresses the needs of our country, our constituents, and our economy. That is what we have been able to do with this TPA debate, which is a debate that has been going on for many years now. I still want to work with those who may not share all my views on all these issues. One way we have agreed to do that is to help ensure that trade adjustment assistance, or TAA, will be extended. As you know, TAA has been included in the trade preferences bill the Senate will hopefully vote on later this week after we pass TPA. I have said many times that I am not a fan of TAA. Personally, I think the program is redundant and ineffective. However, after 38 years here in the Senate, believe me, I am well aware that everything is not about me. I understand TAA is a priority for a number of my colleagues and that it continues to be the price of admission for many who want to support TPA. The Senate majority leader recognizes this as well, which is why he has committed to ensuring that TAA gets a fair vote here in the Senate and a fair opportunity to pass. Throughout this process, we have done all we can, within reason, to accommodate the concerns of Senators. I am very appreciative of all the support we have received from Members on both sides of the aisle. We couldn't have gotten this far without that support. Now it is time to finish the work--to pass this bill and get it to the President's desk. We need this bill to ensure that our constituents' voices are heard in the trade negotiating process. We need this bill to give our trade negotiators the tools they need to get a good deal. And we need this bill to expand access to foreign markets so that we can grow our economy and create new and high-paying jobs here at home. That is what this bill is all about and why we have been working on this process for so long. We are very close to the finish line, and we need just one more burst of energy and a few more steps to get us there. I urge all my colleagues who support free trade, open markets, and the advancement of American values and interests abroad to join me once again in supporting TPA and working with me [[Page S4526]] and with my colleague Senator Wyden to get all the pending trade bills passed in the Senate and signed into law. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, over the last several weeks on the floor of both this body and the House, we have heard Members, colleagues, say they are tired of the old 1990s North American Free Trade Agreement playbook on trade. They are concerned that the package which is once again before the Senate is more of the same. Here is my message on why this legislation needs to move forward. If you believe those policies of the 1990s failed to protect American workers and strengthen our economy, this is our chance to set a new course. This is our chance to put in place higher standards in global trade on matters such as labor rights and environmental protection, to shine some real sunlight on trade agreements and ensure that our country writes the rules of the road. The fact is, in 2015, globalization is a reality. The choice is whether to sit back and allow globalization to push and pull on our economy until in ways dictated by countries in China. So our choice is either to move now and get into the center of the ring and fight for a stronger economic future, protect our workers and promote our values, or remain tethered to many of those old policies of the 1990s. I say to the Senate today: If you believe, like me, that it is time once and for all to close the books on the North American free-trade era in trade, this legislation deserves your support. In my hometown paper recently, there was an opinion article, and it stated that this trade bill lays out ``a hard-and-fast checklist for the TPP, holding the Obama administration accountable for meeting its goals and conditions.'' The article goes on to say that this legislation ``will reorient priorities and improve the process for the TPP and other trade agreements in the future.'' I completely agree with that view, but the Senate doesn't have to take my word for it. Those are the words of Tim Nesbitt, the past president of the Oregon AFL-CIO, who has disagreed with me on trade often over the years. Yet now he states that this legislation we will vote on today provides a fresh opportunity for trade done right. When it comes to core American values--labor rights, environmental protection, and human rights--this legislation raises the bar and demands more from our trade negotiators than ever before. We have talked a lot about a race to the bottom. My view is that if our country doesn't fight to protect worker rights and the environment with tough, enforceable trade agreements, those priorities are going to wither away. China is certainly not going to take up the banner for American values in trade. So if you believe America should stop a race to the bottom on labor rights, environmental safeguards, and human rights, this legislation is our chance to lift up global standards. I want to talk for a moment about the economic potential of this legislation. What we all understand we need to do is make things here, grow things here, add value to them here, and then ship them somewhere. My State knows how to make this happen, and so do many others. About one out of five jobs in Oregon depends on international trade. Almost 90 percent of them are small and medium sized. And what we know is that in many instances those jobs pay better. The fact is, if our farmers want to sell their products in Japan--and this is true of agriculture all over America. A lot of our farmers face average tariffs of 40 percent. That is right. If you want to export some jam to Vietnam, it will be marked up by 90 percent. If you want to sell a bottle of wine--and we have wine growers with prosperous businesses all over the country--they have to fork over 50 percent of the value to the government. So if we believe other countries should open their markets to American exports, like the U.S. is open to theirs, this is our chance to break down the tariffs and other barriers. I want to touch for a moment again on how different this is than the 1990s. In the 1990s, nobody could have imagined the right tools to protect the modern Internet. Twenty-five years ago, it was impossible to make a living by setting up a business online. A cell phone was as big as a brick. In fact, the NAFTA negotiations began a year before the first Web site was set up. Today, Internet commerce is at the heart of our economy. If we want to cement America's leadership in the digital economy, this is our chance to vote for trade policies that will protect a free and open Internet. Now, I wish to mention again, apropos of how different this is, that I have felt for some time that critics of past trade policy have been spot on with respect to a lot of this secrecy which is just gratuitous. If we believe deeply in trade, as Chairman Hatch and I do, and want more of it, why should we have all this unnecessary secrecy which just makes people cynical about trade? So we have brought sunshine to this trade debate in a way that is unprecedented. For the first time, before the President can sign a deal, the full text has to be released to the public for 60 days. Before we can have votes in the other body and in the Senate, there will be no fewer than 4 months where people can open a proposed trade deal and read it for themselves. So picture that: For 4 months, the American people will have in their hands--starting with the TPP--what the trade agreement is all about. That is simply unprecedented. I wish to close the question of how we are going to proceed from here. This has obviously been a complicated piece of legislation. I appreciate the Senate and House leaders have committed to moving trade adjustment assistance alongside trade promotion authority as well as a proposal that originated with Senator Brown to strengthen our critically important trade enforcement laws. While the goal of enacting trade policies is a tool to give all Americans a chance to get ahead, trade adjustment assistance is an absolute must-pass bill, and I am confident it is going to get through Congress to the President's desk. That bill includes the vitally important program also that creates new opportunities for impoverished nations in Africa. The Customs enforcement bill is also moving forward on a bipartisan basis, and there is important work there to be done. The Senate must resolve differences in the enforcement bill with the other body. I wish to make it clear this morning that I expect that conference to respect Democratic priorities. My Democratic colleagues and I will be laying down markers on several of our top priorities. I discussed those priorities with Chairman Ryan last night. Those priorities include provisions in the Senate bill championed by Senator Shaheen to help our small businesses, provisions authored by Senator Bennet to address enforcement environmental laws, and Senator Cantwell's important trade enforcement trust fund. In my view, the Congress has an opportunity in this legislation to show it can work in a bipartisan way to take on one of the premier economic challenges of our time. Our job is to get past the policies of the 1990s and move toward getting trade done right. Colleagues, let's pry open foreign markets and send more of our exports abroad. Let's fight for the American brand and the Oregon brand against the trade chiefs and the bad actors who are blocking our way, and let's raise the bar for American values and open our trade policies to sunlight. I urge all in the Senate to vote yes on cloture today and to support this package as it advances this week. In effect, we get three important bills done this week and set in motion. I yield the floor. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the motion to invoke cloture on TPA, the so-called fast-track legislation. I am still incredulous, as I have watched this trade nondebate, if you will, at the speed at which, time after time, the majority leader has tried to shut down debate. It has happened again and again, and that is compounded by the secrecy of this whole process. [[Page S4527]] I can't count the number of times in my State of Ohio and in meetings in Washington, with people from all over the country, that people have said we have little or no access to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. TPA, in the past--fast-track--has actually been sort of a rule book for how we should negotiate trade agreements and, at the same time, has been a direction on how to negotiate these trade agreements and a rule book on how it is presented on the Senate floor. Yet none of the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations by Ambassador Froman have been informed at all by a TPA because we haven't had a TPA yet. We haven't even had an instruction booklet in the past. At the same time, we have gotten the worst of both worlds because we are voting on TPA, and we really haven't been able to see what is in TPP. I know supporters of TPP will say we are going to have 60 days now, but Members are casting their votes now--where 60 votes are required and they have maximum leverage-- to put no final point on it, just giving up the leverage they have as we are still kept in the dark on what is happening. Let me give one example before I get to where I think we are making a mistake by moving so quickly today, in essence, fast-tracking fast- track. One example, my office and I personally have repeatedly spoken to the President of the United States and the U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Froman, repeatedly asking them to fix some of the language on tobacco. Because one of the things that apparently--we really don't know for sure--the Trans-Pacific Partnership does is it gives even more power to American tobacco companies--more power to American tobacco companies to have influence over laws in particularly small countries which don't have the wherewithal and can't afford the huge legal bills a large tobacco company can afford to write public health law. If a small country wants to write a law to protect their children from marketing of tobacco products--which is what we have done in this country--the U.S. tobacco company or British tobacco company can--let's keep it here. The U.S. tobacco company can threaten a lawsuit against those countries, and those countries are probably going to back off because they probably can't afford to go to court with the big American tobacco company. Even something as clearly violative of the public interest and of public health as what damage Big Tobacco inflicts on children has not, to our knowledge, been addressed. Again, so much of this is secretive that we don't even know that. That is why there is anger in this country and why there is--so many people in this country tell me, so many in my State: Why are you moving so fast? Why is this coming up right now? Why don't we know more about this whole process? Yet again, the majority leader is shutting down debate. He will be joined, I assume, by a small number, a distinct, small number of minority Democrats, getting up over the 60-vote margin so they can shut down debate, so they can move the TPA--the fast-track--forward, so they can get the Trans-Pacific Partnership down the road. No matter which side of the TPP debate, no matter which side of the trade promotion authority, TPA, fast-track--no matter which side you are on, it is clear that our trade policy creates winners and losers. It is clear. Even the most vigorous cheerleaders for free trade--the Wall Street Journal editorial board, for instance--even the strongest free-traders, even though people who reflectively support these free- trade agreements acknowledge there are winners and losers. They will argue that these trade agreements create more jobs than they lose. I don't agree with that. They argue that. Put that aside. But they also acknowledge that people lose jobs because of decisions we make. We are about to pass fast-track here. We are about to pass trade promotion authority, leading probably to the Trans-Pacific Partnership having a reasonable chance of passage. We are about to do that. We are making that decision here. Members of Congress, people who are well paid, with government-financed retirements and health care--we are about to make those decisions, and we know--we are knowingly making that decision, acknowledging that some people will lose their jobs because of a decision we make, but we are not going to take care of those workers. We are going to pass today the TPA, the trade promotion authority, fast-track. We are going to pass that and ignore those workers. How shameful is that that we know the decisions we are making in this body--we are making the decisions, the President of the United States makes this decision, the House of Representatives has made this decision, the Senate is about to make this decision, we are making this decision, knowing people will lose their jobs because of our actions. Yet we are unwilling to provide for those workers who lose their jobs. Let me give a little history, a special message to Congress. In January of 1962, President Kennedy said: When considerations of national policy make it desirable to avoid higher tariffs, those injured by that competition should not be required to bear the full brunt of the impact. Rather, the burden of economic adjustment should be borne in part by the Federal Government. That is President Kennedy at the advent, at the beginning, at the creation of the trade adjustment assistance, the support for workers who lose their jobs because of--again, I repeat--decisions we make in this body, in the House of Representatives, in the White House. We make decisions on trade. We know people will lose their jobs. We should help them. It should be our moral responsibility to help them. Senator Vance Hartke of Indiana said: ``No small group of firms and workers should be made to bear the full burden of the costs of a program whose great benefits enrich the Nation as a whole.'' This is as true today as it was 53 years ago. It is not a Democratic idea. It is not a Republican idea. Everyone from the Cato Institute--a libertarian-oriented think tank in Washington, a bunch of well-paid scholars who make pronouncements from on high about various kinds of public policy issues--to the Wall Street Journal--a similar body but one with greater ability to disseminate information--even those two venerable institutions admit the trade agreements do not create winners everywhere. A Cato Institute trade briefing says, ``All of those job losses are a painful but necessary part of the larger process of innovation and productivity increases.'' I am always a bit amused when people who--again, well-educated, good pay, dress like this, good benefits, good retirement, good health care--make pronunciations saying: Well, job losses are painful--not to us, of course. The same as editorial writers who make these decisions, these pronouncements on trade, they are not losing their jobs. People in my State are losing jobs on these fair trade agreements. We are going to inflict this pain. As the Cato Institute and the Wall Street Journal say, by the decisions we make, we are going to inflict pain on these workers. People are going to lose jobs in my town of Mansfield, OH. People are going to lose jobs where I grew up. People are going to lose jobs in Cleveland where I live now. People are going to lose jobs in Zanesville and Newark because of decisions we make today on fast- track, because of decisions we will make next year on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. People are going to lose their jobs, but we are going to vote today to cut off debate, and we are going to forget, at least temporarily, about helping those workers who lose jobs because of decisions we make. How immoral is that? How shameful is that? What a betrayal we are inflicting on those workers if we make this decision today. Former Wall Street Journal economics editor David Wessel writes, ``Even [free trade's] most fervent admirers concede trade creates winners and losers.'' I will debate until the cows come home the net benefits of these trade agreements. I think they are net job loss. But even if you believe these trade agreements are net job-gainers--I don't think there is a lot of evidence of that--but even if you believe that, we know people lose their jobs because of decisions we make. That is why Republicans in the past have supported trade adjustment assistance in principle and in policy going back decades. Fifteen years ago, President George W. Bush said, ``I recognize that some [[Page S4528]] American workers may face adjustment challenges''--that means they get thrown out of work. It is a nice way a President might talk about people he has left behind. Put that aside. ``I recognize that some American workers may face adjustment challenges as a result of trade.'' At least to President Bush's credit--I wish his words would be followed today on this floor by the majority leader, by Republican Leader McConnell as he cuts off debate and leaves behind trade adjustment assistance. President Bush said, ``I support helping these workers by reauthorizing and improving trade adjustment assistance programs that will give workers impacted by trade new skills, help them find new jobs quickly, and provide them with financial assistance.'' I can give lots of stories about people I know in Youngstown, Lima, Dayton, Hamilton, and people in Portsmouth who lost their jobs because of trade, but at least they have gotten a helping hand from a government that used to have their backs and believe in them--at least until today--from a government that actually will extend that hand and help them retrain. Maybe they can become a nurse, maybe they can work in information technology, maybe they can become a radiology technologist at the local hospital. Earlier this year, my colleague John Cornyn--Republican from Texas, the senior Senator and assistant Republican leader--told reporters that ``there is no doubt that the benefits of more trade do not fall uniformly. There are some segments of the economy that don't prosper as well.'' We know that. We have seen that acknowledgement across the board. Yet today Leader McConnell is going to cut off debate, even though decisions we have made have cost people their jobs. That is why we have a moral obligation. It is not a new idea. It is not a partisan idea. It is universally accepted. Trade deals don't benefit everybody. That is why this moral obligation to include trade adjustment assistance in any package with TPA is so important. We can't send a framework for a new trade deal to the President's desk without assistance for the workers who will be left behind, but that is not what we are doing today. Today, it is full-speed ahead, cut off debate, move ahead on fast-track, move ahead on trade promotion authority. I assume a number of my Democratic colleagues are going along with it. I hope the wrath of people in this country--if the House and Senate refuse to do what some of their leaders say they will, that they will pass trade adjustment assistance, that they will take care of those workers--if they don't live up to that promise--and many times in the past they haven't lived up to similar promises--a lot of my colleagues are going to go home and face people who say: Wait. You made a decision. I got thrown out of a job because of a decision you made, because of a decision you made as a House Member, because of a decision you made as a Senator, because of a decision you made, Mr. President. I was thrown out of work, and you passed on June 23--or whatever today is--fast-track without taking care of me, even though it was your decision that I lose my job. What kind of government--what kind of principles do we live under here? In March, conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote in National Review Online: To be sure, any trade deal, while a net plus overall, produces winners and losers. But the TPP will be accompanied by so-called Trade Adjustment Assistance, training and subsidies to help those negatively affected. Again, Krauthammer, as he is about 95 percent of the time, is wrong. He is wrong that it is going be accompanied by the trade adjustment assistance. The assumption all along, even among TPP proponents, has been that TPA would be passed in tandem with aid for workers. But you know, even though that is what we did first here, Republicans in the House of Representatives are unwilling to vote for them together. They are just not going to vote. Speaker Boehner, for some reason, acquiesced to the President of the United States, pulled them apart, and had separate votes. Think about the message we will send. If we put another huge trade deal--parenthetically, once-majority leader, Republican leader Trent Lott said: You can't pass a trade agreement in an even-numbered year. Do you know why he said that? He said that because people don't like trade deals in this country. People know NAFTA sold them out. They know CAFTA sold them out. They know PNTR with China sold them out. They know Korea sold them out. We heard these promises over and over. With NAFTA, we were promised 200,000 jobs in 2 years. Thank you, President Bush 1, and thank you, President Clinton, for that. We lost 680,000 net jobs. Central America Free Trade Agreement--thank you, President Bush 2, for that. Promises were made, big promises about job increases, big promises about wages going up. It didn't happen. Wages stayed flat. Jobs were lost. Thank you, President Bush 2, for that. Korea, South Korea Free Trade Agreement, negotiated in part by President Bush, pushed through the Senate by President Obama--thank you, Mr. Presidents of both parties, for that. They told us 70,000 jobs would be created out of the South Korea Free Trade Agreement. No, we have lost 75,000 jobs. Using the same formula that we have--we have seen this over and over. We know what happens. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that between 2009 and 2012, two-thirds of displaced manufacturing workers who did find new jobs ended up taking lower paying jobs. Most of those workers saw wage losses of more than 20 percent. You can debate whether the gains others experienced make these losses worth it. I don't think they do. I think if you have traveled darned near anywhere--if Members of Congress spent a little more time with people who can't contribute to them, with people who don't belong to a local rotary club, with people who might just work hard, play by the rules, not make a lot of money, barely make it, sometimes have their house foreclosed on, sometimes lose their job--if we would spend a little more time with people like that, I think we would see how these trade agreements are working. There is a debate to be had. I will cede it is debatable, whether these trade agreements--whether the evidence is that they create jobs or lose jobs. I think it is pretty clear they lose jobs. But there is no debate. There is no debate on what actually happens here. Because of decisions--I will repeat--before this vote coming up in about 60 seconds, because of decisions we make in this body--the President makes, Senators make, Congress men and women make--because of decisions we make in this body, people in our States, whether it is Arkansas or Arizona, Oregon, Utah or my State of Ohio, people lose jobs because of decisions we make. There is no question people lose jobs because of decisions we make. Anything short of providing for those workers who lose their jobs today, not doing this on a promise--we are basically trusting the majority leader who doesn't really like, I understand, the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program. We are relying on the word of Speaker Boehner, who doesn't particularly like trade adjustment assistance. We know most of the Members of his party in the House of Representatives do not particularly like trade adjustment assistance. We are going to rely on their promise. We are voting today on the fly. We are saying to workers in this country: Yes, we have made decisions that may have cost you your job. We are going to try to help you when you lose that job, but we are still going to go ahead today and do that. That is why I asked my colleagues to vote no on this motion today to invoke cloture on trade promotion authority. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. The legislative clerk read as follows: Cloture Motion We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the [[Page S4529]] Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 2146, an act to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow Federal law enforcement officers, firefighters, and air traffic controllers to make penalty-free withdrawals from governmental plans after age 50, and for other purposes. Mitch McConnell, Johnny Isakson, David Perdue, Chuck Grassley, Thom Tillis, Marco Rubio, Daniel Coats, John Cornyn, Michael B. Enzi, Kelly Ayotte, Orrin G. Hatch, Roger F. Wicker, Deb Fischer, Rob Portman, Cory Gardner, Richard Burr, Roy Blunt. The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 2146 shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Corker) and the Senator from Utah (Mr. Lee). Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Corker) would have voted ``yea.'' Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Menendez) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 60, nays 37, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 218 Leg.] YEAS--60 Alexander Ayotte Barrasso Bennet Blunt Boozman Burr Cantwell Capito Carper Cassidy Coats Cochran Coons Cornyn Cotton Crapo Daines Enzi Ernst Feinstein Fischer Flake Gardner Graham Grassley Hatch Heitkamp Heller Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kaine Kirk Lankford McCain McCaskill McConnell Moran Murkowski Murray Nelson Perdue Portman Risch Roberts Rounds Rubio Sasse Scott Shaheen Sullivan Thune Tillis Toomey Vitter Warner Wicker Wyden NAYS--37 Baldwin Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Cardin Casey Collins Cruz Donnelly Durbin Franken Gillibrand Heinrich Hirono King Klobuchar Leahy Manchin Markey Merkley Mikulski Murphy Paul Peters Reed Reid Sanders Schatz Schumer Sessions Shelby Stabenow Tester Udall Warren Whitehouse NOT VOTING--3 Corker Lee Menendez The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 60, the nays are 37. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to. Vote Explanation Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for rollcall vote No. 218, the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 2146, trade promotion authority. Had I been present, I would have voted nay. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4525-S4529] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CLOTURE MOTION The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 11 a.m. will be equally divided. The Senator from Utah. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, later today the Senate will once again have an opportunity to vote on whether to renew trade promotion authority. The Senate has already considered this issue once and the House has voted on it twice, each time demonstrating strong bipartisan support for TPA. My hope is that we can get to a similar result with today's vote in the Senate. We need to be clear about what is at stake. The United States is currently negotiating a number of trade agreements with some of our most important trading partners in the world. If the Senate fails to approve this bill, neither Congress nor the American people will have a strong voice during these negotiations. As a result, our Nation will not be able to get the best trade agreements possible, if we are able to advance any trade agreements at all. Some people, including some of our colleagues, may be fine with that result. They do not think we need trade agreements to promote a healthy economy. But nothing could be further from the truth. As we all know, most of the world's consumers live outside our borders--95 percent of them. In addition, the vast majority of economic growth in the world is likely to occur outside of the United States over the next decade. If our workers, farmers, ranchers, and service providers are going to be able to compete in these growing markets, we must have open access to these markets and fair trade rules to boot. Without strong trade agreements, neither of these is possible. When it comes to international trade, we cannot stand still. If we don't lead and set the rules of the game, other nations will and our economy will be left behind. The United States continues to be a leader in agricultural exports throughout the world. In fact, we still export more agricultural goods than any other country. In addition, the United States continues to boast an enormous manufacturing base that supplies consumers in every corner of the globe. We also lead the world in technology, digital services, and innovation. Indeed, not only do we lead the world in creation of intellectual property, America essentially created the modern digital landscape. The United States also continues to lead in trade in services, exporting more than $700 billion in services in 2014 alone. That is more than twice as much as the United Kingdom, the world's second highest services exporter. I ask that the Parliamentarian let me know when my 10 minutes has expired. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified. Mr. HATCH. In other words, we know we can compete on the world stage when the rules are fair and the playing field is level. That is why I am such a strong proponent of this TPA legislation. This bill, which is the product of a great deal of work and a lot of bipartisan cooperation, will have a powerful and positive impact on industries throughout our economy, on consumers, and, of course, on American workers as well. In an America that embraces international trade, I believe even those individuals who encounter a temporary setback can find new opportunities, can out-work, out-produce, out-think, and out-innovate our global competition so long as the groundwork has been laid to give them those opportunities. That is why we need strong trade agreements, and that is why we need TPA. As you can surely tell, I feel very passionately about free trade, and I know many of my colleagues are just as passionate in their opposition. But as Congress has considered this legislation, I think we have had a full and fair debate on these issues. We have been transparent on the substance of the bill and in the way things have moved forward. Both sides have been able to make their case to the American people. It is at times such as these when working in Congress is the most rewarding. We have the opportunity to hear so many different accounts, sift through mountains of data and research, meet with hundreds of interested parties representing thousands of our constituents, and work through hotly contested differences. Then, after all of that work, when circumstances are right, we are able to come up with bipartisan legislation that addresses the needs of our country, our constituents, and our economy. That is what we have been able to do with this TPA debate, which is a debate that has been going on for many years now. I still want to work with those who may not share all my views on all these issues. One way we have agreed to do that is to help ensure that trade adjustment assistance, or TAA, will be extended. As you know, TAA has been included in the trade preferences bill the Senate will hopefully vote on later this week after we pass TPA. I have said many times that I am not a fan of TAA. Personally, I think the program is redundant and ineffective. However, after 38 years here in the Senate, believe me, I am well aware that everything is not about me. I understand TAA is a priority for a number of my colleagues and that it continues to be the price of admission for many who want to support TPA. The Senate majority leader recognizes this as well, which is why he has committed to ensuring that TAA gets a fair vote here in the Senate and a fair opportunity to pass. Throughout this process, we have done all we can, within reason, to accommodate the concerns of Senators. I am very appreciative of all the support we have received from Members on both sides of the aisle. We couldn't have gotten this far without that support. Now it is time to finish the work--to pass this bill and get it to the President's desk. We need this bill to ensure that our constituents' voices are heard in the trade negotiating process. We need this bill to give our trade negotiators the tools they need to get a good deal. And we need this bill to expand access to foreign markets so that we can grow our economy and create new and high-paying jobs here at home. That is what this bill is all about and why we have been working on this process for so long. We are very close to the finish line, and we need just one more burst of energy and a few more steps to get us there. I urge all my colleagues who support free trade, open markets, and the advancement of American values and interests abroad to join me once again in supporting TPA and working with me [[Page S4526]] and with my colleague Senator Wyden to get all the pending trade bills passed in the Senate and signed into law. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, over the last several weeks on the floor of both this body and the House, we have heard Members, colleagues, say they are tired of the old 1990s North American Free Trade Agreement playbook on trade. They are concerned that the package which is once again before the Senate is more of the same. Here is my message on why this legislation needs to move forward. If you believe those policies of the 1990s failed to protect American workers and strengthen our economy, this is our chance to set a new course. This is our chance to put in place higher standards in global trade on matters such as labor rights and environmental protection, to shine some real sunlight on trade agreements and ensure that our country writes the rules of the road. The fact is, in 2015, globalization is a reality. The choice is whether to sit back and allow globalization to push and pull on our economy until in ways dictated by countries in China. So our choice is either to move now and get into the center of the ring and fight for a stronger economic future, protect our workers and promote our values, or remain tethered to many of those old policies of the 1990s. I say to the Senate today: If you believe, like me, that it is time once and for all to close the books on the North American free-trade era in trade, this legislation deserves your support. In my hometown paper recently, there was an opinion article, and it stated that this trade bill lays out ``a hard-and-fast checklist for the TPP, holding the Obama administration accountable for meeting its goals and conditions.'' The article goes on to say that this legislation ``will reorient priorities and improve the process for the TPP and other trade agreements in the future.'' I completely agree with that view, but the Senate doesn't have to take my word for it. Those are the words of Tim Nesbitt, the past president of the Oregon AFL-CIO, who has disagreed with me on trade often over the years. Yet now he states that this legislation we will vote on today provides a fresh opportunity for trade done right. When it comes to core American values--labor rights, environmental protection, and human rights--this legislation raises the bar and demands more from our trade negotiators than ever before. We have talked a lot about a race to the bottom. My view is that if our country doesn't fight to protect worker rights and the environment with tough, enforceable trade agreements, those priorities are going to wither away. China is certainly not going to take up the banner for American values in trade. So if you believe America should stop a race to the bottom on labor rights, environmental safeguards, and human rights, this legislation is our chance to lift up global standards. I want to talk for a moment about the economic potential of this legislation. What we all understand we need to do is make things here, grow things here, add value to them here, and then ship them somewhere. My State knows how to make this happen, and so do many others. About one out of five jobs in Oregon depends on international trade. Almost 90 percent of them are small and medium sized. And what we know is that in many instances those jobs pay better. The fact is, if our farmers want to sell their products in Japan--and this is true of agriculture all over America. A lot of our farmers face average tariffs of 40 percent. That is right. If you want to export some jam to Vietnam, it will be marked up by 90 percent. If you want to sell a bottle of wine--and we have wine growers with prosperous businesses all over the country--they have to fork over 50 percent of the value to the government. So if we believe other countries should open their markets to American exports, like the U.S. is open to theirs, this is our chance to break down the tariffs and other barriers. I want to touch for a moment again on how different this is than the 1990s. In the 1990s, nobody could have imagined the right tools to protect the modern Internet. Twenty-five years ago, it was impossible to make a living by setting up a business online. A cell phone was as big as a brick. In fact, the NAFTA negotiations began a year before the first Web site was set up. Today, Internet commerce is at the heart of our economy. If we want to cement America's leadership in the digital economy, this is our chance to vote for trade policies that will protect a free and open Internet. Now, I wish to mention again, apropos of how different this is, that I have felt for some time that critics of past trade policy have been spot on with respect to a lot of this secrecy which is just gratuitous. If we believe deeply in trade, as Chairman Hatch and I do, and want more of it, why should we have all this unnecessary secrecy which just makes people cynical about trade? So we have brought sunshine to this trade debate in a way that is unprecedented. For the first time, before the President can sign a deal, the full text has to be released to the public for 60 days. Before we can have votes in the other body and in the Senate, there will be no fewer than 4 months where people can open a proposed trade deal and read it for themselves. So picture that: For 4 months, the American people will have in their hands--starting with the TPP--what the trade agreement is all about. That is simply unprecedented. I wish to close the question of how we are going to proceed from here. This has obviously been a complicated piece of legislation. I appreciate the Senate and House leaders have committed to moving trade adjustment assistance alongside trade promotion authority as well as a proposal that originated with Senator Brown to strengthen our critically important trade enforcement laws. While the goal of enacting trade policies is a tool to give all Americans a chance to get ahead, trade adjustment assistance is an absolute must-pass bill, and I am confident it is going to get through Congress to the President's desk. That bill includes the vitally important program also that creates new opportunities for impoverished nations in Africa. The Customs enforcement bill is also moving forward on a bipartisan basis, and there is important work there to be done. The Senate must resolve differences in the enforcement bill with the other body. I wish to make it clear this morning that I expect that conference to respect Democratic priorities. My Democratic colleagues and I will be laying down markers on several of our top priorities. I discussed those priorities with Chairman Ryan last night. Those priorities include provisions in the Senate bill championed by Senator Shaheen to help our small businesses, provisions authored by Senator Bennet to address enforcement environmental laws, and Senator Cantwell's important trade enforcement trust fund. In my view, the Congress has an opportunity in this legislation to show it can work in a bipartisan way to take on one of the premier economic challenges of our time. Our job is to get past the policies of the 1990s and move toward getting trade done right. Colleagues, let's pry open foreign markets and send more of our exports abroad. Let's fight for the American brand and the Oregon brand against the trade chiefs and the bad actors who are blocking our way, and let's raise the bar for American values and open our trade policies to sunlight. I urge all in the Senate to vote yes on cloture today and to support this package as it advances this week. In effect, we get three important bills done this week and set in motion. I yield the floor. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the motion to invoke cloture on TPA, the so-called fast-track legislation. I am still incredulous, as I have watched this trade nondebate, if you will, at the speed at which, time after time, the majority leader has tried to shut down debate. It has happened again and again, and that is compounded by the secrecy of this whole process. [[Page S4527]] I can't count the number of times in my State of Ohio and in meetings in Washington, with people from all over the country, that people have said we have little or no access to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. TPA, in the past--fast-track--has actually been sort of a rule book for how we should negotiate trade agreements and, at the same time, has been a direction on how to negotiate these trade agreements and a rule book on how it is presented on the Senate floor. Yet none of the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations by Ambassador Froman have been informed at all by a TPA because we haven't had a TPA yet. We haven't even had an instruction booklet in the past. At the same time, we have gotten the worst of both worlds because we are voting on TPA, and we really haven't been able to see what is in TPP. I know supporters of TPP will say we are going to have 60 days now, but Members are casting their votes now--where 60 votes are required and they have maximum leverage-- to put no final point on it, just giving up the leverage they have as we are still kept in the dark on what is happening. Let me give one example before I get to where I think we are making a mistake by moving so quickly today, in essence, fast-tracking fast- track. One example, my office and I personally have repeatedly spoken to the President of the United States and the U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Froman, repeatedly asking them to fix some of the language on tobacco. Because one of the things that apparently--we really don't know for sure--the Trans-Pacific Partnership does is it gives even more power to American tobacco companies--more power to American tobacco companies to have influence over laws in particularly small countries which don't have the wherewithal and can't afford the huge legal bills a large tobacco company can afford to write public health law. If a small country wants to write a law to protect their children from marketing of tobacco products--which is what we have done in this country--the U.S. tobacco company or British tobacco company can--let's keep it here. The U.S. tobacco company can threaten a lawsuit against those countries, and those countries are probably going to back off because they probably can't afford to go to court with the big American tobacco company. Even something as clearly violative of the public interest and of public health as what damage Big Tobacco inflicts on children has not, to our knowledge, been addressed. Again, so much of this is secretive that we don't even know that. That is why there is anger in this country and why there is--so many people in this country tell me, so many in my State: Why are you moving so fast? Why is this coming up right now? Why don't we know more about this whole process? Yet again, the majority leader is shutting down debate. He will be joined, I assume, by a small number, a distinct, small number of minority Democrats, getting up over the 60-vote margin so they can shut down debate, so they can move the TPA--the fast-track--forward, so they can get the Trans-Pacific Partnership down the road. No matter which side of the TPP debate, no matter which side of the trade promotion authority, TPA, fast-track--no matter which side you are on, it is clear that our trade policy creates winners and losers. It is clear. Even the most vigorous cheerleaders for free trade--the Wall Street Journal editorial board, for instance--even the strongest free-traders, even though people who reflectively support these free- trade agreements acknowledge there are winners and losers. They will argue that these trade agreements create more jobs than they lose. I don't agree with that. They argue that. Put that aside. But they also acknowledge that people lose jobs because of decisions we make. We are about to pass fast-track here. We are about to pass trade promotion authority, leading probably to the Trans-Pacific Partnership having a reasonable chance of passage. We are about to do that. We are making that decision here. Members of Congress, people who are well paid, with government-financed retirements and health care--we are about to make those decisions, and we know--we are knowingly making that decision, acknowledging that some people will lose their jobs because of a decision we make, but we are not going to take care of those workers. We are going to pass today the TPA, the trade promotion authority, fast-track. We are going to pass that and ignore those workers. How shameful is that that we know the decisions we are making in this body--we are making the decisions, the President of the United States makes this decision, the House of Representatives has made this decision, the Senate is about to make this decision, we are making this decision, knowing people will lose their jobs because of our actions. Yet we are unwilling to provide for those workers who lose their jobs. Let me give a little history, a special message to Congress. In January of 1962, President Kennedy said: When considerations of national policy make it desirable to avoid higher tariffs, those injured by that competition should not be required to bear the full brunt of the impact. Rather, the burden of economic adjustment should be borne in part by the Federal Government. That is President Kennedy at the advent, at the beginning, at the creation of the trade adjustment assistance, the support for workers who lose their jobs because of--again, I repeat--decisions we make in this body, in the House of Representatives, in the White House. We make decisions on trade. We know people will lose their jobs. We should help them. It should be our moral responsibility to help them. Senator Vance Hartke of Indiana said: ``No small group of firms and workers should be made to bear the full burden of the costs of a program whose great benefits enrich the Nation as a whole.'' This is as true today as it was 53 years ago. It is not a Democratic idea. It is not a Republican idea. Everyone from the Cato Institute--a libertarian-oriented think tank in Washington, a bunch of well-paid scholars who make pronouncements from on high about various kinds of public policy issues--to the Wall Street Journal--a similar body but one with greater ability to disseminate information--even those two venerable institutions admit the trade agreements do not create winners everywhere. A Cato Institute trade briefing says, ``All of those job losses are a painful but necessary part of the larger process of innovation and productivity increases.'' I am always a bit amused when people who--again, well-educated, good pay, dress like this, good benefits, good retirement, good health care--make pronunciations saying: Well, job losses are painful--not to us, of course. The same as editorial writers who make these decisions, these pronouncements on trade, they are not losing their jobs. People in my State are losing jobs on these fair trade agreements. We are going to inflict this pain. As the Cato Institute and the Wall Street Journal say, by the decisions we make, we are going to inflict pain on these workers. People are going to lose jobs in my town of Mansfield, OH. People are going to lose jobs where I grew up. People are going to lose jobs in Cleveland where I live now. People are going to lose jobs in Zanesville and Newark because of decisions we make today on fast- track, because of decisions we will make next year on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. People are going to lose their jobs, but we are going to vote today to cut off debate, and we are going to forget, at least temporarily, about helping those workers who lose jobs because of decisions we make. How immoral is that? How shameful is that? What a betrayal we are inflicting on those workers if we make this decision today. Former Wall Street Journal economics editor David Wessel writes, ``Even [free trade's] most fervent admirers concede trade creates winners and losers.'' I will debate until the cows come home the net benefits of these trade agreements. I think they are net job loss. But even if you believe these trade agreements are net job-gainers--I don't think there is a lot of evidence of that--but even if you believe that, we know people lose their jobs because of decisions we make. That is why Republicans in the past have supported trade adjustment assistance in principle and in policy going back decades. Fifteen years ago, President George W. Bush said, ``I recognize that some [[Page S4528]] American workers may face adjustment challenges''--that means they get thrown out of work. It is a nice way a President might talk about people he has left behind. Put that aside. ``I recognize that some American workers may face adjustment challenges as a result of trade.'' At least to President Bush's credit--I wish his words would be followed today on this floor by the majority leader, by Republican Leader McConnell as he cuts off debate and leaves behind trade adjustment assistance. President Bush said, ``I support helping these workers by reauthorizing and improving trade adjustment assistance programs that will give workers impacted by trade new skills, help them find new jobs quickly, and provide them with financial assistance.'' I can give lots of stories about people I know in Youngstown, Lima, Dayton, Hamilton, and people in Portsmouth who lost their jobs because of trade, but at least they have gotten a helping hand from a government that used to have their backs and believe in them--at least until today--from a government that actually will extend that hand and help them retrain. Maybe they can become a nurse, maybe they can work in information technology, maybe they can become a radiology technologist at the local hospital. Earlier this year, my colleague John Cornyn--Republican from Texas, the senior Senator and assistant Republican leader--told reporters that ``there is no doubt that the benefits of more trade do not fall uniformly. There are some segments of the economy that don't prosper as well.'' We know that. We have seen that acknowledgement across the board. Yet today Leader McConnell is going to cut off debate, even though decisions we have made have cost people their jobs. That is why we have a moral obligation. It is not a new idea. It is not a partisan idea. It is universally accepted. Trade deals don't benefit everybody. That is why this moral obligation to include trade adjustment assistance in any package with TPA is so important. We can't send a framework for a new trade deal to the President's desk without assistance for the workers who will be left behind, but that is not what we are doing today. Today, it is full-speed ahead, cut off debate, move ahead on fast-track, move ahead on trade promotion authority. I assume a number of my Democratic colleagues are going along with it. I hope the wrath of people in this country--if the House and Senate refuse to do what some of their leaders say they will, that they will pass trade adjustment assistance, that they will take care of those workers--if they don't live up to that promise--and many times in the past they haven't lived up to similar promises--a lot of my colleagues are going to go home and face people who say: Wait. You made a decision. I got thrown out of a job because of a decision you made, because of a decision you made as a House Member, because of a decision you made as a Senator, because of a decision you made, Mr. President. I was thrown out of work, and you passed on June 23--or whatever today is--fast-track without taking care of me, even though it was your decision that I lose my job. What kind of government--what kind of principles do we live under here? In March, conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote in National Review Online: To be sure, any trade deal, while a net plus overall, produces winners and losers. But the TPP will be accompanied by so-called Trade Adjustment Assistance, training and subsidies to help those negatively affected. Again, Krauthammer, as he is about 95 percent of the time, is wrong. He is wrong that it is going be accompanied by the trade adjustment assistance. The assumption all along, even among TPP proponents, has been that TPA would be passed in tandem with aid for workers. But you know, even though that is what we did first here, Republicans in the House of Representatives are unwilling to vote for them together. They are just not going to vote. Speaker Boehner, for some reason, acquiesced to the President of the United States, pulled them apart, and had separate votes. Think about the message we will send. If we put another huge trade deal--parenthetically, once-majority leader, Republican leader Trent Lott said: You can't pass a trade agreement in an even-numbered year. Do you know why he said that? He said that because people don't like trade deals in this country. People know NAFTA sold them out. They know CAFTA sold them out. They know PNTR with China sold them out. They know Korea sold them out. We heard these promises over and over. With NAFTA, we were promised 200,000 jobs in 2 years. Thank you, President Bush 1, and thank you, President Clinton, for that. We lost 680,000 net jobs. Central America Free Trade Agreement--thank you, President Bush 2, for that. Promises were made, big promises about job increases, big promises about wages going up. It didn't happen. Wages stayed flat. Jobs were lost. Thank you, President Bush 2, for that. Korea, South Korea Free Trade Agreement, negotiated in part by President Bush, pushed through the Senate by President Obama--thank you, Mr. Presidents of both parties, for that. They told us 70,000 jobs would be created out of the South Korea Free Trade Agreement. No, we have lost 75,000 jobs. Using the same formula that we have--we have seen this over and over. We know what happens. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that between 2009 and 2012, two-thirds of displaced manufacturing workers who did find new jobs ended up taking lower paying jobs. Most of those workers saw wage losses of more than 20 percent. You can debate whether the gains others experienced make these losses worth it. I don't think they do. I think if you have traveled darned near anywhere--if Members of Congress spent a little more time with people who can't contribute to them, with people who don't belong to a local rotary club, with people who might just work hard, play by the rules, not make a lot of money, barely make it, sometimes have their house foreclosed on, sometimes lose their job--if we would spend a little more time with people like that, I think we would see how these trade agreements are working. There is a debate to be had. I will cede it is debatable, whether these trade agreements--whether the evidence is that they create jobs or lose jobs. I think it is pretty clear they lose jobs. But there is no debate. There is no debate on what actually happens here. Because of decisions--I will repeat--before this vote coming up in about 60 seconds, because of decisions we make in this body--the President makes, Senators make, Congress men and women make--because of decisions we make in this body, people in our States, whether it is Arkansas or Arizona, Oregon, Utah or my State of Ohio, people lose jobs because of decisions we make. There is no question people lose jobs because of decisions we make. Anything short of providing for those workers who lose their jobs today, not doing this on a promise--we are basically trusting the majority leader who doesn't really like, I understand, the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program. We are relying on the word of Speaker Boehner, who doesn't particularly like trade adjustment assistance. We know most of the Members of his party in the House of Representatives do not particularly like trade adjustment assistance. We are going to rely on their promise. We are voting today on the fly. We are saying to workers in this country: Yes, we have made decisions that may have cost you your job. We are going to try to help you when you lose that job, but we are still going to go ahead today and do that. That is why I asked my colleagues to vote no on this motion today to invoke cloture on trade promotion authority. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. The legislative clerk read as follows: Cloture Motion We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the [[Page S4529]] Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 2146, an act to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow Federal law enforcement officers, firefighters, and air traffic controllers to make penalty-free withdrawals from governmental plans after age 50, and for other purposes. Mitch McConnell, Johnny Isakson, David Perdue, Chuck Grassley, Thom Tillis, Marco Rubio, Daniel Coats, John Cornyn, Michael B. Enzi, Kelly Ayotte, Orrin G. Hatch, Roger F. Wicker, Deb Fischer, Rob Portman, Cory Gardner, Richard Burr, Roy Blunt. The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 2146 shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Corker) and the Senator from Utah (Mr. Lee). Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Corker) would have voted ``yea.'' Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Menendez) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 60, nays 37, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 218 Leg.] YEAS--60 Alexander Ayotte Barrasso Bennet Blunt Boozman Burr Cantwell Capito Carper Cassidy Coats Cochran Coons Cornyn Cotton Crapo Daines Enzi Ernst Feinstein Fischer Flake Gardner Graham Grassley Hatch Heitkamp Heller Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kaine Kirk Lankford McCain McCaskill McConnell Moran Murkowski Murray Nelson Perdue Portman Risch Roberts Rounds Rubio Sasse Scott Shaheen Sullivan Thune Tillis Toomey Vitter Warner Wicker Wyden NAYS--37 Baldwin Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Cardin Casey Collins Cruz Donnelly Durbin Franken Gillibrand Heinrich Hirono King Klobuchar Leahy Manchin Markey Merkley Mikulski Murphy Paul Peters Reed Reid Sanders Schatz Schumer Sessions Shelby Stabenow Tester Udall Warren Whitehouse NOT VOTING--3 Corker Lee Menendez The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 60, the nays are 37. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to. Vote Explanation Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for rollcall vote No. 218, the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 2146, trade promotion authority. Had I been present, I would have voted nay. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4525-S4529] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CLOTURE MOTION The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 11 a.m. will be equally divided. The Senator from Utah. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, later today the Senate will once again have an opportunity to vote on whether to renew trade promotion authority. The Senate has already considered this issue once and the House has voted on it twice, each time demonstrating strong bipartisan support for TPA. My hope is that we can get to a similar result with today's vote in the Senate. We need to be clear about what is at stake. The United States is currently negotiating a number of trade agreements with some of our most important trading partners in the world. If the Senate fails to approve this bill, neither Congress nor the American people will have a strong voice during these negotiations. As a result, our Nation will not be able to get the best trade agreements possible, if we are able to advance any trade agreements at all. Some people, including some of our colleagues, may be fine with that result. They do not think we need trade agreements to promote a healthy economy. But nothing could be further from the truth. As we all know, most of the world's consumers live outside our borders--95 percent of them. In addition, the vast majority of economic growth in the world is likely to occur outside of the United States over the next decade. If our workers, farmers, ranchers, and service providers are going to be able to compete in these growing markets, we must have open access to these markets and fair trade rules to boot. Without strong trade agreements, neither of these is possible. When it comes to international trade, we cannot stand still. If we don't lead and set the rules of the game, other nations will and our economy will be left behind. The United States continues to be a leader in agricultural exports throughout the world. In fact, we still export more agricultural goods than any other country. In addition, the United States continues to boast an enormous manufacturing base that supplies consumers in every corner of the globe. We also lead the world in technology, digital services, and innovation. Indeed, not only do we lead the world in creation of intellectual property, America essentially created the modern digital landscape. The United States also continues to lead in trade in services, exporting more than $700 billion in services in 2014 alone. That is more than twice as much as the United Kingdom, the world's second highest services exporter. I ask that the Parliamentarian let me know when my 10 minutes has expired. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified. Mr. HATCH. In other words, we know we can compete on the world stage when the rules are fair and the playing field is level. That is why I am such a strong proponent of this TPA legislation. This bill, which is the product of a great deal of work and a lot of bipartisan cooperation, will have a powerful and positive impact on industries throughout our economy, on consumers, and, of course, on American workers as well. In an America that embraces international trade, I believe even those individuals who encounter a temporary setback can find new opportunities, can out-work, out-produce, out-think, and out-innovate our global competition so long as the groundwork has been laid to give them those opportunities. That is why we need strong trade agreements, and that is why we need TPA. As you can surely tell, I feel very passionately about free trade, and I know many of my colleagues are just as passionate in their opposition. But as Congress has considered this legislation, I think we have had a full and fair debate on these issues. We have been transparent on the substance of the bill and in the way things have moved forward. Both sides have been able to make their case to the American people. It is at times such as these when working in Congress is the most rewarding. We have the opportunity to hear so many different accounts, sift through mountains of data and research, meet with hundreds of interested parties representing thousands of our constituents, and work through hotly contested differences. Then, after all of that work, when circumstances are right, we are able to come up with bipartisan legislation that addresses the needs of our country, our constituents, and our economy. That is what we have been able to do with this TPA debate, which is a debate that has been going on for many years now. I still want to work with those who may not share all my views on all these issues. One way we have agreed to do that is to help ensure that trade adjustment assistance, or TAA, will be extended. As you know, TAA has been included in the trade preferences bill the Senate will hopefully vote on later this week after we pass TPA. I have said many times that I am not a fan of TAA. Personally, I think the program is redundant and ineffective. However, after 38 years here in the Senate, believe me, I am well aware that everything is not about me. I understand TAA is a priority for a number of my colleagues and that it continues to be the price of admission for many who want to support TPA. The Senate majority leader recognizes this as well, which is why he has committed to ensuring that TAA gets a fair vote here in the Senate and a fair opportunity to pass. Throughout this process, we have done all we can, within reason, to accommodate the concerns of Senators. I am very appreciative of all the support we have received from Members on both sides of the aisle. We couldn't have gotten this far without that support. Now it is time to finish the work--to pass this bill and get it to the President's desk. We need this bill to ensure that our constituents' voices are heard in the trade negotiating process. We need this bill to give our trade negotiators the tools they need to get a good deal. And we need this bill to expand access to foreign markets so that we can grow our economy and create new and high-paying jobs here at home. That is what this bill is all about and why we have been working on this process for so long. We are very close to the finish line, and we need just one more burst of energy and a few more steps to get us there. I urge all my colleagues who support free trade, open markets, and the advancement of American values and interests abroad to join me once again in supporting TPA and working with me [[Page S4526]] and with my colleague Senator Wyden to get all the pending trade bills passed in the Senate and signed into law. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, over the last several weeks on the floor of both this body and the House, we have heard Members, colleagues, say they are tired of the old 1990s North American Free Trade Agreement playbook on trade. They are concerned that the package which is once again before the Senate is more of the same. Here is my message on why this legislation needs to move forward. If you believe those policies of the 1990s failed to protect American workers and strengthen our economy, this is our chance to set a new course. This is our chance to put in place higher standards in global trade on matters such as labor rights and environmental protection, to shine some real sunlight on trade agreements and ensure that our country writes the rules of the road. The fact is, in 2015, globalization is a reality. The choice is whether to sit back and allow globalization to push and pull on our economy until in ways dictated by countries in China. So our choice is either to move now and get into the center of the ring and fight for a stronger economic future, protect our workers and promote our values, or remain tethered to many of those old policies of the 1990s. I say to the Senate today: If you believe, like me, that it is time once and for all to close the books on the North American free-trade era in trade, this legislation deserves your support. In my hometown paper recently, there was an opinion article, and it stated that this trade bill lays out ``a hard-and-fast checklist for the TPP, holding the Obama administration accountable for meeting its goals and conditions.'' The article goes on to say that this legislation ``will reorient priorities and improve the process for the TPP and other trade agreements in the future.'' I completely agree with that view, but the Senate doesn't have to take my word for it. Those are the words of Tim Nesbitt, the past president of the Oregon AFL-CIO, who has disagreed with me on trade often over the years. Yet now he states that this legislation we will vote on today provides a fresh opportunity for trade done right. When it comes to core American values--labor rights, environmental protection, and human rights--this legislation raises the bar and demands more from our trade negotiators than ever before. We have talked a lot about a race to the bottom. My view is that if our country doesn't fight to protect worker rights and the environment with tough, enforceable trade agreements, those priorities are going to wither away. China is certainly not going to take up the banner for American values in trade. So if you believe America should stop a race to the bottom on labor rights, environmental safeguards, and human rights, this legislation is our chance to lift up global standards. I want to talk for a moment about the economic potential of this legislation. What we all understand we need to do is make things here, grow things here, add value to them here, and then ship them somewhere. My State knows how to make this happen, and so do many others. About one out of five jobs in Oregon depends on international trade. Almost 90 percent of them are small and medium sized. And what we know is that in many instances those jobs pay better. The fact is, if our farmers want to sell their products in Japan--and this is true of agriculture all over America. A lot of our farmers face average tariffs of 40 percent. That is right. If you want to export some jam to Vietnam, it will be marked up by 90 percent. If you want to sell a bottle of wine--and we have wine growers with prosperous businesses all over the country--they have to fork over 50 percent of the value to the government. So if we believe other countries should open their markets to American exports, like the U.S. is open to theirs, this is our chance to break down the tariffs and other barriers. I want to touch for a moment again on how different this is than the 1990s. In the 1990s, nobody could have imagined the right tools to protect the modern Internet. Twenty-five years ago, it was impossible to make a living by setting up a business online. A cell phone was as big as a brick. In fact, the NAFTA negotiations began a year before the first Web site was set up. Today, Internet commerce is at the heart of our economy. If we want to cement America's leadership in the digital economy, this is our chance to vote for trade policies that will protect a free and open Internet. Now, I wish to mention again, apropos of how different this is, that I have felt for some time that critics of past trade policy have been spot on with respect to a lot of this secrecy which is just gratuitous. If we believe deeply in trade, as Chairman Hatch and I do, and want more of it, why should we have all this unnecessary secrecy which just makes people cynical about trade? So we have brought sunshine to this trade debate in a way that is unprecedented. For the first time, before the President can sign a deal, the full text has to be released to the public for 60 days. Before we can have votes in the other body and in the Senate, there will be no fewer than 4 months where people can open a proposed trade deal and read it for themselves. So picture that: For 4 months, the American people will have in their hands--starting with the TPP--what the trade agreement is all about. That is simply unprecedented. I wish to close the question of how we are going to proceed from here. This has obviously been a complicated piece of legislation. I appreciate the Senate and House leaders have committed to moving trade adjustment assistance alongside trade promotion authority as well as a proposal that originated with Senator Brown to strengthen our critically important trade enforcement laws. While the goal of enacting trade policies is a tool to give all Americans a chance to get ahead, trade adjustment assistance is an absolute must-pass bill, and I am confident it is going to get through Congress to the President's desk. That bill includes the vitally important program also that creates new opportunities for impoverished nations in Africa. The Customs enforcement bill is also moving forward on a bipartisan basis, and there is important work there to be done. The Senate must resolve differences in the enforcement bill with the other body. I wish to make it clear this morning that I expect that conference to respect Democratic priorities. My Democratic colleagues and I will be laying down markers on several of our top priorities. I discussed those priorities with Chairman Ryan last night. Those priorities include provisions in the Senate bill championed by Senator Shaheen to help our small businesses, provisions authored by Senator Bennet to address enforcement environmental laws, and Senator Cantwell's important trade enforcement trust fund. In my view, the Congress has an opportunity in this legislation to show it can work in a bipartisan way to take on one of the premier economic challenges of our time. Our job is to get past the policies of the 1990s and move toward getting trade done right. Colleagues, let's pry open foreign markets and send more of our exports abroad. Let's fight for the American brand and the Oregon brand against the trade chiefs and the bad actors who are blocking our way, and let's raise the bar for American values and open our trade policies to sunlight. I urge all in the Senate to vote yes on cloture today and to support this package as it advances this week. In effect, we get three important bills done this week and set in motion. I yield the floor. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the motion to invoke cloture on TPA, the so-called fast-track legislation. I am still incredulous, as I have watched this trade nondebate, if you will, at the speed at which, time after time, the majority leader has tried to shut down debate. It has happened again and again, and that is compounded by the secrecy of this whole process. [[Page S4527]] I can't count the number of times in my State of Ohio and in meetings in Washington, with people from all over the country, that people have said we have little or no access to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. TPA, in the past--fast-track--has actually been sort of a rule book for how we should negotiate trade agreements and, at the same time, has been a direction on how to negotiate these trade agreements and a rule book on how it is presented on the Senate floor. Yet none of the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations by Ambassador Froman have been informed at all by a TPA because we haven't had a TPA yet. We haven't even had an instruction booklet in the past. At the same time, we have gotten the worst of both worlds because we are voting on TPA, and we really haven't been able to see what is in TPP. I know supporters of TPP will say we are going to have 60 days now, but Members are casting their votes now--where 60 votes are required and they have maximum leverage-- to put no final point on it, just giving up the leverage they have as we are still kept in the dark on what is happening. Let me give one example before I get to where I think we are making a mistake by moving so quickly today, in essence, fast-tracking fast- track. One example, my office and I personally have repeatedly spoken to the President of the United States and the U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Froman, repeatedly asking them to fix some of the language on tobacco. Because one of the things that apparently--we really don't know for sure--the Trans-Pacific Partnership does is it gives even more power to American tobacco companies--more power to American tobacco companies to have influence over laws in particularly small countries which don't have the wherewithal and can't afford the huge legal bills a large tobacco company can afford to write public health law. If a small country wants to write a law to protect their children from marketing of tobacco products--which is what we have done in this country--the U.S. tobacco company or British tobacco company can--let's keep it here. The U.S. tobacco company can threaten a lawsuit against those countries, and those countries are probably going to back off because they probably can't afford to go to court with the big American tobacco company. Even something as clearly violative of the public interest and of public health as what damage Big Tobacco inflicts on children has not, to our knowledge, been addressed. Again, so much of this is secretive that we don't even know that. That is why there is anger in this country and why there is--so many people in this country tell me, so many in my State: Why are you moving so fast? Why is this coming up right now? Why don't we know more about this whole process? Yet again, the majority leader is shutting down debate. He will be joined, I assume, by a small number, a distinct, small number of minority Democrats, getting up over the 60-vote margin so they can shut down debate, so they can move the TPA--the fast-track--forward, so they can get the Trans-Pacific Partnership down the road. No matter which side of the TPP debate, no matter which side of the trade promotion authority, TPA, fast-track--no matter which side you are on, it is clear that our trade policy creates winners and losers. It is clear. Even the most vigorous cheerleaders for free trade--the Wall Street Journal editorial board, for instance--even the strongest free-traders, even though people who reflectively support these free- trade agreements acknowledge there are winners and losers. They will argue that these trade agreements create more jobs than they lose. I don't agree with that. They argue that. Put that aside. But they also acknowledge that people lose jobs because of decisions we make. We are about to pass fast-track here. We are about to pass trade promotion authority, leading probably to the Trans-Pacific Partnership having a reasonable chance of passage. We are about to do that. We are making that decision here. Members of Congress, people who are well paid, with government-financed retirements and health care--we are about to make those decisions, and we know--we are knowingly making that decision, acknowledging that some people will lose their jobs because of a decision we make, but we are not going to take care of those workers. We are going to pass today the TPA, the trade promotion authority, fast-track. We are going to pass that and ignore those workers. How shameful is that that we know the decisions we are making in this body--we are making the decisions, the President of the United States makes this decision, the House of Representatives has made this decision, the Senate is about to make this decision, we are making this decision, knowing people will lose their jobs because of our actions. Yet we are unwilling to provide for those workers who lose their jobs. Let me give a little history, a special message to Congress. In January of 1962, President Kennedy said: When considerations of national policy make it desirable to avoid higher tariffs, those injured by that competition should not be required to bear the full brunt of the impact. Rather, the burden of economic adjustment should be borne in part by the Federal Government. That is President Kennedy at the advent, at the beginning, at the creation of the trade adjustment assistance, the support for workers who lose their jobs because of--again, I repeat--decisions we make in this body, in the House of Representatives, in the White House. We make decisions on trade. We know people will lose their jobs. We should help them. It should be our moral responsibility to help them. Senator Vance Hartke of Indiana said: ``No small group of firms and workers should be made to bear the full burden of the costs of a program whose great benefits enrich the Nation as a whole.'' This is as true today as it was 53 years ago. It is not a Democratic idea. It is not a Republican idea. Everyone from the Cato Institute--a libertarian-oriented think tank in Washington, a bunch of well-paid scholars who make pronouncements from on high about various kinds of public policy issues--to the Wall Street Journal--a similar body but one with greater ability to disseminate information--even those two venerable institutions admit the trade agreements do not create winners everywhere. A Cato Institute trade briefing says, ``All of those job losses are a painful but necessary part of the larger process of innovation and productivity increases.'' I am always a bit amused when people who--again, well-educated, good pay, dress like this, good benefits, good retirement, good health care--make pronunciations saying: Well, job losses are painful--not to us, of course. The same as editorial writers who make these decisions, these pronouncements on trade, they are not losing their jobs. People in my State are losing jobs on these fair trade agreements. We are going to inflict this pain. As the Cato Institute and the Wall Street Journal say, by the decisions we make, we are going to inflict pain on these workers. People are going to lose jobs in my town of Mansfield, OH. People are going to lose jobs where I grew up. People are going to lose jobs in Cleveland where I live now. People are going to lose jobs in Zanesville and Newark because of decisions we make today on fast- track, because of decisions we will make next year on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. People are going to lose their jobs, but we are going to vote today to cut off debate, and we are going to forget, at least temporarily, about helping those workers who lose jobs because of decisions we make. How immoral is that? How shameful is that? What a betrayal we are inflicting on those workers if we make this decision today. Former Wall Street Journal economics editor David Wessel writes, ``Even [free trade's] most fervent admirers concede trade creates winners and losers.'' I will debate until the cows come home the net benefits of these trade agreements. I think they are net job loss. But even if you believe these trade agreements are net job-gainers--I don't think there is a lot of evidence of that--but even if you believe that, we know people lose their jobs because of decisions we make. That is why Republicans in the past have supported trade adjustment assistance in principle and in policy going back decades. Fifteen years ago, President George W. Bush said, ``I recognize that some [[Page S4528]] American workers may face adjustment challenges''--that means they get thrown out of work. It is a nice way a President might talk about people he has left behind. Put that aside. ``I recognize that some American workers may face adjustment challenges as a result of trade.'' At least to President Bush's credit--I wish his words would be followed today on this floor by the majority leader, by Republican Leader McConnell as he cuts off debate and leaves behind trade adjustment assistance. President Bush said, ``I support helping these workers by reauthorizing and improving trade adjustment assistance programs that will give workers impacted by trade new skills, help them find new jobs quickly, and provide them with financial assistance.'' I can give lots of stories about people I know in Youngstown, Lima, Dayton, Hamilton, and people in Portsmouth who lost their jobs because of trade, but at least they have gotten a helping hand from a government that used to have their backs and believe in them--at least until today--from a government that actually will extend that hand and help them retrain. Maybe they can become a nurse, maybe they can work in information technology, maybe they can become a radiology technologist at the local hospital. Earlier this year, my colleague John Cornyn--Republican from Texas, the senior Senator and assistant Republican leader--told reporters that ``there is no doubt that the benefits of more trade do not fall uniformly. There are some segments of the economy that don't prosper as well.'' We know that. We have seen that acknowledgement across the board. Yet today Leader McConnell is going to cut off debate, even though decisions we have made have cost people their jobs. That is why we have a moral obligation. It is not a new idea. It is not a partisan idea. It is universally accepted. Trade deals don't benefit everybody. That is why this moral obligation to include trade adjustment assistance in any package with TPA is so important. We can't send a framework for a new trade deal to the President's desk without assistance for the workers who will be left behind, but that is not what we are doing today. Today, it is full-speed ahead, cut off debate, move ahead on fast-track, move ahead on trade promotion authority. I assume a number of my Democratic colleagues are going along with it. I hope the wrath of people in this country--if the House and Senate refuse to do what some of their leaders say they will, that they will pass trade adjustment assistance, that they will take care of those workers--if they don't live up to that promise--and many times in the past they haven't lived up to similar promises--a lot of my colleagues are going to go home and face people who say: Wait. You made a decision. I got thrown out of a job because of a decision you made, because of a decision you made as a House Member, because of a decision you made as a Senator, because of a decision you made, Mr. President. I was thrown out of work, and you passed on June 23--or whatever today is--fast-track without taking care of me, even though it was your decision that I lose my job. What kind of government--what kind of principles do we live under here? In March, conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote in National Review Online: To be sure, any trade deal, while a net plus overall, produces winners and losers. But the TPP will be accompanied by so-called Trade Adjustment Assistance, training and subsidies to help those negatively affected. Again, Krauthammer, as he is about 95 percent of the time, is wrong. He is wrong that it is going be accompanied by the trade adjustment assistance. The assumption all along, even among TPP proponents, has been that TPA would be passed in tandem with aid for workers. But you know, even though that is what we did first here, Republicans in the House of Representatives are unwilling to vote for them together. They are just not going to vote. Speaker Boehner, for some reason, acquiesced to the President of the United States, pulled them apart, and had separate votes. Think about the message we will send. If we put another huge trade deal--parenthetically, once-majority leader, Republican leader Trent Lott said: You can't pass a trade agreement in an even-numbered year. Do you know why he said that? He said that because people don't like trade deals in this country. People know NAFTA sold them out. They know CAFTA sold them out. They know PNTR with China sold them out. They know Korea sold them out. We heard these promises over and over. With NAFTA, we were promised 200,000 jobs in 2 years. Thank you, President Bush 1, and thank you, President Clinton, for that. We lost 680,000 net jobs. Central America Free Trade Agreement--thank you, President Bush 2, for that. Promises were made, big promises about job increases, big promises about wages going up. It didn't happen. Wages stayed flat. Jobs were lost. Thank you, President Bush 2, for that. Korea, South Korea Free Trade Agreement, negotiated in part by President Bush, pushed through the Senate by President Obama--thank you, Mr. Presidents of both parties, for that. They told us 70,000 jobs would be created out of the South Korea Free Trade Agreement. No, we have lost 75,000 jobs. Using the same formula that we have--we have seen this over and over. We know what happens. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that between 2009 and 2012, two-thirds of displaced manufacturing workers who did find new jobs ended up taking lower paying jobs. Most of those workers saw wage losses of more than 20 percent. You can debate whether the gains others experienced make these losses worth it. I don't think they do. I think if you have traveled darned near anywhere--if Members of Congress spent a little more time with people who can't contribute to them, with people who don't belong to a local rotary club, with people who might just work hard, play by the rules, not make a lot of money, barely make it, sometimes have their house foreclosed on, sometimes lose their job--if we would spend a little more time with people like that, I think we would see how these trade agreements are working. There is a debate to be had. I will cede it is debatable, whether these trade agreements--whether the evidence is that they create jobs or lose jobs. I think it is pretty clear they lose jobs. But there is no debate. There is no debate on what actually happens here. Because of decisions--I will repeat--before this vote coming up in about 60 seconds, because of decisions we make in this body--the President makes, Senators make, Congress men and women make--because of decisions we make in this body, people in our States, whether it is Arkansas or Arizona, Oregon, Utah or my State of Ohio, people lose jobs because of decisions we make. There is no question people lose jobs because of decisions we make. Anything short of providing for those workers who lose their jobs today, not doing this on a promise--we are basically trusting the majority leader who doesn't really like, I understand, the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program. We are relying on the word of Speaker Boehner, who doesn't particularly like trade adjustment assistance. We know most of the Members of his party in the House of Representatives do not particularly like trade adjustment assistance. We are going to rely on their promise. We are voting today on the fly. We are saying to workers in this country: Yes, we have made decisions that may have cost you your job. We are going to try to help you when you lose that job, but we are still going to go ahead today and do that. That is why I asked my colleagues to vote no on this motion today to invoke cloture on trade promotion authority. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. The legislative clerk read as follows: Cloture Motion We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the [[Page S4529]] Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 2146, an act to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow Federal law enforcement officers, firefighters, and air traffic controllers to make penalty-free withdrawals from governmental plans after age 50, and for other purposes. Mitch McConnell, Johnny Isakson, David Perdue, Chuck Grassley, Thom Tillis, Marco Rubio, Daniel Coats, John Cornyn, Michael B. Enzi, Kelly Ayotte, Orrin G. Hatch, Roger F. Wicker, Deb Fischer, Rob Portman, Cory Gardner, Richard Burr, Roy Blunt. The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 2146 shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Corker) and the Senator from Utah (Mr. Lee). Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Corker) would have voted ``yea.'' Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Menendez) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 60, nays 37, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 218 Leg.] YEAS--60 Alexander Ayotte Barrasso Bennet Blunt Boozman Burr Cantwell Capito Carper Cassidy Coats Cochran Coons Cornyn Cotton Crapo Daines Enzi Ernst Feinstein Fischer Flake Gardner Graham Grassley Hatch Heitkamp Heller Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kaine Kirk Lankford McCain McCaskill McConnell Moran Murkowski Murray Nelson Perdue Portman Risch Roberts Rounds Rubio Sasse Scott Shaheen Sullivan Thune Tillis Toomey Vitter Warner Wicker Wyden NAYS--37 Baldwin Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Cardin Casey Collins Cruz Donnelly Durbin Franken Gillibrand Heinrich Hirono King Klobuchar Leahy Manchin Markey Merkley Mikulski Murphy Paul Peters Reed Reid Sanders Schatz Schumer Sessions Shelby Stabenow Tester Udall Warren Whitehouse NOT VOTING--3 Corker Lee Menendez The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for rollcall vote No. 218, the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 2146, trade promotion authority. Had I been present, I would have voted nay. ____________________",package_114_266.csv,34723,34723,34791,"[congressional record volume 161, number 101 (tuesday, june 23, 2015)] [senate] [pages s4525-s4529] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] cloture motion the presiding officer. under the previous order, the time until 11 a.m. will be equally divided. the senator from utah. mr. hatch. mr. president, later today the senate will once again have an opportunity to vote on whether to renew trade promotion authority. the senate has already considered this issue once and the house has voted on it twice, each time demonstrating strong bipartisan support for tpa. my hope is that we can get to a similar result with today's vote in the senate. we need to be clear about what is at stake. the united states is currently negotiating a number of trade agreements with some of our most important trading partners in the world. if the senate fails to approve this bill, neither congress nor the american people will have a strong voice during these negotiations. as a result, our nation will not be able to get the best trade agreements possible, if we are able to advance any trade agreements at all. some people, including some of our colleagues, may be fine with that result. they do not think we need trade agreements to promote a healthy economy. but nothing could be further from the truth. as we all know, most of the world's consumers live outside our borders--95 percent of them. in addition, the vast majority of economic growth in the world is likely to occur outside of the united states over the next decade. if our workers, farmers, ranchers, and service providers are going to be able to compete in these growing markets, we must have open access to these markets and fair trade rules to boot. without strong trade agreements, neither of these is possible. when it comes to international trade, we cannot stand still. if we don't lead and set the rules of the game, other nations will and our economy will be left behind. the united states continues to be a leader in agricultural exports throughout the world. in fact, we still export more agricultural goods than any other country. in addition, the united states continues to boast an enormous manufacturing base that supplies consumers in every corner of the globe. we also lead the world in technology, digital services, and innovation. indeed, not only do we lead the world in creation of intellectual property, america essentially created the modern digital landscape. the united states also continues to lead in trade in services, exporting more than $700 billion in services in 2014 alone. that is more than twice as much as the united kingdom, the world's second highest services exporter. i ask that the parliamentarian let me know when my 10 minutes has expired. the presiding officer. the senator will be so notified. mr. hatch. in other words, we know we can compete on the world stage when the rules are fair and the playing field is level. that is why i am such a strong proponent of this tpa legislation. this bill, which is the product of a great deal of work and a lot of bipartisan cooperation, will have a powerful and positive impact on industries throughout our economy, on consumers, and, of course, on american workers as well. in an america that embraces international trade, i believe even those individuals who encounter a temporary setback can find new opportunities, can out-work, out-produce, out-think, and out-innovate our global competition so long as the groundwork has been laid to give them those opportunities. that is why we need strong trade agreements, and that is why we need tpa. as you can surely tell, i feel very passionately about free trade, and i know many of my colleagues are just as passionate in their opposition. but as congress has considered this legislation, i think we have had a full and fair debate on these issues. we have been transparent on the substance of the bill and in the way things have moved forward. both sides have been able to make their case to the american people. it is at times such as these when working in congress is the most rewarding. we have the opportunity to hear so many different accounts, sift through mountains of data and research, meet with hundreds of interested parties representing thousands of our constituents, and work through hotly contested differences. then, after all of that work, when circumstances are right, we are able to come up with bipartisan legislation that addresses the needs of our country, our constituents, and our economy. that is what we have been able to do with this tpa debate, which is a debate that has been going on for many years now. i still want to work with those who may not share all my views on all these issues. one way we have agreed to do that is to help ensure that trade adjustment assistance, or taa, will be extended. as you know, taa has been included in the trade preferences bill the senate will hopefully vote on later this week after we pass tpa. i have said many times that i am not a fan of taa. personally, i think the program is redundant and ineffective. however, after 38 years here in the senate, believe me, i am well aware that everything is not about me. i understand taa is a priority for a number of my colleagues and that it continues to be the price of admission for many who want to support tpa. the senate majority leader recognizes this as well, which is why he has committed to ensuring that taa gets a fair vote here in the senate and a fair opportunity to pass. throughout this process, we have done all we can, within reason, to accommodate the concerns of senators. i am very appreciative of all the support we have received from members on both sides of the aisle. we couldn't have gotten this far without that support. now it is time to finish the work--to pass this bill and get it to the president's desk. we need this bill to ensure that our constituents' voices are heard in the trade negotiating process. we need this bill to give our trade negotiators the tools they need to get a good deal. and we need this bill to expand access to foreign markets so that we can grow our economy and create new and high-paying jobs here at home. that is what this bill is all about and why we have been working on this process for so long. we are very close to the finish line, and we need just one more burst of energy and a few more steps to get us there. i urge all my colleagues who support free trade, open markets, and the advancement of american values and interests abroad to join me once again in supporting tpa and working with me [[page s4526]] and with my colleague senator wyden to get all the pending trade bills passed in the senate and signed into law. with that, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from oregon. mr. wyden. mr. president, over the last several weeks on the floor of both this body and the house, we have heard members, colleagues, say they are tired of the old 1990s north american free trade agreement playbook on trade. they are concerned that the package which is once again before the senate is more of the same. here is my message on why this legislation needs to move forward. if you believe those policies of the 1990s failed to protect american workers and strengthen our economy, this is our chance to set a new course. this is our chance to put in place higher standards in global trade on matters such as labor rights and environmental protection, to shine some real sunlight on trade agreements and ensure that our country writes the rules of the road. the fact is, in 2015, globalization is a reality. the choice is whether to sit back and allow globalization to push and pull on our economy until in ways dictated by countries in china. so our choice is either to move now and get into the center of the ring and fight for a stronger economic future, protect our workers and promote our values, or remain tethered to many of those old policies of the 1990s. i say to the senate today: if you believe, like me, that it is time once and for all to close the books on the north american free-trade era in trade, this legislation deserves your support. in my hometown paper recently, there was an opinion article, and it stated that this trade bill lays out ``a hard-and-fast checklist for the tpp, holding the obama administration accountable for meeting its goals and conditions.'' the article goes on to say that this legislation ``will reorient priorities and improve the process for the tpp and other trade agreements in the future.'' i completely agree with that view, but the senate doesn't have to take my word for it. those are the words of tim nesbitt, the past president of the oregon afl-cio, who has disagreed with me on trade often over the years. yet now he states that this legislation we will vote on today provides a fresh opportunity for trade done right. when it comes to core american values--labor rights, environmental protection, and human rights--this legislation raises the bar and demands more from our trade negotiators than ever before. we have talked a lot about a race to the bottom. my view is that if our country doesn't fight to protect worker rights and the environment with tough, enforceable trade agreements, those priorities are going to wither away. china is certainly not going to take up the banner for american values in trade. so if you believe america should stop a race to the bottom on labor rights, environmental safeguards, and human rights, this legislation is our chance to lift up global standards. i want to talk for a moment about the economic potential of this legislation. what we all understand we need to do is make things here, grow things here, add value to them here, and then ship them somewhere. my state knows how to make this happen, and so do many others. about one out of five jobs in oregon depends on international trade. almost 90 percent of them are small and medium sized. and what we know is that in many instances those jobs pay better. the fact is, if our farmers want to sell their products in japan--and this is true of agriculture all over america. a lot of our farmers face average tariffs of 40 percent. that is right. if you want to export some jam to vietnam, it will be marked up by 90 percent. if you want to sell a bottle of wine--and we have wine growers with prosperous businesses all over the country--they have to fork over 50 percent of the value to the government. so if we believe other countries should open their markets to american exports, like the u.s. is open to theirs, this is our chance to break down the tariffs and other barriers. i want to touch for a moment again on how different this is than the 1990s. in the 1990s, nobody could have imagined the right tools to protect the modern internet. twenty-five years ago, it was impossible to make a living by setting up a business online. a cell phone was as big as a brick. in fact, the nafta negotiations began a year before the first web site was set up. today, internet commerce is at the heart of our economy. if we want to cement america's leadership in the digital economy, this is our chance to vote for trade policies that will protect a free and open internet. now, i wish to mention again, apropos of how different this is, that i have felt for some time that critics of past trade policy have been spot on with respect to a lot of this secrecy which is just gratuitous. if we believe deeply in trade, as chairman hatch and i do, and want more of it, why should we have all this unnecessary secrecy which just makes people cynical about trade? so we have brought sunshine to this trade debate in a way that is unprecedented. for the first time, before the president can sign a deal, the full text has to be released to the public for 60 days. before we can have votes in the other body and in the senate, there will be no fewer than 4 months where people can open a proposed trade deal and read it for themselves. so picture that: for 4 months, the american people will have in their hands--starting with the tpp--what the trade agreement is all about. that is simply unprecedented. i wish to close the question of how we are going to proceed from here. this has obviously been a complicated piece of legislation. i appreciate the senate and house leaders have committed to moving trade adjustment assistance alongside trade promotion authority as well as a proposal that originated with senator brown to strengthen our critically important trade enforcement laws. while the goal of enacting trade policies is a tool to give all americans a chance to get ahead, trade adjustment assistance is an absolute must-pass bill, and i am confident it is going to get through congress to the president's desk. that bill includes the vitally important program also that creates new opportunities for impoverished nations in africa. the customs enforcement bill is also moving forward on a bipartisan basis, and there is important work there to be done. the senate must resolve differences in the enforcement bill with the other body. i wish to make it clear this morning that i expect that conference to respect democratic priorities. my democratic colleagues and i will be laying down markers on several of our top priorities. i discussed those priorities with chairman ryan last night. those priorities include provisions in the senate bill championed by senator shaheen to help our small businesses, provisions authored by senator bennet to address enforcement environmental laws, and senator cantwell's important trade enforcement trust fund. in my view, the congress has an opportunity in this legislation to show it can work in a bipartisan way to take on one of the premier economic challenges of our time. our job is to get past the policies of the 1990s and move toward getting trade done right. colleagues, let's pry open foreign markets and send more of our exports abroad. let's fight for the american brand and the oregon brand against the trade chiefs and the bad actors who are blocking our way, and let's raise the bar for american values and open our trade policies to sunlight. i urge all in the senate to vote yes on cloture today and to support this package as it advances this week. in effect, we get three important bills done this week and set in motion. i yield the floor. mr. hatch. mr. president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. brown. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. brown. mr. president, i rise to oppose the motion to invoke cloture on tpa, the so-called fast-track legislation. i am still incredulous, as i have watched this trade nondebate, if you will, at the speed at which, time after time, the majority leader has tried to shut down debate. it has happened again and again, and that is compounded by the secrecy of this whole process. [[page s4527]] i can't count the number of times in my state of ohio and in meetings in washington, with people from all over the country, that people have said we have little or no access to the trans-pacific partnership. tpa, in the past--fast-track--has actually been sort of a rule book for how we should negotiate trade agreements and, at the same time, has been a direction on how to negotiate these trade agreements and a rule book on how it is presented on the senate floor. yet none of the trans-pacific partnership negotiations by ambassador froman have been informed at all by a tpa because we haven't had a tpa yet. we haven't even had an instruction booklet in the past. at the same time, we have gotten the worst of both worlds because we are voting on tpa, and we really haven't been able to see what is in tpp. i know supporters of tpp will say we are going to have 60 days now, but members are casting their votes now--where 60 votes are required and they have maximum leverage-- to put no final point on it, just giving up the leverage they have as we are still kept in the dark on what is happening. let me give one example before i get to where i think we are making a mistake by moving so quickly today, in essence, fast-tracking fast- track. one example, my office and i personally have repeatedly spoken to the president of the united states and the u.s. trade representative, ambassador froman, repeatedly asking them to fix some of the language on tobacco. because one of the things that apparently--we really don't know for sure--the trans-pacific partnership does is it gives even more power to american tobacco companies--more power to american tobacco companies to have influence over laws in particularly small countries which don't have the wherewithal and can't afford the huge legal bills a large tobacco company can afford to write public health law. if a small country wants to write a law to protect their children from marketing of tobacco products--which is what we have done in this country--the u.s. tobacco company or british tobacco company can--let's keep it here. the u.s. tobacco company can threaten a lawsuit against those countries, and those countries are probably going to back off because they probably can't afford to go to court with the big american tobacco company. even something as clearly violative of the public interest and of public health as what damage big tobacco inflicts on children has not, to our knowledge, been addressed. again, so much of this is secretive that we don't even know that. that is why there is anger in this country and why there is--so many people in this country tell me, so many in my state: why are you moving so fast? why is this coming up right now? why don't we know more about this whole process? yet again, the majority leader is shutting down debate. he will be joined, i assume, by a small number, a distinct, small number of minority democrats, getting up over the 60-vote margin so they can shut down debate, so they can move the tpa--the fast-track--forward, so they can get the trans-pacific partnership down the road. no matter which side of the tpp debate, no matter which side of the trade promotion authority, tpa, fast-track--no matter which side you are on, it is clear that our trade policy creates winners and losers. it is clear. even the most vigorous cheerleaders for free trade--the wall street journal editorial board, for instance--even the strongest free-traders, even though people who reflectively support these free- trade agreements acknowledge there are winners and losers. they will argue that these trade agreements create more jobs than they lose. i don't agree with that. they argue that. put that aside. but they also acknowledge that people lose jobs because of decisions we make. we are about to pass fast-track here. we are about to pass trade promotion authority, leading probably to the trans-pacific partnership having a reasonable chance of passage. we are about to do that. we are making that decision here. members of congress, people who are well paid, with government-financed retirements and health care--we are about to make those decisions, and we know--we are knowingly making that decision, acknowledging that some people will lose their jobs because of a decision we make, but we are not going to take care of those workers. we are going to pass today the tpa, the trade promotion authority, fast-track. we are going to pass that and ignore those workers. how shameful is that that we know the decisions we are making in this body--we are making the decisions, the president of the united states makes this decision, the house of representatives has made this decision, the senate is about to make this decision, we are making this decision, knowing people will lose their jobs because of our actions. yet we are unwilling to provide for those workers who lose their jobs. let me give a little history, a special message to congress. in january of 1962, president kennedy said: when considerations of national policy make it desirable to avoid higher tariffs, those injured by that competition should not be required to bear the full brunt of the impact. rather, the burden of economic adjustment should be borne in part by the federal government. that is president kennedy at the advent, at the beginning, at the creation of the trade adjustment assistance, the support for workers who lose their jobs because of--again, i repeat--decisions we make in this body, in the house of representatives, in the white house. we make decisions on trade. we know people will lose their jobs. we should help them. it should be our moral responsibility to help them. senator vance hartke of indiana said: ``no small group of firms and workers should be made to bear the full burden of the costs of a program whose great benefits enrich the nation as a whole.'' this is as true today as it was 53 years ago. it is not a democratic idea. it is not a republican idea. everyone from the cato institute--a libertarian-oriented think tank in washington, a bunch of well-paid scholars who make pronouncements from on high about various kinds of public policy issues--to the wall street journal--a similar body but one with greater ability to disseminate information--even those two venerable institutions admit the trade agreements do not create winners everywhere. a cato institute trade briefing says, ``all of those job losses are a painful but necessary part of the larger process of innovation and productivity increases.'' i am always a bit amused when people who--again, well-educated, good pay, dress like this, good benefits, good retirement, good health care--make pronunciations saying: well, job losses are painful--not to us, of course. the same as editorial writers who make these decisions, these pronouncements on trade, they are not losing their jobs. people in my state are losing jobs on these fair trade agreements. we are going to inflict this pain. as the cato institute and the wall street journal say, by the decisions we make, we are going to inflict pain on these workers. people are going to lose jobs in my town of mansfield, oh. people are going to lose jobs where i grew up. people are going to lose jobs in cleveland where i live now. people are going to lose jobs in zanesville and newark because of decisions we make today on fast- track, because of decisions we will make next year on the trans-pacific partnership. people are going to lose their jobs, but we are going to vote today to cut off debate, and we are going to forget, at least temporarily, about helping those workers who lose jobs because of decisions we make. how immoral is that? how shameful is that? what a betrayal we are inflicting on those workers if we make this decision today. former wall street journal economics editor david wessel writes, ``even [free trade's] most fervent admirers concede trade creates winners and losers.'' i will debate until the cows come home the net benefits of these trade agreements. i think they are net job loss. but even if you believe these trade agreements are net job-gainers--i don't think there is a lot of evidence of that--but even if you believe that, we know people lose their jobs because of decisions we make. that is why republicans in the past have supported trade adjustment assistance in principle and in policy going back decades. fifteen years ago, president george w. bush said, ``i recognize that some [[page s4528]] american workers may face adjustment challenges''--that means they get thrown out of work. it is a nice way a president might talk about people he has left behind. put that aside. ``i recognize that some american workers may face adjustment challenges as a result of trade.'' at least to president bush's credit--i wish his words would be followed today on this floor by the majority leader, by republican leader mcconnell as he cuts off debate and leaves behind trade adjustment assistance. president bush said, ``i support helping these workers by reauthorizing and improving trade adjustment assistance programs that will give workers impacted by trade new skills, help them find new jobs quickly, and provide them with financial assistance.'' i can give lots of stories about people i know in youngstown, lima, dayton, hamilton, and people in portsmouth who lost their jobs because of trade, but at least they have gotten a helping hand from a government that used to have their backs and believe in them--at least until today--from a government that actually will extend that hand and help them retrain. maybe they can become a nurse, maybe they can work in information technology, maybe they can become a radiology technologist at the local hospital. earlier this year, my colleague john cornyn--republican from texas, the senior senator and assistant republican leader--told reporters that ``there is no doubt that the benefits of more trade do not fall uniformly. there are some segments of the economy that don't prosper as well.'' we know that. we have seen that acknowledgement across the board. yet today leader mcconnell is going to cut off debate, even though decisions we have made have cost people their jobs. that is why we have a moral obligation. it is not a new idea. it is not a partisan idea. it is universally accepted. trade deals don't benefit everybody. that is why this moral obligation to include trade adjustment assistance in any package with tpa is so important. we can't send a framework for a new trade deal to the president's desk without assistance for the workers who will be left behind, but that is not what we are doing today. today, it is full-speed ahead, cut off debate, move ahead on fast-track, move ahead on trade promotion authority. i assume a number of my democratic colleagues are going along with it. i hope the wrath of people in this country--if the house and senate refuse to do what some of their leaders say they will, that they will pass trade adjustment assistance, that they will take care of those workers--if they don't live up to that promise--and many times in the past they haven't lived up to similar promises--a lot of my colleagues are going to go home and face people who say: wait. you made a decision. i got thrown out of a job because of a decision you made, because of a decision you made as a house member, because of a decision you made as a senator, because of a decision you made, mr. president. i was thrown out of work, and you passed on june 23--or whatever today is--fast-track without taking care of me, even though it was your decision that i lose my job. what kind of government--what kind of principles do we live under here? in march, conservative columnist charles krauthammer wrote in national review online: to be sure, any trade deal, while a net plus overall, produces winners and losers. but the tpp will be accompanied by so-called trade adjustment assistance, training and subsidies to help those negatively affected. again, krauthammer, as he is about 95 percent of the time, is wrong. he is wrong that it is going be accompanied by the trade adjustment assistance. the assumption all along, even among tpp proponents, has been that tpa would be passed in tandem with aid for workers. but you know, even though that is what we did first here, republicans in the house of representatives are unwilling to vote for them together. they are just not going to vote. speaker boehner, for some reason, acquiesced to the president of the united states, pulled them apart, and had separate votes. think about the message we will send. if we put another huge trade deal--parenthetically, once-majority leader, republican leader trent lott said: you can't pass a trade agreement in an even-numbered year. do you know why he said that? he said that because people don't like trade deals in this country. people know nafta sold them out. they know cafta sold them out. they know pntr with china sold them out. they know korea sold them out. we heard these promises over and over. with nafta, we were promised 200,000 jobs in 2 years. thank you, president bush 1, and thank you, president clinton, for that. we lost 680,000 net jobs. central america free trade agreement--thank you, president bush 2, for that. promises were made, big promises about job increases, big promises about wages going up. it didn't happen. wages stayed flat. jobs were lost. thank you, president bush 2, for that. korea, south korea free trade agreement, negotiated in part by president bush, pushed through the senate by president obama--thank you, mr. presidents of both parties, for that. they told us 70,000 jobs would be created out of the south korea free trade agreement. no, we have lost 75,000 jobs. using the same formula that we have--we have seen this over and over. we know what happens. the bureau of labor statistics reported that between 2009 and 2012, two-thirds of displaced manufacturing workers who did find new jobs ended up taking lower paying jobs. most of those workers saw wage losses of more than 20 percent. you can debate whether the gains others experienced make these losses worth it. i don't think they do. i think if you have traveled darned near anywhere--if members of congress spent a little more time with people who can't contribute to them, with people who don't belong to a local rotary club, with people who might just work hard, play by the rules, not make a lot of money, barely make it, sometimes have their house foreclosed on, sometimes lose their job--if we would spend a little more time with people like that, i think we would see how these trade agreements are working. there is a debate to be had. i will cede it is debatable, whether these trade agreements--whether the evidence is that they create jobs or lose jobs. i think it is pretty clear they lose jobs. but there is no debate. there is no debate on what actually happens here. because of decisions--i will repeat--before this vote coming up in about 60 seconds, because of decisions we make in this body--the president makes, senators make, congress men and women make--because of decisions we make in this body, people in our states, whether it is arkansas or arizona, oregon, utah or my state of ohio, people lose jobs because of decisions we make. there is no question people lose jobs because of decisions we make. anything short of providing for those workers who lose their jobs today, not doing this on a promise--we are basically trusting the majority leader who doesn't really like, i understand, the trade adjustment assistance program. we are relying on the word of speaker boehner, who doesn't particularly like trade adjustment assistance. we know most of the members of his party in the house of representatives do not particularly like trade adjustment assistance. we are going to rely on their promise. we are voting today on the fly. we are saying to workers in this country: yes, we have made decisions that may have cost you your job. we are going to try to help you when you lose that job, but we are still going to go ahead today and do that. that is why i asked my colleagues to vote no on this motion today to invoke cloture on trade promotion authority. mr. cornyn. mr. president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer (mr. flake). the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. hatch. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. the presiding officer. pursuant to rule xxii, the chair lays before the senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. the legislative clerk read as follows: cloture motion we, the undersigned senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule xxii of the [[page s4529]] standing rules of the senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to concur in the house amendment to the senate amendment to h.r. 2146, an act to amend the internal revenue code of 1986 to allow federal law enforcement officers, firefighters, and air traffic controllers to make penalty-free withdrawals from governmental plans after age 50, and for other purposes. mitch mcconnell, johnny isakson, david perdue, chuck grassley, thom tillis, marco rubio, daniel coats, john cornyn, michael b. enzi, kelly ayotte, orrin g. hatch, roger f. wicker, deb fischer, rob portman, cory gardner, richard burr, roy blunt. the presiding officer. by unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. the question is, is it the sense of the senate that debate on the motion to concur in the house amendment to the senate amendment to h.r. 2146 shall be brought to a close?

The clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: House message to accompany H.R. 2146, an act to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow Federal law enforcement officers, firefighters, and air traffic controllers to make penalty-free withdrawals from governmental plans after age 50, and for other purposes. Pending: McConnell motion to concur in the amendment of the House to the amendment of the Senate to the bill. McConnell motion to concur in the amendment of the House to the amendment of the Senate to the bill, with amendment No. 2060 (to the House amendment to the Senate amendment to the bill), to change the enactment date. McConnell amendment No. 2061 (to amendment No. 2060), of a perfecting nature.

McConnell amendment No. 2063 (to (the instructions) amendment No. 2062), of a perfecting nature. McConnell amendment No. 2064 (to amendment No. 2063), of a perfecting nature. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Cloture having been invoked, the motion to refer falls. The majority leader. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would just like to announce that Senator Corker was inadvertently detained in getting to the floor of the Senate. Had he been here, he would have voted yea on the cloture motion. Mr. President, I also just want to say to our colleagues that this is a very important day for our country. We have demonstrated we can work together on a bipartisan basis to achieve something that is extremely important for America. Not only when we confirm this trade promotion authority will we have the mechanism in place for the President to finalize an extraordinarily important deal with a number of different Asian countries, but it will indicate that America is back in the trade business. It will also send a message to our allies that we understand that they are somewhat wary about Chinese commercial and potentially military domination and that we intend to still be deeply involved in the Pacific. So I want to congratulate Senator Hatch and Senator Wyden. This has been a long and rather twisted path to where we are today, but it is a very important accomplishment for the country. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I would like to mention that as to the other two absences, Senator Menendez had voted no on cloture before, and Senator Lee had voted no on cloture before. So the vote would have been 61 to 39. More importantly, this is a day of celebration in the corporate suites of this country, to be sure, because they have another corporate-sponsored trade agreement that will mean more money in some investors' pockets. It will mean more plant closings in Ohio, Arizona, Delaware, Rhode Island, West Virginia, Maine, and all over this country. Most importantly, what I didn't understand about the vote today is that even though the Wall Street Journal, the CATO Institute, and others acknowledge that, as to the decisions we make here on trade agreements--while they say it is a net increase in jobs--people lose their jobs because of the decisions we make. So we make decisions here today that throw people out of work. We know that. Across the political spectrum that is acknowledged. But we today don't do anything to help those workers that lose their jobs. We make a decision to throw people in Mansfield, OH, and Cleveland, OH, out of work, but then we don't take care of those workers that lost their jobs because of our decisions. It is shameful. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me just concur with the Senator from Ohio. This trade agreement was supported by virtually every major corporation in this country, the vast majority of whom have outsourced millions of jobs to low-wage countries all over the world. This trade agreement is supported by Wall Street. This trade agreement is supported by the pharmaceutical industry, which wants to charge people in poor countries higher prices for the medicine they desperately need. This agreement was opposed by every union in this country, working for the best interests of working families, and by almost every environmental group and many religious groups. In my view, this trade agreement will continue the policies of NAFTA, CAFTA, and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China--agreements that have cost us millions of decent-paying jobs. We need a new trade policy in America--a policy that represents working families and not just the big money interests. I strongly disagree with the majority leader, who called this a great day for America. It is not a great day. It is a great day for the Big Money interests, not a great day for working families. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip. [[Page S4530]] Order For Recess Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. today for the weekly conference meetings, as well as from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. today for an all-Senators briefing, and that all time in recess count postcloture. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it is no secret that Republicans on this side of the aisle don't agree with President Obama about everything. In fact, I would say that on balance most Republicans disagree with the policy choices made by this President. But occasionally--occasionally-- even the leader of the Democratic Party, the President of the United States, gets things right. Occasionally, the President of the United States gets his policy choices right, and he did so with regard to trade promotion authority. I would point out to our friends and to anybody listening that this actually is a 6-year trade promotion authority. This extends well beyond the tenure of the current occupant of the White House, and it will be available for the next President of the United States to negotiate trade deals that are in the best interests of the United States. So I agree with the majority leader. This latest vote is just another example of the Senate getting back to work and restored to regular working order. This is a dramatic departure from the old Senate, because there has actually been a lot of time for consideration of important pieces of legislation--from the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act to the Justice for Victims of Human Trafficking Act to the budget. By moving this trade promotion authority bill forward, we can ensure that American workers and businesses can get the best deal in trade agreements with countries from Asia to South America to Europe. I believe we have actually kept the campaign promises we made last year that, if the American people entrusted the Republicans with the new majority, we would work together with our allies where we could on the other side of the aisle where we have common cause to deliver results for the American people, to legislate in their best interest-- not just to obstruct for obstruction's sake or gain some temporary tactical or political advantage but to promote a functioning, deliberative Senate. I see one of the leaders of this effort, the Senator from Delaware, who has done great work trying to find that common cause and producing a result, as exemplified by the TPA. I am going to yield for him in just a moment. But let me just talk briefly about my response to the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from Ohio, who said there is nothing good to be had out of this trade promotion authority or any potential trade deals that we might negotiate. My home State of Texas relies heavily on international trade. We are the number one trading State in the Nation, which is just one reason why our economy grew at the rate of 5.2 percent in 2014. Our economy in Texas grew at the rate of 5.2 percent in 2014. Do you know the rate at which the U.S. economy grew? The U.S. economy grew at just 2.2 percent. So why wouldn't we want to do anything and everything we can to stimulate the growth of the economy to benefit people looking for work and people looking for higher wages? This important trade promotion authority is the first step to doing that. I will conclude because the distinguished Senator from Delaware is here and others who want to speak. Trade is an engine of growth. It keeps our economy growing. These upcoming trade agreements, whether it is the Trans-Pacific Partnership or the transatlantic investment treaty, serve as a great opportunity to turbo-charge that growth. Our economy actually contracted last quarter by 0.7 percent. As long as our economy is shrinking and not growing, we are not going to be able to create the jobs to put America back to work. We are not going to be able to create the sorts of wages that we want for all working Americans. This legislation represents an important step in that direction. I am glad that in the exercise of a little mutual trust and comity, we have reached this important point. We are not through yet because there are other parts of this trade package that we are going to need to process this week. But the promise and commitment we made on this side of the aisle was that if our colleagues across the aisle trust us to move through the trade promotion authority bill, we will continue to work with them and keep our commitments to them, and, hopefully, more than just the trust that produces these pieces of legislation will result from this increased confidence and trust in one another. We know we are going to find measures we will disagree on, and we will fight like cats and dogs when we need to. But when we actually agree on the policy and can find it within ourselves to work together, the American people are the beneficiaries. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, while the Senator from Texas is still on the floor, let me say, if I could--he mentioned the word ``trust'' a number of times. It is an important word in Congress. One of my favorite sayings is ``Integrity--if you have it, nothing else matters. Integrity--if you don't have it, nothing else matters.'' The same is true for trust. In order to get things done here--there is a lot we need to get done. Everybody realizes that. My takeaway from the election last November was threefold: No. 1, people want us to work together; No. 2, they want us to get stuff done; and No. 3, they want us to get things done that will actually strengthen the economic recovery. One of the ways to strengthen the economic recovery, frankly, is to make sure that those markets overseas will actually allow us to sell into them, whether it is products or goods or services, that we have access to those markets. The other thing is that my colleague from Texas is as big believer, as am I, in the Golden Rule, and that is to treat people the way we want to be treated. And I think most of the people in this country support what we are doing. Most of the Democrats in our country support what their President has proposed, and the Republicans as well. But what we need to do while we move forward with trade promotion authority is we need to keep in mind that not everybody will be helped by this and that there are some people who will to be disadvantaged, and we have an obligation to them to treat them how we would want to be treated if we were in their shoes. There is a sister piece of legislature to go along with trade promotion authority, and I would ask the Republican whip from Texas to give us some assurance or reassurance so we build trust around this issue. When we are contacted by folks from around the country today, tomorrow, or the next day, what are we going to do to provide assistance to those people who may be disadvantaged because of trade promotion authority and the trade deal that is going to be negotiated? Can you give us some assurance there? Is this like the end of the road or are there some more pieces to follow this week? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would respond to the question by our colleague from Delaware that assurances have been given that we understand that the trade promotion authority and the trade adjustment assistance travel together. I think we have seen examples where the benefits of trade are not uniformly felt across the country. There are some people who will be displaced. But the importance of trade adjustment assistance--I wish we could negotiate something a little more frugal that would actually get the job done. But a negotiation took place between Chairman Ryan in the House and the ranking member, Senator Wyden, in the Senate on this important piece of the package. We all recognize that these travel in pairs and that trade adjustment assistance is part of the price you pay for getting trade promotion authority done. But most importantly to my colleague's point from Delaware, for those people who are displaced, this guarantees that they will have access to the sort of job training and skills enhancement that they will need in order to get even better jobs in this economy [[Page S4531]] that, on net, will benefit the entire country. That is the intent on this side of the aisle and I think the intent of trade adjustment authority and making sure that we finish our work--not here today but through the rest of the week--on this important package of pieces of legislation. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank the Republican whip for those words and for his work on this. I would just close with this thought: Whenever I talk to people who have been married a long time--like 50, 60, 70 years--I always ask them, what is the secret to being married a long time? I get some very funny answers, and I get some very poignant ones as well. The best answer I have ever heard to that question, what is the secret to being married 50, 60, or 70 years, is the two c's--not ``Cornyn'' and ``Carper'' but ``communicate'' and ``compromise.'' I would add maybe a third to that, and that is ``collaborate.'' We need to demonstrate the ability to communicate and to compromise and to collaborate. And those aren't always the secret to a vibrant marriage, but they are the secret to a vibrant democracy. This is a confidence-building measure. I think we have taken an important step here, working with Democrats and Republicans and working with a Democratic President, and the next step is one we have just talked about, trade adjustment assistance. We need to do that. If we can actually work through these issues this week and produce a bipartisan product that the President is going to sign, we will actually build some trust. And when we turn to the issue of transportation and having a robust, vibrant transportation system and how to fund that, how to pay for that, what to do, this will be helpful. So my applause to Senator Ron Wyden, Senator Murray on our side, Senator Hatch, the leader on the Republican side, and to Senator Cornyn for good work--not done but a very good start today. I yield back the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia. Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I have the utmost respect for my colleagues, and I think they make compelling arguments. I just have a hard time. I really have a hard time, with this. I have not had one West Virginian--average, working West Virginian--who had a good job at one time and lost a job who thinks this type of approach to trade is good. Not one. And I am hearing them talking about how much trade we do from our States. I would like to know what type of trade. Manufactured products? I don't see many manufactured products leaving this country. I see an awful lot of resources, such as oil that has been refined into diesel fuel or gasoline. It probably comes from Texas, I would say. I think that is probably a big part of their trading, and those types of things. But how many people actually benefit from that who really have a good manufacturing job? That is all I have asked. We talked about TAA. We are all hung up on TAA. Do you know why we are hung up? Because we all understand we are going to lose more jobs. We have already lost 6 million jobs since NAFTA. We have all lost 6 million jobs across this country. I lost 31,000 manufacturing jobs. I understand NAFTA hasn't been enforced, and they had some rules in there. And then you take this piece of legislation, TPA--there was more security around this piece of legislation than there was around the Iran nuclear deal we were talking about. My staff could go there, they could take notes, we were briefed, and we were able to ask questions. We couldn't even take a note or take a note out. They are telling me: Well, you know, we all depend on trade and the market shrinking. We are at $18 trillion GDP. Think about this. We in the United States of America have the greatest economy the world has ever seen--$18 trillion. Do you know that of all these 11 countries we are talking about, the closest one to us is Japan--$4.5 trillion. It falls off the Richter scale. But yet we have to be very secretive because somebody might leave us. Well, let me tell you, I have been a businessperson all of my life. If I wanted to get into a market, I will assure you, I would be able to evaluate my competition, the people with whom I want to do business. If that was the big person on the block, I had to make more adjustments than they had to make. But yet we are so concerned about the secrecy of this deal that none of us are able to see it, work it, define it, dissect it, and improve upon it. Now we are just voting basically carte blanche and saying: OK, sure, you are going to get a 60-day review. You can't do a thing about it if you don't like it. I didn't think we were elected to do that. I really didn't. When you start looking at everything this stands for and you look at basically--and my father--my grandfather had a grocery store and my dad had a little furniture store, so I was raised in retail. One thing my dad always encouraged was competition. He enjoyed having it. He said: Joe, listen, good competition brings out more buyers. More buyers gives us more of a chance to sell our goods. What he never did like and what he thought was unfair was when you had unfair competition--didn't pay their taxes, didn't live by the rules or play by the rules. And if we didn't enforce those, it gave them an unfair competitive advantage. If you believe our past performance in our trade deals makes us an expert at enforcing and making sure people play by the rules so that America is treated right, then you probably would have voted for this. I don't. I can only judge off of our past performance, where we are today. When you go shopping for whatever types of goods--household goods, clothing goods, furniture--the greatest furniture markets in the world were in the United States. We make very little furniture in this country today. They still want our wood products, so you know what, yes, we ship logs out of West Virginia around the world so people can make the furniture that they want to send back to America. So I guess they say: Oh, yes, that is good trade. The only reason they are buying our logs is because they don't have the quality logs we have. They don't have the quality hardwood forests. The best coal in the world, the best metallurgical coal--coking--that makes the steel, the best in the world comes out of West Virginia. Sure they are going to buy it because they don't have it. They are going to make their products and send them back to us and come into these markets subsidized. I would just say sooner or later we ought to do something for America. You have to rebuild this country, and you don't build the wealth of a country based on basically moving paper back and forth. Moving paper back and forth--there are some people, with the wealth they accrue from this, I am sure they are very satisfied and happy with that. And we see the income inequality over the last 20 years. We have never seen this big of a spread. Never. You see the flatline of workers all over America, just as flatline as can be. I don't know how we can look them in the eye and say we have done the best because now we have opened up 11 new countries. Vietnam--58 cents an hour is what they are going to pay their workers. And we said: Whoa, whoa, NAFTA is going to be basically bringing the whole North American trade up to par. Twenty-two years later, I understand that Mexico's minimum wage is still under $1 an hour, around 80 cents. You think a person who makes 58 cents an hour or 80 cents an hour or $1.50 an hour--7 out of 11 countries make less than $2--that those people will have disposable income to buy the products we would like to sell so that we can expand our economy and our jobs? I am sorry, I don't think that is going to happen. I really don't. It doesn't make any sense to me at all how we expect a person who can barely survive to have disposable income to buy products that we in the United States of America wish to sell to really lift our manufacturing base. But I guess that is why we have TAA that we are arguing about because we know we have given that up. We just about wrote that off 22 years ago, so I guess we are going to write the rest of it off now. Technology is great. I am all for innovation, creation, technology. I am for every bit of that. But sooner or later, you have to make something, you have to build something, you have [[Page S4532]] to reinvest, and there have to be people making these products, being able to support their families and to have a benefit package that gives them a decent life. When I was growing up in little Farmington, WV, we had manufacturing, mining. We had people who could go to work, work hard, make a living, take their family on vacation, pay the bills. And we let all of that slip away from us. I am not saying they will be the jobs of the past, but we could have the jobs of the future--steel, manufacturing. So I am not willing to give up on this. You don't find me chastising my colleagues on the Republican side or my colleagues on the Democratic side. I think we are all here for the right reason. Sometimes we get a little bit off track, and I think this is one time we have gotten off track. Something that would really help the United States of America, working families all over this country, we have kind of forgotten about, and I am concerned about that. I am concerned about going home to my beautiful State of West Virginia and telling the people: I am sorry, we are going to have a harder time competing with some of these countries because there is just no way. We have opened up our borders. We have let international trade, an international manufacturing base go wherever they get the best deal. And I guarantee you that in every developing country, they are not going to be as tough as we are on human rights and on the environmental quality they should be aspiring to. They are not going to be tough on those things. They are trying to build an economy. They are trying to build, basically, a nation, bring it up. And they are going to be a little bit lax on these things. That is unfair competition, which my dad always warned me against. When we talk about European trade, I am not worried about European trade because they are basically on the same level playing field that we are. But when you are trying to build up a country, should you sacrifice and tear down your country? Should you give away everything you have worked hard for and built? I want to help these countries. I have not a bit of problem helping these countries. I am not an isolationist. But I basically would have put something in there that would have protected our manufacturing base. I would have put something in that said that when we fell below certain jobs in manufacturing, it stops. You don't give it all away. It is hard to regain that and recapture it. I am sure Wall Street is very happy today. I have a lot of friends who work on Wall Street. There are a lot of good people who work on Wall Street, but there are a lot of people who basically are just driven by the almighty dollar. They are not driven by Main Street. They are not worried about West Virginia. They are not worried about my little town of Farmington or any part of my State. And they are going to be very happy. They are not worried about 99 percent of the people who are still on Main Street trying to survive. We talked about the Export-Import Bank. They said: Trust us; we are going to get a vote on Export-Import Bank. Maybe we will sometime. I would hope that comes to fruition. That helped a lot of small businesses. We haven't gotten that vote yet. So you would have thought there would have been a priority to get a vote on that. It has done an awful lot to get us in the market so we can compete on a more level playing field. That hasn't happened. But here we go again. We are going to have some votes tomorrow, and the votes tomorrow are going to be based on the TAA because the House couldn't pass TPA fast-track with TAA in it. It is basically what we are dealing with. So they think we can do a backdoor. What makes you think TAA would be acceptable in any way, shape, or form in the House? What makes you think now, since we have carved this out--but we were promised a vote here on the TAA, which we know we are going to need--it is going to make it more acceptable on the House side when they made them take TAA out and couldn't pass TAA in the TPA bill? Doesn't make any sense to me. So I think it is a sad day today. I really do. And I am concerned. I am concerned about our country. I am concerned about my hard-working people in West Virginia--and I know you are--and all the other States we have. These are good people. They deserve an opportunity. They deserve fair trade. They really deserve a fair trading country, people who will trade honestly with us and who have a quality or standard that they have to live up to in order to get into our markets. I don't think we should sacrifice our markets basically just to build them up. I think we should assist them, but they are going to have to find their own markets to the point where we don't sacrifice. So I think this could be a troubling thing. I am hoping it is not, but it could be. I have concerns. And I have said that if I can't explain it back home, I can't vote for it. And this is one I could not explain back home. I could not make the people feel comfortable that this is really going to improve quality of life and opportunities for them and their families. I couldn't do it because I don't see it. I don't believe in it. And I said I wouldn't vote for it, and I didn't. With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I just want to say a few things about the vote we just took on cloture to proceed with TPA. The Senator who just spoke talked about some of the problems with the deal and the dislocations that happen when we have trade. We all recognize there are dislocations. There are dislocations whenever an economy adjusts and moves ahead with or without trade. But trade overall is necessary. It is good. Free trade is good. Ninety-five percent of the world's consumers live outside our boundaries. Seventy percent of the world's economic output happens outside of our boundaries. We need to trade. We can't just say: Well, we are just going to live within ourselves here, have an economy that doesn't reach out or pull in. We benefit. We benefit from better services and cheaper goods when we trade. Our manufacturers benefit when we are able to export our products. It was said before that we haven't seen any good outcomes after NAFTA. We have. It is rewriting history to say that we haven't seen good outcomes as a result of NAFTA. I think the last speaker said Mexico has not improved since NAFTA. It has. I can tell you, as a representative of a State that borders with Mexico, the economy is considerably bigger and better. Arizona is one of our biggest trading partners. It has improved since NAFTA. These trade agreements work. We haven't had a trade agreement negotiated without the TPA process--with the exception of one--I think in over 30 years. That one was a deal I believe with Jordan, and it had far more to do with defense than commerce. So we need to have TPA--this process--in order to negotiate these trade agreements. The vast majority of our trade--I believe it is close to 90 percent of our trade--is with countries with which we have free- trade agreements. So I applaud those who have worked so hard to bring this to pass here--Senators Hatch and Wyden and others--and the compromises that took place. I am not a particular fan of trade adjustment assistance. When economies move forward, there are dislocations. We can't account for all of them. In fact, we have seen some of the problems with previous TAA assistance. I believe some of it went to those who were laid off at Solyndra and to some of these things that had very little to do with trade. Because of the way you seek such assistance, we don't do the best that we could to keep track of where those jobs were lost to. But having said that, we all recognize, as the Senator from Texas said earlier, that TAA is the price we pay to get TPA. We all recognize in this body that there are compromises that need to be made. That is how we move legislation, and that is how we get important legislation such as TPA passed so that we can [[Page S4533]] have more free trade, and our economy will benefit because of it. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4529-S4533] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEFENDING PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT ACT The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: House message to accompany H.R. 2146, an act to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow Federal law enforcement officers, firefighters, and air traffic controllers to make penalty-free withdrawals from governmental plans after age 50, and for other purposes. Pending: McConnell motion to concur in the amendment of the House to the amendment of the Senate to the bill. McConnell motion to concur in the amendment of the House to the amendment of the Senate to the bill, with amendment No. 2060 (to the House amendment to the Senate amendment to the bill), to change the enactment date. McConnell amendment No. 2061 (to amendment No. 2060), of a perfecting nature. McConnell motion to refer the bill to the Committee on Finance, with instructions, McConnell amendment No. 2062, to change the enactment date. McConnell amendment No. 2063 (to (the instructions) amendment No. 2062), of a perfecting nature. McConnell amendment No. 2064 (to amendment No. 2063), of a perfecting nature. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Cloture having been invoked, the motion to refer falls. The majority leader. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would just like to announce that Senator Corker was inadvertently detained in getting to the floor of the Senate. Had he been here, he would have voted yea on the cloture motion. Mr. President, I also just want to say to our colleagues that this is a very important day for our country. We have demonstrated we can work together on a bipartisan basis to achieve something that is extremely important for America. Not only when we confirm this trade promotion authority will we have the mechanism in place for the President to finalize an extraordinarily important deal with a number of different Asian countries, but it will indicate that America is back in the trade business. It will also send a message to our allies that we understand that they are somewhat wary about Chinese commercial and potentially military domination and that we intend to still be deeply involved in the Pacific. So I want to congratulate Senator Hatch and Senator Wyden. This has been a long and rather twisted path to where we are today, but it is a very important accomplishment for the country. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I would like to mention that as to the other two absences, Senator Menendez had voted no on cloture before, and Senator Lee had voted no on cloture before. So the vote would have been 61 to 39. More importantly, this is a day of celebration in the corporate suites of this country, to be sure, because they have another corporate-sponsored trade agreement that will mean more money in some investors' pockets. It will mean more plant closings in Ohio, Arizona, Delaware, Rhode Island, West Virginia, Maine, and all over this country. Most importantly, what I didn't understand about the vote today is that even though the Wall Street Journal, the CATO Institute, and others acknowledge that, as to the decisions we make here on trade agreements--while they say it is a net increase in jobs--people lose their jobs because of the decisions we make. So we make decisions here today that throw people out of work. We know that. Across the political spectrum that is acknowledged. But we today don't do anything to help those workers that lose their jobs. We make a decision to throw people in Mansfield, OH, and Cleveland, OH, out of work, but then we don't take care of those workers that lost their jobs because of our decisions. It is shameful. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me just concur with the Senator from Ohio. This trade agreement was supported by virtually every major corporation in this country, the vast majority of whom have outsourced millions of jobs to low-wage countries all over the world. This trade agreement is supported by Wall Street. This trade agreement is supported by the pharmaceutical industry, which wants to charge people in poor countries higher prices for the medicine they desperately need. This agreement was opposed by every union in this country, working for the best interests of working families, and by almost every environmental group and many religious groups. In my view, this trade agreement will continue the policies of NAFTA, CAFTA, and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China--agreements that have cost us millions of decent-paying jobs. We need a new trade policy in America--a policy that represents working families and not just the big money interests. I strongly disagree with the majority leader, who called this a great day for America. It is not a great day. It is a great day for the Big Money interests, not a great day for working families. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip. [[Page S4530]] Order For Recess Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. today for the weekly conference meetings, as well as from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. today for an all-Senators briefing, and that all time in recess count postcloture. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it is no secret that Republicans on this side of the aisle don't agree with President Obama about everything. In fact, I would say that on balance most Republicans disagree with the policy choices made by this President. But occasionally--occasionally-- even the leader of the Democratic Party, the President of the United States, gets things right. Occasionally, the President of the United States gets his policy choices right, and he did so with regard to trade promotion authority. I would point out to our friends and to anybody listening that this actually is a 6-year trade promotion authority. This extends well beyond the tenure of the current occupant of the White House, and it will be available for the next President of the United States to negotiate trade deals that are in the best interests of the United States. So I agree with the majority leader. This latest vote is just another example of the Senate getting back to work and restored to regular working order. This is a dramatic departure from the old Senate, because there has actually been a lot of time for consideration of important pieces of legislation--from the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act to the Justice for Victims of Human Trafficking Act to the budget. By moving this trade promotion authority bill forward, we can ensure that American workers and businesses can get the best deal in trade agreements with countries from Asia to South America to Europe. I believe we have actually kept the campaign promises we made last year that, if the American people entrusted the Republicans with the new majority, we would work together with our allies where we could on the other side of the aisle where we have common cause to deliver results for the American people, to legislate in their best interest-- not just to obstruct for obstruction's sake or gain some temporary tactical or political advantage but to promote a functioning, deliberative Senate. I see one of the leaders of this effort, the Senator from Delaware, who has done great work trying to find that common cause and producing a result, as exemplified by the TPA. I am going to yield for him in just a moment. But let me just talk briefly about my response to the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from Ohio, who said there is nothing good to be had out of this trade promotion authority or any potential trade deals that we might negotiate. My home State of Texas relies heavily on international trade. We are the number one trading State in the Nation, which is just one reason why our economy grew at the rate of 5.2 percent in 2014. Our economy in Texas grew at the rate of 5.2 percent in 2014. Do you know the rate at which the U.S. economy grew? The U.S. economy grew at just 2.2 percent. So why wouldn't we want to do anything and everything we can to stimulate the growth of the economy to benefit people looking for work and people looking for higher wages? This important trade promotion authority is the first step to doing that. I will conclude because the distinguished Senator from Delaware is here and others who want to speak. Trade is an engine of growth. It keeps our economy growing. These upcoming trade agreements, whether it is the Trans-Pacific Partnership or the transatlantic investment treaty, serve as a great opportunity to turbo-charge that growth. Our economy actually contracted last quarter by 0.7 percent. As long as our economy is shrinking and not growing, we are not going to be able to create the jobs to put America back to work. We are not going to be able to create the sorts of wages that we want for all working Americans. This legislation represents an important step in that direction. I am glad that in the exercise of a little mutual trust and comity, we have reached this important point. We are not through yet because there are other parts of this trade package that we are going to need to process this week. But the promise and commitment we made on this side of the aisle was that if our colleagues across the aisle trust us to move through the trade promotion authority bill, we will continue to work with them and keep our commitments to them, and, hopefully, more than just the trust that produces these pieces of legislation will result from this increased confidence and trust in one another. We know we are going to find measures we will disagree on, and we will fight like cats and dogs when we need to. But when we actually agree on the policy and can find it within ourselves to work together, the American people are the beneficiaries. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, while the Senator from Texas is still on the floor, let me say, if I could--he mentioned the word ``trust'' a number of times. It is an important word in Congress. One of my favorite sayings is ``Integrity--if you have it, nothing else matters. Integrity--if you don't have it, nothing else matters.'' The same is true for trust. In order to get things done here--there is a lot we need to get done. Everybody realizes that. My takeaway from the election last November was threefold: No. 1, people want us to work together; No. 2, they want us to get stuff done; and No. 3, they want us to get things done that will actually strengthen the economic recovery. One of the ways to strengthen the economic recovery, frankly, is to make sure that those markets overseas will actually allow us to sell into them, whether it is products or goods or services, that we have access to those markets. The other thing is that my colleague from Texas is as big believer, as am I, in the Golden Rule, and that is to treat people the way we want to be treated. And I think most of the people in this country support what we are doing. Most of the Democrats in our country support what their President has proposed, and the Republicans as well. But what we need to do while we move forward with trade promotion authority is we need to keep in mind that not everybody will be helped by this and that there are some people who will to be disadvantaged, and we have an obligation to them to treat them how we would want to be treated if we were in their shoes. There is a sister piece of legislature to go along with trade promotion authority, and I would ask the Republican whip from Texas to give us some assurance or reassurance so we build trust around this issue. When we are contacted by folks from around the country today, tomorrow, or the next day, what are we going to do to provide assistance to those people who may be disadvantaged because of trade promotion authority and the trade deal that is going to be negotiated? Can you give us some assurance there? Is this like the end of the road or are there some more pieces to follow this week? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would respond to the question by our colleague from Delaware that assurances have been given that we understand that the trade promotion authority and the trade adjustment assistance travel together. I think we have seen examples where the benefits of trade are not uniformly felt across the country. There are some people who will be displaced. But the importance of trade adjustment assistance--I wish we could negotiate something a little more frugal that would actually get the job done. But a negotiation took place between Chairman Ryan in the House and the ranking member, Senator Wyden, in the Senate on this important piece of the package. We all recognize that these travel in pairs and that trade adjustment assistance is part of the price you pay for getting trade promotion authority done. But most importantly to my colleague's point from Delaware, for those people who are displaced, this guarantees that they will have access to the sort of job training and skills enhancement that they will need in order to get even better jobs in this economy [[Page S4531]] that, on net, will benefit the entire country. That is the intent on this side of the aisle and I think the intent of trade adjustment authority and making sure that we finish our work--not here today but through the rest of the week--on this important package of pieces of legislation. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank the Republican whip for those words and for his work on this. I would just close with this thought: Whenever I talk to people who have been married a long time--like 50, 60, 70 years--I always ask them, what is the secret to being married a long time? I get some very funny answers, and I get some very poignant ones as well. The best answer I have ever heard to that question, what is the secret to being married 50, 60, or 70 years, is the two c's--not ``Cornyn'' and ``Carper'' but ``communicate'' and ``compromise.'' I would add maybe a third to that, and that is ``collaborate.'' We need to demonstrate the ability to communicate and to compromise and to collaborate. And those aren't always the secret to a vibrant marriage, but they are the secret to a vibrant democracy. This is a confidence-building measure. I think we have taken an important step here, working with Democrats and Republicans and working with a Democratic President, and the next step is one we have just talked about, trade adjustment assistance. We need to do that. If we can actually work through these issues this week and produce a bipartisan product that the President is going to sign, we will actually build some trust. And when we turn to the issue of transportation and having a robust, vibrant transportation system and how to fund that, how to pay for that, what to do, this will be helpful. So my applause to Senator Ron Wyden, Senator Murray on our side, Senator Hatch, the leader on the Republican side, and to Senator Cornyn for good work--not done but a very good start today. I yield back the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia. Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I have the utmost respect for my colleagues, and I think they make compelling arguments. I just have a hard time. I really have a hard time, with this. I have not had one West Virginian--average, working West Virginian--who had a good job at one time and lost a job who thinks this type of approach to trade is good. Not one. And I am hearing them talking about how much trade we do from our States. I would like to know what type of trade. Manufactured products? I don't see many manufactured products leaving this country. I see an awful lot of resources, such as oil that has been refined into diesel fuel or gasoline. It probably comes from Texas, I would say. I think that is probably a big part of their trading, and those types of things. But how many people actually benefit from that who really have a good manufacturing job? That is all I have asked. We talked about TAA. We are all hung up on TAA. Do you know why we are hung up? Because we all understand we are going to lose more jobs. We have already lost 6 million jobs since NAFTA. We have all lost 6 million jobs across this country. I lost 31,000 manufacturing jobs. I understand NAFTA hasn't been enforced, and they had some rules in there. And then you take this piece of legislation, TPA--there was more security around this piece of legislation than there was around the Iran nuclear deal we were talking about. My staff could go there, they could take notes, we were briefed, and we were able to ask questions. We couldn't even take a note or take a note out. They are telling me: Well, you know, we all depend on trade and the market shrinking. We are at $18 trillion GDP. Think about this. We in the United States of America have the greatest economy the world has ever seen--$18 trillion. Do you know that of all these 11 countries we are talking about, the closest one to us is Japan--$4.5 trillion. It falls off the Richter scale. But yet we have to be very secretive because somebody might leave us. Well, let me tell you, I have been a businessperson all of my life. If I wanted to get into a market, I will assure you, I would be able to evaluate my competition, the people with whom I want to do business. If that was the big person on the block, I had to make more adjustments than they had to make. But yet we are so concerned about the secrecy of this deal that none of us are able to see it, work it, define it, dissect it, and improve upon it. Now we are just voting basically carte blanche and saying: OK, sure, you are going to get a 60-day review. You can't do a thing about it if you don't like it. I didn't think we were elected to do that. I really didn't. When you start looking at everything this stands for and you look at basically--and my father--my grandfather had a grocery store and my dad had a little furniture store, so I was raised in retail. One thing my dad always encouraged was competition. He enjoyed having it. He said: Joe, listen, good competition brings out more buyers. More buyers gives us more of a chance to sell our goods. What he never did like and what he thought was unfair was when you had unfair competition--didn't pay their taxes, didn't live by the rules or play by the rules. And if we didn't enforce those, it gave them an unfair competitive advantage. If you believe our past performance in our trade deals makes us an expert at enforcing and making sure people play by the rules so that America is treated right, then you probably would have voted for this. I don't. I can only judge off of our past performance, where we are today. When you go shopping for whatever types of goods--household goods, clothing goods, furniture--the greatest furniture markets in the world were in the United States. We make very little furniture in this country today. They still want our wood products, so you know what, yes, we ship logs out of West Virginia around the world so people can make the furniture that they want to send back to America. So I guess they say: Oh, yes, that is good trade. The only reason they are buying our logs is because they don't have the quality logs we have. They don't have the quality hardwood forests. The best coal in the world, the best metallurgical coal--coking--that makes the steel, the best in the world comes out of West Virginia. Sure they are going to buy it because they don't have it. They are going to make their products and send them back to us and come into these markets subsidized. I would just say sooner or later we ought to do something for America. You have to rebuild this country, and you don't build the wealth of a country based on basically moving paper back and forth. Moving paper back and forth--there are some people, with the wealth they accrue from this, I am sure they are very satisfied and happy with that. And we see the income inequality over the last 20 years. We have never seen this big of a spread. Never. You see the flatline of workers all over America, just as flatline as can be. I don't know how we can look them in the eye and say we have done the best because now we have opened up 11 new countries. Vietnam--58 cents an hour is what they are going to pay their workers. And we said: Whoa, whoa, NAFTA is going to be basically bringing the whole North American trade up to par. Twenty-two years later, I understand that Mexico's minimum wage is still under $1 an hour, around 80 cents. You think a person who makes 58 cents an hour or 80 cents an hour or $1.50 an hour--7 out of 11 countries make less than $2--that those people will have disposable income to buy the products we would like to sell so that we can expand our economy and our jobs? I am sorry, I don't think that is going to happen. I really don't. It doesn't make any sense to me at all how we expect a person who can barely survive to have disposable income to buy products that we in the United States of America wish to sell to really lift our manufacturing base. But I guess that is why we have TAA that we are arguing about because we know we have given that up. We just about wrote that off 22 years ago, so I guess we are going to write the rest of it off now. Technology is great. I am all for innovation, creation, technology. I am for every bit of that. But sooner or later, you have to make something, you have to build something, you have [[Page S4532]] to reinvest, and there have to be people making these products, being able to support their families and to have a benefit package that gives them a decent life. When I was growing up in little Farmington, WV, we had manufacturing, mining. We had people who could go to work, work hard, make a living, take their family on vacation, pay the bills. And we let all of that slip away from us. I am not saying they will be the jobs of the past, but we could have the jobs of the future--steel, manufacturing. So I am not willing to give up on this. You don't find me chastising my colleagues on the Republican side or my colleagues on the Democratic side. I think we are all here for the right reason. Sometimes we get a little bit off track, and I think this is one time we have gotten off track. Something that would really help the United States of America, working families all over this country, we have kind of forgotten about, and I am concerned about that. I am concerned about going home to my beautiful State of West Virginia and telling the people: I am sorry, we are going to have a harder time competing with some of these countries because there is just no way. We have opened up our borders. We have let international trade, an international manufacturing base go wherever they get the best deal. And I guarantee you that in every developing country, they are not going to be as tough as we are on human rights and on the environmental quality they should be aspiring to. They are not going to be tough on those things. They are trying to build an economy. They are trying to build, basically, a nation, bring it up. And they are going to be a little bit lax on these things. That is unfair competition, which my dad always warned me against. When we talk about European trade, I am not worried about European trade because they are basically on the same level playing field that we are. But when you are trying to build up a country, should you sacrifice and tear down your country? Should you give away everything you have worked hard for and built? I want to help these countries. I have not a bit of problem helping these countries. I am not an isolationist. But I basically would have put something in there that would have protected our manufacturing base. I would have put something in that said that when we fell below certain jobs in manufacturing, it stops. You don't give it all away. It is hard to regain that and recapture it. I am sure Wall Street is very happy today. I have a lot of friends who work on Wall Street. There are a lot of good people who work on Wall Street, but there are a lot of people who basically are just driven by the almighty dollar. They are not driven by Main Street. They are not worried about West Virginia. They are not worried about my little town of Farmington or any part of my State. And they are going to be very happy. They are not worried about 99 percent of the people who are still on Main Street trying to survive. We talked about the Export-Import Bank. They said: Trust us; we are going to get a vote on Export-Import Bank. Maybe we will sometime. I would hope that comes to fruition. That helped a lot of small businesses. We haven't gotten that vote yet. So you would have thought there would have been a priority to get a vote on that. It has done an awful lot to get us in the market so we can compete on a more level playing field. That hasn't happened. But here we go again. We are going to have some votes tomorrow, and the votes tomorrow are going to be based on the TAA because the House couldn't pass TPA fast-track with TAA in it. It is basically what we are dealing with. So they think we can do a backdoor. What makes you think TAA would be acceptable in any way, shape, or form in the House? What makes you think now, since we have carved this out--but we were promised a vote here on the TAA, which we know we are going to need--it is going to make it more acceptable on the House side when they made them take TAA out and couldn't pass TAA in the TPA bill? Doesn't make any sense to me. So I think it is a sad day today. I really do. And I am concerned. I am concerned about our country. I am concerned about my hard-working people in West Virginia--and I know you are--and all the other States we have. These are good people. They deserve an opportunity. They deserve fair trade. They really deserve a fair trading country, people who will trade honestly with us and who have a quality or standard that they have to live up to in order to get into our markets. I don't think we should sacrifice our markets basically just to build them up. I think we should assist them, but they are going to have to find their own markets to the point where we don't sacrifice. So I think this could be a troubling thing. I am hoping it is not, but it could be. I have concerns. And I have said that if I can't explain it back home, I can't vote for it. And this is one I could not explain back home. I could not make the people feel comfortable that this is really going to improve quality of life and opportunities for them and their families. I couldn't do it because I don't see it. I don't believe in it. And I said I wouldn't vote for it, and I didn't. With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I just want to say a few things about the vote we just took on cloture to proceed with TPA. The Senator who just spoke talked about some of the problems with the deal and the dislocations that happen when we have trade. We all recognize there are dislocations. There are dislocations whenever an economy adjusts and moves ahead with or without trade. But trade overall is necessary. It is good. Free trade is good. Ninety-five percent of the world's consumers live outside our boundaries. Seventy percent of the world's economic output happens outside of our boundaries. We need to trade. We can't just say: Well, we are just going to live within ourselves here, have an economy that doesn't reach out or pull in. We benefit. We benefit from better services and cheaper goods when we trade. Our manufacturers benefit when we are able to export our products. It was said before that we haven't seen any good outcomes after NAFTA. We have. It is rewriting history to say that we haven't seen good outcomes as a result of NAFTA. I think the last speaker said Mexico has not improved since NAFTA. It has. I can tell you, as a representative of a State that borders with Mexico, the economy is considerably bigger and better. Arizona is one of our biggest trading partners. It has improved since NAFTA. These trade agreements work. We haven't had a trade agreement negotiated without the TPA process--with the exception of one--I think in over 30 years. That one was a deal I believe with Jordan, and it had far more to do with defense than commerce. So we need to have TPA--this process--in order to negotiate these trade agreements. The vast majority of our trade--I believe it is close to 90 percent of our trade--is with countries with which we have free- trade agreements. So I applaud those who have worked so hard to bring this to pass here--Senators Hatch and Wyden and others--and the compromises that took place. I am not a particular fan of trade adjustment assistance. When economies move forward, there are dislocations. We can't account for all of them. In fact, we have seen some of the problems with previous TAA assistance. I believe some of it went to those who were laid off at Solyndra and to some of these things that had very little to do with trade. Because of the way you seek such assistance, we don't do the best that we could to keep track of where those jobs were lost to. But having said that, we all recognize, as the Senator from Texas said earlier, that TAA is the price we pay to get TPA. We all recognize in this body that there are compromises that need to be made. That is how we move legislation, and that is how we get important legislation such as TPA passed so that we can [[Page S4533]] have more free trade, and our economy will benefit because of it. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4529-S4533] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEFENDING PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT ACT The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report. The legislative clerk read as follows: House message to accompany H.R. 2146, an act to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow Federal law enforcement officers, firefighters, and air traffic controllers to make penalty-free withdrawals from governmental plans after age 50, and for other purposes. Pending: McConnell motion to concur in the amendment of the House to the amendment of the Senate to the bill. McConnell motion to concur in the amendment of the House to the amendment of the Senate to the bill, with amendment No. 2060 (to the House amendment to the Senate amendment to the bill), to change the enactment date. McConnell amendment No. 2061 (to amendment No. 2060), of a perfecting nature. McConnell motion to refer the bill to the Committee on Finance, with instructions, McConnell amendment No. 2062, to change the enactment date. McConnell amendment No. 2063 (to (the instructions) amendment No. 2062), of a perfecting nature. McConnell amendment No. 2064 (to amendment No. 2063), of a perfecting nature. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Cloture having been invoked, the motion to refer falls. The majority leader. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would just like to announce that Senator Corker was inadvertently detained in getting to the floor of the Senate. Had he been here, he would have voted yea on the cloture motion. Mr. President, I also just want to say to our colleagues that this is a very important day for our country. We have demonstrated we can work together on a bipartisan basis to achieve something that is extremely important for America. Not only when we confirm this trade promotion authority will we have the mechanism in place for the President to finalize an extraordinarily important deal with a number of different Asian countries, but it will indicate that America is back in the trade business. It will also send a message to our allies that we understand that they are somewhat wary about Chinese commercial and potentially military domination and that we intend to still be deeply involved in the Pacific. So I want to congratulate Senator Hatch and Senator Wyden. This has been a long and rather twisted path to where we are today, but it is a very important accomplishment for the country. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I would like to mention that as to the other two absences, Senator Menendez had voted no on cloture before, and Senator Lee had voted no on cloture before. So the vote would have been 61 to 39. More importantly, this is a day of celebration in the corporate suites of this country, to be sure, because they have another corporate-sponsored trade agreement that will mean more money in some investors' pockets. It will mean more plant closings in Ohio, Arizona, Delaware, Rhode Island, West Virginia, Maine, and all over this country. Most importantly, what I didn't understand about the vote today is that even though the Wall Street Journal, the CATO Institute, and others acknowledge that, as to the decisions we make here on trade agreements--while they say it is a net increase in jobs--people lose their jobs because of the decisions we make. So we make decisions here today that throw people out of work. We know that. Across the political spectrum that is acknowledged. But we today don't do anything to help those workers that lose their jobs. We make a decision to throw people in Mansfield, OH, and Cleveland, OH, out of work, but then we don't take care of those workers that lost their jobs because of our decisions. It is shameful. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me just concur with the Senator from Ohio. This trade agreement was supported by virtually every major corporation in this country, the vast majority of whom have outsourced millions of jobs to low-wage countries all over the world. This trade agreement is supported by Wall Street. This trade agreement is supported by the pharmaceutical industry, which wants to charge people in poor countries higher prices for the medicine they desperately need. This agreement was opposed by every union in this country, working for the best interests of working families, and by almost every environmental group and many religious groups. In my view, this trade agreement will continue the policies of NAFTA, CAFTA, and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China--agreements that have cost us millions of decent-paying jobs. We need a new trade policy in America--a policy that represents working families and not just the big money interests. I strongly disagree with the majority leader, who called this a great day for America. It is not a great day. It is a great day for the Big Money interests, not a great day for working families. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip. [[Page S4530]] Order For Recess Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. today for the weekly conference meetings, as well as from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. today for an all-Senators briefing, and that all time in recess count postcloture. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it is no secret that Republicans on this side of the aisle don't agree with President Obama about everything. In fact, I would say that on balance most Republicans disagree with the policy choices made by this President. But occasionally--occasionally-- even the leader of the Democratic Party, the President of the United States, gets things right. Occasionally, the President of the United States gets his policy choices right, and he did so with regard to trade promotion authority. I would point out to our friends and to anybody listening that this actually is a 6-year trade promotion authority. This extends well beyond the tenure of the current occupant of the White House, and it will be available for the next President of the United States to negotiate trade deals that are in the best interests of the United States. So I agree with the majority leader. This latest vote is just another example of the Senate getting back to work and restored to regular working order. This is a dramatic departure from the old Senate, because there has actually been a lot of time for consideration of important pieces of legislation--from the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act to the Justice for Victims of Human Trafficking Act to the budget. By moving this trade promotion authority bill forward, we can ensure that American workers and businesses can get the best deal in trade agreements with countries from Asia to South America to Europe. I believe we have actually kept the campaign promises we made last year that, if the American people entrusted the Republicans with the new majority, we would work together with our allies where we could on the other side of the aisle where we have common cause to deliver results for the American people, to legislate in their best interest-- not just to obstruct for obstruction's sake or gain some temporary tactical or political advantage but to promote a functioning, deliberative Senate. I see one of the leaders of this effort, the Senator from Delaware, who has done great work trying to find that common cause and producing a result, as exemplified by the TPA. I am going to yield for him in just a moment. But let me just talk briefly about my response to the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from Ohio, who said there is nothing good to be had out of this trade promotion authority or any potential trade deals that we might negotiate. My home State of Texas relies heavily on international trade. We are the number one trading State in the Nation, which is just one reason why our economy grew at the rate of 5.2 percent in 2014. Our economy in Texas grew at the rate of 5.2 percent in 2014. Do you know the rate at which the U.S. economy grew? The U.S. economy grew at just 2.2 percent. So why wouldn't we want to do anything and everything we can to stimulate the growth of the economy to benefit people looking for work and people looking for higher wages? This important trade promotion authority is the first step to doing that. I will conclude because the distinguished Senator from Delaware is here and others who want to speak. Trade is an engine of growth. It keeps our economy growing. These upcoming trade agreements, whether it is the Trans-Pacific Partnership or the transatlantic investment treaty, serve as a great opportunity to turbo-charge that growth. Our economy actually contracted last quarter by 0.7 percent. As long as our economy is shrinking and not growing, we are not going to be able to create the jobs to put America back to work. We are not going to be able to create the sorts of wages that we want for all working Americans. This legislation represents an important step in that direction. I am glad that in the exercise of a little mutual trust and comity, we have reached this important point. We are not through yet because there are other parts of this trade package that we are going to need to process this week. But the promise and commitment we made on this side of the aisle was that if our colleagues across the aisle trust us to move through the trade promotion authority bill, we will continue to work with them and keep our commitments to them, and, hopefully, more than just the trust that produces these pieces of legislation will result from this increased confidence and trust in one another. We know we are going to find measures we will disagree on, and we will fight like cats and dogs when we need to. But when we actually agree on the policy and can find it within ourselves to work together, the American people are the beneficiaries. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, while the Senator from Texas is still on the floor, let me say, if I could--he mentioned the word ``trust'' a number of times. It is an important word in Congress. One of my favorite sayings is ``Integrity--if you have it, nothing else matters. Integrity--if you don't have it, nothing else matters.'' The same is true for trust. In order to get things done here--there is a lot we need to get done. Everybody realizes that. My takeaway from the election last November was threefold: No. 1, people want us to work together; No. 2, they want us to get stuff done; and No. 3, they want us to get things done that will actually strengthen the economic recovery. One of the ways to strengthen the economic recovery, frankly, is to make sure that those markets overseas will actually allow us to sell into them, whether it is products or goods or services, that we have access to those markets. The other thing is that my colleague from Texas is as big believer, as am I, in the Golden Rule, and that is to treat people the way we want to be treated. And I think most of the people in this country support what we are doing. Most of the Democrats in our country support what their President has proposed, and the Republicans as well. But what we need to do while we move forward with trade promotion authority is we need to keep in mind that not everybody will be helped by this and that there are some people who will to be disadvantaged, and we have an obligation to them to treat them how we would want to be treated if we were in their shoes. There is a sister piece of legislature to go along with trade promotion authority, and I would ask the Republican whip from Texas to give us some assurance or reassurance so we build trust around this issue. When we are contacted by folks from around the country today, tomorrow, or the next day, what are we going to do to provide assistance to those people who may be disadvantaged because of trade promotion authority and the trade deal that is going to be negotiated? Can you give us some assurance there? Is this like the end of the road or are there some more pieces to follow this week? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip. Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would respond to the question by our colleague from Delaware that assurances have been given that we understand that the trade promotion authority and the trade adjustment assistance travel together. I think we have seen examples where the benefits of trade are not uniformly felt across the country. There are some people who will be displaced. But the importance of trade adjustment assistance--I wish we could negotiate something a little more frugal that would actually get the job done. But a negotiation took place between Chairman Ryan in the House and the ranking member, Senator Wyden, in the Senate on this important piece of the package. We all recognize that these travel in pairs and that trade adjustment assistance is part of the price you pay for getting trade promotion authority done. But most importantly to my colleague's point from Delaware, for those people who are displaced, this guarantees that they will have access to the sort of job training and skills enhancement that they will need in order to get even better jobs in this economy [[Page S4531]] that, on net, will benefit the entire country. That is the intent on this side of the aisle and I think the intent of trade adjustment authority and making sure that we finish our work--not here today but through the rest of the week--on this important package of pieces of legislation. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank the Republican whip for those words and for his work on this. I would just close with this thought: Whenever I talk to people who have been married a long time--like 50, 60, 70 years--I always ask them, what is the secret to being married a long time? I get some very funny answers, and I get some very poignant ones as well. The best answer I have ever heard to that question, what is the secret to being married 50, 60, or 70 years, is the two c's--not ``Cornyn'' and ``Carper'' but ``communicate'' and ``compromise.'' I would add maybe a third to that, and that is ``collaborate.'' We need to demonstrate the ability to communicate and to compromise and to collaborate. And those aren't always the secret to a vibrant marriage, but they are the secret to a vibrant democracy. This is a confidence-building measure. I think we have taken an important step here, working with Democrats and Republicans and working with a Democratic President, and the next step is one we have just talked about, trade adjustment assistance. We need to do that. If we can actually work through these issues this week and produce a bipartisan product that the President is going to sign, we will actually build some trust. And when we turn to the issue of transportation and having a robust, vibrant transportation system and how to fund that, how to pay for that, what to do, this will be helpful. So my applause to Senator Ron Wyden, Senator Murray on our side, Senator Hatch, the leader on the Republican side, and to Senator Cornyn for good work--not done but a very good start today. I yield back the remainder of my time. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia. Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I have the utmost respect for my colleagues, and I think they make compelling arguments. I just have a hard time. I really have a hard time, with this. I have not had one West Virginian--average, working West Virginian--who had a good job at one time and lost a job who thinks this type of approach to trade is good. Not one. And I am hearing them talking about how much trade we do from our States. I would like to know what type of trade. Manufactured products? I don't see many manufactured products leaving this country. I see an awful lot of resources, such as oil that has been refined into diesel fuel or gasoline. It probably comes from Texas, I would say. I think that is probably a big part of their trading, and those types of things. But how many people actually benefit from that who really have a good manufacturing job? That is all I have asked. We talked about TAA. We are all hung up on TAA. Do you know why we are hung up? Because we all understand we are going to lose more jobs. We have already lost 6 million jobs since NAFTA. We have all lost 6 million jobs across this country. I lost 31,000 manufacturing jobs. I understand NAFTA hasn't been enforced, and they had some rules in there. And then you take this piece of legislation, TPA--there was more security around this piece of legislation than there was around the Iran nuclear deal we were talking about. My staff could go there, they could take notes, we were briefed, and we were able to ask questions. We couldn't even take a note or take a note out. They are telling me: Well, you know, we all depend on trade and the market shrinking. We are at $18 trillion GDP. Think about this. We in the United States of America have the greatest economy the world has ever seen--$18 trillion. Do you know that of all these 11 countries we are talking about, the closest one to us is Japan--$4.5 trillion. It falls off the Richter scale. But yet we have to be very secretive because somebody might leave us. Well, let me tell you, I have been a businessperson all of my life. If I wanted to get into a market, I will assure you, I would be able to evaluate my competition, the people with whom I want to do business. If that was the big person on the block, I had to make more adjustments than they had to make. But yet we are so concerned about the secrecy of this deal that none of us are able to see it, work it, define it, dissect it, and improve upon it. Now we are just voting basically carte blanche and saying: OK, sure, you are going to get a 60-day review. You can't do a thing about it if you don't like it. I didn't think we were elected to do that. I really didn't. When you start looking at everything this stands for and you look at basically--and my father--my grandfather had a grocery store and my dad had a little furniture store, so I was raised in retail. One thing my dad always encouraged was competition. He enjoyed having it. He said: Joe, listen, good competition brings out more buyers. More buyers gives us more of a chance to sell our goods. What he never did like and what he thought was unfair was when you had unfair competition--didn't pay their taxes, didn't live by the rules or play by the rules. And if we didn't enforce those, it gave them an unfair competitive advantage. If you believe our past performance in our trade deals makes us an expert at enforcing and making sure people play by the rules so that America is treated right, then you probably would have voted for this. I don't. I can only judge off of our past performance, where we are today. When you go shopping for whatever types of goods--household goods, clothing goods, furniture--the greatest furniture markets in the world were in the United States. We make very little furniture in this country today. They still want our wood products, so you know what, yes, we ship logs out of West Virginia around the world so people can make the furniture that they want to send back to America. So I guess they say: Oh, yes, that is good trade. The only reason they are buying our logs is because they don't have the quality logs we have. They don't have the quality hardwood forests. The best coal in the world, the best metallurgical coal--coking--that makes the steel, the best in the world comes out of West Virginia. Sure they are going to buy it because they don't have it. They are going to make their products and send them back to us and come into these markets subsidized. I would just say sooner or later we ought to do something for America. You have to rebuild this country, and you don't build the wealth of a country based on basically moving paper back and forth. Moving paper back and forth--there are some people, with the wealth they accrue from this, I am sure they are very satisfied and happy with that. And we see the income inequality over the last 20 years. We have never seen this big of a spread. Never. You see the flatline of workers all over America, just as flatline as can be. I don't know how we can look them in the eye and say we have done the best because now we have opened up 11 new countries. Vietnam--58 cents an hour is what they are going to pay their workers. And we said: Whoa, whoa, NAFTA is going to be basically bringing the whole North American trade up to par. Twenty-two years later, I understand that Mexico's minimum wage is still under $1 an hour, around 80 cents. You think a person who makes 58 cents an hour or 80 cents an hour or $1.50 an hour--7 out of 11 countries make less than $2--that those people will have disposable income to buy the products we would like to sell so that we can expand our economy and our jobs? I am sorry, I don't think that is going to happen. I really don't. It doesn't make any sense to me at all how we expect a person who can barely survive to have disposable income to buy products that we in the United States of America wish to sell to really lift our manufacturing base. But I guess that is why we have TAA that we are arguing about because we know we have given that up. We just about wrote that off 22 years ago, so I guess we are going to write the rest of it off now. Technology is great. I am all for innovation, creation, technology. I am for every bit of that. But sooner or later, you have to make something, you have to build something, you have [[Page S4532]] to reinvest, and there have to be people making these products, being able to support their families and to have a benefit package that gives them a decent life. When I was growing up in little Farmington, WV, we had manufacturing, mining. We had people who could go to work, work hard, make a living, take their family on vacation, pay the bills. And we let all of that slip away from us. I am not saying they will be the jobs of the past, but we could have the jobs of the future--steel, manufacturing. So I am not willing to give up on this. You don't find me chastising my colleagues on the Republican side or my colleagues on the Democratic side. I think we are all here for the right reason. Sometimes we get a little bit off track, and I think this is one time we have gotten off track. Something that would really help the United States of America, working families all over this country, we have kind of forgotten about, and I am concerned about that. I am concerned about going home to my beautiful State of West Virginia and telling the people: I am sorry, we are going to have a harder time competing with some of these countries because there is just no way. We have opened up our borders. We have let international trade, an international manufacturing base go wherever they get the best deal. And I guarantee you that in every developing country, they are not going to be as tough as we are on human rights and on the environmental quality they should be aspiring to. They are not going to be tough on those things. They are trying to build an economy. They are trying to build, basically, a nation, bring it up. And they are going to be a little bit lax on these things. That is unfair competition, which my dad always warned me against. When we talk about European trade, I am not worried about European trade because they are basically on the same level playing field that we are. But when you are trying to build up a country, should you sacrifice and tear down your country? Should you give away everything you have worked hard for and built? I want to help these countries. I have not a bit of problem helping these countries. I am not an isolationist. But I basically would have put something in there that would have protected our manufacturing base. I would have put something in that said that when we fell below certain jobs in manufacturing, it stops. You don't give it all away. It is hard to regain that and recapture it. I am sure Wall Street is very happy today. I have a lot of friends who work on Wall Street. There are a lot of good people who work on Wall Street, but there are a lot of people who basically are just driven by the almighty dollar. They are not driven by Main Street. They are not worried about West Virginia. They are not worried about my little town of Farmington or any part of my State. And they are going to be very happy. They are not worried about 99 percent of the people who are still on Main Street trying to survive. We talked about the Export-Import Bank. They said: Trust us; we are going to get a vote on Export-Import Bank. Maybe we will sometime. I would hope that comes to fruition. That helped a lot of small businesses. We haven't gotten that vote yet. So you would have thought there would have been a priority to get a vote on that. It has done an awful lot to get us in the market so we can compete on a more level playing field. That hasn't happened. But here we go again. We are going to have some votes tomorrow, and the votes tomorrow are going to be based on the TAA because the House couldn't pass TPA fast-track with TAA in it. It is basically what we are dealing with. So they think we can do a backdoor. What makes you think TAA would be acceptable in any way, shape, or form in the House? What makes you think now, since we have carved this out--but we were promised a vote here on the TAA, which we know we are going to need--it is going to make it more acceptable on the House side when they made them take TAA out and couldn't pass TAA in the TPA bill? Doesn't make any sense to me. So I think it is a sad day today. I really do. And I am concerned. I am concerned about our country. I am concerned about my hard-working people in West Virginia--and I know you are--and all the other States we have. These are good people. They deserve an opportunity. They deserve fair trade. They really deserve a fair trading country, people who will trade honestly with us and who have a quality or standard that they have to live up to in order to get into our markets. I don't think we should sacrifice our markets basically just to build them up. I think we should assist them, but they are going to have to find their own markets to the point where we don't sacrifice. So I think this could be a troubling thing. I am hoping it is not, but it could be. I have concerns. And I have said that if I can't explain it back home, I can't vote for it. And this is one I could not explain back home. I could not make the people feel comfortable that this is really going to improve quality of life and opportunities for them and their families. I couldn't do it because I don't see it. I don't believe in it. And I said I wouldn't vote for it, and I didn't. With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I just want to say a few things about the vote we just took on cloture to proceed with TPA. The Senator who just spoke talked about some of the problems with the deal and the dislocations that happen when we have trade. We all recognize there are dislocations. There are dislocations whenever an economy adjusts and moves ahead with or without trade. But trade overall is necessary. It is good. Free trade is good. Ninety-five percent of the world's consumers live outside our boundaries. Seventy percent of the world's economic output happens outside of our boundaries. We need to trade. We can't just say: Well, we are just going to live within ourselves here, have an economy that doesn't reach out or pull in. We benefit. We benefit from better services and cheaper goods when we trade. Our manufacturers benefit when we are able to export our products. It was said before that we haven't seen any good outcomes after NAFTA. We have. It is rewriting history to say that we haven't seen good outcomes as a result of NAFTA. I think the last speaker said Mexico has not improved since NAFTA. It has. I can tell you, as a representative of a State that borders with Mexico, the economy is considerably bigger and better. Arizona is one of our biggest trading partners. It has improved since NAFTA. These trade agreements work. We haven't had a trade agreement negotiated without the TPA process--with the exception of one--I think in over 30 years. That one was a deal I believe with Jordan, and it had far more to do with defense than commerce. So we need to have TPA--this process--in order to negotiate these trade agreements. The vast majority of our trade--I believe it is close to 90 percent of our trade--is with countries with which we have free- trade agreements. So I applaud those who have worked so hard to bring this to pass here--Senators Hatch and Wyden and others--and the compromises that took place. I am not a particular fan of trade adjustment assistance. When economies move forward, there are dislocations. We can't account for all of them. In fact, we have seen some of the problems with previous TAA assistance. I believe some of it went to those who were laid off at Solyndra and to some of these things that had very little to do with trade. Because of the way you seek such assistance, we don't do the best that we could to keep track of where those jobs were lost to. But having said that, we all recognize, as the Senator from Texas said earlier, that TAA is the price we pay to get TPA. We all recognize in this body that there are compromises that need to be made. That is how we move legislation, and that is how we get important legislation such as TPA passed so that we can [[Page S4533]] have more free trade, and our economy will benefit because of it. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",package_114_266.csv,30467,30467,30535,"[congressional record volume 161, number 101 (tuesday, june 23, 2015)] [senate] [pages s4529-s4533]

senator corker was inadvertently detained in getting to the floor of the senate. had he been here, he would have voted yea on the cloture motion. mr. president, i also just want to say to our colleagues that this is a very important day for our country. we have demonstrated we can work together on a bipartisan basis to achieve something that is extremely important for america. not only when we confirm this trade promotion authority will we have the mechanism in place for the president to finalize an extraordinarily important deal with a number of different asian countries, but it will indicate that america is back in the trade business. it will also send a message to our allies that we understand that they are somewhat wary about chinese commercial and potentially military domination and that we intend to still be deeply involved in the pacific. so i want to congratulate senator hatch and senator wyden. this has been a long and rather twisted path to where we are today, but it is a very important accomplishment for the country. the presiding officer. the senator from ohio. mr. brown. mr. president, i would like to mention that as to the other two absences, senator menendez had voted no on cloture before, and senator lee had voted no on cloture before. so the vote would have been 61 to 39. more importantly, this is a day of celebration in the corporate suites of this country, to be sure, because they have another corporate-sponsored trade agreement that will mean more money in some investors' pockets. it will mean more plant closings in ohio, arizona, delaware, rhode island, west virginia, maine, and all over this country. most importantly, what i didn't understand about the vote today is that even though the wall street journal, the cato institute, and others acknowledge that, as to the decisions we make here on trade agreements--while they say it is a net increase in jobs--people lose their jobs because of the decisions we make. so we make decisions here today that throw people out of work. we know that. across the political spectrum that is acknowledged. but we today don't do anything to help those workers that lose their jobs. we make a decision to throw people in mansfield, oh, and cleveland, oh, out of work, but then we don't take care of those workers that lost their jobs because of our decisions. it is shameful. the presiding officer. the senator from vermont. mr. sanders. mr. president, let me just concur with the senator from ohio. this trade agreement was supported by virtually every major corporation in this country, the vast majority of whom have outsourced millions of jobs to low-wage countries all over the world. this trade agreement is supported by wall street. this trade agreement is supported by the pharmaceutical industry, which wants to charge people in poor countries higher prices for the medicine they desperately need. this agreement was opposed by every union in this country, working for the best interests of working families, and by almost every environmental group and many religious groups. in my view, this trade agreement will continue the policies of nafta, cafta, and permanent normal trade relations with china--agreements that have cost us millions of decent-paying jobs. we need a new trade policy in america--a policy that represents working families and not just the big money interests. i strongly disagree with the majority leader, who called this a great day for america. it is not a great day. it is a great day for the big money interests, not a great day for working families. the presiding officer. the majority whip. [[page s4530]] order for recess mr. cornyn. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. today for the weekly conference meetings, as well as from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. today for an all-senators briefing, and that all time in recess count postcloture. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. cornyn. mr. president, it is no secret that republicans on this side of the aisle don't agree with president obama about everything. in fact, i would say that on balance most republicans disagree with the policy choices made by this president. but occasionally--occasionally-- even the leader of the democratic party, the president of the united states, gets things right. occasionally, the president of the united states gets his policy choices right, and he did so with regard to trade promotion authority. i would point out to our friends and to anybody listening that this actually is a 6-year trade promotion authority. this extends well beyond the tenure of the current occupant of the white house, and it will be available for the next president of the united states to negotiate trade deals that are in the best interests of the united states. so i agree with the majority leader. this latest vote is just another example of the senate getting back to work and restored to regular working order. this is a dramatic departure from the old senate, because there has actually been a lot of time for consideration of important pieces of legislation--from the iran nuclear agreement review act to the justice for victims of human trafficking act to the budget. by moving this trade promotion authority bill forward, we can ensure that american workers and businesses can get the best deal in trade agreements with countries from asia to south america to europe. i believe we have actually kept the campaign promises we made last year that, if the american people entrusted the republicans with the new majority, we would work together with our allies where we could on the other side of the aisle where we have common cause to deliver results for the american people, to legislate in their best interest-- not just to obstruct for obstruction's sake or gain some temporary tactical or political advantage but to promote a functioning, deliberative senate. i see one of the leaders of this effort, the senator from delaware, who has done great work trying to find that common cause and producing a result, as exemplified by the tpa. i am going to yield for him in just a moment. but let me just talk briefly about my response to the senator from vermont and the senator from ohio, who said there is nothing good to be had out of this trade promotion authority or any potential trade deals that we might negotiate. my home state of texas relies heavily on international trade. we are the number one trading state in the nation, which is just one reason why our economy grew at the rate of 5.2 percent in 2014. our economy in texas grew at the rate of 5.2 percent in 2014. do you know the rate at which the u.s. economy grew? the u.s. economy grew at just 2.2 percent. so why wouldn't we want to do anything and everything we can to stimulate the growth of the economy to benefit people looking for work and people looking for higher wages? this important trade promotion authority is the first step to doing that. i will conclude because the distinguished senator from delaware is here and others who want to speak. trade is an engine of growth. it keeps our economy growing. these upcoming trade agreements, whether it is the trans-pacific partnership or the transatlantic investment treaty, serve as a great opportunity to turbo-charge that growth. our economy actually contracted last quarter by 0.7 percent. as long as our economy is shrinking and not growing, we are not going to be able to create the jobs to put america back to work. we are not going to be able to create the sorts of wages that we want for all working americans. this legislation represents an important step in that direction. i am glad that in the exercise of a little mutual trust and comity, we have reached this important point. we are not through yet because there are other parts of this trade package that we are going to need to process this week. but the promise and commitment we made on this side of the aisle was that if our colleagues across the aisle trust us to move through the trade promotion authority bill, we will continue to work with them and keep our commitments to them, and, hopefully, more than just the trust that produces these pieces of legislation will result from this increased confidence and trust in one another. we know we are going to find measures we will disagree on, and we will fight like cats and dogs when we need to. but when we actually agree on the policy and can find it within ourselves to work together, the american people are the beneficiaries. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from delaware. mr. carper. mr. president, while the senator from texas is still on the floor, let me say, if i could--he mentioned the word ``trust'' a number of times. it is an important word in congress. one of my favorite sayings is ``integrity--if you have it, nothing else matters. integrity--if you don't have it, nothing else matters.'' the same is true for trust. in order to get things done here--there is a lot we need to get done. everybody realizes that. my takeaway from the election last november was threefold: no. 1, people want us to work together; no. 2, they want us to get stuff done; and no. 3, they want us to get things done that will actually strengthen the economic recovery. one of the ways to strengthen the economic recovery, frankly, is to make sure that those markets overseas will actually allow us to sell into them, whether it is products or goods or services, that we have access to those markets. the other thing is that my colleague from texas is as big believer, as am i, in the golden rule, and that is to treat people the way we want to be treated. and i think most of the people in this country support what we are doing. most of the democrats in our country support what their president has proposed, and the republicans as well. but what we need to do while we move forward with trade promotion authority is we need to keep in mind that not everybody will be helped by this and that there are some people who will to be disadvantaged, and we have an obligation to them to treat them how we would want to be treated if we were in their shoes. there is a sister piece of legislature to go along with trade promotion authority, and i would ask the republican whip from texas to give us some assurance or reassurance so we build trust around this issue. when we are contacted by folks from around the country today, tomorrow, or the next day, what are we going to do to provide assistance to those people who may be disadvantaged because of trade promotion authority and the trade deal that is going to be negotiated? can you give us some assurance there? is this like the end of the road or are there some more pieces to follow this week? the presiding officer. the majority whip. mr. cornyn. mr. president, i would respond to the question by our colleague from delaware that assurances have been given that we understand that the trade promotion authority and the trade adjustment assistance travel together. i think we have seen examples where the benefits of trade are not uniformly felt across the country. there are some people who will be displaced. but the importance of trade adjustment assistance--i wish we could negotiate something a little more frugal that would actually get the job done. but a negotiation took place between chairman ryan in the house and the ranking member, senator wyden, in the senate on this important piece of the package. we all recognize that these travel in pairs and that trade adjustment assistance is part of the price you pay for getting trade promotion authority done. but most importantly to my colleague's point from delaware, for those people who are displaced, this guarantees that they will have access to the sort of job training and skills enhancement that they will need in order to get even better jobs in this economy [[page s4531]] that, on net, will benefit the entire country. that is the intent on this side of the aisle and i think the intent of trade adjustment authority and making sure that we finish our work--not here today but through the rest of the week--on this important package of pieces of legislation. mr. carper. mr. president, i thank the republican whip for those words and for his work on this. i would just close with this thought: whenever i talk to people who have been married a long time--like 50, 60, 70 years--i always ask them, what is the secret to being married a long time? i get some very funny answers, and i get some very poignant ones as well. the best answer i have ever heard to that question, what is the secret to being married 50, 60, or 70 years, is the two c's--not ``cornyn'' and ``carper'' but ``communicate'' and ``compromise.'' i would add maybe a third to that, and that is ``collaborate.'' we need to demonstrate the ability to communicate and to compromise and to collaborate. and those aren't always the secret to a vibrant marriage, but they are the secret to a vibrant democracy. this is a confidence-building measure. i think we have taken an important step here, working with democrats and republicans and working with a democratic president, and the next step is one we have just talked about, trade adjustment assistance. we need to do that. if we can actually work through these issues this week and produce a bipartisan product that the president is going to sign, we will actually build some trust. and when we turn to the issue of transportation and having a robust, vibrant transportation system and how to fund that, how to pay for that, what to do, this will be helpful. so my applause to senator ron wyden, senator murray on our side, senator hatch, the leader on the republican side, and to senator cornyn for good work--not done but a very good start today. i yield back the remainder of my time. the presiding officer. the senator from west virginia. mr. manchin. mr. president, i have the utmost respect for my colleagues, and i think they make compelling arguments. i just have a hard time. i really have a hard time, with this. i have not had one west virginian--average, working west virginian--who had a good job at one time and lost a job who thinks this type of approach to trade is good. not one. and i am hearing them talking about how much trade we do from our states. i would like to know what type of trade. manufactured products? i don't see many manufactured products leaving this country. i see an awful lot of resources, such as oil that has been refined into diesel fuel or gasoline. it probably comes from texas, i would say. i think that is probably a big part of their trading, and those types of things. but how many people actually benefit from that who really have a good manufacturing job? that is all i have asked. we talked about taa. we are all hung up on taa. do you know why we are hung up? because we all understand we are going to lose more jobs. we have already lost 6 million jobs since nafta. we have all lost 6 million jobs across this country. i lost 31,000 manufacturing jobs. i understand nafta hasn't been enforced, and they had some rules in there. and then you take this piece of legislation, tpa--there was more security around this piece of legislation than there was around the iran nuclear deal we were talking about. my staff could go there, they could take notes, we were briefed, and we were able to ask questions. we couldn't even take a note or take a note out. they are telling me: well, you know, we all depend on trade and the market shrinking. we are at $18 trillion gdp. think about this. we in the united states of america have the greatest economy the world has ever seen--$18 trillion. do you know that of all these 11 countries we are talking about, the closest one to us is japan--$4.5 trillion. it falls off the richter scale. but yet we have to be very secretive because somebody might leave us. well, let me tell you, i have been a businessperson all of my life. if i wanted to get into a market, i will assure you, i would be able to evaluate my competition, the people with whom i want to do business. if that was the big person on the block, i had to make more adjustments than they had to make. but yet we are so concerned about the secrecy of this deal that none of us are able to see it, work it, define it, dissect it, and improve upon it. now we are just voting basically carte blanche and saying: ok, sure, you are going to get a 60-day review. you can't do a thing about it if you don't like it. i didn't think we were elected to do that. i really didn't. when you start looking at everything this stands for and you look at basically--and my father--my grandfather had a grocery store and my dad had a little furniture store, so i was raised in retail. one thing my dad always encouraged was competition. he enjoyed having it. he said: joe, listen, good competition brings out more buyers. more buyers gives us more of a chance to sell our goods. what he never did like and what he thought was unfair was when you had unfair competition--didn't pay their taxes, didn't live by the rules or play by the rules. and if we didn't enforce those, it gave them an unfair competitive advantage. if you believe our past performance in our trade deals makes us an expert at enforcing and making sure people play by the rules so that america is treated right, then you probably would have voted for this. i don't. i can only judge off of our past performance, where we are today. when you go shopping for whatever types of goods--household goods, clothing goods, furniture--the greatest furniture markets in the world were in the united states. we make very little furniture in this country today. they still want our wood products, so you know what, yes, we ship logs out of west virginia around the world so people can make the furniture that they want to send back to america. so i guess they say: oh, yes, that is good trade. the only reason they are buying our logs is because they don't have the quality logs we have. they don't have the quality hardwood forests. the best coal in the world, the best metallurgical coal--coking--that makes the steel, the best in the world comes out of west virginia. sure they are going to buy it because they don't have it. they are going to make their products and send them back to us and come into these markets subsidized. i would just say sooner or later we ought to do something for america. you have to rebuild this country, and you don't build the wealth of a country based on basically moving paper back and forth. moving paper back and forth--there are some people, with the wealth they accrue from this, i am sure they are very satisfied and happy with that. and we see the income inequality over the last 20 years. we have never seen this big of a spread. never. you see the flatline of workers all over america, just as flatline as can be. i don't know how we can look them in the eye and say we have done the best because now we have opened up 11 new countries. vietnam--58 cents an hour is what they are going to pay their workers. and we said: whoa, whoa, nafta is going to be basically bringing the whole north american trade up to par. twenty-two years later, i understand that mexico's minimum wage is still under $1 an hour, around 80 cents. you think a person who makes 58 cents an hour or 80 cents an hour or $1.50 an hour--7 out of 11 countries make less than $2--that those people will have disposable income to buy the products we would like to sell so that we can expand our economy and our jobs? i am sorry, i don't think that is going to happen. i really don't. it doesn't make any sense to me at all how we expect a person who can barely survive to have disposable income to buy products that we in the united states of america wish to sell to really lift our manufacturing base. but i guess that is why we have taa that we are arguing about because we know we have given that up. we just about wrote that off 22 years ago, so i guess we are going to write the rest of it off now. technology is great. i am all for innovation, creation, technology. i am for every bit of that. but sooner or later, you have to make something, you have to build something, you have [[page s4532]] to reinvest, and there have to be people making these products, being able to support their families and to have a benefit package that gives them a decent life. when i was growing up in little farmington, wv, we had manufacturing, mining. we had people who could go to work, work hard, make a living, take their family on vacation, pay the bills. and we let all of that slip away from us. i am not saying they will be the jobs of the past, but we could have the jobs of the future--steel, manufacturing. so i am not willing to give up on this. you don't find me chastising my colleagues on the republican side or my colleagues on the democratic side. i think we are all here for the right reason. sometimes we get a little bit off track, and i think this is one time we have gotten off track. something that would really help the united states of america, working families all over this country, we have kind of forgotten about, and i am concerned about that. i am concerned about going home to my beautiful state of west virginia and telling the people: i am sorry, we are going to have a harder time competing with some of these countries because there is just no way. we have opened up our borders. we have let international trade, an international manufacturing base go wherever they get the best deal. and i guarantee you that in every developing country, they are not going to be as tough as we are on human rights and on the environmental quality they should be aspiring to. they are not going to be tough on those things. they are trying to build an economy. they are trying to build, basically, a nation, bring it up. and they are going to be a little bit lax on these things. that is unfair competition, which my dad always warned me against. when we talk about european trade, i am not worried about european trade because they are basically on the same level playing field that we are. but when you are trying to build up a country, should you sacrifice and tear down your country? should you give away everything you have worked hard for and built? i want to help these countries. i have not a bit of problem helping these countries. i am not an isolationist. but i basically would have put something in there that would have protected our manufacturing base. i would have put something in that said that when we fell below certain jobs in manufacturing, it stops. you don't give it all away. it is hard to regain that and recapture it. i am sure wall street is very happy today. i have a lot of friends who work on wall street. there are a lot of good people who work on wall street, but there are a lot of people who basically are just driven by the almighty dollar. they are not driven by main street. they are not worried about west virginia. they are not worried about my little town of farmington or any part of my state. and they are going to be very happy. they are not worried about 99 percent of the people who are still on main street trying to survive. we talked about the export-import bank. they said: trust us; we are going to get a vote on export-import bank. maybe we will sometime. i would hope that comes to fruition. that helped a lot of small businesses. we haven't gotten that vote yet. so you would have thought there would have been a priority to get a vote on that. it has done an awful lot to get us in the market so we can compete on a more level playing field. that hasn't happened. but here we go again. we are going to have some votes tomorrow, and the votes tomorrow are going to be based on the taa because the house couldn't pass tpa fast-track with taa in it. it is basically what we are dealing with. so they think we can do a backdoor. what makes you think taa would be acceptable in any way, shape, or form in the house? what makes you think now, since we have carved this out--but we were promised a vote here on the taa, which we know we are going to need--it is going to make it more acceptable on the house side when they made them take taa out and couldn't pass taa in the tpa bill? doesn't make any sense to me. so i think it is a sad day today. i really do. and i am concerned. i am concerned about our country. i am concerned about my hard-working people in west virginia--and i know you are--and all the other states we have. these are good people. they deserve an opportunity. they deserve fair trade. they really deserve a fair trading country, people who will trade honestly with us and who have a quality or standard that they have to live up to in order to get into our markets. i don't think we should sacrifice our markets basically just to build them up. i think we should assist them, but they are going to have to find their own markets to the point where we don't sacrifice. so i think this could be a troubling thing. i am hoping it is not, but it could be. i have concerns. and i have said that if i can't explain it back home, i can't vote for it. and this is one i could not explain back home. i could not make the people feel comfortable that this is really going to improve quality of life and opportunities for them and their families. i couldn't do it because i don't see it. i don't believe in it. and i said i wouldn't vote for it, and i didn't. with that, mr. president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. flake. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mr. cruz). without objection, it is so ordered. mr. flake. mr. president, i just want to say a few things about the vote we just took on cloture to proceed with tpa. the senator who just spoke talked about some of the problems with the deal and the dislocations that happen when we have trade. we all recognize there are dislocations. there are dislocations whenever an economy adjusts and moves ahead with or without trade. but trade overall is necessary. it is good. free trade is good. ninety-five percent of the world's consumers live outside our boundaries. seventy percent of the world's economic output happens outside of our boundaries. we need to trade. we can't just say: well, we are just going to live within ourselves here, have an economy that doesn't reach out or pull in. we benefit. we benefit from better services and cheaper goods when we trade. our manufacturers benefit when we are able to export our products. it was said before that we haven't seen any good outcomes after nafta. we have. it is rewriting history to say that we haven't seen good outcomes as a result of nafta. i think the last speaker said mexico has not improved since nafta. it has. i can tell you, as a representative of a state that borders with mexico, the economy is considerably bigger and better. arizona is one of our biggest trading partners. it has improved since nafta. these trade agreements work. we haven't had a trade agreement negotiated without the tpa process--with the exception of one--i think in over 30 years. that one was a deal i believe with jordan, and it had far more to do with defense than commerce. so we need to have tpa--this process--in order to negotiate these trade agreements. the vast majority of our trade--i believe it is close to 90 percent of our trade--is with countries with which we have free- trade agreements. so i applaud those who have worked so hard to bring this to pass here--senators hatch and wyden and others--and the compromises that took place. i am not a particular fan of trade adjustment assistance. when economies move forward, there are dislocations. we can't account for all of them. in fact, we have seen some of the problems with previous taa assistance. i believe some of it went to those who were laid off at solyndra and to some of these things that had very little to do with trade. because of the way you seek such assistance, we don't do the best that we could to keep track of where those jobs were lost to. but having said that, we all recognize, as the senator from texas said earlier, that taa is the price we pay to get tpa. we all recognize in this body that there are compromises that need to be made. that is how we move legislation, and that is how we get important legislation such as tpa passed so that we can [[page s4533]] have more free trade, and our economy will benefit because of it. with that, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. flake. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",30467
CREC-2015-06-23-pt1-PgS4533-2,CREC-2015-06-23,114,DEFENDING PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT ACT--Continued,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4533-S4539] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEFENDING PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT ACT--Continued The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized. Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor today to talk about Internet tax freedom and to talk about ensuring that our online businesses remain competitive. First of all, I commend the House of Representatives for recently passing the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act, which would permanently extend the current ban on Internet access taxes. The current tax moratorium will expire on October 1, and if we fail to renew it, it could cost taxpayers nearly $15 billion in new fees and taxes next year. In addition, as importantly, it would make Internet access less affordable to hard-working families and hamper small businesses' ability to grow and create jobs using the Internet because essentially it would allow all of these jurisdictions to tax the Internet. So when you get on the Internet, you can expect many more taxes if we do not do what the House of Representatives did and extend the Internet Tax Freedom Act. In fact, I think we should make it permanent. I am a cosponsor of a Senate companion bill of which I hope this Senate will follow the House's lead to pass and send a permanent extension to the President's desk. Unfortunately, one of the things we have heard is that some see this extension of the moratorium on Internet taxation as an opportunity to attach another piece of legislation that, in fact, would burden our online businesses and would tremendously disadvantage a State like my home State of New Hampshire that has made the legislative decision not to have a sales tax. We have seen this playbook before. It was called before the Marketplace Fairness Act. Of course, there is nothing fair about this act when it comes to our online businesses having to collect taxes for nearly 9,000 taxing jurisdictions. You can imagine the bureaucratic nightmare that would occur. So this so-called Marketplace Fairness Act--I always used to like to call it the ``Online Sales Tax Act'' or the ``Online Sales Tax Collection Act.'' That would be a more accurate description of that particular act. So here we are. We have a rerun of this particular bill that would have required businesses in the State of New Hampshire--even though we do not have a sales tax--our online businesses to collect for all these other tax jurisdictions. Again, it is not even just States that have sales taxes. In some States, it goes down to the municipal level when it comes to municipalities and local jurisdictions actually collecting a separate tax, so it would have ended up being over 9,000 taxing jurisdictions. So here you have a nice online business out there having to be the tax collector for all these different jurisdictions. You can imagine that this would really be a huge burden on these online businesses. The individuals who have been supporting this new sales tax collection scheme in this new burden on the Internet--by the way, one of the reasons I am such a strong proponent of permanently extending the tax freedom and the lack of taxes on the Internet, on Internet access, is because we have seen not only consumers' access to the Internet but the ability of businesses and the ability of us to create jobs and to see real growth on the Internet. This has allowed people to start businesses from their home. It has allowed so much creativity. It has been very positive for our economy. So lo and behold in all of that there are some talking about attaching to this Internet Tax Freedom Act this incredibly burdensome collection scheme to require businesses to be out there collecting all these sales taxes throughout the Nation. The latest proposal the proponents of this type of tax collection scheme have come up with is one that again creates even more issues--certainly as many if not more issues--than the prior proposal that was called the so-called Marketplace Fairness Act. Of course, we know there is nothing fair about it if you are a business having to collect all these taxes. What this rerun would do is actually create this reporting system and require businesses to purchase this software and then require States to actually have what are called certified software providers. Here is what would happen: Under this latest scheme, the certified software providers for these States would actually collect all the sales information for every sale--every online sale in a State--and then they would manage the collection of these taxes. Well, can you imagine? So now we are going to say to businesses: Yes, you have to purchase this certain software. And guess what. Every sale you make is going to be held by the central government in each State. Can you imagine, with all the things we have seen happen in terms of breach of privacy of individuals? We have seen cyber attacks, all these issues we are facing. We have seen it in our government with OPM. We have seen it with the IRS. We have seen it with private companies in data breach. Now this latest scheme is, let's send all the sales information to one place, and we will have some company--I guess some private companies will stand to benefit from this--they will now collect all these taxes, and they will hold all this information. Imagine how much information they would hold in each State. So that is how we are going to create this new taxing scheme. You can imagine how a State such as New Hampshire would feel about that as a State that has decided not to have a sales tax--that suddenly our State has to keep all this information, has to hire some private company to do this, to collect all these taxes, and then that each of our online businesses has to purchase this software which is supposed to interface with its State government. What a massive bureaucracy, and how unfair it is in terms of State sovereignty that the Federal Government would impose this on a State such as New Hampshire that has made a decision not to have a sales tax. This, to me, would be the opposite of what we are trying to accomplish under the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act, which I fully support, which is about Internet tax freedom, and to attach this proposal to that Internet Tax Freedom Act, which some people, I think, are scheming around here to do, which with the right hand we are going to give you Internet freedom and with the left hand we are going to take that freedom away from States like mine that have chosen not to have a sales tax. And our online businesses would now have to be part of this huge bureaucratic scheme to collect taxes for other States and other localities. So I would hope my colleagues would not go down this road because I think the Internet should be free. I think online businesses should be able to continue to thrive and grow. I think online businesses should not be required to collect for over 9,000 taxing jurisdictions. And certainly I think all of us should have concerns about all of the sales data being collected by some kind of third party and being held in one place just so we can collect more taxes on online businesses. In fact, what I have heard from our businesses in New Hampshire previously when the so-called Marketplace Fairness Act was on the floor of the Senate--many of the businesses in New Hampshire that have online sales told me then how unfair they thought this taxing scheme was, and those concerns [[Page S4534]] remain, great businesses such as Garnet Hill in Franconia, NH. Russ Gaitskill, who is the president and CEO of Garnet Hill, told me previously: ``It's going to be a nightmare.'' I heard in the past from E&R Laundry and Dry Cleaners, a small business founded in Manchester in 1921. About 70 percent of E&R's sales are now Internet based. The company's president said he would not have the resources to calculate, collect, and deliver sales taxes for thousands of jurisdictions across the country. There is a great bakery, certainly, in the Nashua and Amherst area, Frederick's Pastries. Anybody who has been there--I can tell you, Frederick's is a great bakery. Susan Lozier Roberts of Frederick's expressed concern that this taxing scheme would create mass confusion, keeping up with all the individual tax codes. There is the fact that we are going to have to have software and have some third party hold all of the sales information for all these online businesses. That creates so many other additional burdensome issues, as well as privacy issues. Travis Adams with whaddy.com, based in Nashua, said previously: One tax audit from another State or jurisdiction would completely crush us. Because what happens under this so-called taxing scheme is now all of our online businesses can be audited in all of these taxing jurisdictions. So you can be an online business in New Hampshire, and what the proponents of this new tax scheme would like to have is this opportunity that businesses in New Hampshire can now be audited in all these other jurisdictions. You can imagine what kind of burdens that would create on businesses that are trying to focus every day on the bottom line and creating jobs. So I would say that as we look at this new proposal that some people behind the scenes are talking about trying to attach to the Internet Tax Freedom Act--I hope we will not go down this road. It would be bad for business, it would be bad for people's privacy, it would be a big power grab, I think, from Washington to require States such as New Hampshire to collect these taxes from throughout the country, and it certainly would not be positive to create more jobs through online businesses. In fact, the Competitive Enterprise Institute said of this latest proposal, which is a cousin to the so-called Marketplace Fairness Act: [This] new tax grab erodes healthy tax competition among states, puts consumers' information at higher risk, and ushers in a regime of taxation without representation. It's like the Blackwater of tax collection, state-paid mercenaries with sales tax charts. Under the Marketplace Fairness Act businesses are threatened by the prospect of being audited and prosecuted in every state into which they sell. This issue is one I think we all should care about. I know in my home State of New Hampshire, where we have chosen not to have a sales tax, it would be completely unfair for us to consider passing this proposal which is a brandnew tax grab that erodes New Hampshire's competitive status of choosing not to have a sales tax. Also, there is the concern we all should have about a central taxing authority holding all of this private sales information in each of the States and what could be done with that information and how will consumers' information be protected. New Hampshire's residents and Internet retailers cannot afford this radical Federal invasion of our State. I hope my colleagues will see the importance of extending the Internet Tax Freedom Act to encourage innovation and job creation, but under no circumstances should the Internet access tax moratorium be held hostage by a new and invasive sales tax that would not only undo the benefits of the tax moratorium but also burden our small businesses with becoming tax collectors for other States. That is wrong, and I hope this body will not go down that road. I certainly will be doing everything I can within my power in the Senate to make sure this new sales tax collection regime does not get attached to a very positive proposal, which is the Internet Tax Freedom Act. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana. Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, it is an honor to follow my colleague from New Hampshire, who has done such an eloquent job. Export-Import Bank I want to talk about the Export-Import Bank. I said this during the unnecessary 2013 Government shutdown, and I will say it again: Most Americans think Congress can do something to help create jobs and strengthen our economy--even if it is simply not doing any harm. Yet here we are again, willfully allowing an important tool for economic growth to expire by not taking commonsense action. On June 30, the charter for the Export-Import Bank will expire. During its 80-plus years of existence, the Bank has garnered support from every President during that span and repeatedly been renewed by Congress, often without any objection. The Export-Import Bank is not a Democratic program or a Republican program. It is a program to help American businesses. President Reagan's words from 30 years ago still ring true: Exports create and sustain jobs for millions of American workers and contribute to the growth and strength of the United States economy. The Export-Import Bank contributes in a significant way to our nation's export sales. The Gipper was right then, and he is right today. Those who oppose the Ex-Im Bank for ideological reasons may make their case in the abstract, but I have to operate in the reality, where I have heard over and over from Indiana small business owners and workers about the importance of the Ex-Im Bank. Jon, the vice president of Specialty Hardwoods of Indiana, in Nappannee, told me about their small company, which has around 40 employees. They got through the financial downturn of 2008 and 2009 but suffered during that time, as all small manufacturers did, not only here in this country but worldwide. As they returned to profitability, they made a decision to try to diversify markets. Up until 2008, they mostly sold their products to the recreational vehicle industry. Since then, they have started to sell to cabinet companies that market to the kitchen and bath industry nationally and made a direct attempt to go after export sales. Lumber product exports now account at Specialty Hardwoods for more than 45 percent of their current sales. Jon told me: We could not have done this without the support of EXIM bank. I personally have helped other small companies in our industry contact EXIM and establish relationships with EXIM to market their products. It levels the playing field for smaller companies to enter this market segment of our industry. We have grown our business and survived because of EXIM bank and the efforts of the 40-45 people that we employ. The stories continue. Mark, the vice president and co-owner of Agrarian Marketing Corporation, told us about his company that makes feed additives and nutritional supplements for the livestock industry. They have a very large distributor in Cairo, Egypt, that represents nearly 30 percent of their business. For this Hoosier business, nearly 30 percent of their business comes from Cairo, Egypt. The credit insurance they purchase through Ex-Im Bank allows them to source this business by extending beneficial credit terms to their Egyptian customer. It would not be possible if they required their customer to prepay for those orders. Mark said: Although we are a small business, this segment of our business is very important to us and provides excellent profitability and jobs here in Indiana as well as jobs for our contract manufacturers in Iowa, Illinois, and Ohio. All would suffer if we lost this business. Bruce, the CEO and chairman of Sullivan-Palatek in Michigan City, noted that not only are the 140 jobs at his company impacted but several hundred more at local suppliers. Bruce said: In the event that the Ex-Im Bank were to be shut down, the impact to us would be immediate. I believe we would have very much difficulty in getting any new orders. In fact, the orders that we have in house, many of them we would not be able to ship. We would have to shut them down right in the middle . . . of the order process. Jon, Mark, and Bruce are three of many in Indiana, many around the country. In my home State, the Hoosier State, since 2010 the Export- Import Bank has directly helped more than 100 companies that have exported more than $3 billion in goods and services. The Ex-Im Bank costs zero in taxpayer dollars. In fact, it turns a profit. [[Page S4535]] Since 1992, the Bank has returned more than $7 billion in profits to the Treasury. Last year, $675 million was returned to the Treasury. And the default rate is 0.175 percent. That is less than one-fifth of 1 percent. That is an effort to manage it in a fiscally prudent, fiscally responsible manner. In fiscal year 2014, the Ex-Im Bank authorized around $20.5 billion for 3,746 transactions, which contributed to $27.5 billion of U.S. exports and more than 164,000 jobs right here in the United States. These are not, for the most part, huge corporations. They are small companies that wouldn't be able to afford financing elsewhere. In 2014, 90 percent of the transactions approved by the Bank were in support of small businesses. So what happens if Ex-Im's charter is to expire? It will be forced to shut down, unwind current obligations, and the loss of future financing could result in a significant amount of business being lost overseas. That directly affects the bottom line for many businesses, leaving them with less revenue to reinvest and less revenue to pay wages or create new jobs. It becomes difficult--if not nearly impossible--for the private sector to replace the loans, the guarantees, and the insurance provided by the Ex-Im Bank. At a time when American companies are competing in a game that is often rigged by foreign currency manipulation, intellectual property theft, and insurmountable regulatory barriers, unilaterally eliminating our export credit agency further handcuffs U.S. job creators and allows competitors in foreign countries to pick up the business. If Ex-Im no longer provides financing, foreign companies and countries are still going to buy their goods and products. They need the products. But instead of buying that product from Muncie, IN, they will purchase it in Russia or China. This is, to me, the direct opposite of what Congress should be doing. It seems as if up is down and down is up in this discussion. Nearly every other major country has a credit export agency. Many are larger and much more aggressive than the Export-Import Bank. Unilaterally eliminating our export credit agency hurts not only the United States and handcuffs our job creators, but it also helps competitors in foreign countries to capitalize and seize that business. Our global competitors, including China, Brazil, and India, are investing more in export financing every single day. They are investing in their companies and in their economy. If we take this measure, we are stepping back. They are rooting for America's Export-Import Bank to close because it means more business for them. Even our neighbor Canada is providing far more export financing than the United States. Canada's economy is one-tenth the size of the U.S. economy, and their export-import agency already provides far more export financing than we do at the present time. The Ex-Im Bank is a tool that helps American companies compete in the global economy. In Indiana, we pride ourselves on what we call Hoosier common sense. It does not get more common sense than creating more American jobs in a fiscally responsible way. That is what the Export-Import Bank does. Congress needs a dose of that Hoosier common sense, which is the same as the common sense in the Presiding Officer's home State of Ohio. We should act quickly to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank to help our companies, to help our employees, to help workers around our country, and to help our Nation. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, our country stands on the brink of a great opportunity in the Asia-Pacific. Since 2008, the United States and 11 other Pacific nations, including Japan and New Zealand, have worked to conclude negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This agreement represents nearly 40 percent of the global gross domestic product, or GDP, and is the most ambitious free-trade agreement in history. By upending antiquated international tariff systems and tearing down barriers to trade, we can unleash American ingenuity and send our Nation's products from Main Street to Malaysia. Much has been said about the national benefits of concluding TPP, but I want to focus on some of the particular benefits for my home State of Colorado. Colorado, like most States, benefits immensely from international trade, particularly with Asia. According to the Business Roundtable, more than 265,000 Colorado jobs are supported by the countries that would be affected by TPP. These trade-related jobs include the farmworker harvesting world-famous melons down in Rocky Ford and the meatpacker shipping American beef from Greeley. They are the electrical engineer designing computer systems in Boulder and the natural gas worker maintaining a rig in Parachute. Collectively, these everyday working Americans help drive the economic and trade engine of Colorado. Last year, my State exported more than $8 billion worth of goods all across the world. Approximately half of them, or $4 billion, went directly to TPP countries. While nations like Vietnam and Japan have imposed hefty tariffs on our Colorado goods in the past, TPP presents an opportunity to level the playing field. American goods would flow more freely to the region and American workers stand to benefit. That is why I strongly support granting the President trade promotion authority, or TPA, and finalizing a high-standard TPP. A vote for TPA is a vote for the American worker. It is a vote for more active engagement in the world and a higher standard of living, and it is a vote to recognize that through increased trade, we can indeed deliver upon the promise of a better tomorrow. Unfortunately, however, some in Congress have opted for isolationism and retreat. They have sounded the alarm over supposed failure of past trade agreements and argued in favor of taking cover rather than taking charge, and they have doubled down on the false notion that trade is always bad for the American economy and the American worker. But a quick review of the facts will dispel these myths very quickly. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, national beef exports to Colombia and Panama have more than tripled since 2011 when we enacted free-trade agreements with these countries. National wheat exports to Chile more than doubled from the enactment of our 2003 free- trade agreement through 2014, while dairy exports increased more than 20 times to that country, and our beef exports have increased more than eight times to the participant countries of the Central America and Dominican Republic free-trade agreement. Colorado businesses have played a large role in expanding overseas as well. My State witnessed a 37-percent increase in goods exported to countries with free-trade agreements between 2003 and 2013. Exports to Korea have increased 61 percent since the conclusion of our free-trade agreement with that nation in 2011. And NAFTA, which anti-trade forces frequently dismiss as the poster child for trade deals gone awry, has resulted in a 293-percent--that is right, 293 percent--increase in Colorado exports to Canada and Mexico since 1994. Beyond the numbers, though, it is important to meet with the workers and business owners who understand that freer trade helps their bottom line. Just a few days ago, I traveled to Eastern Colorado on my annual wheat tour. It is a tradition that Senator Wayne Allard started in the 1990s--then a U.S. Representative--and one I was excited to continue in the Senate. I invited my colleague from Colorado Senator Bennet, so we could both hear the needs directly from Coloradans and see the positive impacts that agreements such as TPP could have not only on Eastern Colorado but farmers across this country. On the tour, we had the chance to marvel at the truly incredible production level of Colorado wheat growers. We are just about 2 weeks away from [[Page S4536]] the height of the winter wheat harvest in Colorado--a time when I have always enjoyed working at our family implement dealership in Yuma--and a reminder that Colorado helps feed the world. The vast majority of Colorado's wheat crop is exported. In fact, in 2013, we shipped more than $235 million worth of wheat across the globe. Eighty percent of the wheat we produce in Colorado is exported. Most of the wheat growers we met on the Eastern Plains aren't interested in retreating from the international marketplace. In fact, they want to expand the international marketplace. They understand that freer trade means improved opportunities to place their product. And with a high-standard TPP, Colorado wheat growers could penetrate notoriously difficult markets in countries such as Japan and begin to ship from Thurman to Tokyo and beyond. It isn't just wheat either. Colorado farmers and ranchers already export millions of dollars in Western Slope beef, Southern Colorado onions, and San Luis Valley potatoes. In fact, according to the Department of Agriculture, Colorado potatoes represent around 70 percent of all U.S. potato exports to Mexico. That market stands to grow significantly if TPP is successfully concluded, considering that Mexico is a member nation in the negotiations. There is no question that trade benefits rural America. We should be promoting Palisade peaches in Perth and Olathe sweet corn on the streets of Singapore. Growing up in rural Colorado, I saw the potential that our hard-working farmers and ranchers created for Colorado and for Colorado products abroad. Their determined spirit and hard-working attitude are what keep America at the top of the global economy, and TPP will expand that promise in the Asia-Pacific. Urban and suburban America succeed with increased trade as well. As do their rural counterparts, urban and suburban Coloradans benefit from a wider selection of cheaper goods. The mechanics of free trade stretch dollars a little bit further for the teenager with a part-time summer job as well as for the family struggling to make ends meet. Aside from the benefit of cheaper products, increased trade creates jobs here at home. A couple of months ago, I was fortunate enough to visit a company in Boulder, CO, that manufactures zip lines and other adventure equipment. This company has successfully expanded their business to Europe and Asia, helping people across the globe enjoy rain forest canopy tours, free falling, and more. As this business expanded overseas, they had the ability to hire more employees and boost the local economy in Boulder. They doubled their Colorado office and are still looking to grow. An agreement such as TPP will open further opportunities for this company in the Asia-Pacific and beyond, perhaps facilitating world-class bungee jumping in New Zealand or advanced rock climbing in Peru, and with those new opportunities come more Colorado jobs. That is the essence of free trade. It encourages innovation and entrepreneurship. It connects the world while growing our workforce at home, and it presents an opportunity for Colorado and our country to spread our goods and ideas across the globe. That is why I have supported free-trade agreements in the past-- agreements that have yielded significant economic and strategic benefits for our Nation. That is why I supported the latest generation of trade promotion authority and look forward to supporting it again. We will continue to support it this week as it goes to the President's desk to be signed into law. That is why I urge my colleagues to continue their support for free-trade agreements, so the United States can help grasp the great opportunity that awaits us in the Asia- Pacific. We have held several hearings over the past couple of months in the Foreign Relations Committee and beyond talking about the benefits of free trade. A couple of weeks ago, we were joined by experts from Asia and economic leaders around this country, all of whom believe we have an important role to play in expanding trade and expanding the opportunities that the Trans-Pacific Partnership will lead to when that agreement comes to this floor, thanks to trade promotion authority. It is an important measure that we must enact. It is an important statement of good faith that the United States truly is interested in the Asia region, the Asia-Pacific region, making good on our efforts to truly pivot to Asia to rebalance policy we all support but making good on our word that we are indeed in the region to stay. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota. Republican-Led Senate Mr. THUNE. Madam President, last fall, Republicans promised that if we were elected to the majority, we would get Washington working. That wasn't a campaign slogan, that was a commitment. After 6 months of Republican control, I am proud to report we are delivering on that promise. The past 6 months in the Senate have been the most productive months in a long time. We passed bipartisan legislation to approve the Keystone Pipeline. We passed a bipartisan bill to help prevent suicides among veterans. We passed the first significant bipartisan reform of Medicare in years, which will ensure that our seniors have access to physicians and that those physicians are judged by the quality rather than the quantity of the care they provide. We passed bipartisan legislation to give law enforcement new tools to fight human trafficking and provide support for trafficking victims. We passed a bipartisan bill to authorize funding for our national defense to provide for the needs of our men and women in uniform. Those are just some of the highlights. Every piece of legislation I mentioned passed with bipartisan support. One reason that happened is because the Republican majority has been committed to ensuring that all Senators, whatever the party, have the opportunity to make their voices heard. Under Democratic leadership, not only were Members of the minority party shut out of the legislative process, but many rank-and-file Democrats were as well. During all of 2014, the Democratic leadership in the Senate allowed just 15 amendment rollcall votes--15 votes in an entire year. That is barely more than a vote a month. By contrast, the Republican-led Senate has taken more than 130 amendment rollcall votes so far this year or more than 21 votes a month. That is not only more amendment rollcall votes than last year, it is more amendment rollcall votes than the Senate has taken in the past 2 years combined. That is through the first 6 months of 2015. We have another 6 months to go. This week, the Senate is considering what I hope is going to be our next bipartisan achievement; that is, the legislation to help expand U.S. trade with other countries and increase the opportunities that are available for American businesses and American workers. Over the past few years, exports have been a bright spot in our economy, supporting an increasing number of American jobs each and every year. In 2014, exports supported 11.7 million U.S. jobs and made up 13 percent of our Nation's economy. We need to continue to open markets around the globe to American goods and services, and the best way to do that is through new trade agreements. Countries with which we have free and fair trade agreements purchase substantially more from us than other countries. In fact, in 2013, free-trade agreement countries purchased 12 times more goods per capita from the United States than nonfree-trade agreement countries--12 times more goods per capita. For American workers, increased trade means more opportunity and increased access to high-paying jobs. Manufacturing jobs tied to exports pay, on average, 13 to 18 percent more than other jobs in our economy. Unfortunately, while trade agreements have proliferated around the globe over the past several years, the United States hasn't signed a new trade agreement in 8 years. A big reason for that is the fact that trade promotion authority expired in 2007. Since 1934, almost all of the U.S. free-trade agreements have been negotiated using trade promotion authority or a similar streamlined, expedited process. Trade promotion authority is designed to put the United States in the [[Page S4537]] strongest possible position when it comes to negotiating trade agreements. Under TPA, Congress sets guidelines for trade negotiations and outlines the priorities the administration must follow. In return, Congress promises a simple up-or-down vote on the resulting trade agreement instead of the long amendment process that could leave the final deal looking nothing like what was initially negotiated. That simple up-or-down vote is the key. It lets our negotiating partners know that Congress and trade negotiators are on the same page, which gives other countries the confidence they need to put their best offers on the table. That, in turn, allows for a successful and timely conclusion of negotiations. Currently, the administration is negotiating two major trade agreements that have the potential to vastly expand the market for American goods and services in the European Union and in the Pacific. The Trans-Pacific Partnership is being negotiated with a number of Asia-Pacific nations, including Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, and Vietnam. If this agreement is done right, it could have huge benefits for American agriculture, among other industries. Agriculture producers in my State of South Dakota and in the Presiding Officer's State of Iowa understand that trade promotion authority is the most effective way to secure trade agreements that will benefit our farmers and our ranchers. One pork producer in my State of South Dakota contacted me to tell me that a successful TPP deal could increase U.S. pork exports to just one of the Trans-Pacific Partnership countries by literally hundreds of millions of dollars in a year. Discussions of the benefits of trade tend to focus on the economic benefits, and with good reason--it helps our economy. It creates good- paying jobs and raises the standard of living for people in this country and gives access for consumers to lower cost goods and services. But new trade agreements also have the potential to result not just in economic gains for America's farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers but in national security gains for the country. When we make trade deals with other countries, we are not just opening new markets for our goods, we are also developing and cementing alliances. Trade agreements build bonds of friendship with other nations that extend not only to cooperation on economic issues but to cooperation on security issues as well. It is also important to remember that just because the United States isn't negotiating trade agreements doesn't mean other countries will not be. In fact, the United States hasn't signed a single new trade agreement over the past 8 years, but that hasn't prevented other countries from signing numerous trade agreements over the same period. If America fails to lead on trade, other nations such as China will step in to fill the void, and these nations will not have the best interests of American workers and American families in mind. The bill before us today will help pave the way for the United States to cement alliances with friendly nations through trade and will help ensure that any trade deals the United States enters into will be favorable to our economic and our national security interests. The Senate passed a version of this bill last month with a bipartisan majority, and I am hopeful we will have a similarly strong bipartisan vote yet this week. Republicans believe our Nation's problems are best solved when Members of both parties come together to find solutions for the American people. Republicans' plans for our second 6 months in the majority are the same as those for the first 6 months of our majority; that is, to make sure we continue to move forward in a way that addresses the challenges that are facing our country. Unfortunately, last week we saw an unfortunate return to partisanship on the part of the Democrats when they blocked an appropriations bill to fund our troops. It is not that Democrats have a problem with this bill; in fact, many of them voted to support the funding this bill provides when they voted in favor of the National Defense Authorization Act last week. The authorization act is the first step in a two-step process which has to be followed by the appropriations bill that actually provides the funding. But Democratic leaders and the President, even though many of them supported the Defense authorization bill, are upset that government agencies such as the EPA and the IRS aren't receiving the Democrats' preferred level of funding, so they have decided to hold appropriations bills hostage in an effort to get what they want. It is unfortunate that Democrats are holding money for our troops hostage in order to get more funding for the EPA and the IRS. If Democrats believe the funding levels in the appropriations bills are not acceptable, they will have the opportunity to offer amendments to increase the funding. But in order to do that, they have to allow us to actually proceed to consideration of these bills on the Senate floor. What they are, in effect, doing now is filibustering any attempt to bring any spending bill to the floor; most recently, as I mentioned, the funding bill for our troops. The bill that funds our national security interests in this country is currently being held hostage. We can't even get it on the floor to debate it. We are not only talking about ultimately passing it, we are talking about even having a discussion on the floor of the Senate about something as important as funding our troops and the important military objectives we have as a nation. Yet, right now, we have a filibuster being conducted by the Democrats--again, because they want to get more funding for their favorite agencies. Well, that is a bad way to go about this. I am hopeful that this obstruction--which is largely driven by the Democratic leadership--that most rank-and-file Democrats will rethink a strategy that involves opposing every opportunity to fund our Nation's priorities and to get things done for the American people. After years of stagnation in the Senate under Democratic leadership, I think even most Democrats have enjoyed governing in a functioning Senate again. We have dozens of bipartisan bills to show for the first 6 months of this year, and our record of accomplishment can continue if the Democrats abandon their strategy of obstruction and continue to work with us to solve the challenges facing our Nation. They can start by not objecting to proceeding to even getting a bill that funds our national security interests here on the floor of the Senate so we can debate it. As I said, if they don't like the funding levels in there, we will have an open amendment process in which they will be able to offer amendments to change those funding levels. But what they are doing right now is fundamentally wrong, not even allowing consideration of an appropriations bill that funds our military and pays our troops on the floor of the United States Senate. I hope that will change. I hope that the Democrats will join us in making the next 6 months of 2015 as productive as the first 6 months have been and that we can point to bipartisan achievements that are good for the American people, that focus on their basic daily needs, and that will promote policies which will grow our economy and create jobs and lead to a higher standard of living and increased take-home pay for middle-income families across this country. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I would like to take a few minutes to underscore the importance of trade and trade promotion authority to the American manufacturing industry. Despite some claims to the contrary, U.S. manufacturers have been among the principal beneficiaries of our existing free-trade agreements. One in four U.S. manufacturing jobs depends on exports. On average, the wages of those in export-supported manufacturing jobs are 18 percent higher than those of other factory workers. Furthermore, since the last TPA bill passed through the Congress in 2002, [[Page S4538]] U.S. goods exports have more than doubled, reaching $1.6 trillion in 2013 alone. While we hear a constant drumbeat decrying our trade deficits, the United States enjoys a nearly $60 billion yearly manufacturing surplus with our 20 existing partners to the free-trade agreements. Consumers and businesses in those 20 countries purchased $658 billion of U.S. manufactured goods in 2013 alone, which represents nearly 48 percent of all exports produced by the 12 million Americans employed in manufacturing. Clearly, in places where we have free-trade agreements, where our manufacturers can compete on a level playing field, they are winning. We need to build on that track record of success and enact more high- standard, 21st-century free-trade agreements. That is yet another reason why we need TPA. It is no wonder, then, that our TPA bill is supported by manufacturers throughout the country. We have received letters or statements of support from groups such as the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, the Grocery Manufacturers Association, the American Forest and Paper Association, the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, the Semiconductor Industry Association, the Society of Chemical Manufacturers & Affiliates, the National Council of Textile Organizations, and many others. On top of that, a number of iconic individual manufacturing companies have weighed in publicly in support of our bill, including Boeing, Cummins, Dow Chemical, Honeywell, Intel, Texas Instruments, Xerox, and, of course, many others. Caterpillar, which is based in Peoria, IL, is the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel engines, and gas turbines. Caterpillar knows the value of trade to a healthy economy, having exported nearly $88 billion in goods and services over the past 5 years. They know that if we pass TPA, they can do even better. Upon introduction of our bill, the company issued a statement saying, ``Passage of TPA will provide the United States with the strongest possible hand when negotiating future trade agreements and will help eliminate the current high tariffs and trade barriers that companies like Caterpillar currently face.'' It is not just big companies that benefit. Ninety-eight percent of nearly 300,000 American exporters are small and medium-sized businesses. Let me say that again. Ninety-eight percent of all U.S. exporters are small and medium-sized businesses. There are 300,000 of them. That fact escapes many people. Let me give an example of one of those small businesses from my home State of Utah. Kimber Kable is owned and operated by Ray Kimber. Ray's story is emblematic of the American dream. In the late 1970s, Ray figured out a way to weave audio cables to reduce unwanted noise and improve fidelity. The company he started in his garage over 35 years ago is now a driver of economic growth and a source of jobs. Today, he employs 30 people in Ogden, UT. He sells his cables to the world. Two- thirds of Ray's cables are shipped to customers overseas. Ray is not only a friend of mine, he is also an outstanding example of a larger truth: The U.S. manufacturing sector is the most innovative in the world, and American workers are unsurpassed in manufacturing productivity. Because of U.S. innovation and productivity, where U.S. manufacturing competes on an equal footing, it always succeeds. We can help people like Ray reach more markets and maintain healthy small businesses across America--businesses that will grow our economy and create more jobs--but we can only do that if our trade negotiators have the tools to set fair trade rules for our exporters. That is what our TPA bill provides. For example, a big part of the ability of small companies like Kimber Kable to sell around the world is digital trade. That is why the TPA bill that is again before us directs our trade negotiators to ensure that electronically delivered goods and services are classified with the most liberal trade treatment possible and that our trading partners allow the free flow of data across borders. Using the Internet to market, sell, and transmit digital products is only part of the story. Companies like Ray's are also innovators, and their innovations must be protected. Too many small businesses have experienced firsthand the destructive impact of intellectual property theft. Companies like Kimber Kable have to contend with counterfeiters stealing their company name to sell inferior products. This TPA bill, therefore, will also ensure that U.S. trade agreements reflect a standard of intellectual property rights protection similar to that found in our own U.S. law. The bill calls for an end to the theft of U.S. intellectual property by foreign governments, including piracy and the theft of trade secrets, and for the elimination of measures that require U.S. companies to locate their intellectual property abroad in return for market access. These are strong provisions that will help U.S. manufacturing compete and sell their products around the world. Companies from Caterpillar to Kimber Kable recognize the importance of trade and trade agreements to the future of American manufacturing. They recognize that 95 percent of the world's consumers live outside of the United States and that if we want to sell American-made products to these customers, we need strong agreements to break down barriers and level the playing field. We simply cannot do that without the TPA. We can do better and we must do better for American manufacturers. If we really want to support the American manufacturing industry, then we should vote today to pass this TPA legislation once and for all. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I wish to take a few minutes to talk about the importance of international trade to my home State of Utah and how Utahns will benefit from the passage of the TPA bill. Despite having a relatively small population, the State of Utah is a very significant player in international trade. In 2014 alone, Utah exported more than $12 billion in goods. That number has more than doubled over the past decade, despite the economic downturn that took place during that time. Goods exports account for more than 11 percent of Utah's GDP. More than 50,000 Utah jobs are directly tied to goods exports, as more than 3,400 Utah-based companies export goods to countries around the world. By the way, nearly 86 percent of those exporting companies are small or medium-sized businesses. These Utah exports include a number of key manufacturing exports, including primary metal products, computer and electronics products, chemicals, processed foods, and transportation equipment, just to mention a few. There are a number of Utah companies that I could single out here today. As I said, there are more than 3,400 Utah-based exporters, but let me talk about one in particular--Albion Laboratories, which is based in Clearfield, UT. Albion is a leading, global manufacturer of chelated minerals for human and plant nutritional applications. The company is incredibly innovative, owning more than 100 patents from manufacturing processes to food applications. Over the years, Albion has enjoyed strong growth in large part because of its expanded exports. Today, Albion exports to more than 100 different countries, which has allowed the company to regularly add new jobs to accommodate its increased output. As of right now, the company employs approximately 150 people. This is just one example of the many unique and innovative Utah companies that have benefited from international trade and will benefit even more from expanded access to foreign markets in the future. Now, there has been a lot of talk about the potential benefits of our pending trade agreements with countries in the Asia-Pacific region and the European Union. As of right now, more than half of Utah's exports already go [[Page S4539]] to these two markets. Therefore, I think it is safe to say that Utah- based exporters will benefit greatly from the expanded market access they will undoubtedly see if we can get both the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership over the finish line. Of course, without TPA, these two important trade agreements, which are among the largest and most ambitious agreements in our Nation's history, don't stand a chance. TPA gives our negotiators the tools they need to get the best deals possible. TPA gives Congress and our constituents a strong voice in the negotiating process, and, of course, TPA assures that once an agreement is reached, our country will be able to deliver on the deal. Utahns depend on international trade. Utah's job creators, like those throughout the country, need greater access to foreign markets in order to compete. Put simply, they are not going to get that access without TPA. So for the sake of the thousands of Utah companies that export goods around the world and the tens of thousands of Utahns whose jobs depend on those exports--and for the hundreds of thousands of companies all over this country and more--I urge my colleagues to join me one more time in supporting our TPA legislation. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (The remarks of Mr. Grassley pertaining to the introduction of S. 1648 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'') Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4533-S4539] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEFENDING PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT ACT--Continued The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized. Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor today to talk about Internet tax freedom and to talk about ensuring that our online businesses remain competitive. First of all, I commend the House of Representatives for recently passing the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act, which would permanently extend the current ban on Internet access taxes. The current tax moratorium will expire on October 1, and if we fail to renew it, it could cost taxpayers nearly $15 billion in new fees and taxes next year. In addition, as importantly, it would make Internet access less affordable to hard-working families and hamper small businesses' ability to grow and create jobs using the Internet because essentially it would allow all of these jurisdictions to tax the Internet. So when you get on the Internet, you can expect many more taxes if we do not do what the House of Representatives did and extend the Internet Tax Freedom Act. In fact, I think we should make it permanent. I am a cosponsor of a Senate companion bill of which I hope this Senate will follow the House's lead to pass and send a permanent extension to the President's desk. Unfortunately, one of the things we have heard is that some see this extension of the moratorium on Internet taxation as an opportunity to attach another piece of legislation that, in fact, would burden our online businesses and would tremendously disadvantage a State like my home State of New Hampshire that has made the legislative decision not to have a sales tax. We have seen this playbook before. It was called before the Marketplace Fairness Act. Of course, there is nothing fair about this act when it comes to our online businesses having to collect taxes for nearly 9,000 taxing jurisdictions. You can imagine the bureaucratic nightmare that would occur. So this so-called Marketplace Fairness Act--I always used to like to call it the ``Online Sales Tax Act'' or the ``Online Sales Tax Collection Act.'' That would be a more accurate description of that particular act. So here we are. We have a rerun of this particular bill that would have required businesses in the State of New Hampshire--even though we do not have a sales tax--our online businesses to collect for all these other tax jurisdictions. Again, it is not even just States that have sales taxes. In some States, it goes down to the municipal level when it comes to municipalities and local jurisdictions actually collecting a separate tax, so it would have ended up being over 9,000 taxing jurisdictions. So here you have a nice online business out there having to be the tax collector for all these different jurisdictions. You can imagine that this would really be a huge burden on these online businesses. The individuals who have been supporting this new sales tax collection scheme in this new burden on the Internet--by the way, one of the reasons I am such a strong proponent of permanently extending the tax freedom and the lack of taxes on the Internet, on Internet access, is because we have seen not only consumers' access to the Internet but the ability of businesses and the ability of us to create jobs and to see real growth on the Internet. This has allowed people to start businesses from their home. It has allowed so much creativity. It has been very positive for our economy. So lo and behold in all of that there are some talking about attaching to this Internet Tax Freedom Act this incredibly burdensome collection scheme to require businesses to be out there collecting all these sales taxes throughout the Nation. The latest proposal the proponents of this type of tax collection scheme have come up with is one that again creates even more issues--certainly as many if not more issues--than the prior proposal that was called the so-called Marketplace Fairness Act. Of course, we know there is nothing fair about it if you are a business having to collect all these taxes. What this rerun would do is actually create this reporting system and require businesses to purchase this software and then require States to actually have what are called certified software providers. Here is what would happen: Under this latest scheme, the certified software providers for these States would actually collect all the sales information for every sale--every online sale in a State--and then they would manage the collection of these taxes. Well, can you imagine? So now we are going to say to businesses: Yes, you have to purchase this certain software. And guess what. Every sale you make is going to be held by the central government in each State. Can you imagine, with all the things we have seen happen in terms of breach of privacy of individuals? We have seen cyber attacks, all these issues we are facing. We have seen it in our government with OPM. We have seen it with the IRS. We have seen it with private companies in data breach. Now this latest scheme is, let's send all the sales information to one place, and we will have some company--I guess some private companies will stand to benefit from this--they will now collect all these taxes, and they will hold all this information. Imagine how much information they would hold in each State. So that is how we are going to create this new taxing scheme. You can imagine how a State such as New Hampshire would feel about that as a State that has decided not to have a sales tax--that suddenly our State has to keep all this information, has to hire some private company to do this, to collect all these taxes, and then that each of our online businesses has to purchase this software which is supposed to interface with its State government. What a massive bureaucracy, and how unfair it is in terms of State sovereignty that the Federal Government would impose this on a State such as New Hampshire that has made a decision not to have a sales tax. This, to me, would be the opposite of what we are trying to accomplish under the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act, which I fully support, which is about Internet tax freedom, and to attach this proposal to that Internet Tax Freedom Act, which some people, I think, are scheming around here to do, which with the right hand we are going to give you Internet freedom and with the left hand we are going to take that freedom away from States like mine that have chosen not to have a sales tax. And our online businesses would now have to be part of this huge bureaucratic scheme to collect taxes for other States and other localities. So I would hope my colleagues would not go down this road because I think the Internet should be free. I think online businesses should be able to continue to thrive and grow. I think online businesses should not be required to collect for over 9,000 taxing jurisdictions. And certainly I think all of us should have concerns about all of the sales data being collected by some kind of third party and being held in one place just so we can collect more taxes on online businesses. In fact, what I have heard from our businesses in New Hampshire previously when the so-called Marketplace Fairness Act was on the floor of the Senate--many of the businesses in New Hampshire that have online sales told me then how unfair they thought this taxing scheme was, and those concerns [[Page S4534]] remain, great businesses such as Garnet Hill in Franconia, NH. Russ Gaitskill, who is the president and CEO of Garnet Hill, told me previously: ``It's going to be a nightmare.'' I heard in the past from E&R Laundry and Dry Cleaners, a small business founded in Manchester in 1921. About 70 percent of E&R's sales are now Internet based. The company's president said he would not have the resources to calculate, collect, and deliver sales taxes for thousands of jurisdictions across the country. There is a great bakery, certainly, in the Nashua and Amherst area, Frederick's Pastries. Anybody who has been there--I can tell you, Frederick's is a great bakery. Susan Lozier Roberts of Frederick's expressed concern that this taxing scheme would create mass confusion, keeping up with all the individual tax codes. There is the fact that we are going to have to have software and have some third party hold all of the sales information for all these online businesses. That creates so many other additional burdensome issues, as well as privacy issues. Travis Adams with whaddy.com, based in Nashua, said previously: One tax audit from another State or jurisdiction would completely crush us. Because what happens under this so-called taxing scheme is now all of our online businesses can be audited in all of these taxing jurisdictions. So you can be an online business in New Hampshire, and what the proponents of this new tax scheme would like to have is this opportunity that businesses in New Hampshire can now be audited in all these other jurisdictions. You can imagine what kind of burdens that would create on businesses that are trying to focus every day on the bottom line and creating jobs. So I would say that as we look at this new proposal that some people behind the scenes are talking about trying to attach to the Internet Tax Freedom Act--I hope we will not go down this road. It would be bad for business, it would be bad for people's privacy, it would be a big power grab, I think, from Washington to require States such as New Hampshire to collect these taxes from throughout the country, and it certainly would not be positive to create more jobs through online businesses. In fact, the Competitive Enterprise Institute said of this latest proposal, which is a cousin to the so-called Marketplace Fairness Act: [This] new tax grab erodes healthy tax competition among states, puts consumers' information at higher risk, and ushers in a regime of taxation without representation. It's like the Blackwater of tax collection, state-paid mercenaries with sales tax charts. Under the Marketplace Fairness Act businesses are threatened by the prospect of being audited and prosecuted in every state into which they sell. This issue is one I think we all should care about. I know in my home State of New Hampshire, where we have chosen not to have a sales tax, it would be completely unfair for us to consider passing this proposal which is a brandnew tax grab that erodes New Hampshire's competitive status of choosing not to have a sales tax. Also, there is the concern we all should have about a central taxing authority holding all of this private sales information in each of the States and what could be done with that information and how will consumers' information be protected. New Hampshire's residents and Internet retailers cannot afford this radical Federal invasion of our State. I hope my colleagues will see the importance of extending the Internet Tax Freedom Act to encourage innovation and job creation, but under no circumstances should the Internet access tax moratorium be held hostage by a new and invasive sales tax that would not only undo the benefits of the tax moratorium but also burden our small businesses with becoming tax collectors for other States. That is wrong, and I hope this body will not go down that road. I certainly will be doing everything I can within my power in the Senate to make sure this new sales tax collection regime does not get attached to a very positive proposal, which is the Internet Tax Freedom Act. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana. Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, it is an honor to follow my colleague from New Hampshire, who has done such an eloquent job. Export-Import Bank I want to talk about the Export-Import Bank. I said this during the unnecessary 2013 Government shutdown, and I will say it again: Most Americans think Congress can do something to help create jobs and strengthen our economy--even if it is simply not doing any harm. Yet here we are again, willfully allowing an important tool for economic growth to expire by not taking commonsense action. On June 30, the charter for the Export-Import Bank will expire. During its 80-plus years of existence, the Bank has garnered support from every President during that span and repeatedly been renewed by Congress, often without any objection. The Export-Import Bank is not a Democratic program or a Republican program. It is a program to help American businesses. President Reagan's words from 30 years ago still ring true: Exports create and sustain jobs for millions of American workers and contribute to the growth and strength of the United States economy. The Export-Import Bank contributes in a significant way to our nation's export sales. The Gipper was right then, and he is right today. Those who oppose the Ex-Im Bank for ideological reasons may make their case in the abstract, but I have to operate in the reality, where I have heard over and over from Indiana small business owners and workers about the importance of the Ex-Im Bank. Jon, the vice president of Specialty Hardwoods of Indiana, in Nappannee, told me about their small company, which has around 40 employees. They got through the financial downturn of 2008 and 2009 but suffered during that time, as all small manufacturers did, not only here in this country but worldwide. As they returned to profitability, they made a decision to try to diversify markets. Up until 2008, they mostly sold their products to the recreational vehicle industry. Since then, they have started to sell to cabinet companies that market to the kitchen and bath industry nationally and made a direct attempt to go after export sales. Lumber product exports now account at Specialty Hardwoods for more than 45 percent of their current sales. Jon told me: We could not have done this without the support of EXIM bank. I personally have helped other small companies in our industry contact EXIM and establish relationships with EXIM to market their products. It levels the playing field for smaller companies to enter this market segment of our industry. We have grown our business and survived because of EXIM bank and the efforts of the 40-45 people that we employ. The stories continue. Mark, the vice president and co-owner of Agrarian Marketing Corporation, told us about his company that makes feed additives and nutritional supplements for the livestock industry. They have a very large distributor in Cairo, Egypt, that represents nearly 30 percent of their business. For this Hoosier business, nearly 30 percent of their business comes from Cairo, Egypt. The credit insurance they purchase through Ex-Im Bank allows them to source this business by extending beneficial credit terms to their Egyptian customer. It would not be possible if they required their customer to prepay for those orders. Mark said: Although we are a small business, this segment of our business is very important to us and provides excellent profitability and jobs here in Indiana as well as jobs for our contract manufacturers in Iowa, Illinois, and Ohio. All would suffer if we lost this business. Bruce, the CEO and chairman of Sullivan-Palatek in Michigan City, noted that not only are the 140 jobs at his company impacted but several hundred more at local suppliers. Bruce said: In the event that the Ex-Im Bank were to be shut down, the impact to us would be immediate. I believe we would have very much difficulty in getting any new orders. In fact, the orders that we have in house, many of them we would not be able to ship. We would have to shut them down right in the middle . . . of the order process. Jon, Mark, and Bruce are three of many in Indiana, many around the country. In my home State, the Hoosier State, since 2010 the Export- Import Bank has directly helped more than 100 companies that have exported more than $3 billion in goods and services. The Ex-Im Bank costs zero in taxpayer dollars. In fact, it turns a profit. [[Page S4535]] Since 1992, the Bank has returned more than $7 billion in profits to the Treasury. Last year, $675 million was returned to the Treasury. And the default rate is 0.175 percent. That is less than one-fifth of 1 percent. That is an effort to manage it in a fiscally prudent, fiscally responsible manner. In fiscal year 2014, the Ex-Im Bank authorized around $20.5 billion for 3,746 transactions, which contributed to $27.5 billion of U.S. exports and more than 164,000 jobs right here in the United States. These are not, for the most part, huge corporations. They are small companies that wouldn't be able to afford financing elsewhere. In 2014, 90 percent of the transactions approved by the Bank were in support of small businesses. So what happens if Ex-Im's charter is to expire? It will be forced to shut down, unwind current obligations, and the loss of future financing could result in a significant amount of business being lost overseas. That directly affects the bottom line for many businesses, leaving them with less revenue to reinvest and less revenue to pay wages or create new jobs. It becomes difficult--if not nearly impossible--for the private sector to replace the loans, the guarantees, and the insurance provided by the Ex-Im Bank. At a time when American companies are competing in a game that is often rigged by foreign currency manipulation, intellectual property theft, and insurmountable regulatory barriers, unilaterally eliminating our export credit agency further handcuffs U.S. job creators and allows competitors in foreign countries to pick up the business. If Ex-Im no longer provides financing, foreign companies and countries are still going to buy their goods and products. They need the products. But instead of buying that product from Muncie, IN, they will purchase it in Russia or China. This is, to me, the direct opposite of what Congress should be doing. It seems as if up is down and down is up in this discussion. Nearly every other major country has a credit export agency. Many are larger and much more aggressive than the Export-Import Bank. Unilaterally eliminating our export credit agency hurts not only the United States and handcuffs our job creators, but it also helps competitors in foreign countries to capitalize and seize that business. Our global competitors, including China, Brazil, and India, are investing more in export financing every single day. They are investing in their companies and in their economy. If we take this measure, we are stepping back. They are rooting for America's Export-Import Bank to close because it means more business for them. Even our neighbor Canada is providing far more export financing than the United States. Canada's economy is one-tenth the size of the U.S. economy, and their export-import agency already provides far more export financing than we do at the present time. The Ex-Im Bank is a tool that helps American companies compete in the global economy. In Indiana, we pride ourselves on what we call Hoosier common sense. It does not get more common sense than creating more American jobs in a fiscally responsible way. That is what the Export-Import Bank does. Congress needs a dose of that Hoosier common sense, which is the same as the common sense in the Presiding Officer's home State of Ohio. We should act quickly to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank to help our companies, to help our employees, to help workers around our country, and to help our Nation. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, our country stands on the brink of a great opportunity in the Asia-Pacific. Since 2008, the United States and 11 other Pacific nations, including Japan and New Zealand, have worked to conclude negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This agreement represents nearly 40 percent of the global gross domestic product, or GDP, and is the most ambitious free-trade agreement in history. By upending antiquated international tariff systems and tearing down barriers to trade, we can unleash American ingenuity and send our Nation's products from Main Street to Malaysia. Much has been said about the national benefits of concluding TPP, but I want to focus on some of the particular benefits for my home State of Colorado. Colorado, like most States, benefits immensely from international trade, particularly with Asia. According to the Business Roundtable, more than 265,000 Colorado jobs are supported by the countries that would be affected by TPP. These trade-related jobs include the farmworker harvesting world-famous melons down in Rocky Ford and the meatpacker shipping American beef from Greeley. They are the electrical engineer designing computer systems in Boulder and the natural gas worker maintaining a rig in Parachute. Collectively, these everyday working Americans help drive the economic and trade engine of Colorado. Last year, my State exported more than $8 billion worth of goods all across the world. Approximately half of them, or $4 billion, went directly to TPP countries. While nations like Vietnam and Japan have imposed hefty tariffs on our Colorado goods in the past, TPP presents an opportunity to level the playing field. American goods would flow more freely to the region and American workers stand to benefit. That is why I strongly support granting the President trade promotion authority, or TPA, and finalizing a high-standard TPP. A vote for TPA is a vote for the American worker. It is a vote for more active engagement in the world and a higher standard of living, and it is a vote to recognize that through increased trade, we can indeed deliver upon the promise of a better tomorrow. Unfortunately, however, some in Congress have opted for isolationism and retreat. They have sounded the alarm over supposed failure of past trade agreements and argued in favor of taking cover rather than taking charge, and they have doubled down on the false notion that trade is always bad for the American economy and the American worker. But a quick review of the facts will dispel these myths very quickly. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, national beef exports to Colombia and Panama have more than tripled since 2011 when we enacted free-trade agreements with these countries. National wheat exports to Chile more than doubled from the enactment of our 2003 free- trade agreement through 2014, while dairy exports increased more than 20 times to that country, and our beef exports have increased more than eight times to the participant countries of the Central America and Dominican Republic free-trade agreement. Colorado businesses have played a large role in expanding overseas as well. My State witnessed a 37-percent increase in goods exported to countries with free-trade agreements between 2003 and 2013. Exports to Korea have increased 61 percent since the conclusion of our free-trade agreement with that nation in 2011. And NAFTA, which anti-trade forces frequently dismiss as the poster child for trade deals gone awry, has resulted in a 293-percent--that is right, 293 percent--increase in Colorado exports to Canada and Mexico since 1994. Beyond the numbers, though, it is important to meet with the workers and business owners who understand that freer trade helps their bottom line. Just a few days ago, I traveled to Eastern Colorado on my annual wheat tour. It is a tradition that Senator Wayne Allard started in the 1990s--then a U.S. Representative--and one I was excited to continue in the Senate. I invited my colleague from Colorado Senator Bennet, so we could both hear the needs directly from Coloradans and see the positive impacts that agreements such as TPP could have not only on Eastern Colorado but farmers across this country. On the tour, we had the chance to marvel at the truly incredible production level of Colorado wheat growers. We are just about 2 weeks away from [[Page S4536]] the height of the winter wheat harvest in Colorado--a time when I have always enjoyed working at our family implement dealership in Yuma--and a reminder that Colorado helps feed the world. The vast majority of Colorado's wheat crop is exported. In fact, in 2013, we shipped more than $235 million worth of wheat across the globe. Eighty percent of the wheat we produce in Colorado is exported. Most of the wheat growers we met on the Eastern Plains aren't interested in retreating from the international marketplace. In fact, they want to expand the international marketplace. They understand that freer trade means improved opportunities to place their product. And with a high-standard TPP, Colorado wheat growers could penetrate notoriously difficult markets in countries such as Japan and begin to ship from Thurman to Tokyo and beyond. It isn't just wheat either. Colorado farmers and ranchers already export millions of dollars in Western Slope beef, Southern Colorado onions, and San Luis Valley potatoes. In fact, according to the Department of Agriculture, Colorado potatoes represent around 70 percent of all U.S. potato exports to Mexico. That market stands to grow significantly if TPP is successfully concluded, considering that Mexico is a member nation in the negotiations. There is no question that trade benefits rural America. We should be promoting Palisade peaches in Perth and Olathe sweet corn on the streets of Singapore. Growing up in rural Colorado, I saw the potential that our hard-working farmers and ranchers created for Colorado and for Colorado products abroad. Their determined spirit and hard-working attitude are what keep America at the top of the global economy, and TPP will expand that promise in the Asia-Pacific. Urban and suburban America succeed with increased trade as well. As do their rural counterparts, urban and suburban Coloradans benefit from a wider selection of cheaper goods. The mechanics of free trade stretch dollars a little bit further for the teenager with a part-time summer job as well as for the family struggling to make ends meet. Aside from the benefit of cheaper products, increased trade creates jobs here at home. A couple of months ago, I was fortunate enough to visit a company in Boulder, CO, that manufactures zip lines and other adventure equipment. This company has successfully expanded their business to Europe and Asia, helping people across the globe enjoy rain forest canopy tours, free falling, and more. As this business expanded overseas, they had the ability to hire more employees and boost the local economy in Boulder. They doubled their Colorado office and are still looking to grow. An agreement such as TPP will open further opportunities for this company in the Asia-Pacific and beyond, perhaps facilitating world-class bungee jumping in New Zealand or advanced rock climbing in Peru, and with those new opportunities come more Colorado jobs. That is the essence of free trade. It encourages innovation and entrepreneurship. It connects the world while growing our workforce at home, and it presents an opportunity for Colorado and our country to spread our goods and ideas across the globe. That is why I have supported free-trade agreements in the past-- agreements that have yielded significant economic and strategic benefits for our Nation. That is why I supported the latest generation of trade promotion authority and look forward to supporting it again. We will continue to support it this week as it goes to the President's desk to be signed into law. That is why I urge my colleagues to continue their support for free-trade agreements, so the United States can help grasp the great opportunity that awaits us in the Asia- Pacific. We have held several hearings over the past couple of months in the Foreign Relations Committee and beyond talking about the benefits of free trade. A couple of weeks ago, we were joined by experts from Asia and economic leaders around this country, all of whom believe we have an important role to play in expanding trade and expanding the opportunities that the Trans-Pacific Partnership will lead to when that agreement comes to this floor, thanks to trade promotion authority. It is an important measure that we must enact. It is an important statement of good faith that the United States truly is interested in the Asia region, the Asia-Pacific region, making good on our efforts to truly pivot to Asia to rebalance policy we all support but making good on our word that we are indeed in the region to stay. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota. Republican-Led Senate Mr. THUNE. Madam President, last fall, Republicans promised that if we were elected to the majority, we would get Washington working. That wasn't a campaign slogan, that was a commitment. After 6 months of Republican control, I am proud to report we are delivering on that promise. The past 6 months in the Senate have been the most productive months in a long time. We passed bipartisan legislation to approve the Keystone Pipeline. We passed a bipartisan bill to help prevent suicides among veterans. We passed the first significant bipartisan reform of Medicare in years, which will ensure that our seniors have access to physicians and that those physicians are judged by the quality rather than the quantity of the care they provide. We passed bipartisan legislation to give law enforcement new tools to fight human trafficking and provide support for trafficking victims. We passed a bipartisan bill to authorize funding for our national defense to provide for the needs of our men and women in uniform. Those are just some of the highlights. Every piece of legislation I mentioned passed with bipartisan support. One reason that happened is because the Republican majority has been committed to ensuring that all Senators, whatever the party, have the opportunity to make their voices heard. Under Democratic leadership, not only were Members of the minority party shut out of the legislative process, but many rank-and-file Democrats were as well. During all of 2014, the Democratic leadership in the Senate allowed just 15 amendment rollcall votes--15 votes in an entire year. That is barely more than a vote a month. By contrast, the Republican-led Senate has taken more than 130 amendment rollcall votes so far this year or more than 21 votes a month. That is not only more amendment rollcall votes than last year, it is more amendment rollcall votes than the Senate has taken in the past 2 years combined. That is through the first 6 months of 2015. We have another 6 months to go. This week, the Senate is considering what I hope is going to be our next bipartisan achievement; that is, the legislation to help expand U.S. trade with other countries and increase the opportunities that are available for American businesses and American workers. Over the past few years, exports have been a bright spot in our economy, supporting an increasing number of American jobs each and every year. In 2014, exports supported 11.7 million U.S. jobs and made up 13 percent of our Nation's economy. We need to continue to open markets around the globe to American goods and services, and the best way to do that is through new trade agreements. Countries with which we have free and fair trade agreements purchase substantially more from us than other countries. In fact, in 2013, free-trade agreement countries purchased 12 times more goods per capita from the United States than nonfree-trade agreement countries--12 times more goods per capita. For American workers, increased trade means more opportunity and increased access to high-paying jobs. Manufacturing jobs tied to exports pay, on average, 13 to 18 percent more than other jobs in our economy. Unfortunately, while trade agreements have proliferated around the globe over the past several years, the United States hasn't signed a new trade agreement in 8 years. A big reason for that is the fact that trade promotion authority expired in 2007. Since 1934, almost all of the U.S. free-trade agreements have been negotiated using trade promotion authority or a similar streamlined, expedited process. Trade promotion authority is designed to put the United States in the [[Page S4537]] strongest possible position when it comes to negotiating trade agreements. Under TPA, Congress sets guidelines for trade negotiations and outlines the priorities the administration must follow. In return, Congress promises a simple up-or-down vote on the resulting trade agreement instead of the long amendment process that could leave the final deal looking nothing like what was initially negotiated. That simple up-or-down vote is the key. It lets our negotiating partners know that Congress and trade negotiators are on the same page, which gives other countries the confidence they need to put their best offers on the table. That, in turn, allows for a successful and timely conclusion of negotiations. Currently, the administration is negotiating two major trade agreements that have the potential to vastly expand the market for American goods and services in the European Union and in the Pacific. The Trans-Pacific Partnership is being negotiated with a number of Asia-Pacific nations, including Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, and Vietnam. If this agreement is done right, it could have huge benefits for American agriculture, among other industries. Agriculture producers in my State of South Dakota and in the Presiding Officer's State of Iowa understand that trade promotion authority is the most effective way to secure trade agreements that will benefit our farmers and our ranchers. One pork producer in my State of South Dakota contacted me to tell me that a successful TPP deal could increase U.S. pork exports to just one of the Trans-Pacific Partnership countries by literally hundreds of millions of dollars in a year. Discussions of the benefits of trade tend to focus on the economic benefits, and with good reason--it helps our economy. It creates good- paying jobs and raises the standard of living for people in this country and gives access for consumers to lower cost goods and services. But new trade agreements also have the potential to result not just in economic gains for America's farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers but in national security gains for the country. When we make trade deals with other countries, we are not just opening new markets for our goods, we are also developing and cementing alliances. Trade agreements build bonds of friendship with other nations that extend not only to cooperation on economic issues but to cooperation on security issues as well. It is also important to remember that just because the United States isn't negotiating trade agreements doesn't mean other countries will not be. In fact, the United States hasn't signed a single new trade agreement over the past 8 years, but that hasn't prevented other countries from signing numerous trade agreements over the same period. If America fails to lead on trade, other nations such as China will step in to fill the void, and these nations will not have the best interests of American workers and American families in mind. The bill before us today will help pave the way for the United States to cement alliances with friendly nations through trade and will help ensure that any trade deals the United States enters into will be favorable to our economic and our national security interests. The Senate passed a version of this bill last month with a bipartisan majority, and I am hopeful we will have a similarly strong bipartisan vote yet this week. Republicans believe our Nation's problems are best solved when Members of both parties come together to find solutions for the American people. Republicans' plans for our second 6 months in the majority are the same as those for the first 6 months of our majority; that is, to make sure we continue to move forward in a way that addresses the challenges that are facing our country. Unfortunately, last week we saw an unfortunate return to partisanship on the part of the Democrats when they blocked an appropriations bill to fund our troops. It is not that Democrats have a problem with this bill; in fact, many of them voted to support the funding this bill provides when they voted in favor of the National Defense Authorization Act last week. The authorization act is the first step in a two-step process which has to be followed by the appropriations bill that actually provides the funding. But Democratic leaders and the President, even though many of them supported the Defense authorization bill, are upset that government agencies such as the EPA and the IRS aren't receiving the Democrats' preferred level of funding, so they have decided to hold appropriations bills hostage in an effort to get what they want. It is unfortunate that Democrats are holding money for our troops hostage in order to get more funding for the EPA and the IRS. If Democrats believe the funding levels in the appropriations bills are not acceptable, they will have the opportunity to offer amendments to increase the funding. But in order to do that, they have to allow us to actually proceed to consideration of these bills on the Senate floor. What they are, in effect, doing now is filibustering any attempt to bring any spending bill to the floor; most recently, as I mentioned, the funding bill for our troops. The bill that funds our national security interests in this country is currently being held hostage. We can't even get it on the floor to debate it. We are not only talking about ultimately passing it, we are talking about even having a discussion on the floor of the Senate about something as important as funding our troops and the important military objectives we have as a nation. Yet, right now, we have a filibuster being conducted by the Democrats--again, because they want to get more funding for their favorite agencies. Well, that is a bad way to go about this. I am hopeful that this obstruction--which is largely driven by the Democratic leadership--that most rank-and-file Democrats will rethink a strategy that involves opposing every opportunity to fund our Nation's priorities and to get things done for the American people. After years of stagnation in the Senate under Democratic leadership, I think even most Democrats have enjoyed governing in a functioning Senate again. We have dozens of bipartisan bills to show for the first 6 months of this year, and our record of accomplishment can continue if the Democrats abandon their strategy of obstruction and continue to work with us to solve the challenges facing our Nation. They can start by not objecting to proceeding to even getting a bill that funds our national security interests here on the floor of the Senate so we can debate it. As I said, if they don't like the funding levels in there, we will have an open amendment process in which they will be able to offer amendments to change those funding levels. But what they are doing right now is fundamentally wrong, not even allowing consideration of an appropriations bill that funds our military and pays our troops on the floor of the United States Senate. I hope that will change. I hope that the Democrats will join us in making the next 6 months of 2015 as productive as the first 6 months have been and that we can point to bipartisan achievements that are good for the American people, that focus on their basic daily needs, and that will promote policies which will grow our economy and create jobs and lead to a higher standard of living and increased take-home pay for middle-income families across this country. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I would like to take a few minutes to underscore the importance of trade and trade promotion authority to the American manufacturing industry. Despite some claims to the contrary, U.S. manufacturers have been among the principal beneficiaries of our existing free-trade agreements. One in four U.S. manufacturing jobs depends on exports. On average, the wages of those in export-supported manufacturing jobs are 18 percent higher than those of other factory workers. Furthermore, since the last TPA bill passed through the Congress in 2002, [[Page S4538]] U.S. goods exports have more than doubled, reaching $1.6 trillion in 2013 alone. While we hear a constant drumbeat decrying our trade deficits, the United States enjoys a nearly $60 billion yearly manufacturing surplus with our 20 existing partners to the free-trade agreements. Consumers and businesses in those 20 countries purchased $658 billion of U.S. manufactured goods in 2013 alone, which represents nearly 48 percent of all exports produced by the 12 million Americans employed in manufacturing. Clearly, in places where we have free-trade agreements, where our manufacturers can compete on a level playing field, they are winning. We need to build on that track record of success and enact more high- standard, 21st-century free-trade agreements. That is yet another reason why we need TPA. It is no wonder, then, that our TPA bill is supported by manufacturers throughout the country. We have received letters or statements of support from groups such as the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, the Grocery Manufacturers Association, the American Forest and Paper Association, the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, the Semiconductor Industry Association, the Society of Chemical Manufacturers & Affiliates, the National Council of Textile Organizations, and many others. On top of that, a number of iconic individual manufacturing companies have weighed in publicly in support of our bill, including Boeing, Cummins, Dow Chemical, Honeywell, Intel, Texas Instruments, Xerox, and, of course, many others. Caterpillar, which is based in Peoria, IL, is the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel engines, and gas turbines. Caterpillar knows the value of trade to a healthy economy, having exported nearly $88 billion in goods and services over the past 5 years. They know that if we pass TPA, they can do even better. Upon introduction of our bill, the company issued a statement saying, ``Passage of TPA will provide the United States with the strongest possible hand when negotiating future trade agreements and will help eliminate the current high tariffs and trade barriers that companies like Caterpillar currently face.'' It is not just big companies that benefit. Ninety-eight percent of nearly 300,000 American exporters are small and medium-sized businesses. Let me say that again. Ninety-eight percent of all U.S. exporters are small and medium-sized businesses. There are 300,000 of them. That fact escapes many people. Let me give an example of one of those small businesses from my home State of Utah. Kimber Kable is owned and operated by Ray Kimber. Ray's story is emblematic of the American dream. In the late 1970s, Ray figured out a way to weave audio cables to reduce unwanted noise and improve fidelity. The company he started in his garage over 35 years ago is now a driver of economic growth and a source of jobs. Today, he employs 30 people in Ogden, UT. He sells his cables to the world. Two- thirds of Ray's cables are shipped to customers overseas. Ray is not only a friend of mine, he is also an outstanding example of a larger truth: The U.S. manufacturing sector is the most innovative in the world, and American workers are unsurpassed in manufacturing productivity. Because of U.S. innovation and productivity, where U.S. manufacturing competes on an equal footing, it always succeeds. We can help people like Ray reach more markets and maintain healthy small businesses across America--businesses that will grow our economy and create more jobs--but we can only do that if our trade negotiators have the tools to set fair trade rules for our exporters. That is what our TPA bill provides. For example, a big part of the ability of small companies like Kimber Kable to sell around the world is digital trade. That is why the TPA bill that is again before us directs our trade negotiators to ensure that electronically delivered goods and services are classified with the most liberal trade treatment possible and that our trading partners allow the free flow of data across borders. Using the Internet to market, sell, and transmit digital products is only part of the story. Companies like Ray's are also innovators, and their innovations must be protected. Too many small businesses have experienced firsthand the destructive impact of intellectual property theft. Companies like Kimber Kable have to contend with counterfeiters stealing their company name to sell inferior products. This TPA bill, therefore, will also ensure that U.S. trade agreements reflect a standard of intellectual property rights protection similar to that found in our own U.S. law. The bill calls for an end to the theft of U.S. intellectual property by foreign governments, including piracy and the theft of trade secrets, and for the elimination of measures that require U.S. companies to locate their intellectual property abroad in return for market access. These are strong provisions that will help U.S. manufacturing compete and sell their products around the world. Companies from Caterpillar to Kimber Kable recognize the importance of trade and trade agreements to the future of American manufacturing. They recognize that 95 percent of the world's consumers live outside of the United States and that if we want to sell American-made products to these customers, we need strong agreements to break down barriers and level the playing field. We simply cannot do that without the TPA. We can do better and we must do better for American manufacturers. If we really want to support the American manufacturing industry, then we should vote today to pass this TPA legislation once and for all. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I wish to take a few minutes to talk about the importance of international trade to my home State of Utah and how Utahns will benefit from the passage of the TPA bill. Despite having a relatively small population, the State of Utah is a very significant player in international trade. In 2014 alone, Utah exported more than $12 billion in goods. That number has more than doubled over the past decade, despite the economic downturn that took place during that time. Goods exports account for more than 11 percent of Utah's GDP. More than 50,000 Utah jobs are directly tied to goods exports, as more than 3,400 Utah-based companies export goods to countries around the world. By the way, nearly 86 percent of those exporting companies are small or medium-sized businesses. These Utah exports include a number of key manufacturing exports, including primary metal products, computer and electronics products, chemicals, processed foods, and transportation equipment, just to mention a few. There are a number of Utah companies that I could single out here today. As I said, there are more than 3,400 Utah-based exporters, but let me talk about one in particular--Albion Laboratories, which is based in Clearfield, UT. Albion is a leading, global manufacturer of chelated minerals for human and plant nutritional applications. The company is incredibly innovative, owning more than 100 patents from manufacturing processes to food applications. Over the years, Albion has enjoyed strong growth in large part because of its expanded exports. Today, Albion exports to more than 100 different countries, which has allowed the company to regularly add new jobs to accommodate its increased output. As of right now, the company employs approximately 150 people. This is just one example of the many unique and innovative Utah companies that have benefited from international trade and will benefit even more from expanded access to foreign markets in the future. Now, there has been a lot of talk about the potential benefits of our pending trade agreements with countries in the Asia-Pacific region and the European Union. As of right now, more than half of Utah's exports already go [[Page S4539]] to these two markets. Therefore, I think it is safe to say that Utah- based exporters will benefit greatly from the expanded market access they will undoubtedly see if we can get both the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership over the finish line. Of course, without TPA, these two important trade agreements, which are among the largest and most ambitious agreements in our Nation's history, don't stand a chance. TPA gives our negotiators the tools they need to get the best deals possible. TPA gives Congress and our constituents a strong voice in the negotiating process, and, of course, TPA assures that once an agreement is reached, our country will be able to deliver on the deal. Utahns depend on international trade. Utah's job creators, like those throughout the country, need greater access to foreign markets in order to compete. Put simply, they are not going to get that access without TPA. So for the sake of the thousands of Utah companies that export goods around the world and the tens of thousands of Utahns whose jobs depend on those exports--and for the hundreds of thousands of companies all over this country and more--I urge my colleagues to join me one more time in supporting our TPA legislation. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized. Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor today to talk about Internet tax freedom and to talk about ensuring that our online businesses remain competitive. First of all, I commend the House of Representatives for recently passing the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act, which would permanently extend the current ban on Internet access taxes. The current tax moratorium will expire on October 1, and if we fail to renew it, it could cost taxpayers nearly $15 billion in new fees and taxes next year. In addition, as importantly, it would make Internet access less affordable to hard-working families and hamper small businesses' ability to grow and create jobs using the Internet because essentially it would allow all of these jurisdictions to tax the Internet. So when you get on the Internet, you can expect many more taxes if we do not do what the House of Representatives did and extend the Internet Tax Freedom Act. In fact, I think we should make it permanent. I am a cosponsor of a Senate companion bill of which I hope this Senate will follow the House's lead to pass and send a permanent extension to the President's desk. Unfortunately, one of the things we have heard is that some see this extension of the moratorium on Internet taxation as an opportunity to attach another piece of legislation that, in fact, would burden our online businesses and would tremendously disadvantage a State like my home State of New Hampshire that has made the legislative decision not to have a sales tax. We have seen this playbook before. It was called before the Marketplace Fairness Act. Of course, there is nothing fair about this act when it comes to our online businesses having to collect taxes for nearly 9,000 taxing jurisdictions. You can imagine the bureaucratic nightmare that would occur. So this so-called Marketplace Fairness Act--I always used to like to call it the ``Online Sales Tax Act'' or the ``Online Sales Tax Collection Act.'' That would be a more accurate description of that particular act. So here we are. We have a rerun of this particular bill that would have required businesses in the State of New Hampshire--even though we do not have a sales tax--our online businesses to collect for all these other tax jurisdictions. Again, it is not even just States that have sales taxes. In some States, it goes down to the municipal level when it comes to municipalities and local jurisdictions actually collecting a separate tax, so it would have ended up being over 9,000 taxing jurisdictions. So here you have a nice online business out there having to be the tax collector for all these different jurisdictions. You can imagine that this would really be a huge burden on these online businesses. The individuals who have been supporting this new sales tax collection scheme in this new burden on the Internet--by the way, one of the reasons I am such a strong proponent of permanently extending the tax freedom and the lack of taxes on the Internet, on Internet access, is because we have seen not only consumers' access to the Internet but the ability of businesses and the ability of us to create jobs and to see real growth on the Internet. This has allowed people to start businesses from their home. It has allowed so much creativity. It has been very positive for our economy. So lo and behold in all of that there are some talking about attaching to this Internet Tax Freedom Act this incredibly burdensome collection scheme to require businesses to be out there collecting all these sales taxes throughout the Nation. The latest proposal the proponents of this type of tax collection scheme have come up with is one that again creates even more issues--certainly as many if not more issues--than the prior proposal that was called the so-called Marketplace Fairness Act. Of course, we know there is nothing fair about it if you are a business having to collect all these taxes. What this rerun would do is actually create this reporting system and require businesses to purchase this software and then require States to actually have what are called certified software providers. Here is what would happen: Under this latest scheme, the certified software providers for these States would actually collect all the sales information for every sale--every online sale in a State--and then they would manage the collection of these taxes. Well, can you imagine? So now we are going to say to businesses: Yes, you have to purchase this certain software. And guess what. Every sale you make is going to be held by the central government in each State. Can you imagine, with all the things we have seen happen in terms of breach of privacy of individuals? We have seen cyber attacks, all these issues we are facing. We have seen it in our government with OPM. We have seen it with the IRS. We have seen it with private companies in data breach. Now this latest scheme is, let's send all the sales information to one place, and we will have some company--I guess some private companies will stand to benefit from this--they will now collect all these taxes, and they will hold all this information. Imagine how much information they would hold in each State. So that is how we are going to create this new taxing scheme. You can imagine how a State such as New Hampshire would feel about that as a State that has decided not to have a sales tax--that suddenly our State has to keep all this information, has to hire some private company to do this, to collect all these taxes, and then that each of our online businesses has to purchase this software which is supposed to interface with its State government. What a massive bureaucracy, and how unfair it is in terms of State sovereignty that the Federal Government would impose this on a State such as New Hampshire that has made a decision not to have a sales tax. This, to me, would be the opposite of what we are trying to accomplish under the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act, which I fully support, which is about Internet tax freedom, and to attach this proposal to that Internet Tax Freedom Act, which some people, I think, are scheming around here to do, which with the right hand we are going to give you Internet freedom and with the left hand we are going to take that freedom away from States like mine that have chosen not to have a sales tax. And our online businesses would now have to be part of this huge bureaucratic scheme to collect taxes for other States and other localities. So I would hope my colleagues would not go down this road because I think the Internet should be free. I think online businesses should be able to continue to thrive and grow. I think online businesses should not be required to collect for over 9,000 taxing jurisdictions. And certainly I think all of us should have concerns about all of the sales data being collected by some kind of third party and being held in one place just so we can collect more taxes on online businesses. In fact, what I have heard from our businesses in New Hampshire previously when the so-called Marketplace Fairness Act was on the floor of the Senate--many of the businesses in New Hampshire that have online sales told me then how unfair they thought this taxing scheme was, and those concerns [[Page S4534]] remain, great businesses such as Garnet Hill in Franconia, NH. Russ Gaitskill, who is the president and CEO of Garnet Hill, told me previously: ``It's going to be a nightmare.'' I heard in the past from E&R Laundry and Dry Cleaners, a small business founded in Manchester in 1921. About 70 percent of E&R's sales are now Internet based. The company's president said he would not have the resources to calculate, collect, and deliver sales taxes for thousands of jurisdictions across the country. There is a great bakery, certainly, in the Nashua and Amherst area, Frederick's Pastries. Anybody who has been there--I can tell you, Frederick's is a great bakery. Susan Lozier Roberts of Frederick's expressed concern that this taxing scheme would create mass confusion, keeping up with all the individual tax codes. There is the fact that we are going to have to have software and have some third party hold all of the sales information for all these online businesses. That creates so many other additional burdensome issues, as well as privacy issues. Travis Adams with whaddy.com, based in Nashua, said previously: One tax audit from another State or jurisdiction would completely crush us. Because what happens under this so-called taxing scheme is now all of our online businesses can be audited in all of these taxing jurisdictions. So you can be an online business in New Hampshire, and what the proponents of this new tax scheme would like to have is this opportunity that businesses in New Hampshire can now be audited in all these other jurisdictions. You can imagine what kind of burdens that would create on businesses that are trying to focus every day on the bottom line and creating jobs. So I would say that as we look at this new proposal that some people behind the scenes are talking about trying to attach to the Internet Tax Freedom Act--I hope we will not go down this road. It would be bad for business, it would be bad for people's privacy, it would be a big power grab, I think, from Washington to require States such as New Hampshire to collect these taxes from throughout the country, and it certainly would not be positive to create more jobs through online businesses. In fact, the Competitive Enterprise Institute said of this latest proposal, which is a cousin to the so-called Marketplace Fairness Act: [This] new tax grab erodes healthy tax competition among states, puts consumers' information at higher risk, and ushers in a regime of taxation without representation. It's like the Blackwater of tax collection, state-paid mercenaries with sales tax charts. Under the Marketplace Fairness Act businesses are threatened by the prospect of being audited and prosecuted in every state into which they sell. This issue is one I think we all should care about. I know in my home State of New Hampshire, where we have chosen not to have a sales tax, it would be completely unfair for us to consider passing this proposal which is a brandnew tax grab that erodes New Hampshire's competitive status of choosing not to have a sales tax. Also, there is the concern we all should have about a central taxing authority holding all of this private sales information in each of the States and what could be done with that information and how will consumers' information be protected. New Hampshire's residents and Internet retailers cannot afford this radical Federal invasion of our State. I hope my colleagues will see the importance of extending the Internet Tax Freedom Act to encourage innovation and job creation, but under no circumstances should the Internet access tax moratorium be held hostage by a new and invasive sales tax that would not only undo the benefits of the tax moratorium but also burden our small businesses with becoming tax collectors for other States. That is wrong, and I hope this body will not go down that road. I certainly will be doing everything I can within my power in the Senate to make sure this new sales tax collection regime does not get attached to a very positive proposal, which is the Internet Tax Freedom Act. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana. Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, it is an honor to follow my colleague from New Hampshire, who has done such an eloquent job. Export-Import Bank I want to talk about the Export-Import Bank. I said this during the unnecessary 2013 Government shutdown, and I will say it again: Most Americans think Congress can do something to help create jobs and strengthen our economy--even if it is simply not doing any harm. Yet here we are again, willfully allowing an important tool for economic growth to expire by not taking commonsense action. On June 30, the charter for the Export-Import Bank will expire. During its 80-plus years of existence, the Bank has garnered support from every President during that span and repeatedly been renewed by Congress, often without any objection. The Export-Import Bank is not a Democratic program or a Republican program. It is a program to help American businesses. President Reagan's words from 30 years ago still ring true: Exports create and sustain jobs for millions of American workers and contribute to the growth and strength of the United States economy. The Export-Import Bank contributes in a significant way to our nation's export sales. The Gipper was right then, and he is right today. Those who oppose the Ex-Im Bank for ideological reasons may make their case in the abstract, but I have to operate in the reality, where I have heard over and over from Indiana small business owners and workers about the importance of the Ex-Im Bank. Jon, the vice president of Specialty Hardwoods of Indiana, in Nappannee, told me about their small company, which has around 40 employees. They got through the financial downturn of 2008 and 2009 but suffered during that time, as all small manufacturers did, not only here in this country but worldwide. As they returned to profitability, they made a decision to try to diversify markets. Up until 2008, they mostly sold their products to the recreational vehicle industry. Since then, they have started to sell to cabinet companies that market to the kitchen and bath industry nationally and made a direct attempt to go after export sales. Lumber product exports now account at Specialty Hardwoods for more than 45 percent of their current sales. Jon told me: We could not have done this without the support of EXIM bank. I personally have helped other small companies in our industry contact EXIM and establish relationships with EXIM to market their products. It levels the playing field for smaller companies to enter this market segment of our industry. We have grown our business and survived because of EXIM bank and the efforts of the 40-45 people that we employ. The stories continue. Mark, the vice president and co-owner of Agrarian Marketing Corporation, told us about his company that makes feed additives and nutritional supplements for the livestock industry. They have a very large distributor in Cairo, Egypt, that represents nearly 30 percent of their business. For this Hoosier business, nearly 30 percent of their business comes from Cairo, Egypt. The credit insurance they purchase through Ex-Im Bank allows them to source this business by extending beneficial credit terms to their Egyptian customer. It would not be possible if they required their customer to prepay for those orders. Mark said: Although we are a small business, this segment of our business is very important to us and provides excellent profitability and jobs here in Indiana as well as jobs for our contract manufacturers in Iowa, Illinois, and Ohio. All would suffer if we lost this business. Bruce, the CEO and chairman of Sullivan-Palatek in Michigan City, noted that not only are the 140 jobs at his company impacted but several hundred more at local suppliers. Bruce said: In the event that the Ex-Im Bank were to be shut down, the impact to us would be immediate. I believe we would have very much difficulty in getting any new orders. In fact, the orders that we have in house, many of them we would not be able to ship. We would have to shut them down right in the middle . . . of the order process. Jon, Mark, and Bruce are three of many in Indiana, many around the country. In my home State, the Hoosier State, since 2010 the Export- Import Bank has directly helped more than 100 companies that have exported more than $3 billion in goods and services. The Ex-Im Bank costs zero in taxpayer dollars. In fact, it turns a profit. [[Page S4535]] Since 1992, the Bank has returned more than $7 billion in profits to the Treasury. Last year, $675 million was returned to the Treasury. And the default rate is 0.175 percent. That is less than one-fifth of 1 percent. That is an effort to manage it in a fiscally prudent, fiscally responsible manner. In fiscal year 2014, the Ex-Im Bank authorized around $20.5 billion for 3,746 transactions, which contributed to $27.5 billion of U.S. exports and more than 164,000 jobs right here in the United States. These are not, for the most part, huge corporations. They are small companies that wouldn't be able to afford financing elsewhere. In 2014, 90 percent of the transactions approved by the Bank were in support of small businesses. So what happens if Ex-Im's charter is to expire? It will be forced to shut down, unwind current obligations, and the loss of future financing could result in a significant amount of business being lost overseas. That directly affects the bottom line for many businesses, leaving them with less revenue to reinvest and less revenue to pay wages or create new jobs. It becomes difficult--if not nearly impossible--for the private sector to replace the loans, the guarantees, and the insurance provided by the Ex-Im Bank. At a time when American companies are competing in a game that is often rigged by foreign currency manipulation, intellectual property theft, and insurmountable regulatory barriers, unilaterally eliminating our export credit agency further handcuffs U.S. job creators and allows competitors in foreign countries to pick up the business. If Ex-Im no longer provides financing, foreign companies and countries are still going to buy their goods and products. They need the products. But instead of buying that product from Muncie, IN, they will purchase it in Russia or China. This is, to me, the direct opposite of what Congress should be doing. It seems as if up is down and down is up in this discussion. Nearly every other major country has a credit export agency. Many are larger and much more aggressive than the Export-Import Bank. Unilaterally eliminating our export credit agency hurts not only the United States and handcuffs our job creators, but it also helps competitors in foreign countries to capitalize and seize that business. Our global competitors, including China, Brazil, and India, are investing more in export financing every single day. They are investing in their companies and in their economy. If we take this measure, we are stepping back. They are rooting for America's Export-Import Bank to close because it means more business for them. Even our neighbor Canada is providing far more export financing than the United States. Canada's economy is one-tenth the size of the U.S. economy, and their export-import agency already provides far more export financing than we do at the present time. The Ex-Im Bank is a tool that helps American companies compete in the global economy. In Indiana, we pride ourselves on what we call Hoosier common sense. It does not get more common sense than creating more American jobs in a fiscally responsible way. That is what the Export-Import Bank does. Congress needs a dose of that Hoosier common sense, which is the same as the common sense in the Presiding Officer's home State of Ohio. We should act quickly to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank to help our companies, to help our employees, to help workers around our country, and to help our Nation. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, our country stands on the brink of a great opportunity in the Asia-Pacific. Since 2008, the United States and 11 other Pacific nations, including Japan and New Zealand, have worked to conclude negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This agreement represents nearly 40 percent of the global gross domestic product, or GDP, and is the most ambitious free-trade agreement in history. By upending antiquated international tariff systems and tearing down barriers to trade, we can unleash American ingenuity and send our Nation's products from Main Street to Malaysia. Much has been said about the national benefits of concluding TPP, but I want to focus on some of the particular benefits for my home State of Colorado. Colorado, like most States, benefits immensely from international trade, particularly with Asia. According to the Business Roundtable, more than 265,000 Colorado jobs are supported by the countries that would be affected by TPP. These trade-related jobs include the farmworker harvesting world-famous melons down in Rocky Ford and the meatpacker shipping American beef from Greeley. They are the electrical engineer designing computer systems in Boulder and the natural gas worker maintaining a rig in Parachute. Collectively, these everyday working Americans help drive the economic and trade engine of Colorado. Last year, my State exported more than $8 billion worth of goods all across the world. Approximately half of them, or $4 billion, went directly to TPP countries. While nations like Vietnam and Japan have imposed hefty tariffs on our Colorado goods in the past, TPP presents an opportunity to level the playing field. American goods would flow more freely to the region and American workers stand to benefit. That is why I strongly support granting the President trade promotion authority, or TPA, and finalizing a high-standard TPP. A vote for TPA is a vote for the American worker. It is a vote for more active engagement in the world and a higher standard of living, and it is a vote to recognize that through increased trade, we can indeed deliver upon the promise of a better tomorrow. Unfortunately, however, some in Congress have opted for isolationism and retreat. They have sounded the alarm over supposed failure of past trade agreements and argued in favor of taking cover rather than taking charge, and they have doubled down on the false notion that trade is always bad for the American economy and the American worker. But a quick review of the facts will dispel these myths very quickly. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, national beef exports to Colombia and Panama have more than tripled since 2011 when we enacted free-trade agreements with these countries. National wheat exports to Chile more than doubled from the enactment of our 2003 free- trade agreement through 2014, while dairy exports increased more than 20 times to that country, and our beef exports have increased more than eight times to the participant countries of the Central America and Dominican Republic free-trade agreement. Colorado businesses have played a large role in expanding overseas as well. My State witnessed a 37-percent increase in goods exported to countries with free-trade agreements between 2003 and 2013. Exports to Korea have increased 61 percent since the conclusion of our free-trade agreement with that nation in 2011. And NAFTA, which anti-trade forces frequently dismiss as the poster child for trade deals gone awry, has resulted in a 293-percent--that is right, 293 percent--increase in Colorado exports to Canada and Mexico since 1994. Beyond the numbers, though, it is important to meet with the workers and business owners who understand that freer trade helps their bottom line. Just a few days ago, I traveled to Eastern Colorado on my annual wheat tour. It is a tradition that Senator Wayne Allard started in the 1990s--then a U.S. Representative--and one I was excited to continue in the Senate. I invited my colleague from Colorado Senator Bennet, so we could both hear the needs directly from Coloradans and see the positive impacts that agreements such as TPP could have not only on Eastern Colorado but farmers across this country. On the tour, we had the chance to marvel at the truly incredible production level of Colorado wheat growers. We are just about 2 weeks away from [[Page S4536]] the height of the winter wheat harvest in Colorado--a time when I have always enjoyed working at our family implement dealership in Yuma--and a reminder that Colorado helps feed the world. The vast majority of Colorado's wheat crop is exported. In fact, in 2013, we shipped more than $235 million worth of wheat across the globe. Eighty percent of the wheat we produce in Colorado is exported. Most of the wheat growers we met on the Eastern Plains aren't interested in retreating from the international marketplace. In fact, they want to expand the international marketplace. They understand that freer trade means improved opportunities to place their product. And with a high-standard TPP, Colorado wheat growers could penetrate notoriously difficult markets in countries such as Japan and begin to ship from Thurman to Tokyo and beyond. It isn't just wheat either. Colorado farmers and ranchers already export millions of dollars in Western Slope beef, Southern Colorado onions, and San Luis Valley potatoes. In fact, according to the Department of Agriculture, Colorado potatoes represent around 70 percent of all U.S. potato exports to Mexico. That market stands to grow significantly if TPP is successfully concluded, considering that Mexico is a member nation in the negotiations. There is no question that trade benefits rural America. We should be promoting Palisade peaches in Perth and Olathe sweet corn on the streets of Singapore. Growing up in rural Colorado, I saw the potential that our hard-working farmers and ranchers created for Colorado and for Colorado products abroad. Their determined spirit and hard-working attitude are what keep America at the top of the global economy, and TPP will expand that promise in the Asia-Pacific. Urban and suburban America succeed with increased trade as well. As do their rural counterparts, urban and suburban Coloradans benefit from a wider selection of cheaper goods. The mechanics of free trade stretch dollars a little bit further for the teenager with a part-time summer job as well as for the family struggling to make ends meet. Aside from the benefit of cheaper products, increased trade creates jobs here at home. A couple of months ago, I was fortunate enough to visit a company in Boulder, CO, that manufactures zip lines and other adventure equipment. This company has successfully expanded their business to Europe and Asia, helping people across the globe enjoy rain forest canopy tours, free falling, and more. As this business expanded overseas, they had the ability to hire more employees and boost the local economy in Boulder. They doubled their Colorado office and are still looking to grow. An agreement such as TPP will open further opportunities for this company in the Asia-Pacific and beyond, perhaps facilitating world-class bungee jumping in New Zealand or advanced rock climbing in Peru, and with those new opportunities come more Colorado jobs. That is the essence of free trade. It encourages innovation and entrepreneurship. It connects the world while growing our workforce at home, and it presents an opportunity for Colorado and our country to spread our goods and ideas across the globe. That is why I have supported free-trade agreements in the past-- agreements that have yielded significant economic and strategic benefits for our Nation. That is why I supported the latest generation of trade promotion authority and look forward to supporting it again. We will continue to support it this week as it goes to the President's desk to be signed into law. That is why I urge my colleagues to continue their support for free-trade agreements, so the United States can help grasp the great opportunity that awaits us in the Asia- Pacific. We have held several hearings over the past couple of months in the Foreign Relations Committee and beyond talking about the benefits of free trade. A couple of weeks ago, we were joined by experts from Asia and economic leaders around this country, all of whom believe we have an important role to play in expanding trade and expanding the opportunities that the Trans-Pacific Partnership will lead to when that agreement comes to this floor, thanks to trade promotion authority. It is an important measure that we must enact. It is an important statement of good faith that the United States truly is interested in the Asia region, the Asia-Pacific region, making good on our efforts to truly pivot to Asia to rebalance policy we all support but making good on our word that we are indeed in the region to stay. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota. Republican-Led Senate Mr. THUNE. Madam President, last fall, Republicans promised that if we were elected to the majority, we would get Washington working. That wasn't a campaign slogan, that was a commitment. After 6 months of Republican control, I am proud to report we are delivering on that promise. The past 6 months in the Senate have been the most productive months in a long time. We passed bipartisan legislation to approve the Keystone Pipeline. We passed a bipartisan bill to help prevent suicides among veterans. We passed the first significant bipartisan reform of Medicare in years, which will ensure that our seniors have access to physicians and that those physicians are judged by the quality rather than the quantity of the care they provide. We passed bipartisan legislation to give law enforcement new tools to fight human trafficking and provide support for trafficking victims. We passed a bipartisan bill to authorize funding for our national defense to provide for the needs of our men and women in uniform. Those are just some of the highlights. Every piece of legislation I mentioned passed with bipartisan support. One reason that happened is because the Republican majority has been committed to ensuring that all Senators, whatever the party, have the opportunity to make their voices heard. Under Democratic leadership, not only were Members of the minority party shut out of the legislative process, but many rank-and-file Democrats were as well. During all of 2014, the Democratic leadership in the Senate allowed just 15 amendment rollcall votes--15 votes in an entire year. That is barely more than a vote a month. By contrast, the Republican-led Senate has taken more than 130 amendment rollcall votes so far this year or more than 21 votes a month. That is not only more amendment rollcall votes than last year, it is more amendment rollcall votes than the Senate has taken in the past 2 years combined. That is through the first 6 months of 2015. We have another 6 months to go. This week, the Senate is considering what I hope is going to be our next bipartisan achievement; that is, the legislation to help expand U.S. trade with other countries and increase the opportunities that are available for American businesses and American workers. Over the past few years, exports have been a bright spot in our economy, supporting an increasing number of American jobs each and every year. In 2014, exports supported 11.7 million U.S. jobs and made up 13 percent of our Nation's economy. We need to continue to open markets around the globe to American goods and services, and the best way to do that is through new trade agreements. Countries with which we have free and fair trade agreements purchase substantially more from us than other countries. In fact, in 2013, free-trade agreement countries purchased 12 times more goods per capita from the United States than nonfree-trade agreement countries--12 times more goods per capita. For American workers, increased trade means more opportunity and increased access to high-paying jobs. Manufacturing jobs tied to exports pay, on average, 13 to 18 percent more than other jobs in our economy. Unfortunately, while trade agreements have proliferated around the globe over the past several years, the United States hasn't signed a new trade agreement in 8 years. A big reason for that is the fact that trade promotion authority expired in 2007. Since 1934, almost all of the U.S. free-trade agreements have been negotiated using trade promotion authority or a similar streamlined, expedited process. Trade promotion authority is designed to put the United States in the [[Page S4537]] strongest possible position when it comes to negotiating trade agreements. Under TPA, Congress sets guidelines for trade negotiations and outlines the priorities the administration must follow. In return, Congress promises a simple up-or-down vote on the resulting trade agreement instead of the long amendment process that could leave the final deal looking nothing like what was initially negotiated. That simple up-or-down vote is the key. It lets our negotiating partners know that Congress and trade negotiators are on the same page, which gives other countries the confidence they need to put their best offers on the table. That, in turn, allows for a successful and timely conclusion of negotiations. Currently, the administration is negotiating two major trade agreements that have the potential to vastly expand the market for American goods and services in the European Union and in the Pacific. The Trans-Pacific Partnership is being negotiated with a number of Asia-Pacific nations, including Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, and Vietnam. If this agreement is done right, it could have huge benefits for American agriculture, among other industries. Agriculture producers in my State of South Dakota and in the Presiding Officer's State of Iowa understand that trade promotion authority is the most effective way to secure trade agreements that will benefit our farmers and our ranchers. One pork producer in my State of South Dakota contacted me to tell me that a successful TPP deal could increase U.S. pork exports to just one of the Trans-Pacific Partnership countries by literally hundreds of millions of dollars in a year. Discussions of the benefits of trade tend to focus on the economic benefits, and with good reason--it helps our economy. It creates good- paying jobs and raises the standard of living for people in this country and gives access for consumers to lower cost goods and services. But new trade agreements also have the potential to result not just in economic gains for America's farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers but in national security gains for the country. When we make trade deals with other countries, we are not just opening new markets for our goods, we are also developing and cementing alliances. Trade agreements build bonds of friendship with other nations that extend not only to cooperation on economic issues but to cooperation on security issues as well. It is also important to remember that just because the United States isn't negotiating trade agreements doesn't mean other countries will not be. In fact, the United States hasn't signed a single new trade agreement over the past 8 years, but that hasn't prevented other countries from signing numerous trade agreements over the same period. If America fails to lead on trade, other nations such as China will step in to fill the void, and these nations will not have the best interests of American workers and American families in mind. The bill before us today will help pave the way for the United States to cement alliances with friendly nations through trade and will help ensure that any trade deals the United States enters into will be favorable to our economic and our national security interests. The Senate passed a version of this bill last month with a bipartisan majority, and I am hopeful we will have a similarly strong bipartisan vote yet this week. Republicans believe our Nation's problems are best solved when Members of both parties come together to find solutions for the American people. Republicans' plans for our second 6 months in the majority are the same as those for the first 6 months of our majority; that is, to make sure we continue to move forward in a way that addresses the challenges that are facing our country. Unfortunately, last week we saw an unfortunate return to partisanship on the part of the Democrats when they blocked an appropriations bill to fund our troops. It is not that Democrats have a problem with this bill; in fact, many of them voted to support the funding this bill provides when they voted in favor of the National Defense Authorization Act last week. The authorization act is the first step in a two-step process which has to be followed by the appropriations bill that actually provides the funding. But Democratic leaders and the President, even though many of them supported the Defense authorization bill, are upset that government agencies such as the EPA and the IRS aren't receiving the Democrats' preferred level of funding, so they have decided to hold appropriations bills hostage in an effort to get what they want. It is unfortunate that Democrats are holding money for our troops hostage in order to get more funding for the EPA and the IRS. If Democrats believe the funding levels in the appropriations bills are not acceptable, they will have the opportunity to offer amendments to increase the funding. But in order to do that, they have to allow us to actually proceed to consideration of these bills on the Senate floor. What they are, in effect, doing now is filibustering any attempt to bring any spending bill to the floor; most recently, as I mentioned, the funding bill for our troops. The bill that funds our national security interests in this country is currently being held hostage. We can't even get it on the floor to debate it. We are not only talking about ultimately passing it, we are talking about even having a discussion on the floor of the Senate about something as important as funding our troops and the important military objectives we have as a nation. Yet, right now, we have a filibuster being conducted by the Democrats--again, because they want to get more funding for their favorite agencies. Well, that is a bad way to go about this. I am hopeful that this obstruction--which is largely driven by the Democratic leadership--that most rank-and-file Democrats will rethink a strategy that involves opposing every opportunity to fund our Nation's priorities and to get things done for the American people. After years of stagnation in the Senate under Democratic leadership, I think even most Democrats have enjoyed governing in a functioning Senate again. We have dozens of bipartisan bills to show for the first 6 months of this year, and our record of accomplishment can continue if the Democrats abandon their strategy of obstruction and continue to work with us to solve the challenges facing our Nation. They can start by not objecting to proceeding to even getting a bill that funds our national security interests here on the floor of the Senate so we can debate it. As I said, if they don't like the funding levels in there, we will have an open amendment process in which they will be able to offer amendments to change those funding levels. But what they are doing right now is fundamentally wrong, not even allowing consideration of an appropriations bill that funds our military and pays our troops on the floor of the United States Senate. I hope that will change. I hope that the Democrats will join us in making the next 6 months of 2015 as productive as the first 6 months have been and that we can point to bipartisan achievements that are good for the American people, that focus on their basic daily needs, and that will promote policies which will grow our economy and create jobs and lead to a higher standard of living and increased take-home pay for middle-income families across this country. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I would like to take a few minutes to underscore the importance of trade and trade promotion authority to the American manufacturing industry. Despite some claims to the contrary, U.S. manufacturers have been among the principal beneficiaries of our existing free-trade agreements. One in four U.S. manufacturing jobs depends on exports. On average, the wages of those in export-supported manufacturing jobs are 18 percent higher than those of other factory workers. Furthermore, since the last TPA bill passed through the Congress in 2002, [[Page S4538]] U.S. goods exports have more than doubled, reaching $1.6 trillion in 2013 alone. While we hear a constant drumbeat decrying our trade deficits, the United States enjoys a nearly $60 billion yearly manufacturing surplus with our 20 existing partners to the free-trade agreements. Consumers and businesses in those 20 countries purchased $658 billion of U.S. manufactured goods in 2013 alone, which represents nearly 48 percent of all exports produced by the 12 million Americans employed in manufacturing. Clearly, in places where we have free-trade agreements, where our manufacturers can compete on a level playing field, they are winning. We need to build on that track record of success and enact more high- standard, 21st-century free-trade agreements. That is yet another reason why we need TPA. It is no wonder, then, that our TPA bill is supported by manufacturers throughout the country. We have received letters or statements of support from groups such as the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, the Grocery Manufacturers Association, the American Forest and Paper Association, the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, the Semiconductor Industry Association, the Society of Chemical Manufacturers & Affiliates, the National Council of Textile Organizations, and many others. On top of that, a number of iconic individual manufacturing companies have weighed in publicly in support of our bill, including Boeing, Cummins, Dow Chemical, Honeywell, Intel, Texas Instruments, Xerox, and, of course, many others. Caterpillar, which is based in Peoria, IL, is the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel engines, and gas turbines. Caterpillar knows the value of trade to a healthy economy, having exported nearly $88 billion in goods and services over the past 5 years. They know that if we pass TPA, they can do even better. Upon introduction of our bill, the company issued a statement saying, ``Passage of TPA will provide the United States with the strongest possible hand when negotiating future trade agreements and will help eliminate the current high tariffs and trade barriers that companies like Caterpillar currently face.'' It is not just big companies that benefit. Ninety-eight percent of nearly 300,000 American exporters are small and medium-sized businesses. Let me say that again. Ninety-eight percent of all U.S. exporters are small and medium-sized businesses. There are 300,000 of them. That fact escapes many people. Let me give an example of one of those small businesses from my home State of Utah. Kimber Kable is owned and operated by Ray Kimber. Ray's story is emblematic of the American dream. In the late 1970s, Ray figured out a way to weave audio cables to reduce unwanted noise and improve fidelity. The company he started in his garage over 35 years ago is now a driver of economic growth and a source of jobs. Today, he employs 30 people in Ogden, UT. He sells his cables to the world. Two- thirds of Ray's cables are shipped to customers overseas. Ray is not only a friend of mine, he is also an outstanding example of a larger truth: The U.S. manufacturing sector is the most innovative in the world, and American workers are unsurpassed in manufacturing productivity. Because of U.S. innovation and productivity, where U.S. manufacturing competes on an equal footing, it always succeeds. We can help people like Ray reach more markets and maintain healthy small businesses across America--businesses that will grow our economy and create more jobs--but we can only do that if our trade negotiators have the tools to set fair trade rules for our exporters. That is what our TPA bill provides. For example, a big part of the ability of small companies like Kimber Kable to sell around the world is digital trade. That is why the TPA bill that is again before us directs our trade negotiators to ensure that electronically delivered goods and services are classified with the most liberal trade treatment possible and that our trading partners allow the free flow of data across borders. Using the Internet to market, sell, and transmit digital products is only part of the story. Companies like Ray's are also innovators, and their innovations must be protected. Too many small businesses have experienced firsthand the destructive impact of intellectual property theft. Companies like Kimber Kable have to contend with counterfeiters stealing their company name to sell inferior products. This TPA bill, therefore, will also ensure that U.S. trade agreements reflect a standard of intellectual property rights protection similar to that found in our own U.S. law. The bill calls for an end to the theft of U.S. intellectual property by foreign governments, including piracy and the theft of trade secrets, and for the elimination of measures that require U.S. companies to locate their intellectual property abroad in return for market access. These are strong provisions that will help U.S. manufacturing compete and sell their products around the world. Companies from Caterpillar to Kimber Kable recognize the importance of trade and trade agreements to the future of American manufacturing. They recognize that 95 percent of the world's consumers live outside of the United States and that if we want to sell American-made products to these customers, we need strong agreements to break down barriers and level the playing field. We simply cannot do that without the TPA. We can do better and we must do better for American manufacturers. If we really want to support the American manufacturing industry, then we should vote today to pass this TPA legislation once and for all. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I wish to take a few minutes to talk about the importance of international trade to my home State of Utah and how Utahns will benefit from the passage of the TPA bill. Despite having a relatively small population, the State of Utah is a very significant player in international trade. In 2014 alone, Utah exported more than $12 billion in goods. That number has more than doubled over the past decade, despite the economic downturn that took place during that time. Goods exports account for more than 11 percent of Utah's GDP. More than 50,000 Utah jobs are directly tied to goods exports, as more than 3,400 Utah-based companies export goods to countries around the world. By the way, nearly 86 percent of those exporting companies are small or medium-sized businesses. These Utah exports include a number of key manufacturing exports, including primary metal products, computer and electronics products, chemicals, processed foods, and transportation equipment, just to mention a few. There are a number of Utah companies that I could single out here today. As I said, there are more than 3,400 Utah-based exporters, but let me talk about one in particular--Albion Laboratories, which is based in Clearfield, UT. Albion is a leading, global manufacturer of chelated minerals for human and plant nutritional applications. The company is incredibly innovative, owning more than 100 patents from manufacturing processes to food applications. Over the years, Albion has enjoyed strong growth in large part because of its expanded exports. Today, Albion exports to more than 100 different countries, which has allowed the company to regularly add new jobs to accommodate its increased output. As of right now, the company employs approximately 150 people. This is just one example of the many unique and innovative Utah companies that have benefited from international trade and will benefit even more from expanded access to foreign markets in the future. Now, there has been a lot of talk about the potential benefits of our pending trade agreements with countries in the Asia-Pacific region and the European Union. As of right now, more than half of Utah's exports already go [[Page S4539]] to these two markets. Therefore, I think it is safe to say that Utah- based exporters will benefit greatly from the expanded market access they will undoubtedly see if we can get both the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership over the finish line. Of course, without TPA, these two important trade agreements, which are among the largest and most ambitious agreements in our Nation's history, don't stand a chance. TPA gives our negotiators the tools they need to get the best deals possible. TPA gives Congress and our constituents a strong voice in the negotiating process, and, of course, TPA assures that once an agreement is reached, our country will be able to deliver on the deal. Utahns depend on international trade. Utah's job creators, like those throughout the country, need greater access to foreign markets in order to compete. Put simply, they are not going to get that access without TPA. So for the sake of the thousands of Utah companies that export goods around the world and the tens of thousands of Utahns whose jobs depend on those exports--and for the hundreds of thousands of companies all over this country and more--I urge my colleagues to join me one more time in supporting our TPA legislation. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (The remarks of Mr. Grassley pertaining to the introduction of S. 1648 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'') Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",package_114_266.csv,51384,51384,51452,"[congressional record volume 161, number 101 (tuesday, june 23, 2015)] [senate] [pages s4533-s4539] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] defending public safety employees' retirement act--continued the presiding officer. the senator from new hampshire is recognized. permanent internet tax freedom act ms. ayotte. mr. president, i wanted to come to the floor today to talk about internet tax freedom and to talk about ensuring that our online businesses remain competitive. first of all, i commend the house of representatives for recently passing the permanent internet tax freedom act, which would permanently extend the current ban on internet access taxes. the current tax moratorium will expire on october 1, and if we fail to renew it, it could cost taxpayers nearly $15 billion in new fees and taxes next year. in addition, as importantly, it would make internet access less affordable to hard-working families and hamper small businesses' ability to grow and create jobs using the internet because essentially it would allow all of these jurisdictions to tax the internet. so when you get on the internet, you can expect many more taxes if we do not do what the house of representatives did and extend the internet tax freedom act. in fact, i think we should make it permanent. i am a cosponsor of a senate companion bill of which i hope this senate will follow the house's lead to pass and send a permanent extension to the president's desk. unfortunately, one of the things we have heard is that some see this extension of the moratorium on internet taxation as an opportunity to attach another piece of legislation that, in fact, would burden our online businesses and would tremendously disadvantage a state like my home state of new hampshire that has made the legislative decision not to have a sales tax. we have seen this playbook before. it was called before the marketplace fairness act. of course, there is nothing fair about this act when it comes to our online businesses having to collect taxes for nearly 9,000 taxing jurisdictions. you can imagine the bureaucratic nightmare that would occur. so this so-called marketplace fairness act--i always used to like to call it the ``online sales tax act'' or the ``online sales tax collection act.'' that would be a more accurate description of that particular act. so here we are. we have a rerun of this particular bill that would have required businesses in the state of new hampshire--even though we do not have a sales tax--our online businesses to collect for all these other tax jurisdictions. again, it is not even just states that have sales taxes. in some states, it goes down to the municipal level when it comes to municipalities and local jurisdictions actually collecting a separate tax, so it would have ended up being over 9,000 taxing jurisdictions. so here you have a nice online business out there having to be the tax collector for all these different jurisdictions. you can imagine that this would really be a huge burden on these online businesses. the individuals who have been supporting this new sales tax collection scheme in this new burden on the internet--by the way, one of the reasons i am such a strong proponent of permanently extending the tax freedom and the lack of taxes on the internet, on internet access, is because we have seen not only consumers' access to the internet but the ability of businesses and the ability of us to create jobs and to see real growth on the internet. this has allowed people to start businesses from their home. it has allowed so much creativity. it has been very positive for our economy. so lo and behold in all of that there are some talking about attaching to this internet tax freedom act this incredibly burdensome collection scheme to require businesses to be out there collecting all these sales taxes throughout the nation. the latest proposal the proponents of this type of tax collection scheme have come up with is one that again creates even more issues--certainly as many if not more issues--than the prior proposal that was called the so-called marketplace fairness act. of course, we know there is nothing fair about it if you are a business having to collect all these taxes. what this rerun would do is actually create this reporting system and require businesses to purchase this software and then require states to actually have what are called certified software providers. here is what would happen: under this latest scheme, the certified software providers for these states would actually collect all the sales information for every sale--every online sale in a state--and then they would manage the collection of these taxes. well, can you imagine? so now we are going to say to businesses: yes, you have to purchase this certain software. and guess what. every sale you make is going to be held by the central government in each state. can you imagine, with all the things we have seen happen in terms of breach of privacy of individuals? we have seen cyber attacks, all these issues we are facing. we have seen it in our government with opm. we have seen it with the irs. we have seen it with private companies in data breach. now this latest scheme is, let's send all the sales information to one place, and we will have some company--i guess some private companies will stand to benefit from this--they will now collect all these taxes, and they will hold all this information. imagine how much information they would hold in each state. so that is how we are going to create this new taxing scheme. you can imagine how a state such as new hampshire would feel about that as a state that has decided not to have a sales tax--that suddenly our state has to keep all this information, has to hire some private company to do this, to collect all these taxes, and then that each of our online businesses has to purchase this software which is supposed to interface with its state government. what a massive bureaucracy, and how unfair it is in terms of state sovereignty that the federal government would impose this on a state such as new hampshire that has made a decision not to have a sales tax. this, to me, would be the opposite of what we are trying to accomplish under the permanent internet tax freedom act, which i fully support, which is about internet tax freedom, and to attach this proposal to that internet tax freedom act, which some people, i think, are scheming around here to do, which with the right hand we are going to give you internet freedom and with the left hand we are going to take that freedom away from states like mine that have chosen not to have a sales tax. and our online businesses would now have to be part of this huge bureaucratic scheme to collect taxes for other states and other localities. so i would hope my colleagues would not go down this road because i think the internet should be free. i think online businesses should be able to continue to thrive and grow. i think online businesses should not be required to collect for over 9,000 taxing jurisdictions. and certainly i think all of us should have concerns about all of the sales data being collected by some kind of third party and being held in one place just so we can collect more taxes on online businesses. in fact, what i have heard from our businesses in new hampshire previously when the so-called marketplace fairness act was on the floor of the senate--many of the businesses in new hampshire that have online sales told me then how unfair they thought this taxing scheme was, and those concerns [[page s4534]] remain, great businesses such as garnet hill in franconia, nh. russ gaitskill, who is the president and ceo of garnet hill, told me previously: ``it's going to be a nightmare.'' i heard in the past from e&r laundry and dry cleaners, a small business founded in manchester in 1921. about 70 percent of e&r's sales are now internet based. the company's president said he would not have the resources to calculate, collect, and deliver sales taxes for thousands of jurisdictions across the country. there is a great bakery, certainly, in the nashua and amherst area, frederick's pastries. anybody who has been there--i can tell you, frederick's is a great bakery. susan lozier roberts of frederick's expressed concern that this taxing scheme would create mass confusion, keeping up with all the individual tax codes. there is the fact that we are going to have to have software and have some third party hold all of the sales information for all these online businesses. that creates so many other additional burdensome issues, as well as privacy issues. travis adams with whaddy.com, based in nashua, said previously: one tax audit from another state or jurisdiction would completely crush us. because what happens under this so-called taxing scheme is now all of our online businesses can be audited in all of these taxing jurisdictions. so you can be an online business in new hampshire, and what the proponents of this new tax scheme would like to have is this opportunity that businesses in new hampshire can now be audited in all these other jurisdictions. you can imagine what kind of burdens that would create on businesses that are trying to focus every day on the bottom line and creating jobs. so i would say that as we look at this new proposal that some people behind the scenes are talking about trying to attach to the internet tax freedom act--i hope we will not go down this road. it would be bad for business, it would be bad for people's privacy, it would be a big power grab, i think, from washington to require states such as new hampshire to collect these taxes from throughout the country, and it certainly would not be positive to create more jobs through online businesses. in fact, the competitive enterprise institute said of this latest proposal, which is a cousin to the so-called marketplace fairness act: [this] new tax grab erodes healthy tax competition among states, puts consumers' information at higher risk, and ushers in a regime of taxation without representation. it's like the blackwater of tax collection, state-paid mercenaries with sales tax charts. under the marketplace fairness act businesses are threatened by the prospect of being audited and prosecuted in every state into which they sell. this issue is one i think we all should care about. i know in my home state of new hampshire, where we have chosen not to have a sales tax, it would be completely unfair for us to consider passing this proposal which is a brandnew tax grab that erodes new hampshire's competitive status of choosing not to have a sales tax. also, there is the concern we all should have about a central taxing authority holding all of this private sales information in each of the states and what could be done with that information and how will consumers' information be protected. new hampshire's residents and internet retailers cannot afford this radical federal invasion of our state. i hope my colleagues will see the importance of extending the internet tax freedom act to encourage innovation and job creation, but under no circumstances should the internet access tax moratorium be held hostage by a new and invasive sales tax that would not only undo the benefits of the tax moratorium but also burden our small businesses with becoming tax collectors for other states. that is wrong, and i hope this body will not go down that road. i certainly will be doing everything i can within my power in the senate to make sure this new sales tax collection regime does not get attached to a very positive proposal, which is the internet tax freedom act. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from indiana. mr. donnelly. mr. president, it is an honor to follow my colleague from new hampshire, who has done such an eloquent job. export-import bank i want to talk about the export-import bank. i said this during the unnecessary 2013 government shutdown, and i will say it again: most americans think congress can do something to help create jobs and strengthen our economy--even if it is simply not doing any harm. yet here we are again, willfully allowing an important tool for economic growth to expire by not taking commonsense action. on june 30, the charter for the export-import bank will expire. during its 80-plus years of existence, the bank has garnered support from every president during that span and repeatedly been renewed by congress, often without any objection. the export-import bank is not a democratic program or a republican program. it is a program to help american businesses. president reagan's words from 30 years ago still ring true: exports create and sustain jobs for millions of american workers and contribute to the growth and strength of the united states economy. the export-import bank contributes in a significant way to our nation's export sales. the gipper was right then, and he is right today. those who oppose the ex-im bank for ideological reasons may make their case in the abstract, but i have to operate in the reality, where i have heard over and over from indiana small business owners and workers about the importance of the ex-im bank. jon, the vice president of specialty hardwoods of indiana, in nappannee, told me about their small company, which has around 40 employees. they got through the financial downturn of 2008 and 2009 but suffered during that time, as all small manufacturers did, not only here in this country but worldwide. as they returned to profitability, they made a decision to try to diversify markets. up until 2008, they mostly sold their products to the recreational vehicle industry. since then, they have started to sell to cabinet companies that market to the kitchen and bath industry nationally and made a direct attempt to go after export sales. lumber product exports now account at specialty hardwoods for more than 45 percent of their current sales. jon told me: we could not have done this without the support of exim bank. i personally have helped other small companies in our industry contact exim and establish relationships with exim to market their products. it levels the playing field for smaller companies to enter this market segment of our industry. we have grown our business and survived because of exim bank and the efforts of the 40-45 people that we employ. the stories continue. mark, the vice president and co-owner of agrarian marketing corporation, told us about his company that makes feed additives and nutritional supplements for the livestock industry. they have a very large distributor in cairo, egypt, that represents nearly 30 percent of their business. for this hoosier business, nearly 30 percent of their business comes from cairo, egypt. the credit insurance they purchase through ex-im bank allows them to source this business by extending beneficial credit terms to their egyptian customer. it would not be possible if they required their customer to prepay for those orders. mark said: although we are a small business, this segment of our business is very important to us and provides excellent profitability and jobs here in indiana as well as jobs for our contract manufacturers in iowa, illinois, and ohio. all would suffer if we lost this business. bruce, the ceo and chairman of sullivan-palatek in michigan city, noted that not only are the 140 jobs at his company impacted but several hundred more at local suppliers. bruce said: in the event that the ex-im bank were to be shut down, the impact to us would be immediate. i believe we would have very much difficulty in getting any new orders. in fact, the orders that we have in house, many of them we would not be able to ship. we would have to shut them down right in the middle . . . of the order process. jon, mark, and bruce are three of many in indiana, many around the country. in my home state, the hoosier state, since 2010 the export- import bank has directly helped more than 100 companies that have exported more than $3 billion in goods and services. the ex-im bank costs zero in taxpayer dollars. in fact, it turns a profit. [[page s4535]] since 1992, the bank has returned more than $7 billion in profits to the treasury. last year, $675 million was returned to the treasury. and the default rate is 0.175 percent. that is less than one-fifth of 1 percent. that is an effort to manage it in a fiscally prudent, fiscally responsible manner. in fiscal year 2014, the ex-im bank authorized around $20.5 billion for 3,746 transactions, which contributed to $27.5 billion of u.s. exports and more than 164,000 jobs right here in the united states. these are not, for the most part, huge corporations. they are small companies that wouldn't be able to afford financing elsewhere. in 2014, 90 percent of the transactions approved by the bank were in support of small businesses. so what happens if ex-im's charter is to expire? it will be forced to shut down, unwind current obligations, and the loss of future financing could result in a significant amount of business being lost overseas. that directly affects the bottom line for many businesses, leaving them with less revenue to reinvest and less revenue to pay wages or create new jobs. it becomes difficult--if not nearly impossible--for the private sector to replace the loans, the guarantees, and the insurance provided by the ex-im bank. at a time when american companies are competing in a game that is often rigged by foreign currency manipulation, intellectual property theft, and insurmountable regulatory barriers, unilaterally eliminating our export credit agency further handcuffs u.s. job creators and allows competitors in foreign countries to pick up the business. if ex-im no longer provides financing, foreign companies and countries are still going to buy their goods and products. they need the products. but instead of buying that product from muncie, in, they will purchase it in russia or china. this is, to me, the direct opposite of what congress should be doing. it seems as if up is down and down is up in this discussion. nearly every other major country has a credit export agency. many are larger and much more aggressive than the export-import bank. unilaterally eliminating our export credit agency hurts not only the united states and handcuffs our job creators, but it also helps competitors in foreign countries to capitalize and seize that business. our global competitors, including china, brazil, and india, are investing more in export financing every single day. they are investing in their companies and in their economy. if we take this measure, we are stepping back. they are rooting for america's export-import bank to close because it means more business for them. even our neighbor canada is providing far more export financing than the united states. canada's economy is one-tenth the size of the u.s. economy, and their export-import agency already provides far more export financing than we do at the present time. the ex-im bank is a tool that helps american companies compete in the global economy. in indiana, we pride ourselves on what we call hoosier common sense. it does not get more common sense than creating more american jobs in a fiscally responsible way. that is what the export-import bank does. congress needs a dose of that hoosier common sense, which is the same as the common sense in the presiding officer's home state of ohio. we should act quickly to reauthorize the export-import bank to help our companies, to help our employees, to help workers around our country, and to help our nation. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. gardner. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mrs. ernst). without objection, it is so ordered. mr. gardner. madam president, our country stands on the brink of a great opportunity in the asia-pacific. since 2008, the united states and 11 other pacific nations, including japan and new zealand, have worked to conclude negotiations on the trans-pacific partnership. this agreement represents nearly 40 percent of the global gross domestic product, or gdp, and is the most ambitious free-trade agreement in history. by upending antiquated international tariff systems and tearing down barriers to trade, we can unleash american ingenuity and send our nation's products from main street to malaysia. much has been said about the national benefits of concluding tpp, but i want to focus on some of the particular benefits for my home state of colorado. colorado, like most states, benefits immensely from international trade, particularly with asia. according to the business roundtable, more than 265,000 colorado jobs are supported by the countries that would be affected by tpp. these trade-related jobs include the farmworker harvesting world-famous melons down in rocky ford and the meatpacker shipping american beef from greeley. they are the electrical engineer designing computer systems in boulder and the natural gas worker maintaining a rig in parachute. collectively, these everyday working americans help drive the economic and trade engine of colorado. last year, my state exported more than $8 billion worth of goods all across the world. approximately half of them, or $4 billion, went directly to tpp countries. while nations like vietnam and japan have imposed hefty tariffs on our colorado goods in the past, tpp presents an opportunity to level the playing field. american goods would flow more freely to the region and american workers stand to benefit. that is why i strongly support granting the president trade promotion authority, or tpa, and finalizing a high-standard tpp. a vote for tpa is a vote for the american worker. it is a vote for more active engagement in the world and a higher standard of living, and it is a vote to recognize that through increased trade, we can indeed deliver upon the promise of a better tomorrow. unfortunately, however, some in congress have opted for isolationism and retreat. they have sounded the alarm over supposed failure of past trade agreements and argued in favor of taking cover rather than taking charge, and they have doubled down on the false notion that trade is always bad for the american economy and the american worker. but a quick review of the facts will dispel these myths very quickly. according to the u.s. department of agriculture, national beef exports to colombia and panama have more than tripled since 2011 when we enacted free-trade agreements with these countries. national wheat exports to chile more than doubled from the enactment of our 2003 free- trade agreement through 2014, while dairy exports increased more than 20 times to that country, and our beef exports have increased more than eight times to the participant countries of the central america and dominican republic free-trade agreement. colorado businesses have played a large role in expanding overseas as well. my state witnessed a 37-percent increase in goods exported to countries with free-trade agreements between 2003 and 2013. exports to korea have increased 61 percent since the conclusion of our free-trade agreement with that nation in 2011. and nafta, which anti-trade forces frequently dismiss as the poster child for trade deals gone awry, has resulted in a 293-percent--that is right, 293 percent--increase in colorado exports to canada and mexico since 1994. beyond the numbers, though, it is important to meet with the workers and business owners who understand that freer trade helps their bottom line. just a few days ago, i traveled to eastern colorado on my annual wheat tour. it is a tradition that senator wayne allard started in the 1990s--then a u.s. representative--and one i was excited to continue in the senate. i invited my colleague from colorado senator bennet, so we could both hear the needs directly from coloradans and see the positive impacts that agreements such as tpp could have not only on eastern colorado but farmers across this country. on the tour, we had the chance to marvel at the truly incredible production level of colorado wheat growers. we are just about 2 weeks away from [[page s4536]] the height of the winter wheat harvest in colorado--a time when i have always enjoyed working at our family implement dealership in yuma--and a reminder that colorado helps feed the world. the vast majority of colorado's wheat crop is exported. in fact, in 2013, we shipped more than $235 million worth of wheat across the globe. eighty percent of the wheat we produce in colorado is exported. most of the wheat growers we met on the eastern plains aren't interested in retreating from the international marketplace. in fact, they want to expand the international marketplace. they understand that freer trade means improved opportunities to place their product. and with a high-standard tpp, colorado wheat growers could penetrate notoriously difficult markets in countries such as japan and begin to ship from thurman to tokyo and beyond. it isn't just wheat either. colorado farmers and ranchers already export millions of dollars in western slope beef, southern colorado onions, and san luis valley potatoes. in fact, according to the department of agriculture, colorado potatoes represent around 70 percent of all u.s. potato exports to mexico. that market stands to grow significantly if tpp is successfully concluded, considering that mexico is a member nation in the negotiations. there is no question that trade benefits rural america. we should be promoting palisade peaches in perth and olathe sweet corn on the streets of singapore. growing up in rural colorado, i saw the potential that our hard-working farmers and ranchers created for colorado and for colorado products abroad. their determined spirit and hard-working attitude are what keep america at the top of the global economy, and tpp will expand that promise in the asia-pacific. urban and suburban america succeed with increased trade as well. as do their rural counterparts, urban and suburban coloradans benefit from a wider selection of cheaper goods. the mechanics of free trade stretch dollars a little bit further for the teenager with a part-time summer job as well as for the family struggling to make ends meet. aside from the benefit of cheaper products, increased trade creates jobs here at home. a couple of months ago, i was fortunate enough to visit a company in boulder, co, that manufactures zip lines and other adventure equipment. this company has successfully expanded their business to europe and asia, helping people across the globe enjoy rain forest canopy tours, free falling, and more. as this business expanded overseas, they had the ability to hire more employees and boost the local economy in boulder. they doubled their colorado office and are still looking to grow. an agreement such as tpp will open further opportunities for this company in the asia-pacific and beyond, perhaps facilitating world-class bungee jumping in new zealand or advanced rock climbing in peru, and with those new opportunities come more colorado jobs. that is the essence of free trade. it encourages innovation and entrepreneurship. it connects the world while growing our workforce at home, and it presents an opportunity for colorado and our country to spread our goods and ideas across the globe. that is why i have supported free-trade agreements in the past-- agreements that have yielded significant economic and strategic benefits for our nation. that is why i supported the latest generation of trade promotion authority and look forward to supporting it again. we will continue to support it this week as it goes to the president's desk to be signed into law. that is why i urge my colleagues to continue their support for free-trade agreements, so the united states can help grasp the great opportunity that awaits us in the asia- pacific. we have held several hearings over the past couple of months in the foreign relations committee and beyond talking about the benefits of free trade. a couple of weeks ago, we were joined by experts from asia and economic leaders around this country, all of whom believe we have an important role to play in expanding trade and expanding the opportunities that the trans-pacific partnership will lead to when that agreement comes to this floor, thanks to trade promotion authority. it is an important measure that we must enact. it is an important statement of good faith that the united states truly is interested in the asia region, the asia-pacific region, making good on our efforts to truly pivot to asia to rebalance policy we all support but making good on our word that we are indeed in the region to stay. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from south dakota. republican-led senate mr. thune. madam president, last fall, republicans promised that if we were elected to the majority, we would get washington working. that wasn't a campaign slogan, that was a commitment. after 6 months of republican control, i am proud to report we are delivering on that promise. the past 6 months in the senate have been the most productive months in a long time. we passed bipartisan legislation to approve the keystone pipeline. we passed a bipartisan bill to help prevent suicides among veterans. we passed the first significant bipartisan reform of medicare in years, which will ensure that our seniors have access to physicians and that those physicians are judged by the quality rather than the quantity of the care they provide. we passed bipartisan legislation to give law enforcement new tools to fight human trafficking and provide support for trafficking victims. we passed a bipartisan bill to authorize funding for our national defense to provide for the needs of our men and women in uniform. those are just some of the highlights. every piece of legislation i mentioned passed with bipartisan support. one reason that happened is because the republican majority has been committed to ensuring that all senators, whatever the party, have the opportunity to make their voices heard. under democratic leadership, not only were members of the minority party shut out of the legislative process, but many rank-and-file democrats were as well. during all of 2014, the democratic leadership in the senate allowed just 15 amendment rollcall votes--15 votes in an entire year. that is barely more than a vote a month. by contrast, the republican-led senate has taken more than 130 amendment rollcall votes so far this year or more than 21 votes a month. that is not only more amendment rollcall votes than last year, it is more amendment rollcall votes than the senate has taken in the past 2 years combined. that is through the first 6 months of 2015. we have another 6 months to go. this week, the senate is considering what i hope is going to be our next bipartisan achievement; that is, the legislation to help expand u.s. trade with other countries and increase the opportunities that are available for american businesses and american workers. over the past few years, exports have been a bright spot in our economy, supporting an increasing number of american jobs each and every year. in 2014, exports supported 11.7 million u.s. jobs and made up 13 percent of our nation's economy. we need to continue to open markets around the globe to american goods and services, and the best way to do that is through new trade agreements. countries with which we have free and fair trade agreements purchase substantially more from us than other countries. in fact, in 2013, free-trade agreement countries purchased 12 times more goods per capita from the united states than nonfree-trade agreement countries--12 times more goods per capita. for american workers, increased trade means more opportunity and increased access to high-paying jobs. manufacturing jobs tied to exports pay, on average, 13 to 18 percent more than other jobs in our economy. unfortunately, while trade agreements have proliferated around the globe over the past several years, the united states hasn't signed a new trade agreement in 8 years. a big reason for that is the fact that trade promotion authority expired in 2007. since 1934, almost all of the u.s. free-trade agreements have been negotiated using trade promotion authority or a similar streamlined, expedited process. trade promotion authority is designed to put the united states in the [[page s4537]] strongest possible position when it comes to negotiating trade agreements. under tpa, congress sets guidelines for trade negotiations and outlines the priorities the administration must follow. in return, congress promises a simple up-or-down vote on the resulting trade agreement instead of the long amendment process that could leave the final deal looking nothing like what was initially negotiated. that simple up-or-down vote is the key. it lets our negotiating partners know that congress and trade negotiators are on the same page, which gives other countries the confidence they need to put their best offers on the table. that, in turn, allows for a successful and timely conclusion of negotiations. currently, the administration is negotiating two major trade agreements that have the potential to vastly expand the market for american goods and services in the european union and in the pacific. the trans-pacific partnership is being negotiated with a number of asia-pacific nations, including australia, japan, new zealand, singapore, and vietnam. if this agreement is done right, it could have huge benefits for american agriculture, among other industries. agriculture producers in my state of south dakota and in the presiding officer's state of iowa understand that trade promotion authority is the most effective way to secure trade agreements that will benefit our farmers and our ranchers. one pork producer in my state of south dakota contacted me to tell me that a successful tpp deal could increase u.s. pork exports to just one of the trans-pacific partnership countries by literally hundreds of millions of dollars in a year. discussions of the benefits of trade tend to focus on the economic benefits, and with good reason--it helps our economy. it creates good- paying jobs and raises the standard of living for people in this country and gives access for consumers to lower cost goods and services. but new trade agreements also have the potential to result not just in economic gains for america's farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers but in national security gains for the country. when we make trade deals with other countries, we are not just opening new markets for our goods, we are also developing and cementing alliances. trade agreements build bonds of friendship with other nations that extend not only to cooperation on economic issues but to cooperation on security issues as well. it is also important to remember that just because the united states isn't negotiating trade agreements doesn't mean other countries will not be. in fact, the united states hasn't signed a single new trade agreement over the past 8 years, but that hasn't prevented other countries from signing numerous trade agreements over the same period. if america fails to lead on trade, other nations such as china will step in to fill the void, and these nations will not have the best interests of american workers and american families in mind. the bill before us today will help pave the way for the united states to cement alliances with friendly nations through trade and will help ensure that any trade deals the united states enters into will be favorable to our economic and our national security interests. the senate passed a version of this bill last month with a bipartisan majority, and i am hopeful we will have a similarly strong bipartisan vote yet this week. republicans believe our nation's problems are best solved when members of both parties come together to find solutions for the american people. republicans' plans for our second 6 months in the majority are the same as those for the first 6 months of our majority; that is, to make sure we continue to move forward in a way that addresses the challenges that are facing our country. unfortunately, last week we saw an unfortunate return to partisanship on the part of the democrats when they blocked an appropriations bill to fund our troops. it is not that democrats have a problem with this bill; in fact, many of them voted to support the funding this bill provides when they voted in favor of the national defense authorization act last week. the authorization act is the first step in a two-step process which has to be followed by the appropriations bill that actually provides the funding. but democratic leaders and the president, even though many of them supported the defense authorization bill, are upset that government agencies such as the epa and the irs aren't receiving the democrats' preferred level of funding, so they have decided to hold appropriations bills hostage in an effort to get what they want. it is unfortunate that democrats are holding money for our troops hostage in order to get more funding for the epa and the irs. if democrats believe the funding levels in the appropriations bills are not acceptable, they will have the opportunity to offer amendments to increase the funding. but in order to do that, they have to allow us to actually proceed to consideration of these bills on the senate floor. what they are, in effect, doing now is filibustering any attempt to bring any spending bill to the floor; most recently, as i mentioned, the funding bill for our troops. the bill that funds our national security interests in this country is currently being held hostage. we can't even get it on the floor to debate it. we are not only talking about ultimately passing it, we are talking about even having a discussion on the floor of the senate about something as important as funding our troops and the important military objectives we have as a nation. yet, right now, we have a filibuster being conducted by the democrats--again, because they want to get more funding for their favorite agencies. well, that is a bad way to go about this. i am hopeful that this obstruction--which is largely driven by the democratic leadership--that most rank-and-file democrats will rethink a strategy that involves opposing every opportunity to fund our nation's priorities and to get things done for the american people. after years of stagnation in the senate under democratic leadership, i think even most democrats have enjoyed governing in a functioning senate again. we have dozens of bipartisan bills to show for the first 6 months of this year, and our record of accomplishment can continue if the democrats abandon their strategy of obstruction and continue to work with us to solve the challenges facing our nation. they can start by not objecting to proceeding to even getting a bill that funds our national security interests here on the floor of the senate so we can debate it. as i said, if they don't like the funding levels in there, we will have an open amendment process in which they will be able to offer amendments to change those funding levels. but what they are doing right now is fundamentally wrong, not even allowing consideration of an appropriations bill that funds our military and pays our troops on the floor of the united states senate. i hope that will change. i hope that the democrats will join us in making the next 6 months of 2015 as productive as the first 6 months have been and that we can point to bipartisan achievements that are good for the american people, that focus on their basic daily needs, and that will promote policies which will grow our economy and create jobs and lead to a higher standard of living and increased take-home pay for middle-income families across this country. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. hatch. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. hatch. madam president, i would like to take a few minutes to underscore the importance of trade and trade promotion authority to the american manufacturing industry. despite some claims to the contrary, u.s. manufacturers have been among the principal beneficiaries of our existing free-trade agreements. one in four u.s. manufacturing jobs depends on exports. on average, the wages of those in export-supported manufacturing jobs are 18 percent higher than those of other factory workers. furthermore, since the last tpa bill passed through the congress in 2002, [[page s4538]] u.s. goods exports have more than doubled, reaching $1.6 trillion in 2013 alone. while we hear a constant drumbeat decrying our trade deficits, the united states enjoys a nearly $60 billion yearly manufacturing surplus with our 20 existing partners to the free-trade agreements. consumers and businesses in those 20 countries purchased $658 billion of u.s. manufactured goods in 2013 alone, which represents nearly 48 percent of all exports produced by the 12 million americans employed in manufacturing. clearly, in places where we have free-trade agreements, where our manufacturers can compete on a level playing field, they are winning. we need to build on that track record of success and enact more high- standard, 21st-century free-trade agreements. that is yet another reason why we need tpa. it is no wonder, then, that our tpa bill is supported by manufacturers throughout the country. we have received letters or statements of support from groups such as the national association of manufacturers, the national electrical manufacturers association, the grocery manufacturers association, the american forest and paper association, the association of equipment manufacturers, the semiconductor industry association, the society of chemical manufacturers & affiliates, the national council of textile organizations, and many others. on top of that, a number of iconic individual manufacturing companies have weighed in publicly in support of our bill, including boeing, cummins, dow chemical, honeywell, intel, texas instruments, xerox, and, of course, many others. caterpillar, which is based in peoria, il, is the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel engines, and gas turbines. caterpillar knows the value of trade to a healthy economy, having exported nearly $88 billion in goods and services over the past 5 years. they know that if we pass tpa, they can do even better. upon introduction of our bill, the company issued a statement saying, ``passage of tpa will provide the united states with the strongest possible hand when negotiating future trade agreements and will help eliminate the current high tariffs and trade barriers that companies like caterpillar currently face.'' it is not just big companies that benefit. ninety-eight percent of nearly 300,000 american exporters are small and medium-sized businesses. let me say that again. ninety-eight percent of all u.s. exporters are small and medium-sized businesses. there are 300,000 of them. that fact escapes many people. let me give an example of one of those small businesses from my home state of utah. kimber kable is owned and operated by ray kimber. ray's story is emblematic of the american dream. in the late 1970s, ray figured out a way to weave audio cables to reduce unwanted noise and improve fidelity. the company he started in his garage over 35 years ago is now a driver of economic growth and a source of jobs. today, he employs 30 people in ogden, ut. he sells his cables to the world. two- thirds of ray's cables are shipped to customers overseas. ray is not only a friend of mine, he is also an outstanding example of a larger truth: the u.s. manufacturing sector is the most innovative in the world, and american workers are unsurpassed in manufacturing productivity. because of u.s. innovation and productivity, where u.s. manufacturing competes on an equal footing, it always succeeds. we can help people like ray reach more markets and maintain healthy small businesses across america--businesses that will grow our economy and create more jobs--but we can only do that if our trade negotiators have the tools to set fair trade rules for our exporters. that is what our tpa bill provides. for example, a big part of the ability of small companies like kimber kable to sell around the world is digital trade. that is why the tpa bill that is again before us directs our trade negotiators to ensure that electronically delivered goods and services are classified with the most liberal trade treatment possible and that our trading partners allow the free flow of data across borders. using the internet to market, sell, and transmit digital products is only part of the story. companies like ray's are also innovators, and their innovations must be protected. too many small businesses have experienced firsthand the destructive impact of intellectual property theft. companies like kimber kable have to contend with counterfeiters stealing their company name to sell inferior products. this tpa bill, therefore, will also ensure that u.s. trade agreements reflect a standard of intellectual property rights protection similar to that found in our own u.s. law. the bill calls for an end to the theft of u.s. intellectual property by foreign governments, including piracy and the theft of trade secrets, and for the elimination of measures that require u.s. companies to locate their intellectual property abroad in return for market access. these are strong provisions that will help u.s. manufacturing compete and sell their products around the world. companies from caterpillar to kimber kable recognize the importance of trade and trade agreements to the future of american manufacturing. they recognize that 95 percent of the world's consumers live outside of the united states and that if we want to sell american-made products to these customers, we need strong agreements to break down barriers and level the playing field. we simply cannot do that without the tpa. we can do better and we must do better for american manufacturers. if we really want to support the american manufacturing industry, then we should vote today to pass this tpa legislation once and for all. madam president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. hatch. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. hatch. madam president, i wish to take a few minutes to talk about the importance of international trade to my home state of utah and how utahns will benefit from the passage of the tpa bill. despite having a relatively small population, the state of utah is a very significant player in international trade. in 2014 alone, utah exported more than $12 billion in goods. that number has more than doubled over the past decade, despite the economic downturn that took place during that time. goods exports account for more than 11 percent of utah's gdp. more than 50,000 utah jobs are directly tied to goods exports, as more than 3,400 utah-based companies export goods to countries around the world. by the way, nearly 86 percent of those exporting companies are small or medium-sized businesses. these utah exports include a number of key manufacturing exports, including primary metal products, computer and electronics products, chemicals, processed foods, and transportation equipment, just to mention a few. there are a number of utah companies that i could single out here today. as i said, there are more than 3,400 utah-based exporters, but let me talk about one in particular--albion laboratories, which is based in clearfield, ut. albion is a leading, global manufacturer of chelated minerals for human and plant nutritional applications. the company is incredibly innovative, owning more than 100 patents from manufacturing processes to food applications. over the years, albion has enjoyed strong growth in large part because of its expanded exports. today, albion exports to more than 100 different countries, which has allowed the company to regularly add new jobs to accommodate its increased output. as of right now, the company employs approximately 150 people. this is just one example of the many unique and innovative utah companies that have benefited from international trade and will benefit even more from expanded access to foreign markets in the future. now, there has been a lot of talk about the potential benefits of our pending trade agreements with countries in the asia-pacific region and the european union. as of right now, more than half of utah's exports already go [[page s4539]] to these two markets. therefore, i think it is safe to say that utah- based exporters will benefit greatly from the expanded market access they will undoubtedly see if we can get both the trans-pacific partnership and the transatlantic trade and investment partnership over the finish line. of course, without tpa, these two important trade agreements, which are among the largest and most ambitious agreements in our nation's history, don't stand a chance. tpa gives our negotiators the tools they need to get the best deals possible. tpa gives congress and our constituents a strong voice in the negotiating process, and, of course, tpa assures that once an agreement is reached, our country will be able to deliver on the deal. utahns depend on international trade. utah's job creators, like those throughout the country, need greater access to foreign markets in order to compete. put simply, they are not going to get that access without tpa. so for the sake of the thousands of utah companies that export goods around the world and the tens of thousands of utahns whose jobs depend on those exports--and for the hundreds of thousands of companies all over this country and more--i urge my colleagues to join me one more time in supporting our tpa legislation. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. grassley. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. (the remarks of mr. grassley pertaining to the introduction of s. 1648 are printed in today's record under ``statements on introduced bills and joint resolutions.'') mr. grassley. madam president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. grassley. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",51384

CREC-2015-06-23-pt1-PgS4539-2,CREC-2015-06-23,114,DEFENDING PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT ACT--Continued,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4539-S4541] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEFENDING PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT ACT--Continued The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin. Jason Simcakoski Memorial Opioid Safety Act Ms. BALDWIN. Madam President, I rise not to speak about an issue that divides this Chamber but rather one that unites us; that is, the care of those who have served and sacrificed for our Nation, America's veterans. Today, I take great pride in the fact I have worked across the aisle to introduce bipartisan VA reform legislation, the Jason Simcakoski Memorial Opioid Safety Act. I am pleased to be joined in offering this legislation by my friend and colleague Senator Capito of West Virginia. This legislation is aimed at addressing the problem of overprescribing practices at the VA and providing safer and more effective pain management services to our Nation's veterans. It is named in honor of a Wisconsin veteran, U.S. Marine veteran Jason Simcakoski. On August 30, 2014, Jason tragically died at Wisconsin's Tomah Veterans Affairs Medical Center as a result of what was medically deemed mixed-drug toxicity. I call this a failure to serve someone who has faithfully served our country. At the time of his death at the VA, Jason was on 14 different prescription drugs. Yet this Marine's heartbreaking story is just one example of the overprescribing problem at the VA. After two, decade-long, wars, a large number of our servicemembers are coming home with the damage of combat, and our veterans and their families are facing the difficult challenge of physical injuries, PTSD, and other mental illnesses. Unfortunately, I believe the VA's overreliance on powerful and highly addicting opioids has resulted in getting our veterans hooked rather than getting them help. Jason's story is a tragic example of the devastation caused by addiction--addiction whose roots are, regrettably, at the VA. To me, overprescription of opioids at the VA is a root problem, and it is growing into a weed--a weed of addiction whose impact is being felt beyond the walls of VA facilities. The ripples are indeed being felt across America in the communities we work for every day in our Nation's Capital. The families whom we have a responsibility to represent--families of those who have bravely served our country--are struggling with the loss of a son or a daughter, a father or a mother, a sister or a brother to addiction whose root is planted within the VA system. It is our job to make sure they do not feel alone, and I believe we have a shared responsibility to do everything we can to pull out this weed by its roots. Jason's family is in Washington today, and I am so honored to have worked with them and others in putting these reforms together to provide the VA with the tools it needs to help prevent this type of tragedy from occurring to other veterans and their families. I what to thank the Simcakoski family and let them know I have a tremendous amount of respect for the courage they have shown in telling theirs and Jason's story and working to make a difference in the lives of other veterans and their families. Their story is one of a sacred trust we must have with our veterans and their families. It is a story of how that trust has been broken, and it is a tragic story of loss. My message to my colleagues comes from Jason's widow Heather, who has said: When I look back at the past, I want to know we made a difference. I want to believe we have leaders in our country who care. I want to inspire others to never give up because change is possible. Her words have inspired me, and it is my hope they will inspire my colleagues to join us in taking action. I hope I speak for all of us when I say there is no room for politics when it comes to ensuring that our Nation's veterans receive the timely, safe, and highest quality care that they have earned. Our legislation takes steps to give veterans and their families a stronger voice in their care by strengthening opioid prescribing guidelines and other measures. It also works to improve coordination and communication throughout the VA and puts in place stronger oversight and accountability for the quality of care we are providing our veterans. Our goal is simple: put these bipartisan reforms in place to prevent tragedies like Jason's from occurring to other veterans and their families. I wish to thank and recognize Senators Blumenthal, Brown, Hirono, Johnson, Kaine, Manchin, Markey, Moran, Murray, Sanders, and Tester for joining Senator Capito and me, signing on as original cosponsors of this bipartisan effort. I also wish to thank the many veterans service organizations and medical professionals for their invaluable support, insight, and input as we crafted this legislation. Today, I ask the rest of my colleagues to join us in working to confront the problems of overprescribing practices at the VA and to provide more safe and effective pain management services to our Nation's veterans. Let us work together to fix what has been broken and restore that sacred trust with our veterans and their families. Let us work together to give our veterans and their families a voice--a voice that is heard, respected, and recognized. Let us be inspired by that voice to take bipartisan action on solutions to prevent these problems and tragedies from ever happening again and to provide our veterans and their families with the care they have earned and the care they deserve. Madam President, I yield time to my coauthor on this bill Senator Capito. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia. Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I come here before you today, joined by [[Page S4540]] my colleague Senator Baldwin from Wisconsin--but also by colleagues from both sides of the aisle, as she mentioned--in support of legislation to provide safer and more effective pain management to our Nation's veterans. Too many of our veterans have returned from overseas duties only to fight another battle here at home. The Jason Simcakoski Memorial Opioid Safety Act takes the necessary steps to address challenges faced by our veterans. Again, I thank the Simcakoskis for their bravery and courage, as painful as it is for the family, in hopes that it will help--and it will help--the next generation of veterans who are being treated at the VA. This bill reforms the overreliance on painkillers by the VA while still ensuring that veterans receive appropriate medication. This legislation not only updates and strengthens the guidelines for opioid prescriptions, but it requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to expand the scope of research, education, delivery, and integration of alternative pain management. Chronic pain should not be something our veterans are forced to live with, and the VA must be on the cutting edge of developing effective pain management. This bill will elevate the role of patient advocates--as I am sure Jason's wife was a great patient advocate--require community meetings hosted by the VA, and establish a joint DOD-VA working group to improve coordination and communication at all levels of government. In an era where medical research and technological advancements have led to at least a 90-percent survival rate for our wounded soldiers, we must continue to focus on the battles our veterans face when they return home, including treatment of those wounds that are not evidently visible. One marine in my hometown, Andrew White, returned home to West Virginia after serving in Iraq. Andrew displayed signs of PTSD, including insomnia, nightmares, constant restlessness, and pain related to an injury. In addition to antidepressant and antianxiety pills, doctors placed Andrew on a strong antipsychotic drug and, over time, increased his dosage from 25 milligrams to 1600 milligrams--more than twice the dosage recommended to treat schizophrenia. Andrew White died in his sleep at the age of 23. Andrew is a reminder of the physical and mental side effects of the war. We must work together to provide the resources and care necessary to assist our veterans in their transition into civilian life. Expansion of the Opioid Safety Initiative and further development of the opioid therapy risk support tool will do just that. These measures will enable the VA to use the patient record database to detect those at higher risk of opioid abuse and submit information to the State prescription drug monitoring programs. We really need all hands on deck. This real-time tracking of information will enable medical professionals to better diagnose and treat patients. This legislation calls for more accountability within the VA through internal audits, reports to Congress, and increased information sharing. We cannot allow bureaucracy to get in the way of delivering quality care to veterans, and we must prioritize the efficient delivery of care. In my home State of West Virginia, the tragic effects of opioid abuse have left families devastated. I have met with other families who lost their loved ones who suffered from PTSD and traumatic brain injury, and I believe more can be done to find solutions. It is incumbent upon us in a bipartisan way, as my colleague has said, to do right by our veterans. I wish to thank Senator Baldwin. I have been at committee meeting after committee meeting with her where she has pounded the drum on the importance of this issue and how devastating it is to families across this country. I thank Senator Baldwin. Our best is not just the least we can do. It is our duty to those who have served, of whom we have asked so much, to do more than our best, and this bill does that. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate as in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Data Breach at OPM Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, earlier today the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee, of which I am a member, conducted a hearing on the data security breach at the Office of Personnel Management. I am a member of that subcommittee, and we had several witnesses, including OPM Director Archuleta. Our goal was to learn about the latest data breach that was revealed earlier this month. I think that in many ways the hearing was useful and in other ways it was inadequate. The hearing once again demonstrated that much more needs to be done to address the ongoing IT management issues which plague so many agencies but in particular OPM. As our witnesses testified, the recent breach--and really, it is breaches--at OPM was not a resource issue but a management issue. Too often--and I certainly understand that how we appropriate money is important--the excuse is we don't have enough resources. Today, in my view, it was made clear that this is much more of a management issue than a resource issue. As Director Archuleta said in her confirmation hearing as well as in today's hearing, IT security was her top priority when she entered the agency in November of 2013. But what has transpired since then has been troubling. She reminded me today that in her confirmation hearing--IT data security was her top priority when she arrived at the agency in late 2013. Ms. Archuleta highlighted the fact that in March of 2014, OPM detected a sophisticated attack targeting sensitive information. While the hackers didn't get information in that particular instance, this should have been the first alarm to go off that somebody was trying to get access to very sensitive documents. I will reiterate what I am talking about in this case. This was March of 2014. We are talking about a hack attempt that occurred last year, not the ones that are making the news today. Unfortunately, it happened again a year ago--in June of 2014--when a company that was involved in background checks for the government, U.S. Investigation Services, USIS, suffered a breach impacting as many as 26,000 Federal employee records. It happened again in August of 2014--a third time. So we have March, June, and August. In August of 2014, another company involved in background checks, KeyPoint, was breached, and this time over 48,000 records were stolen. In both of these contractor breaches, OPM was required to send out notifications to Federal employees who were affected. Clearly OPM knew about these breaches. Now we have learned that the credentials stolen in those original breaches were used to enter the OPM system and this time steal highly sensitive information. The information stolen was Social Security numbers, military records, veteran status, addresses, birth dates, job and pay history, health insurance, life insurance, pension, age, gender, race, and union status. So these three separate examples should have been the stark warning to secure this highly sensitive data. When I asked the Director today about this topic, she merely pointed to an IT modernization plan that was drafted when she entered the agency about 20 months ago. My question was: Having seen these three attempts to breach the information at OPM, what then occurred at OPM following that which was different to further and better protect information at the Office of Personnel Management? The answer was really about pointing to a plan that was developed when the Director initially arrived at OPM some 20 months ago. In addition to those three breaches, if those were not warning enough, there were two other important reports which also could have and should have suggested that better management was [[Page S4541]] needed. In November 2014, the inspector general for OPM released its annual report on Federal information security. That report found that 11 of the 47 major information systems--23 percent--at OPM lacked proper security authorization. In fact, 5 of the 11 systems were in the office of the Chief Information Officer, the person responsible for the agency's data security. This morning, Ms. Archuleta was proud to claim that the agency had been upgraded to just ``significant deficiency'' with regard to its IT system, up from ``material weakness.'' And the inspector general testified this morning that they had offered 29 recommendations in their November report, and to date only 3 of the 29 recommendations had been adopted. In addition to the inspector general report in November of 2014, in December--the following month--of 2014, the General Accounting Office, or GAO, issued a report highly critical of IT management at OPM. The report identified best practices that OPM should implement to improve IT management. The report found that ``OPM's efforts to modernize retirement processing have been plagued by IT management weaknesses''-- another indication that OPM desperately needed to address IT management, which our witnesses argue is critical to ensuring agency- wide security. So my takeaway from this morning's hearing is that all the warning signs were there. OPM was aware of the persistent issues. They knew about breaches to their contractors, and the agency knew they were a target. Yet the only evidence that OPM did anything was a plan that was written in the first 100 days of the new Director's tenure at OPM. Planning is important, but execution matters a lot more. We still need lots of answers as to what OPM did following those original breaches last year. What security plan did they put in place? Have they identified which information to secure? How did they secure these documents? Were they effective in preventing other attacks? How often did the OPM Director and the CIO, the Chief Information Officer, meet and what were their discussions? I am encouraged to know that our Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee intends to have another hearing, and this time we will have the opportunity to present it in a secured setting so that no one can indicate that they are incapable of answering the question because of security issues. I look forward to that hearing. However, I will tell my colleagues that it is discouraging to know what I now know, and it is a discouraging time for IT security and the Federal Government. I hope we can use this as a lesson for other agencies that they need to be vigilant. We face real and serious threats. Inaction by agencies put Federal workers, the American people, and, most importantly, our national security at risk. In my view, this is important. These hearings matter. The information we are garnering and attempting to garner is important for those who are employees of the Federal Government. They need to know what has transpired so they can better protect themselves. Why are they at risk because of these hacks? Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, we need to know what has transpired here. Processes need to be in place to prevent additional challenges to our information technology, because it is a matter of our national security. So for the sake of our Federal employees and their well-being but also for the sake of the American citizens and our national security, this is not an issue that we have the opportunity to avoid. Answers need to be forthcoming and decisions need to be made system-wide--not just at OPM but throughout the entire Federal Government--as we work to protect those who work for the Federal Government and as we work to protect American citizens from a national security perspective. With that, I thank the Chair for the opportunity to address the Senate. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4539-S4541] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEFENDING PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT ACT--Continued The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin. Jason Simcakoski Memorial Opioid Safety Act Ms. BALDWIN. Madam President, I rise not to speak about an issue that divides this Chamber but rather one that unites us; that is, the care of those who have served and sacrificed for our Nation, America's veterans. Today, I take great pride in the fact I have worked across the aisle to introduce bipartisan VA reform legislation, the Jason Simcakoski Memorial Opioid Safety Act. I am pleased to be joined in offering this legislation by my friend and colleague Senator Capito of West Virginia. This legislation is aimed at addressing the problem of overprescribing practices at the VA and providing safer and more effective pain management services to our Nation's veterans. It is named in honor of a Wisconsin veteran, U.S. Marine veteran Jason Simcakoski. On August 30, 2014, Jason tragically died at Wisconsin's Tomah Veterans Affairs Medical Center as a result of what was medically deemed mixed-drug toxicity. I call this a failure to serve someone who has faithfully served our country. At the time of his death at the VA, Jason was on 14 different prescription drugs. Yet this Marine's heartbreaking story is just one example of the overprescribing problem at the VA. After two, decade-long, wars, a large number of our servicemembers are coming home with the damage of combat, and our veterans and their families are facing the difficult challenge of physical injuries, PTSD, and other mental illnesses. Unfortunately, I believe the VA's overreliance on powerful and highly addicting opioids has resulted in getting our veterans hooked rather than getting them help. Jason's story is a tragic example of the devastation caused by addiction--addiction whose roots are, regrettably, at the VA. To me, overprescription of opioids at the VA is a root problem, and it is growing into a weed--a weed of addiction whose impact is being felt beyond the walls of VA facilities. The ripples are indeed being felt across America in the communities we work for every day in our Nation's Capital. The families whom we have a responsibility to represent--families of those who have bravely served our country--are struggling with the loss of a son or a daughter, a father or a mother, a sister or a brother to addiction whose root is planted within the VA system. It is our job to make sure they do not feel alone, and I believe we have a shared responsibility to do everything we can to pull out this weed by its roots. Jason's family is in Washington today, and I am so honored to have worked with them and others in putting these reforms together to provide the VA with the tools it needs to help prevent this type of tragedy from occurring to other veterans and their families. I what to thank the Simcakoski family and let them know I have a tremendous amount of respect for the courage they have shown in telling theirs and Jason's story and working to make a difference in the lives of other veterans and their families. Their story is one of a sacred trust we must have with our veterans and their families. It is a story of how that trust has been broken, and it is a tragic story of loss. My message to my colleagues comes from Jason's widow Heather, who has said: When I look back at the past, I want to know we made a difference. I want to believe we have leaders in our country who care. I want to inspire others to never give up because change is possible. Her words have inspired me, and it is my hope they will inspire my colleagues to join us in taking action. I hope I speak for all of us when I say there is no room for politics when it comes to ensuring that our Nation's veterans receive the timely, safe, and highest quality care that they have earned. Our legislation takes steps to give veterans and their families a stronger voice in their care by strengthening opioid prescribing guidelines and other measures. It also works to improve coordination and communication throughout the VA and puts in place stronger oversight and accountability for the quality of care we are providing our veterans. Our goal is simple: put these bipartisan reforms in place to prevent tragedies like Jason's from occurring to other veterans and their families. I wish to thank and recognize Senators Blumenthal, Brown, Hirono, Johnson, Kaine, Manchin, Markey, Moran, Murray, Sanders, and Tester for joining Senator Capito and me, signing on as original cosponsors of this bipartisan effort. I also wish to thank the many veterans service organizations and medical professionals for their invaluable support, insight, and input as we crafted this legislation. Today, I ask the rest of my colleagues to join us in working to confront the problems of overprescribing practices at the VA and to provide more safe and effective pain management services to our Nation's veterans. Let us work together to fix what has been broken and restore that sacred trust with our veterans and their families. Let us work together to give our veterans and their families a voice--a voice that is heard, respected, and recognized. Let us be inspired by that voice to take bipartisan action on solutions to prevent these problems and tragedies from ever happening again and to provide our veterans and their families with the care they have earned and the care they deserve. Madam President, I yield time to my coauthor on this bill Senator Capito. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia. Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I come here before you today, joined by [[Page S4540]] my colleague Senator Baldwin from Wisconsin--but also by colleagues from both sides of the aisle, as she mentioned--in support of legislation to provide safer and more effective pain management to our Nation's veterans. Too many of our veterans have returned from overseas duties only to fight another battle here at home. The Jason Simcakoski Memorial Opioid Safety Act takes the necessary steps to address challenges faced by our veterans. Again, I thank the Simcakoskis for their bravery and courage, as painful as it is for the family, in hopes that it will help--and it will help--the next generation of veterans who are being treated at the VA. This bill reforms the overreliance on painkillers by the VA while still ensuring that veterans receive appropriate medication. This legislation not only updates and strengthens the guidelines for opioid prescriptions, but it requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to expand the scope of research, education, delivery, and integration of alternative pain management. Chronic pain should not be something our veterans are forced to live with, and the VA must be on the cutting edge of developing effective pain management. This bill will elevate the role of patient advocates--as I am sure Jason's wife was a great patient advocate--require community meetings hosted by the VA, and establish a joint DOD-VA working group to improve coordination and communication at all levels of government. In an era where medical research and technological advancements have led to at least a 90-percent survival rate for our wounded soldiers, we must continue to focus on the battles our veterans face when they return home, including treatment of those wounds that are not evidently visible. One marine in my hometown, Andrew White, returned home to West Virginia after serving in Iraq. Andrew displayed signs of PTSD, including insomnia, nightmares, constant restlessness, and pain related to an injury. In addition to antidepressant and antianxiety pills, doctors placed Andrew on a strong antipsychotic drug and, over time, increased his dosage from 25 milligrams to 1600 milligrams--more than twice the dosage recommended to treat schizophrenia. Andrew White died in his sleep at the age of 23. Andrew is a reminder of the physical and mental side effects of the war. We must work together to provide the resources and care necessary to assist our veterans in their transition into civilian life. Expansion of the Opioid Safety Initiative and further development of the opioid therapy risk support tool will do just that. These measures will enable the VA to use the patient record database to detect those at higher risk of opioid abuse and submit information to the State prescription drug monitoring programs. We really need all hands on deck. This real-time tracking of information will enable medical professionals to better diagnose and treat patients. This legislation calls for more accountability within the VA through internal audits, reports to Congress, and increased information sharing. We cannot allow bureaucracy to get in the way of delivering quality care to veterans, and we must prioritize the efficient delivery of care. In my home State of West Virginia, the tragic effects of opioid abuse have left families devastated. I have met with other families who lost their loved ones who suffered from PTSD and traumatic brain injury, and I believe more can be done to find solutions. It is incumbent upon us in a bipartisan way, as my colleague has said, to do right by our veterans. I wish to thank Senator Baldwin. I have been at committee meeting after committee meeting with her where she has pounded the drum on the importance of this issue and how devastating it is to families across this country. I thank Senator Baldwin. Our best is not just the least we can do. It is our duty to those who have served, of whom we have asked so much, to do more than our best, and this bill does that. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. MORAN.

Mr. President, earlier today the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee, of which I am a member, conducted a hearing on the data security breach at the Office of Personnel Management. I am a member of that subcommittee, and we had several witnesses, including OPM Director Archuleta. Our goal was to learn about the latest data breach that was revealed earlier this month. I think that in many ways the hearing was useful and in other ways it was inadequate.

Ms. Archuleta highlighted the fact that in March of 2014, OPM detected a sophisticated attack targeting sensitive information. While the hackers didn't get information in that particular instance, this should have been the first alarm to go off that somebody was trying to get access to very sensitive documents. I will reiterate what I am talking about in this case. This was March of 2014. We are talking about a hack attempt that occurred last year, not the ones that are making the news today. Unfortunately, it happened again a year ago--in June of 2014--when a company that was involved in background checks for the government, U.S. Investigation Services, USIS, suffered a breach impacting as many as 26,000 Federal employee records. It happened again in August of 2014--a third time. So we have March, June, and August. In August of 2014, another company involved in background checks, KeyPoint, was breached, and this time over 48,000 records were stolen. In both of these contractor breaches, OPM was required to send out notifications to Federal employees who were affected. Clearly OPM knew about these breaches. Now we have learned that the credentials stolen in those original breaches were used to enter the OPM system and this time steal highly sensitive information. The information stolen was Social Security numbers, military records, veteran status, addresses, birth dates, job and pay history, health insurance, life insurance, pension, age, gender, race, and union status. So these three separate examples should have been the stark warning to secure this highly sensitive data. When I asked the Director today about this topic, she merely pointed to an IT modernization plan that was drafted when she entered the agency about 20 months ago. My question was: Having seen these three attempts to breach the information at OPM, what then occurred at OPM following that which was different to further and better protect information at the Office of Personnel Management? The answer was really about pointing to a plan that was developed when the Director initially arrived at OPM some 20 months ago. In addition to those three breaches, if those were not warning enough, there were two other important reports which also could have and should have suggested that better management was [[Page S4541]] needed. In November 2014, the inspector general for OPM released its annual report on Federal information security. That report found that 11 of the 47 major information systems--23 percent--at OPM lacked proper security authorization. In fact, 5 of the 11 systems were in the office of the Chief Information Officer, the person responsible for the agency's data security. This morning, Ms. Archuleta was proud to claim that the agency had been upgraded to just ``significant deficiency'' with regard to its IT system, up from ``material weakness.'' And the inspector general testified this morning that they had offered 29 recommendations in their November report, and to date only 3 of the 29 recommendations had been adopted. In addition to the inspector general report in November of 2014, in December--the following month--of 2014, the General Accounting Office, or GAO, issued a report highly critical of IT management at OPM. The report identified best practices that OPM should implement to improve IT management. The report found that ``OPM's efforts to modernize retirement processing have been plagued by IT management weaknesses''-- another indication that OPM desperately needed to address IT management, which our witnesses argue is critical to ensuring agency- wide security. So my takeaway from this morning's hearing is that all the warning signs were there. OPM was aware of the persistent issues. They knew about breaches to their contractors, and the agency knew they were a target. Yet the only evidence that OPM did anything was a plan that was written in the first 100 days of the new Director's tenure at OPM. Planning is important, but execution matters a lot more. We still need lots of answers as to what OPM did following those original breaches last year. What security plan did they put in place? Have they identified which information to secure? How did they secure these documents? Were they effective in preventing other attacks? How often did the OPM Director and the CIO, the Chief Information Officer, meet and what were their discussions? I am encouraged to know that our Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee intends to have another hearing, and this time we will have the opportunity to present it in a secured setting so that no one can indicate that they are incapable of answering the question because of security issues. I look forward to that hearing. However, I will tell my colleagues that it is discouraging to know what I now know, and it is a discouraging time for IT security and the Federal Government. I hope we can use this as a lesson for other agencies that they need to be vigilant. We face real and serious threats. Inaction by agencies put Federal workers, the American people, and, most importantly, our national security at risk. In my view, this is important. These hearings matter. The information we are garnering and attempting to garner is important for those who are employees of the Federal Government. They need to know what has transpired so they can better protect themselves. Why are they at risk because of these hacks? Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, we need to know what has transpired here. Processes need to be in place to prevent additional challenges to our information technology, because it is a matter of our national security. So for the sake of our Federal employees and their well-being but also for the sake of the American citizens and our national security, this is not an issue that we have the opportunity to avoid. Answers need to be forthcoming and decisions need to be made system-wide--not just at OPM but throughout the entire Federal Government--as we work to protect those who work for the Federal Government and as we work to protect American citizens from a national security perspective. With that, I thank the Chair for the opportunity to address the Senate. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",package_114_266.csv,18233,18233,18301,"[congressional record volume 161, number 101 (tuesday, june 23, 2015)] [senate] [pages s4539-s4541] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] defending public safety employees' retirement act--continued the presiding officer. the senator from wisconsin. jason simcakoski memorial opioid safety act ms. baldwin. madam president, i rise not to speak about an issue that divides this chamber but rather one that unites us; that is, the care of those who have served and sacrificed for our nation, america's veterans. today, i take great pride in the fact i have worked across the aisle to introduce bipartisan va reform legislation, the jason simcakoski memorial opioid safety act. i am pleased to be joined in offering this legislation by my friend and colleague senator capito of west virginia. this legislation is aimed at addressing the problem of overprescribing practices at the va and providing safer and more effective pain management services to our nation's veterans. it is named in honor of a wisconsin veteran, u.s. marine veteran jason simcakoski. on august 30, 2014, jason tragically died at wisconsin's tomah veterans affairs medical center as a result of what was medically deemed mixed-drug toxicity. i call this a failure to serve someone who has faithfully served our country. at the time of his death at the va, jason was on 14 different prescription drugs. yet this marine's heartbreaking story is just one example of the overprescribing problem at the va. after two, decade-long, wars, a large number of our servicemembers are coming home with the damage of combat, and our veterans and their families are facing the difficult challenge of physical injuries, ptsd, and other mental illnesses. unfortunately, i believe the va's overreliance on powerful and highly addicting opioids has resulted in getting our veterans hooked rather than getting them help. jason's story is a tragic example of the devastation caused by addiction--addiction whose roots are, regrettably, at the va. to me, overprescription of opioids at the va is a root problem, and it is growing into a weed--a weed of addiction whose impact is being felt beyond the walls of va facilities. the ripples are indeed being felt across america in the communities we work for every day in our nation's capital. the families whom we have a responsibility to represent--families of those who have bravely served our country--are struggling with the loss of a son or a daughter, a father or a mother, a sister or a brother to addiction whose root is planted within the va system. it is our job to make sure they do not feel alone, and i believe we have a shared responsibility to do everything we can to pull out this weed by its roots. jason's family is in washington today, and i am so honored to have worked with them and others in putting these reforms together to provide the va with the tools it needs to help prevent this type of tragedy from occurring to other veterans and their families. i what to thank the simcakoski family and let them know i have a tremendous amount of respect for the courage they have shown in telling theirs and jason's story and working to make a difference in the lives of other veterans and their families. their story is one of a sacred trust we must have with our veterans and their families. it is a story of how that trust has been broken, and it is a tragic story of loss. my message to my colleagues comes from jason's widow heather, who has said: when i look back at the past, i want to know we made a difference. i want to believe we have leaders in our country who care. i want to inspire others to never give up because change is possible. her words have inspired me, and it is my hope they will inspire my colleagues to join us in taking action. i hope i speak for all of us when i say there is no room for politics when it comes to ensuring that our nation's veterans receive the timely, safe, and highest quality care that they have earned. our legislation takes steps to give veterans and their families a stronger voice in their care by strengthening opioid prescribing guidelines and other measures. it also works to improve coordination and communication throughout the va and puts in place stronger oversight and accountability for the quality of care we are providing our veterans. our goal is simple: put these bipartisan reforms in place to prevent tragedies like jason's from occurring to other veterans and their families. i wish to thank and recognize senators blumenthal, brown, hirono, johnson, kaine, manchin, markey, moran, murray, sanders, and tester for joining senator capito and me, signing on as original cosponsors of this bipartisan effort. i also wish to thank the many veterans service organizations and medical professionals for their invaluable support, insight, and input as we crafted this legislation. today, i ask the rest of my colleagues to join us in working to confront the problems of overprescribing practices at the va and to provide more safe and effective pain management services to our nation's veterans. let us work together to fix what has been broken and restore that sacred trust with our veterans and their families. let us work together to give our veterans and their families a voice--a voice that is heard, respected, and recognized. let us be inspired by that voice to take bipartisan action on solutions to prevent these problems and tragedies from ever happening again and to provide our veterans and their families with the care they have earned and the care they deserve. madam president, i yield time to my coauthor on this bill senator capito. the presiding officer. the senator from west virginia. mrs. capito. madam president, i come here before you today, joined by [[page s4540]] my colleague senator baldwin from wisconsin--but also by colleagues from both sides of the aisle, as she mentioned--in support of legislation to provide safer and more effective pain management to our nation's veterans. too many of our veterans have returned from overseas duties only to fight another battle here at home. the jason simcakoski memorial opioid safety act takes the necessary steps to address challenges faced by our veterans. again, i thank the simcakoskis for their bravery and courage, as painful as it is for the family, in hopes that it will help--and it will help--the next generation of veterans who are being treated at the va. this bill reforms the overreliance on painkillers by the va while still ensuring that veterans receive appropriate medication. this legislation not only updates and strengthens the guidelines for opioid prescriptions, but it requires the department of veterans affairs to expand the scope of research, education, delivery, and integration of alternative pain management. chronic pain should not be something our veterans are forced to live with, and the va must be on the cutting edge of developing effective pain management. this bill will elevate the role of patient advocates--as i am sure jason's wife was a great patient advocate--require community meetings hosted by the va, and establish a joint dod-va working group to improve coordination and communication at all levels of government. in an era where medical research and technological advancements have led to at least a 90-percent survival rate for our wounded soldiers, we must continue to focus on the battles our veterans face when they return home, including treatment of those wounds that are not evidently visible. one marine in my hometown, andrew white, returned home to west virginia after serving in iraq. andrew displayed signs of ptsd, including insomnia, nightmares, constant restlessness, and pain related to an injury. in addition to antidepressant and antianxiety pills, doctors placed andrew on a strong antipsychotic drug and, over time, increased his dosage from 25 milligrams to 1600 milligrams--more than twice the dosage recommended to treat schizophrenia. andrew white died in his sleep at the age of 23. andrew is a reminder of the physical and mental side effects of the war. we must work together to provide the resources and care necessary to assist our veterans in their transition into civilian life. expansion of the opioid safety initiative and further development of the opioid therapy risk support tool will do just that. these measures will enable the va to use the patient record database to detect those at higher risk of opioid abuse and submit information to the state prescription drug monitoring programs. we really need all hands on deck. this real-time tracking of information will enable medical professionals to better diagnose and treat patients. this legislation calls for more accountability within the va through internal audits, reports to congress, and increased information sharing. we cannot allow bureaucracy to get in the way of delivering quality care to veterans, and we must prioritize the efficient delivery of care. in my home state of west virginia, the tragic effects of opioid abuse have left families devastated. i have met with other families who lost their loved ones who suffered from ptsd and traumatic brain injury, and i believe more can be done to find solutions. it is incumbent upon us in a bipartisan way, as my colleague has said, to do right by our veterans. i wish to thank senator baldwin. i have been at committee meeting after committee meeting with her where she has pounded the drum on the importance of this issue and how devastating it is to families across this country. i thank senator baldwin. our best is not just the least we can do. it is our duty to those who have served, of whom we have asked so much, to do more than our best, and this bill does that. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. moran. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mr. gardner). without objection, it is so ordered. mr. moran. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to address the senate as in morning business. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. data breach at opm mr. moran. mr. president, earlier today the financial services and general government appropriations subcommittee, of which i am a member, conducted a hearing on the data security breach at the office of personnel management. i am a member of that subcommittee, and we had several witnesses, including opm director archuleta. our goal was to learn about the latest data breach that was revealed earlier this month. i think that in many ways the hearing was useful and in other ways it was inadequate. the hearing once again demonstrated that much more needs to be done to address the ongoing it management issues which plague so many agencies but in particular opm. as our witnesses testified, the recent breach--and really, it is breaches--at opm was not a resource issue but a management issue. too often--and i certainly understand that how we appropriate money is important--the excuse is we don't have enough resources. today, in my view, it was made clear that this is much more of a management issue than a resource issue. as director archuleta said in her confirmation hearing as well as in today's hearing, it security was her top priority when she entered the agency in november of 2013. but what has transpired since then has been troubling. she reminded me today that in her

Mr. President, I, as chairman of the Committee on Finance along with Ranking Member Wyden, recognize Thomas Parrott, a distinguished executive at the Social Security Administration--or, SSA. Tom is currently the Assistant Deputy Commissioner for Legislation and Congressional Affairs at SSA. He is a dedicated public servant who has served his country for more than 40 years. Tom began his career at SSA in January 1975 as a claims representative in the Midtown Manhattan district office, before being assigned to district offices in Rochester, NY, and later in Redding, CA. He returned to his hometown of Baltimore in 1980 as a policy analyst in the predecessor office of what is currently called the Office of Legislation and Congressional Affairs. Since that time, he has been in the same component office at SSA serving as the Associate Commissioner for Legislative Development and Operations, as Acting Deputy Commissioner, and in his current position as the Assistant Deputy Commissioner. Tom is a 1972 graduate of Denison University in Ohio, and he completed the Federal Executive Institute's Leadership for a Democratic Society program in 2005. He was appointed in 2008, by then-SSA Commissioner Michael Astrue, to the Senior Executive Service. As testimony to Tom's devotion to public service, prior to joining SSA, he was a VISTA volunteer and a field health inspector in western New York working with migrant farm workers in the potato and apple growing regions of the State. Sequences of staffers in the Finance Committee have had the pleasure of working with Tom on many issues relating to Social Security during his tenure at SSA. He has always been resourceful, insightful, and forthcoming. Tom will retire from the Social Security Administration on July 3, 2015. He will be sorely missed by his colleagues and his many friends on the Hill. He will leave behind the numerous individuals he has mentored and encouraged over the years and who will now carry on this work. Both Ranking Member Wyden and I feel that it is important that we in Congress recognize those who devote their working lives to improving the lives of others. Career civil servants often do their work in quiet anonymity behind the scenes providing vital service to the American people. They are rarely recognized for their many contributions. Tom Parrott is one of those people. His record of leadership at the Social Security Administration and his commitment to providing the American people with effective and compassionate service is a record of which he can be justly proud. Ranking Member Wyden and I wish Tom all the best in his retirement from Federal service and thank him for his many years of dedicated service. Tom will continue in many ways to serve people in his community, and we are all grateful for his efforts. We wish him all the very best in his future endeavors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S4541] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MORNING BUSINESS ______ TRIBUTE TO THOMAS PARROTT Mr. HATCH.

CREC-2015-06-23-pt1-PgS4541-2,CREC-2015-06-23,114,3RD ANNIVERSARY OF DACA PROGRAM,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4541-S4542] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 3RD ANNIVERSARY OF DACA PROGRAM Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I commemorate the 3-year anniversary of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, commonly referred to as DACA. This program has played a vital role in empowering the Nation's undocumented immigrant youth population. Many of these young people were brought to the United States at a young age, through no fault of their own, and know no other home or country. They are woven into the fabric of California and this country. At school, they are taught American history, culture, and values. They strive to achieve the American dream. The DACA Program enables such youth to fulfill their potential and thus to maximize their contribution to their families, communities, and this country. President Obama announced the DACA Program in June 2012 to protect [[Page S4542]] eligible young people from deportation for a 2-year period, while Congress considered comprehensive immigration reform legislation. The Senate passed the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act with a strong bipartisan majority, 68 to 32. This bill would have provided a pathway to citizenship for DACA grantees and others similarly situated. But the House failed to act, and so here we are today without comprehensive immigration reform. Although we have not yet succeeded in fixing our broken immigration system through congressional action, at least the DACA Program provides some temporary reprieve for these young immigrants so that they do not live in constant fear of deportation. The program enables them to get work authorization, and thus to seek higher education and contribute to the American economy. To qualify, an individual must have come to the United States when they were under 16 years of age and lived in the country continuously for at least 5 years. The individual must also receive an education, pass a background check, and pay an application fee. The State of California is home to over a quarter of the estimated 1.8 million young immigrants who potentially meet the criteria of the DACA Program. Of the approximately 660,000 DACA applications that have been approved since the program's inception in 2012, about 30 percent reside in California. This is more than any other State. To help those who are eligible, nonprofits, religious organizations, pro bono legal networks, and other volunteers in California and nationwide have risen to the occasion. They have helped, and continue to help, hundreds of thousands of DACA applicants to navigate the filing process. The benefits of DACA for these young individuals and for this country are undeniable. A recent report published by the University of California, Berkeley School of Law found that 66 percent of students granted DACA noted a positive change in post-graduate plans and greater hope for their future. All of the study's participants come from low- income households, with 88 percent living below 150 percent of the Federal poverty level. Many students reported that parents could not assist them with educational costs; and, in some instances, students contributed a portion of their own earnings to provide for their families. Several students had suffered the deportation of a close relative, and over a quarter had a parent or sibling with an active case in immigration court. Imagine the day-to-day stresses of being a college student: trying to excel in the classroom, paying for food and housing, and finding future employment. For these students, they must also consider additional financial, psychological, and emotional challenges because they-- despite spending their lives in this country--are undocumented. The DACA Program gives these young people a measure of stability so they can focus on their school work and professional growth and development, not on whether they or a loved one will be deported. The DACA Program allows them to do just that and look forward. The economic impacts of the 2012 DACA Program show that the United States has much to gain from enabling eligible undocumented individuals to work lawfully within our borders. According to the University of California, Los Angeles' North American Integration and Development Center ``The DACA program of 2012-2014 appears to have spurred extraordinary growth in the earnings of DACA beneficiaries. According to the results of two recent surveys, this wage growth surpassed 240 percent, a number that far exceeds the expectations in the literature.'' All around the country, this time of year is punctuated by graduation ceremonies. Parents and grandparents beam as their children and grandchildren earn their high school, college, and graduate degrees. This year, I was one of those grandparents. My granddaughter, Eileen, graduated from Stanford, my alma mater, and I was so proud to attend the ceremony. DACA recipients and their families should have that feeling too--a feeling of hope for the future, accomplishment, and growth, and they should have it without fear of deportation right around the corner. That is what this is about. So I am pleased to commemorate the 3-year anniversary of the DACA Program, and I very much hope we can renew our commitment to passing comprehensive immigration reform legislation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4541-S4542] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 3RD ANNIVERSARY OF DACA PROGRAM Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

CREC-2015-06-23-pt1-PgS4542-2,CREC-2015-06-23,114,NEFFENGER CONFIRMATION,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4542-S4543] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NEFFENGER CONFIRMATION Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, yesterday I missed Senate rollcall vote No. 217, the nomination of Peter V. Neffenger, of Ohio, to be an Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security, because of flight delay issues due to weather. Had I been here, I would have voted in favor of this nomination. I support the Senate's confirmation last night of Coast Guard VADM Peter V. Neffenger who was confirmed to be the next Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration, TSA. The TSA has been without Senate-confirmed leadership for too long. John Pistole, the previous TSA Administrator, announced on October 16, 2014, that he would be resigning in December. Since the end of 2014, the TSA Administrator position has been vacant. In January, I along with Ranking Member Nelson, and Senators Ayotte, Cantwell, and Fischer, called on President Obama to send us a qualified, experienced, and dedicated individual to serve as TSA Administrator. Unfortunately, President Obama did not nominate Admiral Neffenger until April 28, 2015, over 6 months after John Pistole informed the administration that he would be leaving. I was disappointed at the length of time it took for the President to send us a qualified nominee. Even the New York Times editorial page, normally quite deferential to the President, expressed the opinion that ``the Obama Administration has been disturbingly slow to give the TSA strong leadership at the top.'' By comparison, the Senate has very rapidly moved the Neffenger nomination, despite two separate committees being involved with his formal vetting. Since the TSA was transferred to the Department of Homeland Security, the Senate has abided by an understanding that TSA Administrator nominees would be vetted by the Commerce Committee, which has primary jurisdiction over TSA, and also by the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which oversees the Department of Homeland Security where TSA is organizationally housed. Some could [[Page S4543]] say that this protocol could lend itself to unnecessary delay. However, Admiral Neffenger received three votes in less than 3 weeks, first by the Commerce Committee on June 4, 2015, the second one on June 15, 2015, by the Homeland Security Committee, and last night when he was confirmed by a vote of 81 to 1. So the Senate has moved swiftly to confirm this important nomination, in comparison to the time the Obama administration has taken to send the Senate a qualified nominee. While I am disappointed at the length of time it took for the President to send the Senate a qualified nominee, I applaud the President's selection of Admiral Neffenger to be the next TSA Administrator. Admiral Neffenger has served ably and well for 34 years in the U.S. Coast Guard, rising through the ranks to become the Vice Commandant when the Senate confirmed him last year for that distinguished position. During an assignment to Mobile, AL, he helped to lead the multi- agency response to the 1993 Amtrak Sunset Limited train derailment into a remote waterway in the Mobile River Delta, which killed 47 people. Admiral Neffenger also has substantial experience serving right here in the Senate, having been a Coast Guard fellow and detailee for 3 years at the Senate Appropriations Committee. Admiral Neffenger also served as Deputy National Incident Commander for the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. In that role, Admiral Neffenger coordinated and led over 50,000 people from Federal, State, and local agencies, tribal representatives, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector throughout five Gulf Coast States in the clean-up and response effort. Clearly, Admiral Neffenger has the requisite background and experience to lead reforms at the TSA. Admiral Neffenger has proven himself as a leader, and the TSA is an agency in dire need of strong, capable leadership. In May, the Department of Homeland Security's Inspector General testified in the House of Representatives that, ``[u]nfortunately, although nearly 14 years have passed since TSA's inception, we remain deeply concerned about its ability to execute its important mission.'' Then, earlier this month, news broke that undercover investigators from the Inspector General's office had penetrated TSA security checkpoints while carrying illegal weapons or simulated bombs on 67 of 70 attempts. In other words, TSA failed 95 percent of the time to prevent illegal weapons or simulated bombs from being smuggled through TSA security checkpoints. This is unacceptable, and it is clear that the Inspector General is right to be concerned about TSA's ability to execute its important mission in a rapidly changing threat environment. TSA has also experienced a number of other troubling failures about which I have written to the agency. I have been concerned about the TSA's oversight of Secure Identification Display Area, SIDA, badges at the Nation's airports. In December 2014, it was revealed that a Delta ramp agent in Atlanta allegedly used his SIDA badge to bypass TSA security and facilitate an interstate gun smuggling operation via commercial aircraft. TSA's response to my letter of inquiry about its oversight of SIDA badges stated that TSA does not issue or manage SIDA badges and that this responsibility falls to airport operators--which raised even more concerns about TSA's awareness about lost SIDA badges at our Nation's airports. Another issue I have raised with TSA relates to the potential security gaps in its PreCheck initiative raised in reports by the inspector general. On January 28, 2015, the inspector general released an unclassified summary of a classified report concluding that PreCheck is a positive step towards risk-based security screening as a concept, but that TSA needs to modify its PreCheck vetting and screening processes and improve its PreCheck communication and coordination. The Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General report also stated that, ``TSA did not concur with all recommendations and all recommendations remain open.'' In response to the conclusions and recommendations, I wrote to TSA along with Ranking Member Nelson on March 25, 2015, asking a series of questions about potential security gaps in TSA PreCheck. TSA responded to this letter on April 14, 2015, but the issue of potential security gaps in PreCheck and other expedited screening initiatives must still be addressed as TSA seeks to continue these initiatives, let alone expand them. Admiral Neffenger's proven leadership throughout the course of his service in the U.S. Coast Guard will undoubtedly afford valuable perspective in his role as TSA Administrator. Admiral Neffenger understands the need for TSA to continuously evolve to meet the challenges presented by an ever-changing threat environment. Obviously, the TSA is an agency that needs a strong leader who will bring cultural change to the agency. I am hopeful that Admiral Neffenger can be a leader who can fundamentally reform the TSA. He has a heavy burden, but I believe he is capable of shouldering that burden and I pledge to work with him and my colleagues here in the Senate to see that those changes occur. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4542-S4543] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NEFFENGER CONFIRMATION Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, yesterday I missed Senate rollcall vote No. 217, the nomination of Peter V. Neffenger, of Ohio, to be an Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security, because of flight delay issues due to weather. Had I been here, I would have voted in favor of this nomination. I support the Senate's confirmation last night of Coast Guard VADM Peter V. Neffenger who was confirmed to be the next Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration, TSA. The TSA has been without Senate-confirmed leadership for too long. John Pistole, the previous TSA Administrator, announced on October 16, 2014, that he would be resigning in December. Since the end of 2014, the TSA Administrator position has been vacant. In January, I along with Ranking Member Nelson, and Senators Ayotte, Cantwell, and Fischer, called on President Obama to send us a qualified, experienced, and dedicated individual to serve as TSA Administrator. Unfortunately, President Obama did not nominate Admiral Neffenger until April 28, 2015, over 6 months after John Pistole informed the administration that he would be leaving. I was disappointed at the length of time it took for the President to send us a qualified nominee. Even the New York Times editorial page, normally quite deferential to the President, expressed the opinion that ``the Obama Administration has been disturbingly slow to give the TSA strong leadership at the top.'' By comparison, the Senate has very rapidly moved the Neffenger nomination, despite two separate committees being involved with his formal vetting. Since the TSA was transferred to the Department of Homeland Security, the Senate has abided by an understanding that TSA Administrator nominees would be vetted by the Commerce Committee, which has primary jurisdiction over TSA, and also by the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which oversees the Department of Homeland Security where TSA is organizationally housed. Some could [[Page S4543]] say that this protocol could lend itself to unnecessary delay. However, Admiral Neffenger received three votes in less than 3 weeks, first by the Commerce Committee on June 4, 2015, the second one on June 15, 2015, by the Homeland Security Committee, and last night when he was confirmed by a vote of 81 to 1. So the Senate has moved swiftly to confirm this important nomination, in comparison to the time the Obama administration has taken to send the Senate a qualified nominee. While I am disappointed at the length of time it took for the President to send the Senate a qualified nominee, I applaud the President's selection of Admiral Neffenger to be the next TSA Administrator. Admiral Neffenger has served ably and well for 34 years in the U.S. Coast Guard, rising through the ranks to become the Vice Commandant when the Senate confirmed him last year for that distinguished position. During an assignment to Mobile, AL, he helped to lead the multi- agency response to the 1993 Amtrak Sunset Limited train derailment into a remote waterway in the Mobile River Delta, which killed 47 people. Admiral Neffenger also has substantial experience serving right here in the Senate, having been a Coast Guard fellow and detailee for 3 years at the Senate Appropriations Committee. Admiral Neffenger also served as Deputy National Incident Commander for the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. In that role, Admiral Neffenger coordinated and led over 50,000 people from Federal, State, and local agencies, tribal representatives, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector throughout five Gulf Coast States in the clean-up and response effort. Clearly, Admiral Neffenger has the requisite background and experience to lead reforms at the TSA. Admiral Neffenger has proven himself as a leader, and the TSA is an agency in dire need of strong, capable leadership.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the work of 12 power linemen from nine electric cooperatives in Arkansas for their work to bring reliable electricity to citizens in Guatemala. The Arkansas linemen dedicated more than 2 weeks to completely change the lives of more than 1,390 residents in 2 villages in rural Guatemala--Jolom I'Jix and Zapotal. Through construction activities such as installation of poles, distribution transformers, household connections, and meters, these volunteers extended the electric distribution system 4 miles, connecting homes to an electric grid powered by a small hydroelectric plant. Since 2013, Electric Cooperatives of Arkansas volunteers have worked to improve the lives of Guatemalans by providing electricity. The significance of this project stretches to impact numerous aspects of daily life for these residents. Electricity is a critical element in improving the quality of life and to providing health care, education, access to clean water, and economic growth. Equipped with this newfound source of electricity, hope for a brighter future exists for subsistence farmers whose main worry is simply providing food for their family. This effort, funded by participating co-ops and supporters in Arkansas, continues the State's storied history of making an impact. By being a beacon of good for these villagers, the linemen were able to engrave a lasting impact, which will help future generations of Guatemalans.

CREC-2015-06-23-pt1-PgS4543-2,CREC-2015-06-23,114,RECOGNIZING ALAN LEVIN,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4543-S4544] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING ALAN LEVIN Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise on behalf of the Delaware Delegation to honor the exemplary service of Alan Levin, director of the Delaware Economic Development Office, upon his retirement. Alan became director in January 2009 and continued to serve with distinction in that capacity for 6 years. He assumed that position at a time when tens of thousands of Delawareans were losing their jobs, and the State's top priority was putting them back to work. Throughout this tumultuous time, he has been a tremendous leader and true advocate for the State. Alan has a lifetime of experience when it comes to knowing what it takes to make a business successful. In 1987, he took over Delaware's homegrown pharmacy chain Happy Harry's, the business his father started, and grew it to become an iconic brand with 76 stores throughout the state. Prior to taking over the family business, he worked for United States Senator Bill Roth as his executive assistant and counsel. He is a graduate of Tulane [[Page S4544]] University and Widener University Law School. When Delaware Governor Jack Markell tapped him to head the Delaware Economic Development Office, unemployment in Delaware was soaring. The State's automotive plants were shuttering, and the State's major oil refinery announced plans to idle operations. Alan got straight to work, and over the next 6 years, the Delaware Economic Development Office awarded more than $213 million in job creation grants and loans to corporations through its strategic fund, and courted big firms such as Amazon, Barclays, Capitol One, JP Morgan Chase, Kraft Foods, Purdue and Sallie Mae to expand its current operations or relocate to Delaware. Alan was also instrumental in reopening the shuttered Delaware City Oil Refinery, putting hundreds of people back to work at one of the State's most significant industrial sites. Alan has been lauded as a bold risk-taker whose experience and innovative planning has helped Delaware have the fastest job growth in the Mid-Atlantic over the last 2 years. He can also be credited with helping to level the playing field for minority, women, and veteran business owners, as well as those with disabilities. On behalf of Senator Chris Coons and Congressman John Carney, I wholeheartedly thank Alan Levin for his service to the State of Delaware. His model leadership and dedication has improved the quality of life for countless residents and businesses in our great State. We offer our sincere congratulations on a job well done, and wish him and his wife Ellen, their children Andrew, Daniel and Jason, and their granddaughter Hannah, many happy, healthy and successful years to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4543-S4544] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING ALAN LEVIN Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise on behalf of the Delaware Delegation to honor the exemplary service of Alan Levin, director of the Delaware Economic Development Office, upon his retirement. Alan became director in January 2009 and continued to serve with distinction in that capacity for 6 years. He assumed that position at a time when tens of thousands of Delawareans were losing their jobs, and the State's top priority was putting them back to work. Throughout this tumultuous time, he has been a tremendous leader and true advocate for the State. Alan has a lifetime of experience when it comes to knowing what it takes to make a business successful. In 1987, he took over Delaware's homegrown pharmacy chain Happy Harry's, the business his father started, and grew it to become an iconic brand with 76 stores throughout the state. Prior to taking over the family business, he worked for United States Senator Bill Roth as his executive assistant and counsel. He is a graduate of Tulane [[Page S4544]] University and Widener University Law School. When Delaware Governor Jack Markell tapped him to head the Delaware Economic Development Office, unemployment in Delaware was soaring. The State's automotive plants were shuttering, and the State's major oil refinery announced plans to idle operations. Alan got straight to work, and over the next 6 years, the Delaware Economic Development Office awarded more than $213 million in job creation grants and loans to corporations through its strategic fund, and courted big firms such as Amazon, Barclays, Capitol One, JP Morgan Chase, Kraft Foods, Purdue and Sallie Mae to expand its current operations or relocate to Delaware. Alan was also instrumental in reopening the shuttered Delaware City Oil Refinery, putting hundreds of people back to work at one of the State's most significant industrial sites. Alan has been lauded as a bold risk-taker whose experience and innovative planning has helped Delaware have the fastest job growth in the Mid-Atlantic over the last 2 years. He can also be credited with helping to level the playing field for minority, women, and veteran business owners, as well as those with disabilities.

CREC-2015-06-23-pt1-PgS4546-2,CREC-2015-06-23,114,Introductory Statement on S. 1648,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4546-S4547] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Gardner): S. 1648. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to create a sustainable future for rural healthcare; to the Committee on Finance. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss a bill I am introducing, the Rural Emergency Acute Care Hospital Act, or REACH Act. Since January 2010, 55 rural hospitals have closed their doors. It is even more troubling that the pace of rural hospital closures appears to be accelerating. As you can see from this chart, the number of hospital closures has increased each year over the past 5 years. These closures are creating a health care crisis for hundreds of thousands of Americans across the country. The REACH Act will create a new rural hospital model under Medicare that will enable struggling rural hospitals to keep their doors open and maintain the most critical hospital service: emergency medicine. When a rural hospital closes, the community loses the lifesaving capabilities of the emergency room. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 60 percent of trauma deaths in the United States occur in rural areas. After a traumatic event, access to an emergency room within 1 [[Page S4547]] hour can make a big difference between life and death. Take, for example, Portia Gibbs from North Carolina. At 48, Portia suffered a heart attack 75 miles from the nearest emergency room. She later died while waiting for a helicopter to arrive that would have taken her over the State line to Virginia, where the closest hospital was located. If Portia's heart attack had occurred just 1 week earlier, Portia would have been transported to a hospital in Belhaven, NC, just 30 miles away. Unfortunately, the facility in Belhaven had closed just 6 days before Portia's heart attack, citing insurmountable financial struggles. Then there is the tragic story of 18-month-old Edith Gonzalez who choked on a grape in her hometown of Center, TX. Edith's frantic parents rushed her to their local hospital, Shelby Regional Medical Center, only to discover that it had closed just weeks earlier. By the time little Edith arrived at the next closest hospital, she had passed away. While we can't say with certainty that both Edith and Portia would have survived if their local hospitals had not closed, we know the earlier people access care, the better their chances are. The term used by emergency medical practitioners is the ``golden hour.'' The golden hour is the hour following a traumatic event when lifesaving intervention--like that which can be provided in an emergency room--has the best chance of impacting survival. In other words, the longer a patient has to wait to receive emergency medical care, the lower their chances will be for survival. Rural hospital closures mean patients have to travel longer distances to access emergency medical care. Ensuring that rural communities keep their emergency care resources could make the difference between life and death. Rural hospital closures also extend beyond the loss of emergency services to include economic consequences for rural communities. Hospital closures can mean the death of a rural community. Approximately 62 million Americans live in rural areas. Rural communities play an integral role in the economic stability of this country through their invaluable contributions in food production, manufacturing, and other vital industries. In addition to supporting the medical needs of those who participate in rural industry, rural hospitals also serve as the single largest employer in a rural community. The economic impacts of closing a hospital when no other hospital is close by are devastating. If we care about the physical and economic health of rural communities, we must make a change that will reverse the trend of accumulating rural hospital closures. iVantage Analytics compiled a report for the National Rural Health Association which identified 283 additional hospitals at risk of closure based upon performance indicators that matched those of the 53 facilities that already closed. Allow me to direct the Presiding Officer's attention to this map. This map depicts the approximate locations of 53 of the 55 hospitals that have closed in the last 5 years. I would like to point out that between the printing of this chart and today, two additional rural hospitals have closed. That alone is a clear indication of the problem I am trying to convey. Now, imagine this same map depicting five times the number of hospital closures you see here. That is what is what will happen if we do not act to protect America's rural hospitals. Furthermore, the loss of those additional hospitals would not only impact local economies but would also result in a $10.6 billion loss in GDP. It must change, not only for the health of rural Americans but also for the health and stability of our economy. Payment cuts to hospitals are one contributing factor to rural hospital closures. More significant, however, is the current Medicare payment structure that supports rural hospitals. Today, the Medicare payment structure for hospitals is focused on inpatient volume. Emergency rooms act as a loss leader, and income is primary generated through inpatient stays. A RAND study published in 2013 found that the average cost of an inpatient stay is 10 times the cost of an emergency room visit. Researchers at the University of North Carolina found that many of the at-risk rural hospitals around the country have an average of two or fewer patients admitted to a hospital on any given day. These hospitals can have up to 25 inpatient beds, and if only 2 or fewer of those beds are filled every day, that is a utilization rate of 8 percent or less. Instead of letting these facilities close because they do not have the needed inpatient volume to generate enough revenue, why not let go of the underutilized inpatient services in favor of sustaining life- saving emergency care. That is what the REACH Act does. It provides a voluntary pathway for rural hospitals to eliminate their underutilized inpatient services and ensure residents have access to emergency medical care that saves lives. A key component of the bill that allows the rural emergency hospital model to function is the requirement for these facilities to have protocols in place for the timely transfer of patients who require a higher level of care or inpatient admission. The value of the rural emergency hospitals in the case of a life- threatening emergency will be their ability to administer lifesaving measures in order to stabilize a patient before they are transferred to a higher level of care. In addition to providing lifesaving emergency care, rural emergency hospitals will have the flexibility to provide a wide array of outpatient services, including observation care, skilled nursing facility care, infusion services, hemodialysis, home health, hospice, nursing home care, population health, as well as telemedicine services. This list is not all-inclusive but is just a sample of the outpatient services rural emergency hospitals could provide to their communities. The door is left open for rural emergency hospitals to design their outpatient services to match the needs of their communities. There are roughly 1,300 critical access hospitals in America, including 82 in Iowa, the second most just behind Kansas. I am not suggesting that 1,300 critical access hospitals will become rural emergency hospitals. Some hospitals may never consider giving up their inpatient beds, others may consider it in the future, but some critical access hospitals need this or something like it right now. The rural emergency hospital model, with its outpatient and emergency care services, will be good for the health of rural communities and our Nation because of the critical care it will provide when and where rural Americans need it. When there is a farm accident in the afternoon or a heart attack in the middle of the night, that emergency room can be the difference between life and death. Medicare needs a payment policy that recognizes that simple fact. I look forward to continuing to work with my cosponsor Senator Gardner, other colleagues, and stakeholders in building a sustainable future for rural health care. ______","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4546-S4547] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Gardner): S. 1648.

CREC-2015-06-23-pt1-PgS4547,CREC-2015-06-23,114,Introductory Statement on S. 1651,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4547-S4548] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mr. BROWN (for himself, Ms. Collins, Ms. Warren, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Vitter, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Reed, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Franken, Mr. Udall, and Mr. Heller): S. 1651. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to repeal the Government pension offset and windfall elimination provisions; to the Committee on Finance. Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise today to address America's retirement savings crisis. A 2013 survey conducted by the Governors of the Federal Reserve System found that roughly 31 percent of Americans have no retirement savings or access to a defined-benefit pension. In addition, 19 percent of respondents nearing retirement--those aged 55 to 64--reported having zero savings or pension to rely on in the coming years. In light of these figures it is more important than ever that Congress ensure America's seniors have access to the Social Security benefits they have earned. Yet provisions such as the Windfall Elimination Provision, WEP, and the Government Pension Offset, GPO, prevent millions of Americans--including teachers, firefighters, and police officers--from receiving their full benefits. It is time Congress repealed them. This afternoon, I, along with Senator Collins and a number of my Senate colleagues from both sides of the aisle, [[Page S4548]] introduced the Social Security Fairness Act. This bipartisan bill will repeal both the WEP and GPO provisions which Congress enacted in 1983 and 1977, respectively. In December 2014, these unfair provisions chipped away at more than 2 million Americans' Social Security benefits. That same month, in my State of Ohio, more than 200,000 Ohioans had their Social Security benefits reduced because of these provisions. Over the past 35 years, fewer and fewer workers have been given access to defined-benefit plans, and, today, only about half of the total U.S. workforce is covered by an employer-sponsored retirement plan. That is why Social Security is critical for so many. Congress should make sure that every American has access to all the Social Security benefits he or she has earned. Repealing these provisions is an important step in that direction. I ask my colleagues to join me in repealing the WEP and GPO by cosponsoring this legislation. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Social Security Fairness Act of 2015, which I am joining my colleague from Ohio in introducing today. This bill would repeal both the windfall elimination provision, WEP, and the government pension offset, GPO. We believe that these two provisions in the Social Security Act unfairly penalize certain individuals for holding jobs in public service when the time comes for them to retire. The WEP affects individuals who have worked in both the private sector and in public sector jobs for which Social Security taxes were not withheld. For such individuals, the WEP applies a special formula to calculate benefits, reducing them compared to what would otherwise be paid. The GPO affects retired public employees whose spouses are entitled to Social Security benefits. When these individuals apply for Social Security spousal or survivor benefits, the GPO applies an offset, reducing the Social Security benefit based on the amount of that individual's public pension. In some cases, the spouse will not be entitled to any spousal or survivor benefit because of the GPO. The WEP and the GPO have enormous financial implications for many of our teachers, police officers, firefighters, postal workers and other public employees. Given their important responsibilities, it is simply unfair to penalize them when it comes to their Social Security benefits. These public servants--or their spouses--have all paid taxes into the Social Security system. So have their employers. They have worked long enough to earn their Social Security benefits. Yet, because of the GPO and WEP, they are unable to receive all of the Social Security benefits to which they otherwise would be entitled. The impact of these two provisions is most acute in 15 States, including Maine, which have state retirement plans that lack a Social Security component. However, it is important to point out that the GPO and WEP affect public employees and retirees in every state, including our emergency responders, other Federal employees, and postal workers. Nationwide, more than \1/3\ of teachers and educating employees, and more than \1/5\ of other public employees, are affected by the GPO and/ or the WEP. As of 2013, one and a half million people were affected by the WEP and 615,000 people had their benefits reduced by the GPO. Many more public employees across the country stand to be harmed in the future. Moreover, at a time when we should be doing all that we can to attract qualified people to public service, this reduction in retirement benefits makes it even more difficult for our federal, state and local governments to recruit and retain the public servants who are so critical to the safety and well-being of our families. What is most troubling is that this offset is most harsh for those who can least afford the loss: lower-income women. In fact, of those affected by the GPO, more than 80 percent are women. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the GPO reduces benefits for more than 200,000 individuals by more than $3,600 a year--an amount that can make the difference between a comfortable retirement and poverty. Many Maine teachers, in particular, have talked with me about the impact of these provisions on their retirement security. They love their jobs and the children they teach, but they worry about the future and about their financial security. Roxie Brechlin of Bar Harbor, Maine, is one of many examples of the effect that the GPO and the WEP have on our teachers when they retire. Mrs. Brechlin first began paying into Social Security when she took her first summer job at age 16. After graduation, she continued to pay into Social Security for 18 more years before getting her first teaching job. Mrs. Brechlin worked as a teacher for 23 years, and for 14 of those years she worked full-time at another job during the summer, paying more and more into Social Security each year. Mr. Brechlin recently contacted my office to explain the effect that the WEP and GPO will have on his wife. Mrs. Brechlin recently retired. When she applied for Social Security benefits, the WEP applied, and her benefit was reduced by two thirds. Mr. Brechlin is more concerned about what would happen to his wife if he were to predecease her. Normally, a widow would be eligible to continue to collect 100 percent of her husband's benefit. Mrs. Brechlin, however, would not be able to collect any survivor benefit, due to the application of the GPO. Not only does this fact worry Mr. Brechlin, he also sees it as unfair. It is time for us to take action, and I urge all of my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring the Social Security Fairness Act to eliminate these two unfair provisions. ______","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4547-S4548] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mr. BROWN (for himself, Ms. Collins, Ms. Warren, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Vitter, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Reed, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Franken, Mr. Udall, and Mr. Heller): S. 1651.

CREC-2015-06-23-pt1-PgS4546,CREC-2015-06-23,114,STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4546-S4549] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Gardner): S. 1648. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to create a sustainable future for rural healthcare; to the Committee on Finance. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss a bill I am introducing, the Rural Emergency Acute Care Hospital Act, or REACH Act. Since January 2010, 55 rural hospitals have closed their doors. It is even more troubling that the pace of rural hospital closures appears to be accelerating. As you can see from this chart, the number of hospital closures has increased each year over the past 5 years. These closures are creating a health care crisis for hundreds of thousands of Americans across the country. The REACH Act will create a new rural hospital model under Medicare that will enable struggling rural hospitals to keep their doors open and maintain the most critical hospital service: emergency medicine. When a rural hospital closes, the community loses the lifesaving capabilities of the emergency room. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 60 percent of trauma deaths in the United States occur in rural areas. After a traumatic event, access to an emergency room within 1 [[Page S4547]] hour can make a big difference between life and death. Take, for example, Portia Gibbs from North Carolina. At 48, Portia suffered a heart attack 75 miles from the nearest emergency room. She later died while waiting for a helicopter to arrive that would have taken her over the State line to Virginia, where the closest hospital was located. If Portia's heart attack had occurred just 1 week earlier, Portia would have been transported to a hospital in Belhaven, NC, just 30 miles away. Unfortunately, the facility in Belhaven had closed just 6 days before Portia's heart attack, citing insurmountable financial struggles. Then there is the tragic story of 18-month-old Edith Gonzalez who choked on a grape in her hometown of Center, TX. Edith's frantic parents rushed her to their local hospital, Shelby Regional Medical Center, only to discover that it had closed just weeks earlier. By the time little Edith arrived at the next closest hospital, she had passed away. While we can't say with certainty that both Edith and Portia would have survived if their local hospitals had not closed, we know the earlier people access care, the better their chances are. The term used by emergency medical practitioners is the ``golden hour.'' The golden hour is the hour following a traumatic event when lifesaving intervention--like that which can be provided in an emergency room--has the best chance of impacting survival. In other words, the longer a patient has to wait to receive emergency medical care, the lower their chances will be for survival. Rural hospital closures mean patients have to travel longer distances to access emergency medical care. Ensuring that rural communities keep their emergency care resources could make the difference between life and death. Rural hospital closures also extend beyond the loss of emergency services to include economic consequences for rural communities. Hospital closures can mean the death of a rural community. Approximately 62 million Americans live in rural areas. Rural communities play an integral role in the economic stability of this country through their invaluable contributions in food production, manufacturing, and other vital industries. In addition to supporting the medical needs of those who participate in rural industry, rural hospitals also serve as the single largest employer in a rural community. The economic impacts of closing a hospital when no other hospital is close by are devastating. If we care about the physical and economic health of rural communities, we must make a change that will reverse the trend of accumulating rural hospital closures. iVantage Analytics compiled a report for the National Rural Health Association which identified 283 additional hospitals at risk of closure based upon performance indicators that matched those of the 53 facilities that already closed. Allow me to direct the Presiding Officer's attention to this map. This map depicts the approximate locations of 53 of the 55 hospitals that have closed in the last 5 years. I would like to point out that between the printing of this chart and today, two additional rural hospitals have closed. That alone is a clear indication of the problem I am trying to convey. Now, imagine this same map depicting five times the number of hospital closures you see here. That is what is what will happen if we do not act to protect America's rural hospitals. Furthermore, the loss of those additional hospitals would not only impact local economies but would also result in a $10.6 billion loss in GDP. It must change, not only for the health of rural Americans but also for the health and stability of our economy. Payment cuts to hospitals are one contributing factor to rural hospital closures. More significant, however, is the current Medicare payment structure that supports rural hospitals. Today, the Medicare payment structure for hospitals is focused on inpatient volume. Emergency rooms act as a loss leader, and income is primary generated through inpatient stays. A RAND study published in 2013 found that the average cost of an inpatient stay is 10 times the cost of an emergency room visit. Researchers at the University of North Carolina found that many of the at-risk rural hospitals around the country have an average of two or fewer patients admitted to a hospital on any given day. These hospitals can have up to 25 inpatient beds, and if only 2 or fewer of those beds are filled every day, that is a utilization rate of 8 percent or less. Instead of letting these facilities close because they do not have the needed inpatient volume to generate enough revenue, why not let go of the underutilized inpatient services in favor of sustaining life- saving emergency care. That is what the REACH Act does. It provides a voluntary pathway for rural hospitals to eliminate their underutilized inpatient services and ensure residents have access to emergency medical care that saves lives. A key component of the bill that allows the rural emergency hospital model to function is the requirement for these facilities to have protocols in place for the timely transfer of patients who require a higher level of care or inpatient admission. The value of the rural emergency hospitals in the case of a life- threatening emergency will be their ability to administer lifesaving measures in order to stabilize a patient before they are transferred to a higher level of care. In addition to providing lifesaving emergency care, rural emergency hospitals will have the flexibility to provide a wide array of outpatient services, including observation care, skilled nursing facility care, infusion services, hemodialysis, home health, hospice, nursing home care, population health, as well as telemedicine services. This list is not all-inclusive but is just a sample of the outpatient services rural emergency hospitals could provide to their communities. The door is left open for rural emergency hospitals to design their outpatient services to match the needs of their communities. There are roughly 1,300 critical access hospitals in America, including 82 in Iowa, the second most just behind Kansas. I am not suggesting that 1,300 critical access hospitals will become rural emergency hospitals. Some hospitals may never consider giving up their inpatient beds, others may consider it in the future, but some critical access hospitals need this or something like it right now. The rural emergency hospital model, with its outpatient and emergency care services, will be good for the health of rural communities and our Nation because of the critical care it will provide when and where rural Americans need it. When there is a farm accident in the afternoon or a heart attack in the middle of the night, that emergency room can be the difference between life and death. Medicare needs a payment policy that recognizes that simple fact. I look forward to continuing to work with my cosponsor Senator Gardner, other colleagues, and stakeholders in building a sustainable future for rural health care. ______ By Mr. BROWN (for himself, Ms. Collins, Ms. Warren, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Vitter, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Reed, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Franken, Mr. Udall, and Mr. Heller): S. 1651. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to repeal the Government pension offset and windfall elimination provisions; to the Committee on Finance. Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise today to address America's retirement savings crisis. A 2013 survey conducted by the Governors of the Federal Reserve System found that roughly 31 percent of Americans have no retirement savings or access to a defined-benefit pension. In addition, 19 percent of respondents nearing retirement--those aged 55 to 64--reported having zero savings or pension to rely on in the coming years. In light of these figures it is more important than ever that Congress ensure America's seniors have access to the Social Security benefits they have earned. Yet provisions such as the Windfall Elimination Provision, WEP, and the Government Pension Offset, GPO, prevent millions of Americans--including teachers, firefighters, and police officers--from receiving their full benefits. It is time Congress repealed them. This afternoon, I, along with Senator Collins and a number of my Senate colleagues from both sides of the aisle, [[Page S4548]] introduced the Social Security Fairness Act. This bipartisan bill will repeal both the WEP and GPO provisions which Congress enacted in 1983 and 1977, respectively. In December 2014, these unfair provisions chipped away at more than 2 million Americans' Social Security benefits. That same month, in my State of Ohio, more than 200,000 Ohioans had their Social Security benefits reduced because of these provisions. Over the past 35 years, fewer and fewer workers have been given access to defined-benefit plans, and, today, only about half of the total U.S. workforce is covered by an employer-sponsored retirement plan. That is why Social Security is critical for so many. Congress should make sure that every American has access to all the Social Security benefits he or she has earned. Repealing these provisions is an important step in that direction. I ask my colleagues to join me in repealing the WEP and GPO by cosponsoring this legislation. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Social Security Fairness Act of 2015, which I am joining my colleague from Ohio in introducing today. This bill would repeal both the windfall elimination provision, WEP, and the government pension offset, GPO. We believe that these two provisions in the Social Security Act unfairly penalize certain individuals for holding jobs in public service when the time comes for them to retire. The WEP affects individuals who have worked in both the private sector and in public sector jobs for which Social Security taxes were not withheld. For such individuals, the WEP applies a special formula to calculate benefits, reducing them compared to what would otherwise be paid. The GPO affects retired public employees whose spouses are entitled to Social Security benefits. When these individuals apply for Social Security spousal or survivor benefits, the GPO applies an offset, reducing the Social Security benefit based on the amount of that individual's public pension. In some cases, the spouse will not be entitled to any spousal or survivor benefit because of the GPO. The WEP and the GPO have enormous financial implications for many of our teachers, police officers, firefighters, postal workers and other public employees. Given their important responsibilities, it is simply unfair to penalize them when it comes to their Social Security benefits. These public servants--or their spouses--have all paid taxes into the Social Security system. So have their employers. They have worked long enough to earn their Social Security benefits. Yet, because of the GPO and WEP, they are unable to receive all of the Social Security benefits to which they otherwise would be entitled. The impact of these two provisions is most acute in 15 States, including Maine, which have state retirement plans that lack a Social Security component. However, it is important to point out that the GPO and WEP affect public employees and retirees in every state, including our emergency responders, other Federal employees, and postal workers. Nationwide, more than \1/3\ of teachers and educating employees, and more than \1/5\ of other public employees, are affected by the GPO and/ or the WEP. As of 2013, one and a half million people were affected by the WEP and 615,000 people had their benefits reduced by the GPO. Many more public employees across the country stand to be harmed in the future. Moreover, at a time when we should be doing all that we can to attract qualified people to public service, this reduction in retirement benefits makes it even more difficult for our federal, state and local governments to recruit and retain the public servants who are so critical to the safety and well-being of our families. What is most troubling is that this offset is most harsh for those who can least afford the loss: lower-income women. In fact, of those affected by the GPO, more than 80 percent are women. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the GPO reduces benefits for more than 200,000 individuals by more than $3,600 a year--an amount that can make the difference between a comfortable retirement and poverty. Many Maine teachers, in particular, have talked with me about the impact of these provisions on their retirement security. They love their jobs and the children they teach, but they worry about the future and about their financial security. Roxie Brechlin of Bar Harbor, Maine, is one of many examples of the effect that the GPO and the WEP have on our teachers when they retire. Mrs. Brechlin first began paying into Social Security when she took her first summer job at age 16. After graduation, she continued to pay into Social Security for 18 more years before getting her first teaching job. Mrs. Brechlin worked as a teacher for 23 years, and for 14 of those years she worked full-time at another job during the summer, paying more and more into Social Security each year. Mr. Brechlin recently contacted my office to explain the effect that the WEP and GPO will have on his wife. Mrs. Brechlin recently retired. When she applied for Social Security benefits, the WEP applied, and her benefit was reduced by two thirds. Mr. Brechlin is more concerned about what would happen to his wife if he were to predecease her. Normally, a widow would be eligible to continue to collect 100 percent of her husband's benefit. Mrs. Brechlin, however, would not be able to collect any survivor benefit, due to the application of the GPO. Not only does this fact worry Mr. Brechlin, he also sees it as unfair. It is time for us to take action, and I urge all of my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring the Social Security Fairness Act to eliminate these two unfair provisions. ______ By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Markey, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Leahy): S. 1654. A bill to prevent deaths occurring from drug overdoses; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Mr. REED. Mr. President, today, in an effort to decrease the rate of drug overdose deaths, I am pleased to be joined by Senators Durbin, Whitehouse, Markey, and Leahy in introducing the Overdose Prevention Act. Representative Donna Edwards is introducing this bill in the other body. Throughout the country, the death rate from drug overdoses has been rapidly climbing. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, drug overdose death rates have more than tripled since 1990, and more than 110 Americans died each day from drug overdoses in 2011. More than half of these deaths are attributable to opioids, like prescription pain relievers or heroin. Indeed, this tragic epidemic has hit particularly hard in my home state of Rhode Island, where in 2014, 239 individuals died from drug overdoses. Americans aged 25 to 64 are now more likely to die as a result of drug overdose than from injuries sustained in motor vehicle traffic crashes. While overdoses from illegal drugs persist as a major public health problem, fatal overdoses from prescribed opioid pain medications such as oxycodone account for more than 40 percent of all overdose deaths. It is clear that we must do more to stop these often preventable deaths. Fortunately, the drug naloxone, which has no side effects and no potential for abuse, is widely recognized as an important tool to help prevent drug overdose deaths. Naloxone can rapidly reverse an overdose from heroin and opioid medications if provided in a timely manner. Overdose prevention programs, including those that utilize naloxone, have been credited with saving more than 26,000 lives since 1996, according to the CDC. Opioid abuse and overdose is not an abstract threat found in far-off corners. It is a national public health crisis and it's taking place right here at home in our communities and our neighborhoods. Rhode Island is taking steps to combat this scourge and is leading the way in adopting innovative solutions. Through a ``collaborative practice agreement,'' some Rhode Island pharmacies are dispensing naloxone, along with training about its proper use, to anyone who walks in and requests the treatment, no prescription necessary. In addition, the Rhode Island State Police carry naloxone in every cruiser. The Overdose Prevention Act, which we are introducing today, would complement these efforts and take important steps towards addressing this [[Page S4549]] issue nationally and increasing access to naloxone in our communities. The legislation aims to establish a comprehensive response to this epidemic that emphasizes collaboration between state and federal officials and employs best practices from the medical community, as well as programs and treatments that have been proven effective to combat this startling national trend. This is an emergency and it requires a coordinated and comprehensive response. Specifically, the bill would authorize the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, to award funding through cooperative agreements to eligible entities--like public health agencies or community-based organizations with expertise in preventing overdose deaths. As a condition of participation, an entity would use the grant to purchase and distribute naloxone, and carry out overdose prevention activities, such as educating and training prescribers, pharmacists, and first responders on how to recognize the signs of an overdose, seek emergency medical help, and administer naloxone and other first aid. As rates of overdose deaths continue to spike, public health agencies, law enforcement, and others are struggling to keep up without clear and timely information about the epidemic. Therefore, the Overdose Prevention Act would also require HHS to take steps to improve surveillance and research of drug overdose deaths, so that public health agencies, law enforcement, and community organizations have an accurate picture of the problem. It would also establish a coordinated federal plan of action to address this epidemic. The Overdose Prevention Act seeks to bring together first responders, medical personnel, addiction treatment specialists, social service providers, and families to help save lives and get at the root of this problem. I am pleased that the Overdose Prevention Act has the support of the American Association of Poison Control Centers, the Drug Policy Alliance, the Harm Reduction Coalition, and the Trust for America's Health. I look forward to working with these and other stakeholders, as well as our cosponsors to urge the rest of our colleagues to join us in supporting this crucial legislation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4546-S4549] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Gardner): S. 1648. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to create a sustainable future for rural healthcare; to the Committee on Finance. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss a bill I am introducing, the Rural Emergency Acute Care Hospital Act, or REACH Act. Since January 2010, 55 rural hospitals have closed their doors. It is even more troubling that the pace of rural hospital closures appears to be accelerating. As you can see from this chart, the number of hospital closures has increased each year over the past 5 years. These closures are creating a health care crisis for hundreds of thousands of Americans across the country. The REACH Act will create a new rural hospital model under Medicare that will enable struggling rural hospitals to keep their doors open and maintain the most critical hospital service: emergency medicine. When a rural hospital closes, the community loses the lifesaving capabilities of the emergency room. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 60 percent of trauma deaths in the United States occur in rural areas. After a traumatic event, access to an emergency room within 1 [[Page S4547]] hour can make a big difference between life and death. Take, for example, Portia Gibbs from North Carolina. At 48, Portia suffered a heart attack 75 miles from the nearest emergency room. She later died while waiting for a helicopter to arrive that would have taken her over the State line to Virginia, where the closest hospital was located. If Portia's heart attack had occurred just 1 week earlier, Portia would have been transported to a hospital in Belhaven, NC, just 30 miles away. Unfortunately, the facility in Belhaven had closed just 6 days before Portia's heart attack, citing insurmountable financial struggles. Then there is the tragic story of 18-month-old Edith Gonzalez who choked on a grape in her hometown of Center, TX. Edith's frantic parents rushed her to their local hospital, Shelby Regional Medical Center, only to discover that it had closed just weeks earlier. By the time little Edith arrived at the next closest hospital, she had passed away. While we can't say with certainty that both Edith and Portia would have survived if their local hospitals had not closed, we know the earlier people access care, the better their chances are. The term used by emergency medical practitioners is the ``golden hour.'' The golden hour is the hour following a traumatic event when lifesaving intervention--like that which can be provided in an emergency room--has the best chance of impacting survival. In other words, the longer a patient has to wait to receive emergency medical care, the lower their chances will be for survival. Rural hospital closures mean patients have to travel longer distances to access emergency medical care. Ensuring that rural communities keep their emergency care resources could make the difference between life and death. Rural hospital closures also extend beyond the loss of emergency services to include economic consequences for rural communities. Hospital closures can mean the death of a rural community. Approximately 62 million Americans live in rural areas. Rural communities play an integral role in the economic stability of this country through their invaluable contributions in food production, manufacturing, and other vital industries. In addition to supporting the medical needs of those who participate in rural industry, rural hospitals also serve as the single largest employer in a rural community. The economic impacts of closing a hospital when no other hospital is close by are devastating. If we care about the physical and economic health of rural communities, we must make a change that will reverse the trend of accumulating rural hospital closures. iVantage Analytics compiled a report for the National Rural Health Association which identified 283 additional hospitals at risk of closure based upon performance indicators that matched those of the 53 facilities that already closed. Allow me to direct the Presiding Officer's attention to this map. This map depicts the approximate locations of 53 of the 55 hospitals that have closed in the last 5 years. I would like to point out that between the printing of this chart and today, two additional rural hospitals have closed. That alone is a clear indication of the problem I am trying to convey. Now, imagine this same map depicting five times the number of hospital closures you see here. That is what is what will happen if we do not act to protect America's rural hospitals. Furthermore, the loss of those additional hospitals would not only impact local economies but would also result in a $10.6 billion loss in GDP. It must change, not only for the health of rural Americans but also for the health and stability of our economy. Payment cuts to hospitals are one contributing factor to rural hospital closures. More significant, however, is the current Medicare payment structure that supports rural hospitals. Today, the Medicare payment structure for hospitals is focused on inpatient volume. Emergency rooms act as a loss leader, and income is primary generated through inpatient stays. A RAND study published in 2013 found that the average cost of an inpatient stay is 10 times the cost of an emergency room visit. Researchers at the University of North Carolina found that many of the at-risk rural hospitals around the country have an average of two or fewer patients admitted to a hospital on any given day. These hospitals can have up to 25 inpatient beds, and if only 2 or fewer of those beds are filled every day, that is a utilization rate of 8 percent or less. Instead of letting these facilities close because they do not have the needed inpatient volume to generate enough revenue, why not let go of the underutilized inpatient services in favor of sustaining life- saving emergency care. That is what the REACH Act does. It provides a voluntary pathway for rural hospitals to eliminate their underutilized inpatient services and ensure residents have access to emergency medical care that saves lives. A key component of the bill that allows the rural emergency hospital model to function is the requirement for these facilities to have protocols in place for the timely transfer of patients who require a higher level of care or inpatient admission. The value of the rural emergency hospitals in the case of a life- threatening emergency will be their ability to administer lifesaving measures in order to stabilize a patient before they are transferred to a higher level of care. In addition to providing lifesaving emergency care, rural emergency hospitals will have the flexibility to provide a wide array of outpatient services, including observation care, skilled nursing facility care, infusion services, hemodialysis, home health, hospice, nursing home care, population health, as well as telemedicine services. This list is not all-inclusive but is just a sample of the outpatient services rural emergency hospitals could provide to their communities. The door is left open for rural emergency hospitals to design their outpatient services to match the needs of their communities. There are roughly 1,300 critical access hospitals in America, including 82 in Iowa, the second most just behind Kansas. I am not suggesting that 1,300 critical access hospitals will become rural emergency hospitals. Some hospitals may never consider giving up their inpatient beds, others may consider it in the future, but some critical access hospitals need this or something like it right now.

While we can't say with certainty that both Edith and Portia would have survived if their local hospitals had not closed, we know the earlier people access care, the better their chances are. The term used by emergency medical practitioners is the ``golden hour.'' The golden hour is the hour following a traumatic event when lifesaving intervention--like that which can be provided in an emergency room--has the best chance of impacting survival. In other words, the longer a patient has to wait to receive emergency medical care, the lower their chances will be for survival. Rural hospital closures mean patients have to travel longer distances to access emergency medical care. Ensuring that rural communities keep their emergency care resources could make the difference between life and death. Rural hospital closures also extend beyond the loss of emergency services to include economic consequences for rural communities. Hospital closures can mean the death of a rural community. Approximately 62 million Americans live in rural areas. Rural communities play an integral role in the economic stability of this country through their invaluable contributions in food production, manufacturing, and other vital industries. In addition to supporting the medical needs of those who participate in rural industry, rural hospitals also serve as the single largest employer in a rural community. The economic impacts of closing a hospital when no other hospital is close by are devastating. If we care about the physical and economic health of rural communities, we must make a change that will reverse the trend of accumulating rural hospital closures. iVantage Analytics compiled a report for the National Rural Health Association which identified 283 additional hospitals at risk of closure based upon performance indicators that matched those of the 53 facilities that already closed. Allow me to direct the Presiding Officer's attention to this map. This map depicts the approximate locations of 53 of the 55 hospitals that have closed in the last 5 years. I would like to point out that between the printing of this chart and today, two additional rural hospitals have closed. That alone is a clear indication of the problem I am trying to convey. Now, imagine this same map depicting five times the number of hospital closures you see here. That is what is what will happen if we do not act to protect America's rural hospitals. Furthermore, the loss of those additional hospitals would not only impact local economies but would also result in a $10.6 billion loss in GDP. It must change, not only for the health of rural Americans but also for the health and stability of our economy. Payment cuts to hospitals are one contributing factor to rural hospital closures. More significant, however, is the current Medicare payment structure that supports rural hospitals. Today, the Medicare payment structure for hospitals is focused on inpatient volume. Emergency rooms act as a loss leader, and income is primary generated through inpatient stays. A RAND study published in 2013 found that the average cost of an inpatient stay is 10 times the cost of an emergency room visit. Researchers at the University of North Carolina found that many of the at-risk rural hospitals around the country have an average of two or fewer patients admitted to a hospital on any given day. These hospitals can have up to 25 inpatient beds, and if only 2 or fewer of those beds are filled every day, that is a utilization rate of 8 percent or less. Instead of letting these facilities close because they do not have the needed inpatient volume to generate enough revenue, why not let go of the underutilized inpatient services in favor of sustaining life- saving emergency care. That is what the REACH Act does. It provides a voluntary pathway for rural hospitals to eliminate their underutilized inpatient services and ensure residents have access to emergency medical care that saves lives. A key component of the bill that allows the rural emergency hospital model to function is the requirement for these facilities to have protocols in place for the timely transfer of patients who require a higher level of care or inpatient admission. The value of the rural emergency hospitals in the case of a life- threatening emergency will be their ability to administer lifesaving measures in order to stabilize a patient before they are transferred to a higher level of care. In addition to providing lifesaving emergency care, rural emergency hospitals will have the flexibility to provide a wide array of outpatient services, including observation care, skilled nursing facility care, infusion services, hemodialysis, home health, hospice, nursing home care, population health, as well as telemedicine services. This list is not all-inclusive but is just a sample of the outpatient services rural emergency hospitals could provide to their communities. The door is left open for rural emergency hospitals to design their outpatient services to match the needs of their communities. There are roughly 1,300 critical access hospitals in America, including 82 in Iowa, the second most just behind Kansas. I am not suggesting that 1,300 critical access hospitals will become rural emergency hospitals. Some hospitals may never consider giving up their inpatient beds, others may consider it in the future, but some critical access hospitals need this or something like it right now. The rural emergency hospital model, with its outpatient and emergency care services, will be good for the health of rural communities and our Nation because of the critical care it will provide when and where rural Americans need it. When there is a farm accident in the afternoon or a heart attack in the middle of the night, that emergency room can be the difference between life and death. Medicare needs a payment policy that recognizes that simple fact. I look forward to continuing to work with my cosponsor Senator Gardner, other colleagues, and stakeholders in building a sustainable future for rural health care. ______ By Mr. BROWN (for himself, Ms. Collins, Ms. Warren, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Vitter, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Reed, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Franken, Mr. Udall, and Mr. Heller): S. 1651. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to repeal the Government pension offset and windfall elimination provisions; to the Committee on Finance. Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise today to address America's retirement savings crisis. A 2013 survey conducted by the Governors of the Federal Reserve System found that roughly 31 percent of Americans have no retirement savings or access to a defined-benefit pension. In addition, 19 percent of respondents nearing retirement--those aged 55 to 64--reported having zero savings or pension to rely on in the coming years. In light of these figures it is more important than ever that Congress ensure America's seniors have access to the Social Security benefits they have earned. Yet provisions such as the Windfall Elimination Provision, WEP, and the Government Pension Offset, GPO, prevent millions of Americans--including teachers, firefighters, and police officers--from receiving their full benefits. It is time Congress repealed them. This afternoon, I, along with Senator Collins and a number of my Senate colleagues from both sides of the aisle, [[Page S4548]] introduced the Social Security Fairness Act. This bipartisan bill will repeal both the WEP and GPO provisions which Congress enacted in 1983 and 1977, respectively. In December 2014, these unfair provisions chipped away at more than 2 million Americans' Social Security benefits. That same month, in my State of Ohio, more than 200,000 Ohioans had their Social Security benefits reduced because of these provisions. Over the past 35 years, fewer and fewer workers have been given access to defined-benefit plans, and, today, only about half of the total U.S. workforce is covered by an employer-sponsored retirement plan. That is why Social Security is critical for so many. Congress should make sure that every American has access to all the Social Security benefits he or she has earned. Repealing these provisions is an important step in that direction. I ask my colleagues to join me in repealing the WEP and GPO by cosponsoring this legislation. Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Social Security Fairness Act of 2015, which I am joining my colleague from Ohio in introducing today. This bill would repeal both the windfall elimination provision, WEP, and the government pension offset, GPO. We believe that these two provisions in the Social Security Act unfairly penalize certain individuals for holding jobs in public service when the time comes for them to retire. The WEP affects individuals who have worked in both the private sector and in public sector jobs for which Social Security taxes were not withheld. For such individuals, the WEP applies a special formula to calculate benefits, reducing them compared to what would otherwise be paid. The GPO affects retired public employees whose spouses are entitled to Social Security benefits. When these individuals apply for Social Security spousal or survivor benefits, the GPO applies an offset, reducing the Social Security benefit based on the amount of that individual's public pension. In some cases, the spouse will not be entitled to any spousal or survivor benefit because of the GPO. The WEP and the GPO have enormous financial implications for many of our teachers, police officers, firefighters, postal workers and other public employees. Given their important responsibilities, it is simply unfair to penalize them when it comes to their Social Security benefits. These public servants--or their spouses--have all paid taxes into the Social Security system. So have their employers. They have worked long enough to earn their Social Security benefits. Yet, because of the GPO and WEP, they are unable to receive all of the Social Security benefits to which they otherwise would be entitled. The impact of these two provisions is most acute in 15 States, including Maine, which have state retirement plans that lack a Social Security component. However, it is important to point out that the GPO and WEP affect public employees and retirees in every state, including our emergency responders, other Federal employees, and postal workers. Nationwide, more than \1/3\ of teachers and educating employees, and more than \1/5\ of other public employees, are affected by the GPO and/ or the WEP. As of 2013, one and a half million people were affected by the WEP and 615,000 people had their benefits reduced by the GPO. Many more public employees across the country stand to be harmed in the future. Moreover, at a time when we should be doing all that we can to attract qualified people to public service, this reduction in retirement benefits makes it even more difficult for our federal, state and local governments to recruit and retain the public servants who are so critical to the safety and well-being of our families. What is most troubling is that this offset is most harsh for those who can least afford the loss: lower-income women. In fact, of those affected by the GPO, more than 80 percent are women. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the GPO reduces benefits for more than 200,000 individuals by more than $3,600 a year--an amount that can make the difference between a comfortable retirement and poverty. Many Maine teachers, in particular, have talked with me about the impact of these provisions on their retirement security. They love their jobs and the children they teach, but they worry about the future and about their financial security. Roxie Brechlin of Bar Harbor, Maine, is one of many examples of the effect that the GPO and the WEP have on our teachers when they retire. Mrs. Brechlin first began paying into Social Security when she took her first summer job at age 16. After graduation, she continued to pay into Social Security for 18 more years before getting her first teaching job. Mrs. Brechlin worked as a teacher for 23 years, and for 14 of those years she worked full-time at another job during the summer, paying more and more into Social Security each year. Mr. Brechlin recently contacted my office to explain the effect that the WEP and GPO will have on his wife. Mrs. Brechlin recently retired. When she applied for Social Security benefits, the WEP applied, and her benefit was reduced by two thirds. Mr. Brechlin is more concerned about what would happen to his wife if he were to predecease her. Normally, a widow would be eligible to continue to collect 100 percent of her husband's benefit. Mrs. Brechlin, however, would not be able to collect any survivor benefit, due to the application of the GPO. Not only does this fact worry Mr. Brechlin, he also sees it as unfair. It is time for us to take action, and I urge all of my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring the Social Security Fairness Act to eliminate these two unfair provisions. ______ By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Markey, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Leahy): S. 1654. A bill to prevent deaths occurring from drug overdoses; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Mr. REED. Mr. President, today, in an effort to decrease the rate of drug overdose deaths, I am pleased to be joined by Senators Durbin, Whitehouse, Markey, and Leahy in introducing the Overdose Prevention Act. Representative Donna Edwards is introducing this bill in the other body. Throughout the country, the death rate from drug overdoses has been rapidly climbing. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, drug overdose death rates have more than tripled since 1990, and more than 110 Americans died each day from drug overdoses in 2011. More than half of these deaths are attributable to opioids, like prescription pain relievers or heroin. Indeed, this tragic epidemic has hit particularly hard in my home state of Rhode Island, where in 2014, 239 individuals died from drug overdoses. Americans aged 25 to 64 are now more likely to die as a result of drug overdose than from injuries sustained in motor vehicle traffic crashes. While overdoses from illegal drugs persist as a major public health problem, fatal overdoses from prescribed opioid pain medications such as oxycodone account for more than 40 percent of all overdose deaths. It is clear that we must do more to stop these often preventable deaths. Fortunately, the drug naloxone, which has no side effects and no potential for abuse, is widely recognized as an important tool to help prevent drug overdose deaths. Naloxone can rapidly reverse an overdose from heroin and opioid medications if provided in a timely manner. Overdose prevention programs, including those that utilize naloxone, have been credited with saving more than 26,000 lives since 1996, according to the CDC. Opioid abuse and overdose is not an abstract threat found in far-off corners. It is a national public health crisis and it's taking place right here at home in our communities and our neighborhoods. Rhode Island is taking steps to combat this scourge and is leading the way in adopting innovative solutions. Through a ``collaborative practice agreement,'' some Rhode Island pharmacies are dispensing naloxone, along with training about its proper use, to anyone who walks in and requests the treatment, no prescription necessary. In addition, the Rhode Island State Police carry naloxone in every cruiser. The Overdose Prevention Act, which we are introducing today, would complement these efforts and take important steps towards addressing this [[Page S4549]] issue nationally and increasing access to naloxone in our communities. The legislation aims to establish a comprehensive response to this epidemic that emphasizes collaboration between state and federal officials and employs best practices from the medical community, as well as programs and treatments that have been proven effective to combat this startling national trend. This is an emergency and it requires a coordinated and comprehensive response. Specifically, the bill would authorize the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, to award funding through cooperative agreements to eligible entities--like public health agencies or community-based organizations with expertise in preventing overdose deaths. As a condition of participation, an entity would use the grant to purchase and distribute naloxone, and carry out overdose prevention activities, such as educating and training prescribers, pharmacists, and first responders on how to recognize the signs of an overdose, seek emergency medical help, and administer naloxone and other first aid. As rates of overdose deaths continue to spike, public health agencies, law enforcement, and others are struggling to keep up without clear and timely information about the epidemic. Therefore, the Overdose Prevention Act would also require HHS to take steps to improve surveillance and research of drug overdose deaths, so that public health agencies, law enforcement, and community organizations have an accurate picture of the problem. It would also establish a coordinated federal plan of action to address this epidemic. The Overdose Prevention Act seeks to bring together first responders, medical personnel, addiction treatment specialists, social service providers, and families to help save lives and get at the root of this problem. I am pleased that the Overdose Prevention Act has the support of the American Association of Poison Control Centers, the Drug Policy Alliance, the Harm Reduction Coalition, and the Trust for America's Health. I look forward to working with these and other stakeholders, as well as our cosponsors to urge the rest of our colleagues to join us in supporting this crucial legislation.

through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] statements on introduced bills and joint resolutions by mr. grassley (for himself and mr. gardner): s. 1648. a bill to amend title xviii of the social security act to create a sustainable future for rural healthcare; to the committee on finance. mr. grassley. mr. president, i come to the floor today to discuss a bill i am introducing, the rural emergency acute care hospital act, or reach act. since january 2010, 55 rural hospitals have closed their doors. it is even more troubling that the pace of rural hospital closures appears to be accelerating. as you can see from this chart, the number of hospital closures has increased each year over the past 5 years. these closures are creating a health care crisis for hundreds of thousands of americans across the country. the reach act will create a new rural hospital model under medicare that will enable struggling rural hospitals to keep their doors open and maintain the most critical hospital service: emergency medicine. when a rural hospital closes, the community loses the lifesaving capabilities of the emergency room. according to the national conference of state legislatures, 60 percent of trauma deaths in the united states occur in rural areas. after a traumatic event, access to an emergency room within 1 [[page s4547]] hour can make a big difference between life and death. take, for example, portia gibbs from north carolina. at 48, portia suffered a heart attack 75 miles from the nearest emergency room. she later died while waiting for a helicopter to arrive that would have taken her over the state line to virginia, where the closest hospital was located. if portia's heart attack had occurred just 1 week earlier, portia would have been transported to a hospital in belhaven, nc, just 30 miles away. unfortunately, the facility in belhaven had closed just 6 days before portia's heart attack, citing insurmountable financial struggles. then there is the tragic story of 18-month-old edith gonzalez who choked on a grape in her hometown of center, tx. edith's frantic parents rushed her to their local hospital, shelby regional medical center, only to discover that it had closed just weeks earlier. by the time little edith arrived at the next closest hospital, she had passed away. while we can't say with certainty that both edith and portia would have survived if their local hospitals had not closed, we know the earlier people access care, the better their chances are. the term used by emergency medical practitioners is the ``golden hour.'' the golden hour is the hour following a traumatic event when lifesaving intervention--like that which can be provided in an emergency room--has the best chance of impacting survival. in other words, the longer a patient has to wait to receive emergency medical care, the lower their chances will be for survival. rural hospital closures mean patients have to travel longer distances to access emergency medical care. ensuring that rural communities keep their emergency care resources could make the difference between life and death. rural hospital closures also extend beyond the loss of emergency services to include economic consequences for rural communities. hospital closures can mean the death of a rural community. approximately 62 million americans live in rural areas. rural

CREC-2015-06-23-pt1-PgS4548,CREC-2015-06-23,114,Introductory Statement on S. 1654,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4548-S4549] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Markey, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Leahy): S. 1654. A bill to prevent deaths occurring from drug overdoses; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Mr. REED. Mr. President, today, in an effort to decrease the rate of drug overdose deaths, I am pleased to be joined by Senators Durbin, Whitehouse, Markey, and Leahy in introducing the Overdose Prevention Act. Representative Donna Edwards is introducing this bill in the other body. Throughout the country, the death rate from drug overdoses has been rapidly climbing. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, drug overdose death rates have more than tripled since 1990, and more than 110 Americans died each day from drug overdoses in 2011. More than half of these deaths are attributable to opioids, like prescription pain relievers or heroin. Indeed, this tragic epidemic has hit particularly hard in my home state of Rhode Island, where in 2014, 239 individuals died from drug overdoses. Americans aged 25 to 64 are now more likely to die as a result of drug overdose than from injuries sustained in motor vehicle traffic crashes. While overdoses from illegal drugs persist as a major public health problem, fatal overdoses from prescribed opioid pain medications such as oxycodone account for more than 40 percent of all overdose deaths. It is clear that we must do more to stop these often preventable deaths. Fortunately, the drug naloxone, which has no side effects and no potential for abuse, is widely recognized as an important tool to help prevent drug overdose deaths. Naloxone can rapidly reverse an overdose from heroin and opioid medications if provided in a timely manner. Overdose prevention programs, including those that utilize naloxone, have been credited with saving more than 26,000 lives since 1996, according to the CDC. Opioid abuse and overdose is not an abstract threat found in far-off corners. It is a national public health crisis and it's taking place right here at home in our communities and our neighborhoods. Rhode Island is taking steps to combat this scourge and is leading the way in adopting innovative solutions. Through a ``collaborative practice agreement,'' some Rhode Island pharmacies are dispensing naloxone, along with training about its proper use, to anyone who walks in and requests the treatment, no prescription necessary. In addition, the Rhode Island State Police carry naloxone in every cruiser. The Overdose Prevention Act, which we are introducing today, would complement these efforts and take important steps towards addressing this [[Page S4549]] issue nationally and increasing access to naloxone in our communities. The legislation aims to establish a comprehensive response to this epidemic that emphasizes collaboration between state and federal officials and employs best practices from the medical community, as well as programs and treatments that have been proven effective to combat this startling national trend. This is an emergency and it requires a coordinated and comprehensive response. Specifically, the bill would authorize the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, to award funding through cooperative agreements to eligible entities--like public health agencies or community-based organizations with expertise in preventing overdose deaths. As a condition of participation, an entity would use the grant to purchase and distribute naloxone, and carry out overdose prevention activities, such as educating and training prescribers, pharmacists, and first responders on how to recognize the signs of an overdose, seek emergency medical help, and administer naloxone and other first aid. As rates of overdose deaths continue to spike, public health agencies, law enforcement, and others are struggling to keep up without clear and timely information about the epidemic. Therefore, the Overdose Prevention Act would also require HHS to take steps to improve surveillance and research of drug overdose deaths, so that public health agencies, law enforcement, and community organizations have an accurate picture of the problem. It would also establish a coordinated federal plan of action to address this epidemic. The Overdose Prevention Act seeks to bring together first responders, medical personnel, addiction treatment specialists, social service providers, and families to help save lives and get at the root of this problem.

CREC-2015-06-23-pt1-PgE941-3,CREC-2015-06-23,114,HONORING LESTER L. STROUP,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E941] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING LESTER L. STROUP ______ HON. DOUG LAMBORN of colorado in the house of representatives Tuesday, June 23, 2015 Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy of Lester L. Stroup, a veteran, a former prisoner of war and a treasured member of the Colorado Springs community. Throughout his life, Lester proudly served and sacrificed for his country, then devoted the remainder of this life to veterans' organizations in the Pikes Peak Region. Lester joined the Army in 1949, during the Second World War, and was assigned to the artillery outfit of the 2nd Infantry Division. Shortly thereafter, he was deployed in defense of the Busan Perimeter following North Korea's invasion of South Korea in 1950. Lester would be on the front lines only one month when his artillery battery was overrun and suffered a defeat. Wounded and surrounded by Chinese forces, Lester and his unit were captured on December 1, 1950. A brutal 400-mile march to the Puchkin Mining Camp initiated Lester's time as a prisoner of war, which lasted for exactly 1,000 days. While imprisoned at the Puchkin Mining Camp, Lester and 750 of his fellow American servicemen were compelled to act as their own burial detail. Every day, on the brink of starvation, these gallant soldiers went out in groups of 12 or 14 to dig shallow graves for prisoners who had died. In less than one years' time, five hundred American prisoners of war perished in this camp, also known as the Death Valley Camp. When Lester was finally released, he was denied the Purple Heart Medal for lack of medical records maintained by the Chinese forces. Lester first retired in 1969 with 20 years of service in the Army, re-enlisting in 1970 and serving a voluntary combat tour in Vietnam. After retiring for good as a First Sergeant in 1975, he dedicated his time and energy to the Rocky Mountain Chapter of the Ex-Prisoners of War, Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Retired Enlisted Association, Disabled American Veterans, and American Legion Post 5.

STROUP ______ HON. DOUG LAMBORN of colorado in the house of representatives Tuesday, June 23, 2015 Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy of Lester L. Stroup, a veteran, a former prisoner of war and a treasured member of the Colorado Springs community. Throughout his life, Lester proudly served and sacrificed for his country, then devoted the remainder of this life to veterans' organizations in the Pikes Peak Region. Lester joined the Army in 1949, during the Second World War, and was assigned to the artillery outfit of the 2nd Infantry Division. Shortly thereafter, he was deployed in defense of the Busan Perimeter following North Korea's invasion of South Korea in 1950. Lester would be on the front lines only one month when his artillery battery was overrun and suffered a defeat. Wounded and surrounded by Chinese forces, Lester and his unit were captured on December 1, 1950. A brutal 400-mile march to the Puchkin Mining Camp initiated Lester's time as a prisoner of war, which lasted for exactly 1,000 days. While imprisoned at the Puchkin Mining Camp, Lester and 750 of his fellow American servicemen were compelled to act as their own burial detail. Every day, on the brink of starvation, these gallant soldiers went out in groups of 12 or 14 to dig shallow graves for prisoners who had died. In less than one years' time, five hundred American prisoners of war perished in this camp, also known as the Death Valley Camp. When Lester was finally released, he was denied the Purple Heart Medal for lack of medical records maintained by the Chinese forces. Lester first retired in 1969 with 20 years of service in the Army, re-enlisting in 1970 and serving a voluntary combat tour in Vietnam. After retiring for good as a First Sergeant in 1975, he dedicated his time and energy to the Rocky Mountain Chapter of the Ex-Prisoners of War, Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Retired Enlisted Association, Disabled American Veterans, and American Legion Post 5. In 2006, Lester vigorously led the effort to erect a beautiful memorial that now stands in Colorado Springs in memory of our POWs. Until he passed away on August 17, 2014 at the age of 84, Lester unsparingly gave of himself to his fellow ex-prisoners of war and other veterans.

CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH of new jersey in the house of representatives Tuesday, June 23, 2015 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, the Vietnamese-American community is celebrating its 40th year in the U.S. We often think of 1975 as a time of tragedy and loss, as the Vietnam War ended with helicopters flying off the U.S. Embassy. But from tragedy has come hope and prosperity. The Vietnamese-American community has added so much to the American fabric. They are a shining example of an immigrant community, many who came here penniless refugees, who has made important contributions to the United States. The subcommittee I chair has held numerous hearings on human rights in Vietnam and we have discussed a range of concerns, from restrictions on religious freedom to the jailing and torture of dissidents. From sex and labor trafficking to the censorship of the press and Internet, the Vietnamese Government and Communist Party continues to be one of the world's worst abusers of human rights. We may want to sweep that reality under the table, paper it over by promises of security cooperation and trade deals. But that reality stares us in the face and requires us to ask whether U.S. policy really serves the people of Vietnam, people who want our liberties and freedoms as much as our trade. The U.S. Government must continue to press the Vietnamese government on truly fundamental human rights issues, not only in human rights dialogue, but in all meetings with Vietnamese officials, at the highest levels from the U.S. President on down. Sixty-six percent of the Vietnamese population is under 35, they don't remember the war, they want their lives to look like those of their Vietnamese cousins in the U.S., in Australia, and Canada. Our policies cannot only be directed at the Vietnamese elite in the Communist Party, but must focus on the people of Vietnam. They are looking for U.S. leadership; they are hungry for a U.S. policy that advances the rights and freedoms of the Vietnamese people. They understand that if the U.S. sides with the Vietnamese Government, they will only receive crumbs from the Communist Party's table. Our economic, security, and freedom interests must be linked. The Vietnamese Government needs U.S. security cooperation and economic benefits more than the U.S. needs Vietnam. We have leverage to bring about concrete changes in Vietnam. We must not give up or ignore this leverage. If human rights issues are not explicitly linked to our economic and security interests, we risk having discussions on trade and defense moving forward, while human rights conditions go backward. Trade between the U.S. and Vietnam has exponentially expanded since Vietnam was granted normal trade relations in 2000. If this expansion is to continue under the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP for short, then the American people should at least be assured that Vietnam, currently our 15th largest source of imports, is protecting basic freedoms. If the past is any indicator, Vietnam will regress from political liberalization as soon as it gains preferential trade status. In 2007, after the United States lifted its long-standing objection to Vietnam's membership in the World Trade Organization, Hanoi responded by launching the first of three waves of arrests that jailed over one hundred dissidents and introduced sweeping new laws restricting freedom of association, assembly, and the Internet. In short, Vietnam's WTO accession allowed the Communist government free license to jail, torture, and abuse. Further, when the State Department removed Vietnam from the list of Countries of Particular Concern as a gesture of goodwill in 2006, we once again saw backsliding. Despite the State Department's decision in 2006 to remove Vietnam from the list of Countries of Particular Concern as designated pursuant to the International Religious Freedom Act, Vietnam, in fact, continues to be among the worst violators of religious freedom in the world. According to the United States Commission for International Religious Freedom's 2015 Annual Report, ``The Vietnamese Government continues to control all religious activities through law and administrative oversight, restrict severely independent religious practice, and repress individuals and religious groups it views as challenging its authority . . .'' I agree with USCIRF's conclusion that Vietnam should be designated a CPC country. I met courageous religious leaders during my trips to Vietnam who were struggling for fundamental human rights in their country. Unfortunately, many of them, including Father Ly and the Most Venerable Thich Quang Do, remain wrongly detained today. There are disturbing reports that Father Ly is suffering poor [[Page E942]] health. There are over 150 prisoners of conscience in Vietnam. We should not forget them. Some have made the case that Vietnam has made progress in recent years with respect to human rights, especially in regard to joining international agreements like the United Nations Convention Against Torture. In order for there to be real progress, the Vietnamese Government needs to back up its words with actions. The Vietnamese Government can show that it is serious about respecting and protecting human rights by crafting a new religion law that rolls back some of the many constraints on religious activities, but early indications the new law will actually be more restrictive. Vietnam can lift its draconian Internet restrictions and allow for independent labor organizations. Labor protections and Internet freedom are critical economic as well as human rights issues. Despite the dismal status for human rights in Vietnam, we can exert pressure on the Vietnamese Government to cease these abuses. I have reintroduced the Vietnam Human Rights Act. The Vietnam Human Rights Act of 2015 seeks to promote the development of freedom and democracy in Vietnam by stipulating that the United States can increase its non- humanitarian assistance to Vietnam above FY2012 levels only when the President is able to certify that the Government of Vietnam has made substantial progress in establishing human rights protections. The United States should not be rewarding the Vietnamese regime with taxpayer dollars when it continues to violently repress its own people. Swift Congressional action on this bill will send a strong message that U.S. will not tolerate continuing human rights abuses in Vietnam. Its enactment will send an unmistakable message to the Government of Vietnam that human rights improvements are fundamental to better relations, critically linked to our mutual economic and security interests, and cannot be ignored or bargained away. Those intent on passing TPP should also be concerned with maximizing leverage over Vietnam, with the Vietnamese Government making true and lasting concessions on human rights, before we agree to provide them with the benefits of trade. In fact, we heard from a witness at a recent hearing I held, the Reverend Nguyen Manh Hung of the Mennonite Church of Vietnam, how a religious leader has been threatened by security forces who told him that once TPP is passed, his house of worship will be torn down. This is a message that Congress, and the American people need to hear, before we continue to debate TPP in the abstract: There should be no trade deal with Vietnam without milestones being met on human rights on a permanent and sustainable basis. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E941-E942] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES BY VIETNAMESE AUTHORITIES ______ HON.

restrict severely independent religious practice, and repress individuals and religious groups it views as challenging its authority . . .'' i agree with uscirf's conclusion that vietnam should be designated a cpc country. i met courageous religious leaders during my trips to vietnam who were struggling for fundamental human rights in their country. unfortunately, many of them, including father ly and the most venerable thich quang do, remain wrongly detained today. there are disturbing reports that father ly is suffering poor [[page e942]] health. there are over 150 prisoners of conscience in vietnam. we should not forget them. some have made the case that vietnam has made progress in recent years with respect to human rights, especially in regard to joining international agreements like the united nations convention against torture. in order for there to be real progress, the vietnamese government needs to back up its words with actions. the vietnamese government can show that it is serious about respecting and protecting human rights by crafting a new religion law that rolls back some of the many constraints on religious activities, but early indications the new law will actually be more restrictive. vietnam can lift its draconian internet restrictions and allow for independent labor organizations. labor protections and internet freedom are critical economic as well as human rights issues. despite the dismal status for human rights in vietnam, we can exert pressure on the vietnamese government to cease these abuses. i have reintroduced the vietnam human rights act. the vietnam human rights act of 2015 seeks to promote the development of freedom and democracy in vietnam by stipulating that the united states can increase its non- humanitarian assistance to vietnam above fy2012 levels only when the president is able to certify that the government of vietnam has made substantial progress in establishing human rights protections. the united states should not be rewarding the vietnamese regime with taxpayer dollars when it continues to violently repress its own people. swift congressional action on this bill will send a strong message that u.s. will not tolerate continuing human rights abuses in vietnam. its enactment will send an unmistakable message to the government of vietnam that human rights improvements are fundamental to better relations, critically linked to our mutual economic and security interests, and cannot be ignored or bargained away. those intent on passing tpp should also be concerned with maximizing leverage over vietnam, with the vietnamese government making true and lasting concessions on human rights, before we agree to provide them with the benefits of trade. in fact, we heard from a witness at a recent hearing i held, the reverend nguyen manh hung of the mennonite church of vietnam, how a religious leader has been threatened by security forces who told him that once tpp is passed, his house of worship will be torn down. this is a message that congress, and the american people need to hear, before we continue to debate tpp in the abstract: there should be no trade deal with vietnam without milestones being met on human rights on a permanent and sustainable basis. ____________________",7715

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Waynesboro Area YMCA on the occasion of its 100th year of service to the Waynesboro community. The Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) was first established in 1844, and has grown into a worldwide organization that represents the pursuit of a healthy body, mind, and spirit. The Waynesboro community has been fortunate to have the Waynesboro Area YMCA since 1915, and today I congratulate the organization for 100 years of positive impact on the community. From the momentous laying of the original building's cornerstone to today, the Waynesboro Area YMCA's Board of Directors, staff, and community members have put an impressive amount of work into continually growing and improving the Y's impact on the community. Countless renovations, fundraising efforts, and hours of work have enabled the Waynesboro Area Y to reach a community presence of which its 1915 founders would be proud. Today the Waynesboro Y has a membership of nearly 3,600 people and offers more than 100 different programs. With a true communal spirit, it financially assists over 300 youth and 150 adults for membership and programs, providing over $90,000 in scholarships annually. Though much has changed about the Waynesboro Y, it has remained committed to the principles by which it was founded--the pursuit of a healthy body, mind, and spirit with a Christian basis. I am privileged to congratulate the Waynesboro Area YMCA for a century of history and service to the Waynesboro community, and to thank all who have helped this YMCA continue its success. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E942] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE WAYNESBORO, PENNSYLVANIA YMCA FOR 100 YEARS OF HISTORY AND SERVICE ______ HON.

HAROLD ROGERS of kentucky in the house of representatives Tuesday, June 23, 2015 Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and commend John Michael ``Mike'' Ringler on the occasion of his retirement, having served for 17 years on the House Appropriations Committee. In total, he has provided more than 27 years of distinguished, quiet service to our country. His integrity stands as a model for us all. Mike, a native of Rector, Pennsylvania, graduated from Georgetown University with a Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service, enhancing his experience by studying abroad in the United Kingdom and Ecuador. He also earned a Master of Public and International Affairs from the University of Pittsburgh. Mike counts himself as an avid fan of Steelers football and Hoyas basketball, and he fine tunes his own basketball skills at weekend games with friends and colleagues. Mike began his career in Washington, D.C. in 1987 as a Presidential Management Intern at the U.S. Information Agency, Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. From there, he rose through the ranks as a budget analyst then financial manager by 1996 before spending a year as the budget officer for the Broadcasting Board of Governors. In 1997, he started his dedicated service to the House Appropriations Committee, serving as Professional Staff from 1997 through 2001; Majority Clerk and Staff Director from 2002 through 2006; Minority Clerk and Staff Director from 2007 through 2010; and finally as Majority Clerk and Staff Director from 2011 through the early spring of 2015. Mike spent his entire Congressional career working on the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, where he was responsible for leading the review, analysis, and production of the annual appropriations bill providing more than $50 billion for the Department of Commerce, the Department of Justice, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Science Foundation, and several related agencies. He also oversaw spending for various State Department programs and the U.S. Supreme Court. Mike recently has gone back to his roots and now works for his alma mater, the University of Pittsburgh. Mike's contributions extend beyond his role on the Appropriations Committee. For years, he participated as a reading mentor with Everybody Wins! in Washington, D.C., a literacy mentor program with one-on-one, read-aloud sessions. Mike's other passions include music-- both playing guitar and attending classical Indian music recitals and small music venues. Mr. Speaker, Mike Ringler has left a tangible, lasting imprint on the Congress where he was known as a calm, diligent force on the Committee and a trusted mentor for professional staff and fellow clerks alike. He will be remembered for his many contributions to the Committee. I wish Mike and his family continued success as he enters this next stage of his life, and I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing my appreciation for his tremendous contributions to our nation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E943] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING AND COMMENDING MIKE RINGLER ______ HON.

SAM FARR of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, June 23, 2015 Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the remarkable public service career of Keith Israel, who is retiring as the General Manager of the Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency (MRWPCA), after 27 years. Under Mr. Israel's leadership, the MRWPCA has grown to serve 250,000 people and treat 18.5 million gallons each day. After obtaining a Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering and a Masters in both Environmental Engineering and Business Administration, Mr. Israel worked for five years as General Manager of the Victor Valley Wastewater Reclamation District. In 1988, Mr. Israel came to the Monterey Peninsula and immediately began to revolutionize the work of the MRWPCA. In the 1990's, MRWPCA constructed the Regional Treatment Plant (RTP) near Marina under his leadership. The efficiency and new treatment plans spearheaded by Mr. Israel and brought about by the RTP's development led to increased economic opportunity and business and housing development in the Monterey region. Also in the 1990's, Mr. Israel began collaborating with the Monterey County Water Resources Agency to begin a project to reduce groundwater withdrawal and allow for the use of recycled water for 12,000 acres of farmland in the Salinas Valley. Throughout his tenure at the MRWPCA, Mr. Israel has served as a visionary, coordinating the Salinas River Diversion Project and Pure Water Monterey Project, all while working tirelessly to facilitate collaboration between local leaders to advocate for sustainable water resources. Because of Mr. Israel's dedication to reducing the MRWPCA's carbon footprint, the agency has made great strides in the implementation of environmentally progressive processes, leading to recognition such as the Breathe California Central Coast Clean-Air Award and a partnership with ENERGY STAR. Mr. Israel has also built a personal reputation of excellence in the industry; throughout his career, he has served on the Boards of American Water Works Association and WateReuse Association and maintained leadership positions in the California Association of Sanitation Agencies. Mr. Speaker, I know that I speak for the whole House in sharing our gratitude to Keith for a job well done and extend our best wishes to him and his family this next chapter of life. I know that even in retirement, he will still find himself involved in the community and continue to better the Monterey Peninsula just as he has done through his work at the MRWPCA these last 27 years. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E942] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF KEITH ISRAEL ______ HON.

TONY CARDENAS of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, June 23, 2015 Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Adel Hagekhalil, Assistant Director for the City of Los Angeles' Bureau of Sanitation, on his election as President of the National Association of Clean Water Agencies (NACWA). The Bureau of Sanitation is responsible for operating and maintaining one of the world's largest wastewater collection and treatment systems. Over 6,500 miles of sewers serve more than four million residential and business customers in Los Angeles and 29 contracting cities and agencies, treating an average of 550 million gallons of wastewater each day of the year. Adel is a dynamic leader who has shown an unparalleled ability to collaborate and bring diverse interests together for a common cause-- strengths ideally suited for the NACWA Presidency. During this transition year for NACWA, Adel's steady leadership style will help ensure that the Association will build on its 45-year record of being a dynamic and forward-thinking environmental organization. Beyond his wealth of environmental, engineering, and management expertise, Adel utilized a collaborative approach to watershed-based solutions that garnered broad support among the public, business, elected officials, regulators and policymakers. He moves the needle in the right direction, is results-oriented, and gets the job done. [[Page E944]] Adel is also a staunch and effective advocate for investing in our nation's aging and often deteriorating water infrastructure-- investments that convey both environmental and economic benefits and help communities across our great nation create jobs, grow, and thrive. Adel believes that great communities must better understand the true value of water and deserve first-class, sustainable water infrastructure. Under Adel's direction, the City of Los Angeles prepared an award- winning Water Integrated Resources Plan (IRP) for the year 2020 which relies on public input and participation and integrates water supply, water reuse, water conservation and stormwater management with wastewater facilities planning through a regional watershed approach. He has managed the City's collection system maintenance upgrade efforts resulting in over 83 percent reduction in sewer spills and over 70 percent reduction in sewer-related odors. Adel's work on Fats, Oils and Grease (FOG) reduction has cut FOG- related spills by 90 percent. More recently, he led the development and adoption of a Low Impact Development Ordinance for the City of Los Angeles that focuses on rainwater harvesting and runoff management for new developments and redevelopments. In addition, he was instrumental in the successful development and adoption of a 10-year financial plan including the necessary rates adjustment to support the renewal of the City's clean water systems. Adel is currently leading the City of Los Angeles' Green Infrastructure program where stormwater is managed through regional and distributed solutions that provide multiple benefits while improving the quality of life in LA's neighborhoods. In addition, he is leading the development of the One Water Plan for Los Angeles for the year 2040 to manage water holistically while reducing consumption, increasing water reuse and reducing dependence on imported water, a critical need in the City's efforts to confront drought conditions. Adel has more than 26 years of experience in the clean water industry and has published numerous technical papers and participated in various technical conferences and committees. In addition to his service to NACWA, The Bureau of Sanitation is a founding member of the U.S. Water Alliance, and Adel is a proud member of the American Academy of Environmental Engineers, the American Public Works Association, and the Water Environment Federation. Adel has received many awards at the local, state and national levels. These include the inaugural U.S. Water Prize, Heal the Bay's ``Walk the Talk Award."" L.A.

TONY CARDENAS of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, June 23, 2015 Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Adel Hagekhalil, Assistant Director for the City of Los Angeles' Bureau of Sanitation, on his election as President of the National Association of Clean Water Agencies (NACWA). The Bureau of Sanitation is responsible for operating and maintaining one of the world's largest wastewater collection and treatment systems. Over 6,500 miles of sewers serve more than four million residential and business customers in Los Angeles and 29 contracting cities and agencies, treating an average of 550 million gallons of wastewater each day of the year. Adel is a dynamic leader who has shown an unparalleled ability to collaborate and bring diverse interests together for a common cause-- strengths ideally suited for the NACWA Presidency. During this transition year for NACWA, Adel's steady leadership style will help ensure that the Association will build on its 45-year record of being a dynamic and forward-thinking environmental organization. Beyond his wealth of environmental, engineering, and management expertise, Adel utilized a collaborative approach to watershed-based solutions that garnered broad support among the public, business, elected officials, regulators and policymakers. He moves the needle in the right direction, is results-oriented, and gets the job done. [[Page E944]] Adel is also a staunch and effective advocate for investing in our nation's aging and often deteriorating water infrastructure-- investments that convey both environmental and economic benefits and help communities across our great nation create jobs, grow, and thrive. Adel believes that great communities must better understand the true value of water and deserve first-class, sustainable water infrastructure. Under Adel's direction, the City of Los Angeles prepared an award- winning Water Integrated Resources Plan (IRP) for the year 2020 which relies on public input and participation and integrates water supply, water reuse, water conservation and stormwater management with wastewater facilities planning through a regional watershed approach. He has managed the City's collection system maintenance upgrade efforts resulting in over 83 percent reduction in sewer spills and over 70 percent reduction in sewer-related odors. Adel's work on Fats, Oils and Grease (FOG) reduction has cut FOG- related spills by 90 percent. More recently, he led the development and adoption of a Low Impact Development Ordinance for the City of Los Angeles that focuses on rainwater harvesting and runoff management for new developments and redevelopments. In addition, he was instrumental in the successful development and adoption of a 10-year financial plan including the necessary rates adjustment to support the renewal of the City's clean water systems.

DAVID YOUNG of iowa in the house of representatives Tuesday, June 23, 2015 Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Shenandoah Floral of Shenandoah, Iowa. For over 90 years, Shenandoah Floral has been a staple in the Shenandoah community. According to local history, the florist shop was first recorded in the local phonebook in 1925. In 2006, Shenandoah Floral was purchased by current owner Nancy Maher. Nancy purchased the shop when it was in danger of closing and has turned the business into a success story. Nancy had no prior experience running a floral shop, so the assistance of the existing staff helped in making Shenandoah Floral successful. Nancy contributes the success of the floral shop to her employees. Nancy wanted to keep the floral shop in operation in order to keep existing jobs in Shenandoah. She stated that, ``If the doors had closed, they'd have just been out of a job.'' Nancy has been committed to preserving Shenandoah's downtown area and keeping the downtown business district viable. Since assuming ownership of the floral shop, Nancy has seen many changes in the operation of the business, such as the streamlining of operations by using advanced technology and computers. She remembers handwriting orders. Nancy takes pride in the services that the floral shop provides. The shop receives orders from around the world, including from our men and women in the military who wish to send flowers to family members. The business cherishes the many friends and customers they have served for the past 90 years. I commend Shenandoah Floral and their staff for their 90 years of dedicated service to Shenandoah and southwest Iowa. I urge my colleagues in the House to join me in congratulating Shenandoah Floral for their many achievements in the florist industry. I wish them and all of their employees best wishes moving forward. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E945] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO SHENANDOAH FLORAL _____ HON.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Tuesday, June 23, 2015 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, on June 4, 2015, the Barbara Jordan- Mickey Leland School of Public Affairs and the Thurgood Marshall School of Law, two of the great institutions of Texas Southern University, which is located in my congressional district and is one of the nation's great historically black colleges and universities, awarded the inaugural Barbara Jordan Gold Medallion for Public-Private Leadership. The Barbara Jordan Gold Medallion for Public-Private Leadership is presented annually to a woman of demonstrated excellence in the public or private sector whose achievements are an example and inspiration to people everywhere, but especially to women and girls. The Barbara Jordan Gold Medallion for Public-Private Leadership is presented annually to a woman of demonstrated excellence in the public or private sector whose achievements are an example and inspiration to people everywhere, but especially to women and girls. It was my honor to present the Barbara Jordan Gold Medallion to the Honorable Hillary Clinton, the former First Lady of Arkansas and the United States, U.S. Senator, and Secretary of State. As I stated at the award ceremony, it was fitting that the inaugural recipient of this award is a person whose life and achievements embody the passion and principles and values and commitment to service of Barbara Jordan. When asked to name the woman living anywhere in the world whom they admire most, Americans have named Hillary Clinton in each of the last 13 years and 17 of the last 18. As a leader on the national and international stage, Hillary Clinton represented our nation with distinction and grace, always reflecting our highest ideals and aspirations. It was First Lady Hillary Clinton who traveled to Beijing to speak truth to power, declaring on behalf of women and girls everywhere that: ``human rights are women's rights. And women's rights are human rights.'' It was Hillary Clinton who gave voice to what many of us have always understood, when she said that to raise a happy, healthy and hopeful child, ``it takes a family, it takes teachers, it takes clergy, it takes business people, it takes community leaders, it takes those who protect our health and safety, it takes all of us.'' That, yes indeed, ``it takes a village to raise a child.'' But before Hillary Clinton was a household name, many of us in Texas remembered her as a brilliant young activist whose passion for justice and equality brought her to Texas in 1972 to help poor people and African Americans and Latinos register to exercise the right to vote they had been denied so long. Passed in 1965 with the extraordinary leadership of President Lyndon Johnson, the greatest legislative genius of our lifetime, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was bringing dramatic change in many states across the South. But in 1972, change was not coming fast enough or in many places in Texas. In fact, Texas, which had never elected a woman to Congress or an African American to the Texas State Senate, was not covered by Section 5 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the language minorities living in South Texas that Hillary Clinton came to help were not protected at all. But the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the voter registration work performed in 1972 by Hillary Clinton in Texas, along with hundreds of others, helped elect Barbara Jordan to Congress. In 2006, during the floor debate on the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, I said: The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is no ordinary piece of legislation. For millions of Americans, and many of us in Congress, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is a sacred treasure, earned by the sweat and toil and tears and blood of ordinary Americans who showed the world it was possible to accomplish extraordinary things. But a terrible blow was dealt to the Voting Rights Act on June 25, 2013, when the Supreme Court handed down the decision in Shelby County v. Holder, 537 U.S. 193 (2013), which invalidated Section 4(b), the provision of the law determining which jurisdictions would be subject to Section 5 ``preclearance.'' The reason the Court gave for its ruling was that ``times have changed.'' Times have changed, but what the Court did not fully appreciate is that the positive changes it cited were due almost entirely to the existence and vigorous enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. And that is why the Voting Rights Act is still needed today. In the same way that the vaccine invented by Dr. Jonas Salk in 1953 eradicated the crippling effects but did not eliminate the cause of polio, the Voting Rights Act succeeded in stymying the practices that resulted in the wholesale disenfranchisement of African Americans and language minorities but did not eliminate them entirely. [[Page E945]] In Texas, we know this from personal experience. On the same day that Shelby County v. Holder was decided officials in Texas announced they would immediately implement its Photo ID law, and other election laws, policies, and practices that could never pass muster under the Section 5 preclearance regime. This stands in contrast to President Lyndon Johnson, who understood that the right to vote is: The most powerful instrument ever devised by man for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which imprison men because they are different from other men. Because Barbara Jordan understood the importance of protecting the right to vote, she authored the 1975 amendment that became Section Sections 4(f)(3) and 4(f)(4) of the Voting Rights Act, which extended to language minorities the protections of Section 4(a) and Section 5, which also had the effect of subjecting Texas to the pre-clearance provisions of Section 5. I am pleased that the inaugural recipient of the award given in Barbara Jordan's name also understands, as she made clear in her acceptance remarks in which she called for reforms to make it easier, not harder, for Americans to exercise the franchise, including automatic, universal registration of voters once they turn 18; and a national standard of not fewer than 20 days of early in-person voting in every state, including opportunities for weekend and evenings. Mr. Speaker, I commend Texas Southern University, and the Barbara Jordan-Mickey Leland School of Public Affairs and Thurgood Marshall School of Law for honoring the memory of one of a great American by establishing the Barbara Jordan Gold Medallion and I congratulate the 2015 recipient of this prestigious award, the Honorable Hillary Clinton. I look forward to congratulating future recipients of the Barbara Jordan Gold Medallion in the years to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E944-E945] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING HILLARY CLINTON, 2015 RECIPIENT OF THE BARBARA JORDAN GOLD MEDALLION FOR LEADERSHIP _____ HON.

Res. 55, which requires the President to withdraw our troops deployed in Iraq and Syria before the end of the year unless Congress passes an Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) to combat ISIL. I do want to stress that I support many aspects of the military operations the President is currently conducting against ISIL, including the use of American air power against ISIL targets and in support of Iraqi and Kurdish forces, as well as the deployment of limited numbers of American troops to help train and equip those forces. However, it has now been ten months since the President sent troops into Iraq and Syria and four months since the President sent Congress a proposed AUMF to combat ISIL. While I have serious concerns with that proposed draft, we owe it to our troops and the American people to at the very least have a debate in Congress on our military engagement in Iraq and Syria. My primary concern is that the President continues to rely on the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against and Al-Qaeda and associated forces and the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force against Iraq as justification to take military action against ISIL. While he has repeatedly stated that he will not deploy ground troops in a combat role in either Syria or Iraq, these existing authorities leave that door open. We need to sunset both the 2001 AUMF and 2002 AUMF and pass a narrowly tailored AUMF to combat ISIL that provides the authority necessary to degrade [[Page E946]] and defeat ISIL without dragging the United States into another unnecessary ground war in the Middle East. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E945-E946] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMOVAL OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES FROM IRAQ AND SYRIA ______ speech of HON.

While I have serious concerns with that proposed draft, we owe it to our troops and the American people to at the very least have a debate in Congress on our military engagement in Iraq and Syria. My primary concern is that the President continues to rely on the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against and Al-Qaeda and associated forces and the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force against Iraq as justification to take military action against ISIL. While he has repeatedly stated that he will not deploy ground troops in a combat role in either Syria or Iraq, these existing authorities leave that door open. We need to sunset both the 2001 AUMF and 2002 AUMF and pass a narrowly tailored AUMF to combat ISIL that provides the authority necessary to degrade [[Page E946]] and defeat ISIL without dragging the United States into another unnecessary ground war in the Middle East. ____________________",package_114_266.csv,2067,2067,2135,"[congressional record volume 161, number 101 (tuesday, june 23, 2015)] [extensions of remarks] [pages e945-e946] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] removal of united states armed forces from iraq and syria ______ speech of hon. chris van hollen of maryland in the house of representatives wednesday, june 17, 2015 mr. van hollen. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h. con. res. 55, which requires the president to withdraw our troops deployed in iraq and syria before the end of the year unless congress passes an authorization for use of military force (aumf) to combat isil. i do want to stress that i support many aspects of the military operations the president is currently conducting against isil, including the use of american air power against isil targets and in support of iraqi and kurdish forces, as well as the deployment of limited numbers of american troops to help train and equip those forces. however, it has now been ten months since the president sent troops into iraq and syria and four months since the president sent congress a proposed aumf to combat isil. while i have serious concerns with that proposed draft, we owe it to our troops and the american people to at the very least have a debate in congress on our military engagement in iraq and syria. my primary concern is that the president continues to rely on the 2001 authorization for use of military force against and al-qaeda and associated forces and the 2002 authorization for use of military force against iraq as justification to take military action against isil. while he has repeatedly stated that he will not deploy ground troops in a combat role in either syria or iraq, these existing authorities leave that door open. we need to sunset both the 2001 aumf and 2002 aumf and pass a narrowly tailored aumf to combat isil that provides the authority necessary to degrade [[page e946]] and defeat isil without dragging the united states into another unnecessary ground war in the middle east. ____________________",2067

SANDER M. LEVIN of michigan in the house of representatives Tuesday, June 23, 2015 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a good friend and a pioneer from my home state of Michigan, Jane Hart. Jane passed away on June 5, 2015. Some of us in Congress knew Jane through her husband, the late Senator Phil Hart, for whom the Hart Senate Office Building is named and who was known as the ``conscience of the Senate.'' I had the privilege of knowing her personally through common endeavors in Michigan. So while Jane Hart was her husband's partner in so many ways during his service to the people of Michigan, she was a leader and a trailblazer in her own right. She was a person with an unusual combination of a sense of responsibility for the common good, family loyalty and respect for individuality. Like so many women during World War II, Jane was committed to helping the American war effort. She was involved with the American Red Cross, helping to found their motor corps. She trained other women to drive the trucks built in Michigan factories to military bases around the country and to ports for transport overseas. Her involvement in this effort led to her interest in flying. During a time when there were very few women pilots, Jane earned licenses to fly single and multi- engine airplanes. She later became the first woman in the state of Michigan to earn a license to fly helicopters, and during her husband's first campaign for the Senate, she flew Phil to campaign events throughout the state. Her passion for flight led to an interest in the space program, and she, along with 12 others, were the first women to pass the physical and psychological tests required by NASA of astronaut candidates. NASA denied their entry into the astronaut program, and the Detroit News reported that she commented at the time, ``The men just could not get it and the country lost a great opportunity.'' While this group of women, who became known as the Mercury 13, never went to space themselves, their efforts and their advocacy helped to pave the way for Sally Ride to become the first American woman astronaut, and for all the women who have contributed so much to our space program since Ms. Ride's historic flight. As a pioneer for women in flight and in space, it was no surprise that Jane Hart was a powerful advocate for women's rights in general. In 1966, Jane was a founding board member of the National Organization for Women (NOW), where she chaired the new organization's Task Force on Legal and Political Rights, and she helped to establish NOW chapters in Michigan and in Washington, DC. For many years, she passionately advocated for an Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In recognition of her leadership, Jane was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame in 2007. Jane was also a well-known peace activist during the tumultuous period of the Vietnam War, which her son Michael told the Washington Post sometimes made things ``a little bit . . . complicated'' for her husband. But, as her son also noted to the Post, ``On occasion someone would demand of him, `Can't you control that wife of yours?' But the senator would respond, `Why would I?' '' While leading a life of adventure and advocacy, Jane Hart also raised her family with love and commitment. She and Phil Hart had nine children, eight grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren. To them, and to all who knew her, Jane Hart was a vital force whose intelligence, energy and passion were inspirational. I encourage my colleagues to join me in remembering Jane Hart's remarkable contributions to our country and in extending condolences to the Hart family on her passing. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E946] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO JANE HART ______ HON.

SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. of georgia in the house of representatives Tuesday, June 23, 2015 Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart and solemn remembrance that I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding spiritual leader and man of God, the Reverend Roosevelt Franklin. Sadly, Reverend Franklin passed away on Monday, June 15, 2015. His passing leaves a tremendous void in the hearts of his family, friends, and followers in Georgia and across the world. A funeral service was held in his honor on Saturday, June 20, 2015 at 1:00 p.m. at First Baptist Church in Macon, Georgia. Reverend Roosevelt Delano Franklin Johnson was born on August 30, 1933 in Chattanooga, Tennessee to James and Cora Ponds Johnson. He attended Oxford School of Divinity in England. Reverend Franklin began his ministry in 1966, and for the past forty-nine years, he has been a willing vessel for the Lord. Known around the world as the ``Original Georgia Prophet,'' Rev. Franklin traveled the globe teaching people of all walks of life. He served as pastor of Free For All Baptist Church in Greenwood, South Carolina from 1951 until 1952, when he became a spiritual radio minister. He ministered at Spiritual Church in Aiken, South Carolina from 1962-1963. His journey then took him to Macon, Georgia, where he became President of United Council of Spiritual Ministers and Talent Coordinator and Promoter of numerous renowned spiritual singers. Always seeking to improve the craft of Christian ministry and discipleship, Rev. Franklin created the television program, ``The Prosperity Way of Living'' and the radio program, ``Echo of Prophecy,'' in the early 1960s. In 1966, Rev. Franklin founded the Holy Trinity House of God, which he pastored until his departure to his eternal reward. Rev. Franklin proudly served the craft of Smooth Ashlar Grand Lodge. He was National Grand Orator for the National Grand Council of Nine. Rev. Franklin received numerous awards and recognitions for his accomplishments. A charismatic leader with an infectious spiritual zeal, Reverend Franklin had a way of ensuring that his listeners found their way to prosperity and happiness as they lived their lives in Christ. But beyond his radio ministry, Rev. Franklin made himself available to those who sought a relationship with Christ, and he would hold personal consultations with anyone who needed guidance and encouragement. He taught people to be positive, to search for knowledge, and overall, to be guided by the voice of God. Rev. Franklin was truly a man of integrity who exuded the genuine principles and values of Christian discipleship. On a personal note, I have truly been blessed by Rev. Franklin's sage counsel and enduring friendship over the many years I have known him. Dr. George Washington Carver once said, ``No individual has any right to come into the world and go out of it without leaving behind distinct and legitimate reasons for having passed through it.'' We are so blessed that the Reverend Roosevelt Franklin passed this way and shared with us his legacy of service that will stand the test of time. Surely, the wealth of wisdom that Reverend Franklin has given to his listeners will forever resonate in their hearts and spirits. Mr. Speaker, my wife Vivian and I, along with the more than 730,000 people in the Second Congressional District of Georgia, would like to extend our deepest sympathies to Rev. Franklin's family, friends, and followers during this difficult time. May we all be consoled and comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks and months ahead. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E946] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF THE REVEREND ROOSEVELT FRANKLIN ______ HON.

Sadly, Reverend Franklin passed away on Monday, June 15, 2015. His passing leaves a tremendous void in the hearts of his family, friends, and followers in Georgia and across the world. A funeral service was held in his honor on Saturday, June 20, 2015 at 1:00 p.m. at First Baptist Church in Macon, Georgia. Reverend Roosevelt Delano Franklin Johnson was born on August 30, 1933 in Chattanooga, Tennessee to James and Cora Ponds Johnson. He attended Oxford School of Divinity in England. Reverend Franklin began his ministry in 1966, and for the past forty-nine years, he has been a willing vessel for the Lord. Known around the world as the ``Original Georgia Prophet,'' Rev. Franklin traveled the globe teaching people of all walks of life. He served as pastor of Free For All Baptist Church in Greenwood, South Carolina from 1951 until 1952, when he became a spiritual radio minister. He ministered at Spiritual Church in Aiken, South Carolina from 1962-1963. His journey then took him to Macon, Georgia, where he became President of United Council of Spiritual Ministers and Talent Coordinator and Promoter of numerous renowned spiritual singers. Always seeking to improve the craft of Christian ministry and discipleship, Rev. Franklin created the television program, ``The Prosperity Way of Living'' and the radio program, ``Echo of Prophecy,'' in the early 1960s. In 1966, Rev. Franklin founded the Holy Trinity House of God, which he pastored until his departure to his eternal reward. Rev. Franklin proudly served the craft of Smooth Ashlar Grand Lodge. He was National Grand Orator for the National Grand Council of Nine. Rev. Franklin received numerous awards and recognitions for his accomplishments. A charismatic leader with an infectious spiritual zeal, Reverend Franklin had a way of ensuring that his listeners found their way to prosperity and happiness as they lived their lives in Christ. But beyond his radio ministry, Rev. Franklin made himself available to those who sought a relationship with Christ, and he would hold personal consultations with anyone who needed guidance and encouragement. He taught people to be positive, to search for knowledge, and overall, to be guided by the voice of God. Rev. Franklin was truly a man of integrity who exuded the genuine principles and values of Christian discipleship. On a personal note, I have truly been blessed by Rev. Franklin's sage counsel and enduring friendship over the many years I have known him. Dr. George Washington Carver once said, ``No individual has any right to come into the world and go out of it without leaving behind distinct and legitimate reasons for having passed through it.'' We are so blessed that the Reverend Roosevelt Franklin passed this way and shared with us his legacy of service that will stand the test of time. Surely, the wealth of wisdom that Reverend Franklin has given to his listeners will forever resonate in their hearts and spirits. Mr. Speaker, my wife Vivian and I, along with the more than 730,000 people in the Second Congressional District of Georgia, would like to extend our deepest sympathies to Rev. Franklin's family, friends, and followers during this difficult time. May we all be consoled and comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks and months ahead. ____________________",package_114_266.csv,3877,3877,3945,"[congressional record volume 161, number 101 (tuesday, june 23, 2015)] [extensions of remarks] [page e946] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] in honor of the reverend roosevelt franklin ______ hon. sanford d. bishop, jr. of georgia in the house of representatives tuesday, june 23, 2015 mr. bishop of georgia. mr. speaker, it is with a heavy heart and solemn remembrance that i rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding spiritual leader and man of god, the reverend roosevelt franklin. sadly, reverend franklin passed away on monday, june 15, 2015. his passing leaves a tremendous void in the hearts of his family, friends, and followers in georgia and across the world. a funeral service was held in his honor on saturday, june 20, 2015 at 1:00 p.m. at first baptist church in macon, georgia. reverend roosevelt delano franklin johnson was born on august 30, 1933 in chattanooga, tennessee to james and cora ponds johnson. he attended oxford school of divinity in england. reverend franklin began his ministry in 1966, and for the past forty-nine years, he has been a willing vessel for the lord. known around the world as the ``original georgia prophet,'' rev. franklin traveled the globe teaching people of all walks of life. he served as pastor of free for all baptist church in greenwood, south carolina from 1951 until 1952, when he became a spiritual radio minister. he ministered at spiritual church in aiken, south carolina from 1962-1963. his journey then took him to macon, georgia, where he became president of united council of spiritual ministers and talent coordinator and promoter of numerous renowned spiritual singers. always seeking to improve the craft of christian ministry and discipleship, rev. franklin created the television program, ``the prosperity way of living'' and the radio program, ``echo of prophecy,'' in the early 1960s. in 1966, rev. franklin founded the holy trinity house of god, which he pastored until his departure to his eternal reward. rev. franklin proudly served the craft of smooth ashlar grand lodge. he was national grand orator for the national grand council of nine. rev. franklin received numerous awards and recognitions for his accomplishments. a charismatic leader with an infectious spiritual zeal, reverend franklin had a way of ensuring that his listeners found their way to prosperity and happiness as they lived their lives in christ. but beyond his radio ministry, rev. franklin made himself available to those who sought a relationship with christ, and he would hold personal consultations with anyone who needed guidance and encouragement. he taught people to be positive, to search for knowledge, and overall, to be guided by the voice of god. rev. franklin was truly a man of integrity who exuded the genuine principles and values of christian discipleship. on a personal note, i have truly been blessed by rev. franklin's sage counsel and enduring friendship over the many years i have known him. dr. george washington carver once said, ``no individual has any right to come into the world and go out of it without leaving behind distinct and legitimate reasons for having passed through it.'' we are so blessed that the reverend roosevelt franklin passed this way and shared with us his legacy of service that will stand the test of time. surely, the wealth of wisdom that reverend franklin has given to his listeners will forever resonate in their hearts and spirits. mr. speaker, my wife vivian and i, along with the more than 730,000 people in the second congressional district of georgia, would like to extend our deepest sympathies to rev. franklin's family, friends, and followers during this difficult time. may we all be consoled and comforted by an abiding faith and the holy spirit in the days, weeks and months ahead. ____________________",3877

MATT CARTWRIGHT of pennsylvania in the house of representatives Tuesday, June 23, 2015 Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 140th anniversary of the Borough of Bangor, located in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, and its listing on the National Register of Historic Places. The area now known as Bangor, PA was settled in 1735. It was first named Uttsville after Adam Utt, one of the area's first hotel builders. In 1855, the name was changed to New Village. Slate was discovered in 1856. Robert M. Jones, from Bethesda, Wales, founded the slate industry, and the first quarry opened in 1863. Bangor was incorporated as a borough on May 5, 1875. At that time, the population was 1,500. It was and is the core community in what came to be known as the Slate Belt region of Northampton County. At its height, Bangor's slate was known as the finest in the world, and Bangor was home to over seven major hotels. In the mid-1990s, a group of Bangor residents sought to preserve the borough's historical assets to secure its future vitality. In 2007, Bangor's Borough Business Revitalization Program joined a regional Main Street Program to foster the image of Bangor's traditional assets. The program later evolved into the Slate Belt Community Partnership, which continued the work. The National Register of Historic Places listing was approved in late 2014. Its focus is the slate extraction industry and the ethnic groups it attracted to Bangor from 1866-1940. I offer congratulations to the residents of Bangor for fulfilling their vision of a preserved [[Page E947]] Historic District. I applaud their dedication to history and to their community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E946-E947] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE BOROUGH OF BANGOR'S 140TH ANNIVERSARY _____ HON.

Mr. Shimizu served our island and country faithfully and passed away on June 5, 2015 at the age of 75. Jack was born on March 23, 1940 to Joaquin Torres Shimizu and Ana Santos Shimizu. He grew up in the village of Dededo and was a member of the first graduating class of Santa Barbara Catholic School. As a child, Jack survived the Japanese occupation of Guam during World War II and was a member of Guam's greatest generation. He joined the United States Navy in 1957 at just 17 years old. Jack served in the U.S. Navy for 28 years before retiring as Master Chief Petty Officer in July 1985. Upon retiring from the Navy, Jack returned to Guam and settled in Latte Plantation in the village of Mangilao. He continued a life of service to our community and served in several positions in the Government of Guam. He was appointed the Chief of Police of the Guam Police Department and the Director of the Guam Department of Corrections. Most notably, Jack dedicated much of his time to helping veterans. He was instrumental in founding the Guam chapter of the Military Order of the Purple Heart (MOPH). Jack was the current Commander of the Asia- Pacific Military Order of the Purple Heart. He devoted his time to carry out the mission of the MOPH to foster an environment of goodwill and camaraderie among combat wounded veterans, promote patriotism, support necessary legislative initiatives, and most importantly, provide service to all veterans and their families. Jack was active in promoting the organization to Purple Heart recipients and making them aware of services that were available to them. He, along with other members would visit homebound residents to assess their needs and offer assistance. He would also lead the organization in fundraising to assist other charitable organizations. Additionally, Jack volunteered his time at the Veterans Affairs Office in Asan. He will be remembered as a loving and giving man who was always willing to help others.

ELIOT L. ENGEL of new york in the house of representatives Tuesday, June 23, 2015 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a global day of physical and mental exercise as the world celebrates International Yoga Day on June 21, 2015. Yoga is a physical, mental, and spiritual practice that aims to integrate the body and the mind. It encourages participants to assume various postures and to conduct breathing exercise, subsequently allowing them to achieve a deeper sense of consciousness and tranquility. Developed around the fifth and sixth century BCE by the ancient Indian civilizations of the Indus River Valley, yoga is a hallmark of the Indian culture. The world's religions that originate from India-- Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism--utilize yoga as a central part of their religious and cultural traditions. In fact, yoga appears prominently in the Bhagadad Gita, one of Hinduism's most important texts, and in some of the earliest Buddhist texts. In the mid-19th century, the Western public gained an active interest in yoga, valuing the practice for its transcendental experience. By the 1980's, yoga became viewed as a means to promote physical wellbeing, citing improvements to mental health and flexibility. On December 11, 2014, the United Nations General Assembly declared June 21st as International Yoga Day. The importance of this special day cannot be understated, because as the saying goes, ``in the practice of yoga, one can emphasize the body, the mind, or the self and hence the effort can never be fruitless.'' This year, there will be a rally on June 21 celebrating International Yoga Day in Times Square. I am honored to recognize the invaluable gift of consciousness and well-being that yoga has brought to the people of the United States and the world, and I wish the participants of International Yoga Day a stimulating experience. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E947] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING INTERNATIONAL YOGA DAY _____ HON.

WHERLEY, JR., DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA NATIONAL GUARD RETENTION AND COLLEGE ACCESS ACT","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E947-E948] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE INTRODUCTION OF THE MAJOR GENERAL DAVID F. WHERLEY, JR., DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA NATIONAL GUARD RETENTION AND COLLEGE ACCESS ACT _____ HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Tuesday, June 23, 2015 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce the Major General David F. Wherley, Jr., District of Columbia National Guard Retention and College Access Act (NGRCA) on the six-year anniversary of the tragic June 22, 2009 Metro crash, where General Wherley, former Commanding General of the D.C. National Guard, his wife, Ann, and seven others were killed when Metro trains collided on the Red Line. Yesterday, the District of Columbia opened Legacy Memorial Park in Ward 4 to honor those who lost their lives and the 70 area residents who were injured. My bill would permanently authorize funding for a program that provides grants for higher education to members of the D.C. National Guard, which is funded by the federal government. I have renamed this bill after General Wherley because he worked tirelessly with me to get funding for the program for many years, and because of his devotion to the youth of the District of Columbia. The NGRCA authorizes an education incentive program, recommended by the late General Wherley and his successor, Major General Errol Schwartz, to stem the troublesome loss of members of the D.C. Guard to other units. Surrounding states offer such educational benefits to their Guards. I am grateful that Congress has provided funds for the program in recent years, most recently in fiscal year 2015. Naming a permanently authorized program after General Wherley would memorialize his service to the country and to the Guard in a way that I know his family would appreciate. Authorizing funding is necessary to ensure that D.C. Guard members receive the same treatment and benefits as other National Guard members, particularly those in states that provide the higher education benefits we seek for D.C. Guard members. The Guard for the nation's capital has a limited ability to compete for regional residents, who may find membership in the Maryland and Virginia Guards more beneficial. A competitive tuition assistance program for the D.C. Guard will provide significant and much needed incentives to help maintain enrollment and level the field of competition. The D.C. Guard is a federal instrument not under the control of the mayor of the District of Columbia. The federal government supports D.C. Guard functions and should support this small benefit as well. I appreciate that the Congress has not hesitated to fund the education benefits for the D.C. National Guard. These small education incentives have not only encouraged high-quality recruits, but have helped the D.C. Guard to maintain the force necessary to protect the federal presence here, including in the event of a natural disaster or terrorist attack. I am pleased to introduce the bill based on the advice of Guard personnel, who best know what is necessary. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Dr. Luciano Francisco Ramon Baca, otherwise known as ``Lu'' in his beloved community. Born and raised in Las Vegas, New Mexico, Dr. Lu dedicated his life in the service of others and to his fellow New Mexicans. For more than 10 years, Lu worked as a Social Studies teacher at Leah Harvey Middle School teaching students the heartfelt principles, values, and beliefs that make our country great. Dr. Lu's work transcended the classroom; as Head of the Legislative Educational Committee Lu spearheaded efforts to better finance and improve educational outcomes in New Mexico. Dr. Lu also had a firm belief that our workforce--the individuals who gave their hard work, persistence and determination to build our country--deserved the support and protections they earned when they retired. After serving in state government, Lu dedicated his life to senior citizens, and carried out every task with the full weight of his energy. He served as the former chief of public school finance for the New Mexico Department of Finance and Administration, helped create the constitution of the State Board of Education as well as the equalized Public School Funding Formula in 1974, and served on the Board of Directors for La Familia Medical Center and with the AARP for 15 years. More than anything, Lu loved his family and wife of 55 years, Mindy Esquibel Baca. In fact, it was rare to find a time when they were not sharing an experience together, celebrating a [[Page E949]] family event, or helping out in the community. Dr. Lu cherished his time with his family and could be consistently found going above and beyond to help out an individual in need. While Dr. Lu is no longer with us, his lasting contributions are still a presence in the community to this day. His character is espoused in the individuals he inspired throughout his life, and his enduring principles live on in the hearts and minds of all those he met. May the memory of Dr. Lu continue to live on in all of us. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E948-E949] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING DR.

ALAN S. LOWENTHAL of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, June 23, 2015 Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Ken Farfsing, upon his retirement as the City Manager of the City of Signal Hill, California on June 30, 2015. I've had the pleasure of working with Ken on local and state-wide issues for almost 20 years while serving on the Long Beach City Council, in the California State Legislature, and now in the U.S. Congress, and I consider him to be a dear friend. Ken has over 33 years of experience in community development, redevelopment, economic development and city management in five Southern California communities. Ken has spent the last 19 years serving the City of Signal Hill, and I am honored to recognize his outstanding career. Ken began his career with the City of Santa Fe Springs, California in 1981 as an intern. In 1985 he was promoted to Community Development Director. In 1988 he continued his career as the Community Development Director for the City of Downey. He later became Downey's Assistant City Manager and Director of Economic Development. He served as the City Manager of the City of South Pasadena for four years before coming to Signal Hill. Under his guidance, the city established three commercial centers, Town Center North, Town Center West and the Signal Hill Gateway Center. He facilitated the relocation of a Mercedes Benz dealership to Signal Hill and the expansion of Glenn E. Thomas Dodge Auto Dealership, growing sales tax revenues from 6 million dollars to more than 12 million dollars. Additionally, he completed the development of six community parks and a new police station. Ken has been active in regional issues and a leader with expertise on water issues, working with the 27 area Gateway Cities Council of Government on water, storm water and urban runoff regulation and practices. He served as chair of the City Manager's Steering Committee for the Gateway Cities Manager's Group and was a member of the ``Water Quality Task Force'' of the League of California. Ken Farfsing's leadership and service to the community of Signal Hill will be greatly missed. I want to wish him the very best as he retires. His impact on the city will always be remembered.

PAUL COOK of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, June 23, 2015 Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Victor Valley College Foundation's establishment. This organization has helped Victor Valley College better serve my constituents of the High Desert by providing students the tools to achieve not only their academic goals, but life goals as well. Students have received more than $6 million in scholarships, allowing them to focus on their studies rather than how to pay for college. Through donations, grants, and partnerships, the Victor Valley College Foundation has expanded the budget of the Victor Valley College by nearly $50 million. In doing so, higher education has been more accessible than public funding alone would have allowed. Over the past 40 years, almost every department and program at Victor Valley College has been supported by the Foundation, of which are the School of Nursing, Southern California Logistics Airport School of Aviation Technology, Solar Photovoltaic Design and Installation, Automotive Technology Hybrid Vehicle Maintenance, Geographic Information Systems, Contract and Community Education, and Paramedic Academy. The Victor Valley College Foundation has enriched campus life by supporting student experience programs that include the Associated Student Body, Athletics, Model United Nations, Performing Arts, and Tropical Research Institute. Among its major accomplishments, the Foundation helped open and outfit influential campus facilities like the Performing Arts Center, Student Activities Center, Regional Public Safety Training Center, and the new Dr. Prem Reddy Health and Science Building. Finally, I would like to congratulate the Board Officers, Directors, Emeritus Council, and the Staff members on the Victor Valley College Foundation's 40th Anniversary. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E949] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VICTOR VALLEY COLLEGE FOUNDATION TURNS 40 _____ HON.

ROBERT J. DOLD of illinois in the house of representatives Tuesday, June 23, 2015 Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Summit of Hope, which has become one of the most successful programs at reducing recidivism in the nation. Too many former inmates leave prison ill-prepared to find work and resume their lives, and the rate at which prisoners return to incarceration is far too high. The economic and human costs associated with high recidivism rates are unacceptable, and we must work for change. The Summit of Hope is a collaborative effort between the Illinois Department of Corrections, the Illinois Department of Public Health and local organizations throughout the state. In 2014, over 13,000 parolees and probationers received resources and assistance which helps many of them along the path to successful re-entry into society. Overseen by Senior Community Outreach Administrator Marcus King, the Summit of Hope is an example of how we can work together to address our most pressing challenges. Mr. Speaker, I will be joining Summit of Hope and community leaders at an event in North Chicago, Illinois. I consider it an honor to be a part of their initiative. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E950] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE SUMMIT OF HOPE PROGRAM _____ HON.

The economic and human costs associated with high recidivism rates are unacceptable, and we must work for change. The Summit of Hope is a collaborative effort between the Illinois Department of Corrections, the Illinois Department of Public Health and local organizations throughout the state. In 2014, over 13,000 parolees and probationers received resources and assistance which helps many of them along the path to successful re-entry into society. Overseen by Senior Community Outreach Administrator Marcus King, the Summit of Hope is an example of how we can work together to address our most pressing challenges. Mr. Speaker, I will be joining Summit of Hope and community leaders at an event in North Chicago, Illinois. I consider it an honor to be a part of their initiative. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E950] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE SUMMIT OF HOPE PROGRAM _____ HON.

SANDER M. LEVIN of michigan in the house of representatives Tuesday, June 23, 2015 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, today, I wish to commemorate the public service of Tom Parrott. Tom is retiring from the Social Security Administration after more than four decades of service to the millions of Americans who rely on Social Security. I serve as the Ranking Democrat on the Committee on Ways and Means, and over the years my colleagues and I and our staff have relied heavily on Tom's thoughtful and accurate advice as we crafted Social Security and Supplemental Security Income legislation. We and our constituents owe Tom our thanks for his careful stewardship of their contributions and the benefits they rely on to live. Tom's roots at Social Security are deep, as his father of the same name and his mother served at SSA before him. In fact, Tom says he can remember polishing the family car so his parents could go to the movies with Mr. and Mrs. Bob Ball. In January 1975, Tom began his service at Social Security as a claims representative in the Midtown Manhattan district office, before being assigned to the Rochester, New York and, subsequently, Redding, California district offices. In 1980, he was welcomed back to his home town of Baltimore as a policy analyst in the predecessor office of the current Office of Legislation and Congressional Affairs. He then devoted himself for the last 35 years to working on federal legislation, providing impartial and knowledgeable counsel. He has been Acting Deputy Commissioner for Legislation and Congressional Affairs, and currently serves as Assistant Deputy Commissioner. Tom's commitment to public service runs deeply. Prior to coming to Social Security, Tom was a VISTA volunteer and later a field health inspector working for the State with migrant farm workers in the potato and apple growing regions of western New York. Tom is a 1972 graduate of Denison University, and completed the Federal Executive Institute's Leadership for a Democratic Society program in 2005. He became a member of the Senior Executive Service in 2008. As evidenced by his long and successful service in SSA's legislative affairs office, Tom has a keen eye for public policy, understanding the need to balance competing objectives in a politically and operationally workable fashion, and always with the Americans who rely on Social Security firmly in mind. We and our staffs have enjoyed working with Tom--one of his gifts is the ability to retain a calm demeanor and a sense of humor no matter what the situation. We have relied greatly on Tom's assistance and wise counsel over the years. We thank him for his service, and we wish him a well-earned retirement. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E950] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMEMORATING THE PUBLIC SERVICE OF TOM PARROTT _____ HON.

JOYCE ANN BROWN _____ HON. MARC A. VEASEY of texas in the house of representatives Tuesday, June 23, 2015 Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Ms. Joyce Ann Brown of Dallas, Texas. Ms. Brown was wrongly convicted of aggravated robbery in 1980 and unfairly served over nine years in prison despite her innocence. Following her release in 1989, Ms. Brown used her story to fight for justice for those wrongly convicted in Texas and around the country. Her passing on June 13, 2015 leaves a void in the city of Dallas and I join the Texas community in giving our condolences to the Brown family. Ms. Brown was raised in Dallas, Texas. In 1980, at the age of 33 she was accused of murder after a local robbery turned violent. Despite eyewitness testimony verifying her alibi, Ms. Brown was wrongfully convicted. Following her conviction, Ms. Brown refused to be a victim of her circumstances and fought for a dignified release. After numerous appeal requests went unanswered, Ms. Brown was finally permitted a re-trial and released on bond on November 3, 1989. After being incarcerated for nearly a decade for a crime she did not commit, she was finally able to see her charges dropped on February 14, 1990. Following her release, Ms. Brown served as an assistant for nine years to Dallas County Commissioner, John Wiley Price and later founded MASS, Mothers/Fathers for the Advancement of Social Systems. Ms. Brown's organization aimed to use her experience and passion to help others who were wrongfully convicted. Ms. Brown spent the remainder of her life advocating on the behalf of currently and formerly incarcerated populations with the goal of promoting their successful reintegration into society. Her autobiography Joyce Brown: Justice Denied remains as a testament to both the events that led to her wrongful conviction and her commitment to ensuring justice for all following her exoneration. In honor of Ms. Joyce Ann Brown, a tireless advocate for justice, this statement will be entered into the congressional record on Tuesday, June 23, 2015. She will be remembered as a leader, trailblazer and true public servant for the state of Texas and beyond. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E950] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF MS.

JOHN R. ROZZO _____ HON. TIM RYAN of ohio in the house of representatives Tuesday, June 23, 2015 Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mr. John R. Rozzo. Mr. Rozzo was highly respected within the community for his career as an educator, his dedication to the community, and his love for his friends and family. John was born on January 17th, 1941 to Samuel and Mary G. Airato Rozzo. He graduated from Girard High School in 1958 and afterwards attended Youngstown State University, where he received his B.S. in Education in 1963. John began teaching social studies and science at St. Edward School in Youngstown in 1962 while working towards his Master's in Education, which he received in 1968 from Westminster College. He eventually went on to serve as principal for St. Edwards School, Our Lady of Mt. Cannel in Niles, St. Dominic Elementary School in Youngstown, and St. Joseph Elementary School in Austintown before retiring in 2011. His legacy as a teacher and administrator lives on through all of his students whose lives he impacted through his work. Mr. Rozzo was also a highly regarded leader. He was a man who constantly sacrificed his time for his community. As an educator, he served as regional superintendent, member of the Trumbull County Parochial Schools Principal's Advisory Board, the Diocesan Board of Education and Athletic Director. At St. Joseph parish, he was a lector, Eucharistic minister, and leader of prayer. Being the advocate for education that he was, John served as judge and checker for the Vindicator Spelling Bee for over 40 years. He also showed a fierce commitment to the Austintown Girls' Softball league by serving as a president, coach, manager and was inducted as a member of their hall of fame. [[Page E951]] St. Joseph Parish named Mr. Rozzo man of the year, a title anyone in the community could agree he undoubtedly deserved. John is survived by his wife of 51 years, the former Janet M. Berard whom he married May 2, 1964; his children, Pamela J. Pasquale, Denise M. Rozzo, Alaina M. Chepke, and John A. Rozzo; his brother and sisters, Phyllis Soroka, Connie Nickell, Anthony Rozzo, Ginny Gustovich and Marilyn Bianco; his aunt, Fran Airato; his 10 grandchildren, his great-granddaughter, Leighton and many nieces, nephews, cousins and friends. John Rozzo leaves behind a great example for all of us to follow as a man of faith, community activism, and true leadership. He will be dearly missed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E950-E951] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF MR.

John began teaching social studies and science at St. Edward School in Youngstown in 1962 while working towards his Master's in Education, which he received in 1968 from Westminster College. He eventually went on to serve as principal for St. Edwards School, Our Lady of Mt.

His legacy as a teacher and administrator lives on through all of his students whose lives he impacted through his work. Mr. Rozzo was also a highly regarded leader. He was a man who constantly sacrificed his time for his community. As an educator, he served as regional superintendent, member of the Trumbull County Parochial Schools Principal's Advisory Board, the Diocesan Board of Education and Athletic Director. At St. Joseph parish, he was a lector, Eucharistic minister, and leader of prayer. Being the advocate for education that he was, John served as judge and checker for the Vindicator Spelling Bee for over 40 years. He also showed a fierce commitment to the Austintown Girls' Softball league by serving as a president, coach, manager and was inducted as a member of their hall of fame.

CREC-2015-06-23-pt1-PgE951,CREC-2015-06-23,114,THE MISSING BLACK MALE,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E951-E952] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE MISSING BLACK MALE _____ HON. BARBARA LEE of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, June 23, 2015 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, as the mother of two black men and grandmother of two black boys, we're here to talk about a crisis in our communities: the crisis of missing black men. In order for us to understand where these men have gone, we must understand the root of the problem. Simply put, too many places in our nation are a tale of two cities. One city is bright, shiny and new-- it's home to new condominiums and fancy restaurants. The other city is littered with boarded up stores, abandoned homes, and too many people without a job and without hope. This disparity did not happen overnight. We've lived with these structural injustices for centuries. But it wasn't until race riots erupted in Watts, Chicago, and Detroit in 1968 that our government began to take notice. After the riots, President Johnson convened the Kerner Commission to investigate the root causes of the unrest. The Commission found a nation ``moving towards two societies, one black, one white, separate and unequal.'' Tragically, this report could have been written last week. In the last 50 years, these structural injustices have barely budged. And black men are still being pushed out of American society. According to a New York Times report published in April, there is an estimated 1.5 million black men aged 24-54 who are simply missing from civic life. Let me repeat--one in six black men have disappeared from civic life. 1.5 million black men missing--that can be hard to visualize. So think about it this way: There are more African-American men missing nationwide than there are African-American men residing in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Detroit, Houston, Washington D.C. and Boston, combined. Let me say that again: There are more African American men missing from our society than black men living in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Detroit, Houston, Washington D.C. and Boston--COMBINED. Many have been lost to our jails and prisons, which disproportionately incarcerate black men. And others have lost their lives far too young. Some are the victims of homicide; others, the victims of a healthcare system that fails to care for them. This is tragic--but it's hardly surprising. The inequity of opportunity for black men starts at birth. More than one in three black children are born into poverty. The cycle of poverty continues in school systems that institutionalize discrimination and racial bias. While black students represent just 18 percent of preschool enrollment, they account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions. We are talking about kids that are 2-5 years old--these kids don't even get a start, let alone a head start. And this crisis of inequality extends from education to the economy itself. Over the past four decades, the average unemployment rate for blacks has been DOUBLE the rate for white Americans. And the current unemployment rate for black men over 20 stands at 10.2 percent--that's higher than the national average at the height of the recent recession. For many black men, it feels like there is a permanent recession. In the world's richest and most powerful nation, it is simply inexcusable for the inequities to persist. Mr. Speaker--this must be our call to action. We must come together like never before to address the systemic inequalities that are endemic in our nation--inequalities that leave black men behind. We know that one in six African American men are missing because they are incarcerated or the victims of premature deaths. To start undoing this crisis, we need a coordinated approach including legislation, local programs and broad national initiatives. We must re-double our support of the President's My Brother's Keeper initiative. I encourage everyone, especially my Congressional colleagues, to encourage your local leaders to engage in this initiative, which builds ladders of opportunity and unlocks the full potential of boys and young men of color through a collaborative public-private partnership. We must also look for innovation solutions that are currently working in our communities and bring them to the national stage. I am proud that Oakland Unified School District, in my congressional district, is the first school district to have a dedicated department to address the needs of African American male students. And we need more like it across the country. These national and local initiatives are working but Congress also has a role. It's past time for us to get serious about addressing the lack of opportunity for black men and boys in this country. Right now--today--in this chamber, there is legislation that can and will start moving the needle. Legislation that will create real, good-paying jobs--legislation that will give everyone a fair chance at a job--legislation that will ensure a college degree is within reach for everyone, regardless of where they were born or what race they are. Legislation that will bring health equity and reform our broken criminal justice system. In my role as co-chair of the CBC Task Force on Poverty and the Economy and Chair of the Democratic Whip's Task Force on Poverty, Income Inequality, and Opportunity, I am proud to be working with more than 100 of my colleagues, to advance policies that give black men--and really all Americans--a fair shot This work includes the Half in Ten Act (H.R. 258)--which would develop a national strategy to cut poverty in half the next decade. That's more than 22 million Americans lifted out of poverty and into the middle class in just the next 10 years by being strategic and coordinating our existing programs. We also need to raise the minimum wage--and fight for a living wage because too many Americans are working full time and still struggling to make ends meet. I am proud to cosponsor Congressman Al Green's The Original Living Wage Act (H.R. 122) and Congressman Scott's Raise the Wage Act (H.R. 2150), legislation that would increase the minimum wage for federal workers and the national minimum wage to $12 by 2020, respectively. We also need to fight against the disparities that persist in our health care system. The Affordable Care Act was a good start but more is needed. For years, the Congressional tri-caucus has championed this effort by introducing The Health Equity and Accountability Act (HEAA). Congresswoman Robin Kelly will have the honor in introducing this important legislation this Congress and I am proud to co-lead this effort as co-chair of the CAPAC Health Task Force. This important legislation builds on the Affordable Care Act and puts us on track to eliminate health disparities in our country. Lastly, we need to empower communities to build greater trust between law enforcement and communities of color. And we need to address chronic recidivism, which would be a huge step towards returning some of our ``missing'' men home to their families and communities. That is why Congress should pass the bipartisan Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act (H.R. 1232), which I am a proud cosponsor of, to stop the militarization of our nation's police forces. We need to pass the Police Accountability Act (H.R. 1102) and the Grand Jury Reform Act (H.R. 429) so we can ensure that deadly force cases are heard by a judge and there is more accountability among police officers. I was also proud to lead a letter, signed by 72 of my colleagues, urging the President to adopt a fair chance hiring policy at the federal level for individuals who have been previously incarcerated. A fair chance hiring policy would level the playing field and help stop the cycle of recidivism that's plaguing our communities. This is simply the right thing to do: the federal government shouldn't put up barriers to work for those trying to rebuild their lives after making a mistake. It is vital that Congress acts to ensure the tragedies in Ferguson, Staten Island, Oakland--in my district--and now Baltimore are not repeated. Mr. Speaker, we can end the phenomenon of the missing black male. We must keep calling for action. As Dr. King said in his ``Two Americas'' speech that he gave on April 14th, 1968 at Stanford University: `We must come to see that social progress never rolls in on the wheels of inevitability. It comes through the tireless efforts and the persistent work of dedicated individuals.' We must each be those dedicated individuals working for the social progress that is so desperately needed. I urge my colleagues: act and act now--too much is at stake.

Mr. Speaker--this must be our call to action. We must come together like never before to address the systemic inequalities that are endemic in our nation--inequalities that leave black men behind. We know that one in six African American men are missing because they are incarcerated or the victims of premature deaths. To start undoing this crisis, we need a coordinated approach including legislation, local programs and broad national initiatives. We must re-double our support of the President's My Brother's Keeper initiative. I encourage everyone, especially my Congressional colleagues, to encourage your local leaders to engage in this initiative, which builds ladders of opportunity and unlocks the full potential of boys and young men of color through a collaborative public-private partnership. We must also look for innovation solutions that are currently working in our communities and bring them to the national stage. I am proud that Oakland Unified School District, in my congressional district, is the first school district to have a dedicated department to address the needs of African American male students. And we need more like it across the country. These national and local initiatives are working but Congress also has a role. It's past time for us to get serious about addressing the lack of opportunity for black men and boys in this country. Right now--today--in this chamber, there is legislation that can and will start moving the needle. Legislation that will create real, good-paying jobs--legislation that will give everyone a fair chance at a job--legislation that will ensure a college degree is within reach for everyone, regardless of where they were born or what race they are. Legislation that will bring health equity and reform our broken criminal justice system. In my role as co-chair of the CBC Task Force on Poverty and the Economy and Chair of the Democratic Whip's Task Force on Poverty, Income Inequality, and Opportunity, I am proud to be working with more than 100 of my colleagues, to advance policies that give black men--and really all Americans--a fair shot This work includes the Half in Ten Act (H.R. 258)--which would develop a national strategy to cut poverty in half the next decade. That's more than 22 million Americans lifted out of poverty and into the middle class in just the next 10 years by being strategic and coordinating our existing programs. We also need to raise the minimum wage--and fight for a living wage because too many Americans are working full time and still struggling to make ends meet. I am proud to cosponsor Congressman Al Green's The Original Living Wage Act (H.R. 122) and Congressman Scott's Raise the Wage Act (H.R. 2150), legislation that would increase the minimum wage for federal workers and the national minimum wage to $12 by 2020, respectively. We also need to fight against the disparities that persist in our health care system. The Affordable Care Act was a good start but more is needed. For years, the Congressional tri-caucus has championed this effort by introducing The Health Equity and Accountability Act (HEAA). Congresswoman Robin Kelly will have the honor in introducing this important legislation this Congress and I am proud to co-lead this effort as co-chair of the CAPAC Health Task Force. This important legislation builds on the Affordable Care Act and puts us on track to eliminate health disparities in our country. Lastly, we need to empower communities to build greater trust between law enforcement and communities of color. And we need to address chronic recidivism, which would be a huge step towards returning some of our ``missing'' men home to their families and communities. That is why Congress should pass the bipartisan Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act (H.R. 1232), which I am a proud cosponsor of, to stop the militarization of our nation's police forces. We need to pass the Police Accountability Act (H.R. 1102) and the Grand Jury Reform Act (H.R. 429) so we can ensure that deadly force cases are heard by a judge and there is more accountability among police officers. I was also proud to lead a letter, signed by 72 of my colleagues, urging the President to adopt a fair chance hiring policy at the federal level for individuals who have been previously incarcerated. A fair chance hiring policy would level the playing field and help stop the cycle of recidivism that's plaguing our communities. This is simply the right thing to do: the federal government shouldn't put up barriers to work for those trying to rebuild their lives after making a mistake. It is vital that Congress acts to ensure the tragedies in Ferguson, Staten Island, Oakland--in my district--and now Baltimore are not repeated. Mr. Speaker, we can end the phenomenon of the missing black male. We must keep calling for action. As Dr. King said in his ``Two Americas'' speech that he gave on April 14th, 1968 at Stanford University: `We must come to see that social progress never rolls in on the wheels of inevitability. It comes through the tireless efforts and the persistent work of dedicated individuals.' We must each be those dedicated individuals working for the social progress that is so desperately needed. I urge my colleagues: act and act now--too much is at stake.

congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] the missing black male _____ hon. barbara lee of california in the house of representatives tuesday, june 23, 2015 ms. lee. mr. speaker, as the mother of two black men and grandmother of two black boys, we're here to talk about a crisis in our communities: the crisis of missing black men. in order for us to understand where these men have gone, we must understand the root of the problem. simply put, too many places in our nation are a tale of two cities. one city is bright, shiny and new-- it's home to new condominiums and fancy restaurants. the other city is littered with boarded up stores, abandoned homes, and too many people without a job and without hope. this disparity did not happen overnight. we've lived with these structural injustices for centuries. but it wasn't until race riots erupted in watts, chicago, and detroit in 1968 that our government began to take notice. after the riots, president johnson convened the kerner commission to investigate the root causes of the unrest. the commission found a nation ``moving towards two societies, one black, one white, separate and unequal.'' tragically, this report could have been written last week. in the last 50 years, these structural injustices have barely budged. and black men are still being pushed out of american society. according to a new york times report published in april, there is an estimated 1.5 million black men aged 24-54 who are simply missing from civic life. let me repeat--one in six black men have disappeared from civic life. 1.5 million black men missing--that can be hard to visualize. so think about it this way: there are more african-american men missing nationwide than there are african-american men residing in los angeles, philadelphia, detroit, houston, washington d.c. and boston, combined. let me say that again: there are more african american men missing from our society than black men living in los angeles, philadelphia, detroit, houston, washington d.c. and boston--combined. many have been lost to our jails and prisons, which disproportionately incarcerate black men. and others have lost their lives far too young. some are the victims of homicide; others, the victims of a healthcare system that fails to care for them. this is tragic--but it's hardly surprising. the inequity of opportunity for black men starts at birth. more than one in three black children are born into poverty. the cycle of poverty continues in school systems that institutionalize discrimination and racial bias. while black students represent just 18 percent of preschool enrollment, they account for 42 percent of preschool student expulsions. we are talking about kids that are 2-5 years old--these kids don't even get a start, let alone a head start. and this crisis of inequality extends from education to the economy itself. over the past four decades, the average unemployment rate for blacks has been double the rate for white americans. and the current unemployment rate for black men over 20 stands at 10.2 percent--that's higher than the national average at the height of the recent recession. for many black men, it feels like there is a permanent recession. in the world's richest and most powerful nation, it is simply inexcusable for the inequities to persist. mr. speaker--this must be our call to action. we must come together like never before to address the systemic inequalities that are endemic in our nation--inequalities that

CREC-2015-06-23-pt1-PgE952-2,CREC-2015-06-23,114,"IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 615, THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY INTEROPERABLE COMMUNICATIONS","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E952] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 615, THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY INTEROPERABLE COMMUNICATIONS _____ HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Tuesday, June 23, 2015 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Concur in the Senate Amendment to H.R. 615, the Homeland Security Interoperable Communications Act for three reasons. The bill would address interoperability among information technology systems and radio communications systems to exchange voice, data, and video in real time. First, the bill will save lives of first responders and those they seek to help; Second, the legislation is necessary to create a seamless level of communication among Department of Homeland Security components that are first responders to a terrorist attack, natural or manmade disaster; and finally to meet the technological challenges of bridging the communication divide between different communications systems used by first responders within the Department of Homeland Security. As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, I am well aware, as are many of my colleagues, of the essential and lifesaving role of communications during a crisis. Because the tragedy of September 11, 2001, was compounded by communication failures among the brave first responders who entered the burning towers that comprised the World Trade Center it has been an imperative of the Homeland Security Committee to address first responder communication interoperability challenges. The number of first responders lost on that single day was the greatest loss of first responders at any single event in U.S. History: 343 New York City Fire Department firefighters; 23 New York City Police Department officers; 37 Port Authority Police Department officers; 15 EMTs and 3 court officers were casualties of the attacks. The need for this bill authored by Congressman Payne is evident. The City of Houston covers over a 1000 square mile region in Southeast Texas. It has a night-time population of nearly two million people, which peaks with over three million daytime inhabitants. The City of Houston's 9-1-1 Emergency Center manages nearly 9,000 emergency calls per day. The volume of emergency calls can easily double during times of inclement weather or special City social/ sporting events like Hurricanes Ike in September 2008; and Katrina as well as Rita, which occurred in September and October of 2005). Annually, one out of every ten citizens uses EMS. There are over 200,000 EMS incidents involving over 225,000 patients or potential patients annually. On the average, EMS responds to a citizen every 3 minutes. Each EMS response is made by one of 88 City of Houston EMS vehicles. In 2013, the City of Houston's fire Department lost Captain EMT Matthew Renaud, Engineer Operator EMT Robert Bebee, Firefighter EMT Robert Garner and Probationary Firefighter Anne Sullivan when they responded to a hotel fire. Throughout the history of the Houston Police Department over 110 officers have lost their lives in the line of duty. Each member of the House of Representatives knows of the loss of a first responder who was going to the aid of those in harm's way. This bill will offer additional resources to the first responders of the Department of Homeland Security. The bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to include among the responsibilities of the Under Secretary for Management responsibilities with respect to policies and directives to achieve and maintain interoperable communications among the components of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Under Secretary of Homeland Security would submit to the House and Senate Homeland Security Committees a strategy, which shall be updated as necessary, for achieving and maintaining interoperable communications, including for daily operations, planned events, and emergencies, with corresponding milestones, that includes: An assessment of interoperability gaps in radio communications DHS components, as of this Act's enactment date; Information on DHS efforts and activities, including current and planned policies, directives, and training, since November 1, 2012, to achieve and maintain interoperable communications, and planned efforts and activities to achieve and maintain interoperable communications; An assessment of obstacles and challenges to achieving and maintaining interoperable communications; Information on, and an assessment of, the adequacy of mechanisms available to the Under Secretary to enforce and compel compliance with interoperable communications policies and directives of DHS; Guidance provided to DHS components to implement interoperable communications policies and directives; The total amount of funds expended by DHS since November 1, 2012, and projected future expenditures, to achieve interoperable communications; and Dates upon which DHS-wide interoperability is projected to be achieved for voice, data, and video communications, respectively, and interim milestones. The bill ensures that the Department of Homeland Security would conduct a survey of intra-agency efforts or task forces that have been delegated responsibilities for achieving and maintaining interoperable communications, and report on the status of these efforts, including: Progress on each interim milestone; information on any policies, directives, guidance, and training established by the Under Secretary of Homeland Security; an assessment of the level of compliance, adoption, and participation among the DHS components with the policies, directives, guidance, and training established by the Under Secretary; and information on any additional resources or authorities needed by the Under Secretary. This bill will ensure that the Department of Homeland Security's first responders are prepared to meet the challenges of manmade or natural disasters. I ask my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of H.R. 615. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E952] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 615, THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY INTEROPERABLE COMMUNICATIONS _____ HON.

CREC-2015-06-23-pt1-PgE953-2,CREC-2015-06-23,114,TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE DAMON J. KEITH,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E953-E954] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE DAMON J. KEITH _____ HON. SANDER M. LEVIN of michigan in the house of representatives Tuesday, June 23, 2015 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a proud son of Detroit, Michigan and a true icon in the law and in the civil rights movement, The Honorable Damon J. Keith. Judge Keith, a Senior Judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, is the subject of a new film entitled ``Walk with Me: The Trials of Damon J. Keith.'' The world premiere of the film took place in Detroit on June 17, 2015. It is truly fitting that Judge Keith's story be told, and that his contributions to our country be more widely known. The grandson of slaves, Judge Keith was born on July 4, 1922, in Detroit. Judge Keith's father worked in a Ford factory, and pushed his son to be the first person in his family to attend college. Judge Keith lived up to his father's expectations, graduating from West Virginia State College in 1943. He was drafted into the Army during World War Two after graduating, and he served in a segregated unit in Europe. His experience in Europe as well as upon his return to the U.S. had a significant impact on him. As he told the Detroit Free Press in 2013, . . . ``after the war was over and I returned to the States, I could see white German soldiers riding in the front of the bus and going into restaurants in the States that said 'for whites only.' '' This spurred Judge Keith to pursue a legal career. Judge Keith attended the Howard University School of Law, where he was mentored by future U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. He received his degree in 1949 and returned to Detroit, where he later earned a Master of Laws from Wayne State University. In 1964, he founded one of the first African American law firms in Detroit. That same year, Judge Keith was elected co-chair of the Michigan Civil Rights Commission. The late Judge John Feikens served as the other co- chair and my brother Carl as general counsel where he observed firsthand Damon Keith's exceptional dedication to civil rights for all Americans. Just three years later, at the recommendation of U.S. Senator Phil Hart, President Lyndon Johnson nominated him for appointment to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. After serving as Chief Judge of the District Court, in 1977 President Jimmy Carter nominated him to the Sixth Circuit. He was confirmed, and he remains there today. His jurisprudence is notable for the number of landmark cases which came before him. Several of those cases had to do with issues of race and segregation, including Davis v. School District of the City of Pontiac in 1970, which was the first case in the North in which a federal court ordered integration, and Baker v. City of Detroit in 1979, in which he ordered the Detroit Police Department to carry out Mayor Coleman Young's plan to integrate the department. One of the other cases for which he is known is U.S. v. Sinclair in 1971, in which he ruled that President Richard Nixon and the Attorney General had no right to wiretap individuals in domestic security matters without a court order. The Sixth Circuit upheld Judge Keith's decision, as did the U.S. Supreme Court in U.S. v. U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, which became known as the Keith case. And in 2002, Judge Keith wrote the Sixth Circuit opinion upholding a lower court decision in Detroit Free Press v. Ashcroft, which held that the Justice Department could not prevent the press and the public from witnessing deportation hearings of people suspected of having ties to terrorism. Recognizing his leadership despite a difference in judicial philosophy, in 1987 Chief Justice William Rehnquist named Judge Keith as National Chairman of the Judicial Conference Committee on the Bicentennial of the Constitution. In this role, Judge Keith led his colleagues throughout the country in efforts to promote the bicentennial of our nation's foundational document. In addition to his intelligence and his deep belief in the importance of equality for all people, Judge Keith is known for his respectful nature and his fundamental fairness. The director of ``Walk With Me,'' Jesse Nasser, recently told the Detroit Free Press, ``You're hard pressed to find anybody, whether he ruled for them or ruled against them, nobody will say a bad thing about him. Trust me, we tried. If we interviewed someone who was on the losing side of a case he ruled on, the first thing they'd say is, `Before we get started, let me go on the record saying Judge Keith is an incredibly fair judge and an incredible human being.' '' Just as the legendary Justice Thurgood Marshall mentored a young Damon Keith, so too has Judge Keith helped to guide many young people who, after having clerked for him, have gone on to achieve great things. Among those clerked for Judge Keith are Judge Eric L. Clay, who serves with Judge [[Page E954]] Keith on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals; former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm; Lani Guinier, the first African American woman to receive a tenured professorship at Harvard Law School; and Jocelyn Benson, the Dean of Wayne State University Law School, which is home to the Damon J. Keith Center for Civil Rights and the Damon J. Keith Collection of African American Legal History. Mr. Speaker, perhaps the most quoted line of all of Judge Keith's decisions came from Detroit Free Press v. Ashcroft, in which he wrote that ``Democracy dies behind closed doors.'' Judge Keith has devoted his life to opening doors for all in society, and indeed in ensuring that all who serve in government are accountable to the principles upon which our nation was founded, and which have been enhanced and enriched over time. I encourage my colleagues to join me in thanking Judge Damon J. Keith for his truly excellent and inspirational service to our nation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E953-E954] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE DAMON J.

CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH of new jersey in the house of representatives Thursday, June 18, 2015 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, Medicare and Social Security are our nation's sacred trusts with seniors and disabled Americans. Senior citizens in New Jersey and [[Page E953]] across the county have worked hard throughout their lives to provide for their families and help build our communities, all while making their fair and full contributions of taxes into the programs. It is our duty to respect these sacrifices and ensure that programs continue to deliver on promises made. To that end, I was proud to cosponsor and support today's House passage of H.R. 1190, the Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act of 2015. This bipartisan legislation would completely repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), an unelected and unaccountable board of fifteen bureaucrats who would possess the power to determine what to pay doctors who provide critical treatments and services under Medicare. Created under the fundamentally flawed and wildly unpopular Affordable Care Act (ACA)--or Obamacare--IPAB's recommendations would be considered under fast track procedures that would limit critical Congressional input and oversight. Whether or not it is called rationing, IPAB's mandated focus on short-term savings could result in deep cuts to physician payments and ultimately lead doctors to stop seeing Medicare beneficiaries--seriously undermining seniors' healthcare decision making process and jeopardizing their access to lifesaving and quality care. The repeal of IPAB will allow Congress to continue focusing on policies to ensure that Medicare is sustainable for both current and future generations. Last week I was pleased to support four bills--H.R. 2505, H.R. 2507, H.R. 2570, and H.R. 2582--that strengthen and improve Medicare Advantage (MA). These bills will ensure increased transparency and accessibility to the popular MA program which provides millions of Medicare beneficiaries with affordable, comprehensive, and innovative care plans. Medicare is an absolutely critical component for the delivery of affordable, quality healthcare services for American seniors--and I will continue to advocate for legislation that properly supports Medicare. Seniors and disabled individuals deserve better than an unelected board of bureaucrats that will only serve to cut payments, ultimately resulting in the denial of certain treatments and services and reduced access to care. Congress must remain focused on solutions that ensure Medicare is sustainable for current and future generations, and the repeal of IPAB is critical first step. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E952-E953] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PROTECTING SENIORS' ACCESS TO MEDICARE ACT OF 2015 ______ speech of HON.

Senior citizens in New Jersey and [[Page E953]] across the county have worked hard throughout their lives to provide for their families and help build our communities, all while making their fair and full contributions of taxes into the programs. It is our duty to respect these sacrifices and ensure that programs continue to deliver on promises made. To that end, I was proud to cosponsor and support today's House passage of H.R. 1190, the Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act of 2015. This bipartisan legislation would completely repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), an unelected and unaccountable board of fifteen bureaucrats who would possess the power to determine what to pay doctors who provide critical treatments and services under Medicare. Created under the fundamentally flawed and wildly unpopular Affordable Care Act (ACA)--or Obamacare--IPAB's recommendations would be considered under fast track procedures that would limit critical Congressional input and oversight. Whether or not it is called rationing, IPAB's mandated focus on short-term savings could result in deep cuts to physician payments and ultimately lead doctors to stop seeing Medicare beneficiaries--seriously undermining seniors' healthcare decision making process and jeopardizing their access to lifesaving and quality care. The repeal of IPAB will allow Congress to continue focusing on policies to ensure that Medicare is sustainable for both current and future generations. Last week I was pleased to support four bills--H.R. 2505, H.R. 2507, H.R. 2570, and H.R. 2582--that strengthen and improve Medicare Advantage (MA). These bills will ensure increased transparency and accessibility to the popular MA program which provides millions of Medicare beneficiaries with affordable, comprehensive, and innovative care plans. Medicare is an absolutely critical component for the delivery of affordable, quality healthcare services for American seniors--and I will continue to advocate for legislation that properly supports Medicare. Seniors and disabled individuals deserve better than an unelected board of bureaucrats that will only serve to cut payments, ultimately resulting in the denial of certain treatments and services and reduced access to care. Congress must remain focused on solutions that ensure Medicare is sustainable for current and future generations, and the repeal of IPAB is critical first step. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E952-E953] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PROTECTING SENIORS' ACCESS TO MEDICARE ACT OF 2015 ______ speech of HON.

DORIS O. MATSUI of california in the house of representatives Tuesday, June 23, 2015 Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Fox & Goose Public House as they celebrate their 40th anniversary. As its owners, staff, and loyal patrons gather to celebrate this wonderful occasion, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in recognizing and honoring the Fox & Goose for their contributions to the Sacramento Region. Modeled after the famous public house bearing the same name in the English town of Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, Sacramento's Fox & Goose has become a similarly thriving institution. Founders Bill and Denise Dalton, along with their daughter and current owner Allyson Dalton, have successfully created a tradition of excellent quality and service that is an integral part of Sacramento's dining scene. Since its grand opening on January 15, 1975, Fox & Goose has truly embodied its name as a public house by providing a gathering place for all to visit with friends, unwind with a traditional English or American meal and enjoy their wide range of fine beers, wines, and Scotch. Every time that I am home, I find time to stop by for breakfast and enjoy one of their famous olallieberry scones. Over its 40 year history, Fox & Goose has received a number of accomplishments and accolades. The restaurant is widely regarded to have the ``Best Breakfast'' in Sacramento, winning awards and honors in this category many times, and from a number of different publications. Additionally, Fox & Goose's Open Mic and Pub Quiz nights have provided a great deal of entertainment for many in the Sacramento community to enjoy. The environment created by Bill and Denise, and sustained by Allyson, has also become the centerpiece of the revitalization of Sacramento's historic R Street. Mr. Speaker, as patrons gather for their 40th anniversary celebration, I am pleased to honor and recognize Fox & Goose for its important role in enhancing Sacramento's community. I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing them continued success and thanking them for their service to the Sacramento region. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E953] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF FOX & GOOSE _____ HON.

CHRIS VAN HOLLEN of maryland in the house of representatives Tuesday, June 23, 2015 Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2685, the FY16 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill. While I commend the House Appropriations Committee's support for our servicemembers and our national defense, I have serious concerns about the way this bill funds our military operations. As was the case with last month's National Defense Authorization Act, this appropriations bill uses the Overseas Contingency Operations budget as a backdoor loophole to get around sequestration by funding $38 billion of the Pentagon's regular base budget activities with war funds--a blatant abuse of the budget process. Just last year, House Republicans criticized the abuse of the OCO loophole in their budget report, stating that it ``undermines the integrity of the budget process'' and that the Budget Committee would ``oppose increases above the levels the Administration and our military commanders say are needed to carry out operations unless it can be clearly demonstrated that such amounts are war-related.'' Moreover, in following the strategy of the Republican budget, this legislation begins the process of locking in sequestration for nondefense programs, which will have a devastating impact on investments critical to the nation. We need to get back to the table to have an honest debate about our budget and renegotiate the funding caps for both defense and nondefense. Only then will we be able to provide the necessary resources for our national security needs and to ensure we keep the nation's commitments to education, research, infrastructure, and other crucial drivers of economic prosperity. I also have serious concerns with a number of other provisions contained in this legislation. I strongly object to a measure which provides $600 million to train and equip the so-called ``moderate'' Syrian rebels. As I have urged repeatedly, this initiative could have unintended negative consequences that will not serve our ultimate goal of defeating ISIS. Unfortunately, an amendment offered to strip this funding was not adopted. I strongly oppose sections 8100, 8101, and 8102 of this bill, which prohibit funding for the transfer of Guantanamo Bay detainees to both the United States and abroad. While we must pursue and prosecute terrorists that seek to do us harm, this facility--and the conduct within its walls--have only served to hurt our nation in the eyes of the world. It is simply un-American to hold individuals without charging them for a crime. I was disappointed that amendments offered by Congressman Nadler to strike these sections from the legislation were defeated. I also object to the inclusion of unrequested funding for many weapons systems, including $1 billion for additional Army vehicles and weapons systems that the Pentagon said was not necessary. I appreciate that this bill contains a Sense of Congress stating that this body has a Constitutional duty to debate and decide when to authorize the use of military force in the fight against ISIL. I support many aspects of the military operations the President is currently conducting against ISIL, including the use of American air power against ISIL targets and in support of Iraqi and Kurdish forces, as well as the deployment of limited numbers of American troops to help train and equip those forces. However, it has now been ten months since the President sent troops into Iraq and Syria and four months since the President sent Congress a proposed AUMF to combat ISIL. The President himself said he wanted to revise and ultimately repeal both the 2001 AUMF and 2002 AUMF yet we continue to rely on them as justification for our ongoing military operations. We owe it to our troops and the American people to pass a narrowly tailored AUMF that provides the authority necessary to degrade and defeat ISIL without dragging the United States into another unnecessary ground war in the Middle East. For those reasons, I was disappointed that two amendments offered by Congresswoman Lee to sunset the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against and Al-Qaeda and associated forces and the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq were not adopted. In addition, an amendment offered by Congressman Schiff to prohibit the use of funds for Operation Inherent Resolve in the absence of an AUMF to combat ISIL after March 31, 2016 was defeated. Despite my opposition to the overall legislation, I was pleased that a bipartisan amendment introduced by Rep. Massie and Rep. Lofgren to limit funding for many backdoor programs within Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act passed. I also support the increased 2.3 percent pay raise for our troops and their families. Finally, I support the inclusion of full funding of the President's request for U.S.-Israel Iron Dome missile defense program. While this bill does provide much needed funding for programs that benefit our men and women in uniform, ultimately, it falls short in too many areas. It is my hope that many of my objections will be resolved in Conference with the Senate but I can't support it in its current form. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E954] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN OPPOSITION TO H.R. 2685, THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATION FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016 _____ HON.

sequestration for nondefense programs, which will have a devastating impact on investments critical to the nation. we need to get back to the table to have an honest debate about our budget and renegotiate the funding caps for both defense and nondefense. only then will we be able to provide the necessary resources for our national security needs and to ensure we keep the nation's commitments to education, research, infrastructure, and other crucial drivers of economic prosperity. i also have serious concerns with a number of other provisions contained in this legislation. i strongly object to a measure which provides $600 million to train and equip the so-called ``moderate'' syrian rebels. as i have urged repeatedly, this initiative could have unintended negative consequences that will not serve our ultimate goal of defeating isis. unfortunately, an amendment offered to strip this funding was not adopted. i strongly oppose sections 8100, 8101, and 8102 of this bill, which prohibit funding for the transfer of guantanamo bay detainees to both the united states and abroad. while we must pursue and prosecute terrorists that seek to do us harm, this facility--and the conduct within its walls--have only served to hurt our nation in the eyes of the world. it is simply un-american to hold individuals without charging them for a crime. i was disappointed that amendments offered by congressman nadler to strike these sections from the legislation were defeated. i also object to the inclusion of unrequested funding for many weapons systems, including $1 billion for additional army vehicles and weapons systems that the pentagon said was not necessary. i appreciate that this bill contains a sense of congress stating that this body has a constitutional duty to debate and decide when to authorize the use of military force in the fight against isil. i support many aspects of the military operations the president is currently conducting against isil, including the use of american air power against isil targets and in support of iraqi and kurdish forces, as well as the deployment of limited numbers of american troops to help train and equip those forces. however, it has now been ten months since the president sent troops into iraq and syria and four months since the president sent congress a proposed aumf to combat isil. the president himself said he wanted to revise and ultimately repeal both the 2001 aumf and 2002 aumf yet we continue to rely on them as justification for our ongoing military operations. we owe it to our troops and the american people to pass a narrowly tailored aumf that provides the authority necessary to degrade and defeat isil without dragging the united states into another unnecessary ground war in the middle east. for those reasons, i was disappointed that two amendments offered by congresswoman lee to sunset the 2001 authorization for use of military force against and al-qaeda and associated forces and the 2002 authorization for use of military force against iraq were not adopted. in addition, an amendment offered by congressman schiff to prohibit the use of funds for operation inherent resolve in the absence of an aumf to combat isil after march 31, 2016 was defeated. despite my opposition to the overall legislation, i was pleased that a bipartisan amendment introduced by rep. massie and rep. lofgren to limit funding for many backdoor programs within section 702 of the fisa amendments act passed. i also support the increased 2.3 percent pay raise for our troops and their families. finally, i support the inclusion of full funding of the president's request for u.s.-israel iron dome missile defense program. while this bill does provide much needed funding for programs that benefit our men and women in uniform, ultimately, it falls short in too many areas. it is my hope that many of my objections will be resolved in conference with the senate but i can't support it in its current form. ____________________",5512

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Tuesday, June 23, 2015 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to speak out against the senseless loss of innocent lives resulting from another senseless act of violence. My thoughts and prayers go out to the people of Charleston, South Carolina, the members of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, pastored by the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, who was one of nine persons slain by a gunman motivated by hate. Although tragedy has found its way into the lives of the individuals murdered and the lives of their families there has been some good found in this tragic loss. Mr. Speaker, the legislature of South Carolina has decided to debate whether to remove the flag from the front of the State House building after public support from prominent legislators, community organizations, and the Governor of South Carolina have called for the flag to come down now. When considering the removal of the flag the people must remember the nine lives that were lost due to senseless, insensitive, and hateful feelings that were influenced by the traditions represented by the Confederate flag. The Confederate flag has been used as a symbol of hate, exclusion, and a brutally offensive past. South Carolina should follow in the footsteps of Texas which refused to authorize license plates with the confederate flag on them, a decision upheld last week by the U.S. Supreme Court. Mr. Speaker, Wal Mart, Amazon, Sears, and eBay all have made a decision to stop selling Confederate flag merchandise. The Confederate flag does not represent the future of our great country. We must embrace a spirit of inclusion and goodwill with a mission to eradicate hate and ignorance. We can no longer allow our past to dictate our future, and must use this tragedy as an opportunity to eliminate symbols of hate that permeate through our society. [[Page E955]] Mr. Speaker, as a country we must recognize the emotional pain attached to the Confederate flag, stand strong together and not allow a symbol of hate continue to divide our nation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E954-E955] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING THE SOUTH CAROLINA SHOOTING AND REMOVAL OF THE CONFEDERATE FLAG _____ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize another step forward in the great relationship between the United States and Taiwan. This past Friday, June 19th, EVA Air began offering direct flights from Taipei, Taiwan to Houston, Texas. The inaugural flight, number BR- 52, arrived at George Bush Intercontinental Airport shortly after 4:00 pm on June 19th. This is the beginning of weekly direct flights from Taipei to Houston. In June there will be three flights a week which will be increased to four flights a week in July. EVA Air is looking to serve the Taiwanese community of the Houston area by offering these direct flights multiple times per week. These communities are an important part of Texas and I am pleased that EVA Air has further facilitated travel between our nations. EVA Air operates out of Taiwan and is their second largest airline. According to the JACDEC Airline Safety Rankings for 2015 (based on 2014 data), EVA is the 3rd safest airline in the world. Taiwan and the United States already have an outstanding relationship that was codified with the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) of 1979. The TRA was created to allow our two nations to foster close ties and specifically ``commercial, cultural, and other relations between the people of the United States and the people on Taiwan.'' The TRA enables our two nations to work and partner with one another in a way that is unique from all other nations, and these weekly flights between Taiwan and Houston are just the latest example of how compliance with the TRA continues to benefit our citizens 36 years after its passage. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E955] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING EVA AIRLINES DIRECT FLIGHTS FROM TAIWAN TO HOUSTON _____ HON.

The TRA enables our two nations to work and partner with one another in a way that is unique from all other nations, and these weekly flights between Taiwan and Houston are just the latest example of how compliance with the TRA continues to benefit our citizens 36 years after its passage. ____________________",package_114_266.csv,1967,1967,2035,"[congressional record volume 161, number 101 (tuesday, june 23, 2015)] [extensions of remarks] [page e955] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] recognizing eva airlines direct flights from taiwan to houston _____ hon. brian babin of texas in the house of representatives tuesday, june 23, 2015 mr. babin. mr. speaker, i rise to recognize another step forward in the great relationship between the united states and taiwan. this past friday, june 19th, eva air began offering direct flights from taipei, taiwan to houston, texas. the inaugural flight, number br- 52, arrived at george bush intercontinental airport shortly after 4:00 pm on june 19th. this is the beginning of weekly direct flights from taipei to houston. in june there will be three flights a week which will be increased to four flights a week in july. eva air is looking to serve the taiwanese community of the houston area by offering these direct flights multiple times per week. these communities are an important part of texas and i am pleased that eva air has further facilitated travel between our nations. eva air operates out of taiwan and is their second largest airline. according to the jacdec airline safety rankings for 2015 (based on 2014 data), eva is the 3rd safest airline in the world. taiwan and the united states already have an outstanding relationship that was codified with the taiwan relations act (tra) of 1979. the tra was created to allow our two nations to foster close ties and specifically ``commercial, cultural, and other relations between the people of the united states and the people on taiwan.'' the tra enables our two nations to work and partner with one another in a way that is unique from all other nations, and these weekly flights between taiwan and houston are just the latest example of how compliance with the tra continues to benefit our citizens 36 years after its passage. ____________________",1967

Mr. Speaker, as of today, we have only 3 more legislative days to act in order to re-authorize the Export-Import Bank. Re-authorizing the bank is common sense. Sadly, however, the opponents of the bank are operating out of ideological fervor, not facts. We should be here dealing with and solving real problems, not endangering American jobs with fantastical ideology. Contrary to the many assertions made against the Bank, the bank is an unbridled, market-driven success story which has long enjoyed bipartisan support and support from both unions and business alike. The truth of the matter is that the bank is a vital free market economic engine for our manufacturers, exporters and job creators. This March alone, the Bank financed over $1.1 million dollars in exports in my South Texas District. Additionally, the Bank has supported thousands of jobs in my district over the past five years. These are good jobs in a very high-need area that would not have been possible without the Bank. In my home State of Texas, the Bank has financed $4 billion worth of exports last year supporting thousands of hard working Americans. We cannot and should not let the bank expire.

JAMES P. McGOVERN of massachusetts in the house of representatives Tuesday, June 23, 2015 Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the end of an era at Frontier Regional School in Deerfield, Massachusetts. After 35 years at Frontier, yesterday eighth grade science teacher Kathleen Sheehan retired. Kathy, or Sheehan, as her students call her, over the years wore a variety of hats and held a variety of teaching positions. She has served her entire teaching career at Frontier. Over her 35 years she has held many leadership positions, including Science Department Chair, Middle School Team Leader, Field Hockey Coach, and President of the Frontier's Teacher's Association. Sheehan's impact and influence on the students and communities of Deerfield, Conway, Whately and Sunderland extended far beyond the classroom. Always challenging her students to make the most of their education both inside and outside of the classroom, Sheehan proved a role model having taken her own advice. In 2003, she earned her law degree from Western New England College School of Law and immediately put her legal skills to use helping other teachers across the Commonwealth through the Massachusetts Teachers Association. She plans to continue this role as she transitions out of the classroom and onto retirement. Finally, Sheehan's commitment extends not just beyond the classroom, but beyond the school year. As students move on from her middle school classroom, she continues to foster relationships and offer guidance as they navigate high school and plan for college. Once graduated, she continues to stay connected to and support her students. She will happily tell you how many college graduations, advanced-degree graduations, and weddings she has attended of former students. Sheehan values community and has tirelessly integrated herself into that of Western Massachusetts. As we all know, teachers are a vital asset to society. As a role model for students and teachers alike, Sheehan will leave a legacy behind at Frontier which is unmatched by any other. On behalf of my constituents that attend and have graduated from Frontier Regional School, I thank Kathy Sheehan for her commitment to education, her students and the community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 101 (Tuesday, June 23, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E955] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING KATHLEEN SHEEHAN _____ HON.
