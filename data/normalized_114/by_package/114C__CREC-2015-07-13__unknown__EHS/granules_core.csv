CREC-2015-07-13-pt1-PgH5092-2,CREC-2015-07-13,114,THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS DENYING JUSTICE TO VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [House] [Pages H5092-H5093] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS DENYING JUSTICE TO VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) for 5 minutes. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Department of Justice is failing rape victims. Across America, an estimated 400,000 untested rape kits sit on shelves. Government officials long blamed a lack of resources to test the kits; so Congress fixed this problem in the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, as it is called. VAWA included the Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Reporting Act, or SAFER, which allows and mandates that 75 percent of Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant funds go directly to test the long backlog of rape kits. The bottom line, money has been allocated to fund the backlog of 400,000 rape kits. Funds are required to be made available for audits, so we could find the true number of languishing kits throughout different States and then test them. The goal of SAFER was to ensure that no rape kit went untested, so all victims had answers and all rapists were brought to justice; yet, Mr. Speaker, it has been 2 years. Kits remain in basements on dusty shelves, and nothing has changed. The money is there; the law is written, but the DOJ, the Department of Justice, shamelessly ignores this mandate leaving sexual assault victims waiting for justice. Meanwhile, untested rape kits create an unfair treatment of victims. One thing it does is it allows the guilty outlaws to go free and prevents the innocent from being exonerated. Also, the statute of limitations may expire. Then, when the criminal is captured, he may escape justice because the kit was analyzed too long after the crime was committed. That is a travesty of justice. It is an insult and shameful treatment of sexual assault victims. To quote an old legal maxim, ``the criminal goes free because the constable has blundered'' or, in this case, the constable is incompetent. Without this SAFER Act, which allowed the implementation of funds to analyze backlogs of rape kits, we would still be in a problem that we had 2 years ago. {time} 1215 But these funds are available for the States to analyze and get the kits tested. Once tested, the results would allow the apprehension of criminals. This is not occurring. The Department of Justice has yet to even offer the SAFER audit grants to the States. The DOJ cannot show that 75 percent of the funds are going to direct testing and lab capacity enhancement, as required by the law. To give rape victims justice, DNA often holds the critical key and the only key to learning the identity of the perpetrators. Without this, justice is often delayed or denied forever. Ignoring SAFER is an affront to sexual assault victims. Mr. Speaker, victims deserve to know who assaulted them. They need to know for peace of mind. It is mental turmoil for rape victims not to know the identity of the perpetrator while sometimes they still fear for their own safety. A rape kit DNA test may prove to be their best and last and only hope in knowing the identity of the rapist. Bureaucrats should do their job. Quit making excuses for not implementing the law. In my 30 years as a prosecutor and criminal court judge, I talked to and met a lot of sexual assault victims. Sexual assault, or rape, is, to me, the worst crime in society. And rape victims, more than anything else, want to know who did it. They want to know who did it. We have the capability of helping rape victims know who the perpetrator in 400,000 cases. Why aren't we doing it? Not knowing the identity of a rapist is haunting to their victims. It is traumatizing. And to know that the rapist still may be on the loose because the testing kit was not done is inexcusable incompetence. Each day that goes by, we are running out the clock on the statute of limitations, increasing the chance that criminals may escape the long arm of the law. It is time to analyze the [[Page H5093]] 400,000 rape kits and capture the rapists. The Department of Justice must live up to its name. Enforce the SAFER Act and follow the law. The Department of Justice must ensure justice for victims. Until then, many rape victims see no justice. Our country deserves better; sexual assault victims deserve better; and, Mr. Speaker, justice deserves better. Because, justice is what we do in this country. And that is just the way it is. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [House] [Pages H5092-H5093] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS DENYING JUSTICE TO VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) for 5 minutes. Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, in 1966, Federal legislation established a new type of employer-sponsored retirement plan known as a SIMPLE IRA. These plans are designed to give small businesses a retirement option for their employees without the administrative burdens of other employer- sponsored retirement plan types. SIMPLE IRAs face a 25 percent early withdrawal penalty during the first 2 [[Page H5092]] years of their existence, compared to 10 percent for other IRAs. In order to prevent accountholders from unknowingly rolling their IRA funds into SIMPLE IRAs and being surprised by an increased early retirement penalty, current law prohibits rolling funds over into a SIMPLE IRA from other retirement accounts. However, SIMPLE IRAs have the same early withdrawal penalty as other IRAs after that initial 2-year period, and consumers and financial planners have struggled with the rollover restrictions as they attempt to consolidate accounts. This week, I will introduce legislation to allow for rollovers into SIMPLE IRA accounts that have met the 2-year threshold. The Joint Committee on Taxation has previously estimated this legislation would have a negligible effect on Federal tax revenues. This bill will simplify retirement planning and ensure a complex Tax Code does not prevent sensible financial planning decisions. Individuals should be able to consolidate their retirement funds in a way that best meets their needs. This legislation is a small but important first step in the long road to ensuring our tax system works for Americans, not against them. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [House] [Pages H5091-H5092] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TIME TO STREAMLINE SIMPLE IRA ROLLOVERS The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes. Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, this weekend, we will gather in Portland to mourn the passing and celebrate the life of Don Frisbee, who died June 26 at the age 91. Don led an extraordinary life, rising through the company ranks to become the chairman and CEO of PacifiCorp, then the major private utility in the Pacific Northwest. He was a bold and visionary leader of this important company. He was a board member of Fortune 500 companies like Weyerhaeuser and First Interstate Bank, now Wells Fargo. He was widely regarded as the most influential business leader in Oregon for 2 decades. Don's influence, though, extended beyond the business space. He was also on the board of two prestigious Northwest academic institutions, Whitman College in Walla Walla and Reed College in Portland, where he played a critical role in the development of that storied institution. He helped promote the growth of Portland State University, the Oregon Health Science University, and helped guide the Children's Institute. Later in his retirement, he worked for 5 years with his daughter-in- law, Denise Frisbee, on a program throughout the State of Oregon to connect people with their public schools. He cared deeply about the civic infrastructure, how to encourage and empower individuals to make a difference the way that he, himself, had. He was instrumental in the creation and growth of the Oregon Leadership Forum, which now for 30 years has gathered people from all across Oregon on an ongoing, yearlong program to develop leadership capacity and commitment to our State. From its founding to his board leadership, from participating in the very first year's programming, he was the driving force for this unique organization. The utility executive was passionate about Oregon's special places. He loved the out-of-doors and his own special place, his beloved ranch in Sisters, located in a spectacular setting in central Oregon. This veteran utility executive didn't think there was a conflict between sound, sustainable business practices and protecting the environment. During the last conversation I had with Don, he talked about how delighted he was with the Pope's encyclical on the environment and global warming. For all his many accomplishments, his family and friends were central in his life, even more so as the years passed. He lost his beloved wife, Emily, in 2003, after 56 years of marriage. Together, they built a family, a career, and a better community. A little at loose ends after losing Emily, later in life, he met, wooed, and wed a widow who was his neighbor, Betty Perkins. Together, they found extraordinary happiness. They had an amazing effect on everyone they met, whether on a cruise, on the 60th reunion of Don's class at the Harvard Business School, or just people on the street. At a time when most their age would be in rocking chairs, they were traveling the world, providing inspiration to all privileged to spend time around them. His was an extraordinary life well lived. Portland is often regarded as one of America's finest city, listed on all the best places. Over the last 50 years, no one made it a better place than Don Frisbee. Our hearts go out to Don's family; his wife, Betty; and to all of those who were touched by this extraordinary man. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [House] [Page H5091] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DON FRISBEE The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) for 5 minutes. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, 2-year short-term highway fund extensions have become one of Congress' most costly habits. Kudos to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, which has marked up the highway portion and may come to the floor this week with a 6-year bill. That bill is not yet paid for, but the Senate is at least making progress toward a 6-year bill, the kind that is needed to make a dent in the backlog of our construction projects in the States. We should not be deterred by the likelihood of another short-term bill, perhaps going to the end of the year. The goal before the year is out must be a long-term bill. Congress has taken to authorizing the highway trust fund for 2 years, knowing full well that the trust fund, collecting gas user fees at 1993 levels, would run out even before those 2 years are out; then the waltz begins with endless short-term bills. The States are disgusted and exhausted. MAP-21 ran out before the end of its 2-year lifetime. The last short-term bill extension was so useless that it has lasted longer than expected because the States could not apply the funds to the backlog of now endless rescheduled projects; 6-month extensions have yielded 6-month projects, usually only patchwork. This poster goes beyond showing that the short-term extensions have been useless to the States. These short term bills and extensions are having negative effects on the pocketbooks of our constituents. The highway user fee, which has not been raised for 22 years, costs drivers $97 a year. The bad roads that are the result cost those same drivers $515 per year. Find your State for the cost to your constituents. Here is a random sample: Louisiana, $514 per year; Oklahoma, $763 per year; New Jersey, $685 per driver; Ohio, $446 per driver; California, $762 per driver; and Pennsylvania, $471 per driver. All the figures are high, regardless of State or region of the country, and those high dollar amounts go out of the pockets of our constituents to patch bad roads, instead of putting the funds into fixing those roads, bridges, and transit. Congress' short-term attention to our roads, highways, transit and bridges is breaking the bank, not for the Federal Government, but for our constituents. It is no longer the old adage ``you can't get something for nothing'' rather, not funding the highway trust fund for 6 years costs the people we represent not nothing, but $515 per driver. We have got to fund our transportation projects or ask our constituents to pay for their bad roads. The costs to the American people make our options clear what the best thing to do is. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [House] [Page H5092] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SHORT-TERM HIGHWAY FUND EXTENSIONS The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa) for 5 minutes. Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, last week, the President announced his plans to designate, once again, over 300,000 acres, this time of mountains, meadows, and other areas that stretch over 100 miles in northern California, including parts of Yolo, Solano, Napa, Lake, Mendocino, Glenn, and Colusa Counties, as a monument. This designation now marks the 19th time this President has created or expanded, since taking office, resulting in over 260 million acres of designated lands and waters in monuments or wilderness areas. This move actually exemplifies the President's complete disregard for the legislative process and his lack of hesitance on using every single political tool to carry out even more of his executive power grabs. Indeed, the one in Snow Mountain was a bipartisan effort underway, with legislators working on how that might become a designated area. Instead, that has now been usurped by one more round of executive power, kind of like we have seen recently with the Supreme Court exercising its power usurping the legislative process where we, the legislators, are subject directly to we, the people. Using the Antiquities Act as justification to designate over a third of a million acres in my State overnight is not only a serious abuse of power, it is a serious misrepresentation of the intent of the law itself. This law, the purpose of this law, which was enacted after archeologists years ago noticed small artifacts disappearing or ending up in private collections across different countries, was meant as an emergency option to curb looting in small archeological sites in the Southwest. The short and what would seem like simple text of the law actually directs the President to limit any designation to the smallest area compatible with proper care and management of the resource or the objects to be protected. Now, when you see 330,000 acres designated here or 700,000 designated in Nevada or, a few years ago, when President Clinton declared 1 million acres in Utah, are we really protecting a particular area or zone or is this a widespread power grab? Indeed, what are we protecting it from? Well, you will hear from the left, from oil and gas development, from timber, from mining, or from all sorts of things that would be devastating to the environment. Have you noticed how hard it is to get a permit to do any one of those things, by the time you get through the EPA, U.S. Fish and Wildlife, and the whole litany of others that are in the way of doing things that could be done with good environmental stewardship at the same time as developing the resources that people in this country still need? They still need fuel; they still need oil; they still need gas; they still need paper products. Heaven knows, we use enough paper products in this building. But we need development in this country. We do it more responsibly than anywhere else in the world. Yet these wilderness area designations, these monuments, they don't seek to really protect anything. They just make it off limits to all Americans, even if you just want to go in for hiking or hunting or a little off-roading and, indeed, those that would develop the resources. This is so absurd, it even has made it difficult for fire suppression in our forested areas, for our various fire agencies to go do the job they need to do, to have the roads in the areas that are needed so they can attack the fires. And even more so, as we have seen what happened with the loss of life with illegal immigrants in this country, like Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco, illegal immigration, the effort to stop that at the border was made even more difficult, I believe, down in New Mexico when the President designated a bunch of the area along New Mexico as a monument, making it where the Border Patrol can't even patrol the areas because it is now an environmentally protected zone. That is ridiculous, and I think Americans, when they hear about this, say, ``What is going on?'' So this is, again, a power grab that is completely inappropriate. It bypasses the legislative process where the legislators are directly accountable to the people. It is about time that we change the Antiquities Act, or at least if we had somebody in the White House that knew the balance between designating just a small area that actually helps protect a resource and archaeological site versus hundreds of thousands or millions of acres that makes it just off limits to the type of use the public needs and actually makes the assets a safer and healthier one, for example, with our forests, where we can do the work that needs to be done to keep them healthy. Local residents have very little input, if any, on a designation happening in their backyard. Is this a transparent process? No. It is power in Washington, once again, ruling over the people, ruling over the stakeholders in those communities that know best how to manage the resource, what that resource needs, and what that could mean to the local economy, whether it is hunting or fishing or hiking, off-roading, even a little gold mining. We can do these things. We know how to do them environmentally responsibly, and yet we get run over time and time and time again by left-leaning folks using the Antiquities Act as something for their environmental dreams. Mr. Speaker, I am highly frustrated by this, and I hope the American public will get behind an effort to help us change the Antiquities Act and make it something that actually works for the American public and protects what needs protecting, not everything else. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [House] [Page H5093] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ANTIQUITIES ACT ABUSE The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, homeownership is one of the cornerstones of the American Dream; yet, since the 2007 housing crisis, millions of Americans have lost their homes through the foreclosure process, and many more continue to struggle. Addressing foreclosures and short sales is critical. Accelerating the short sale process for homeowners would be part of the solution. Unfortunately, in California and across the country, one of the most significant factors that slows down the short sale process takes place when a homeowner's second mortgage lender delays final negotiations on the short sale; and too often, second mortgage lenders use stonewalling tactics to delay payouts from the first mortgage lenders. This, unfortunately, delays and hurts the homeowners, willing buyers, and the economy at large. After further investigation on this issue, I will be introducing a bill to address short sales and ask the Federal Housing Finance Agency to provide an update on what it is doing to facilitate short sales and protect homeowners. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [House] [Page H5094] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADDRESSING FORECLOSURES AND SHORT SALES IS CRITICAL (Mr. McNERNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, recently, President Obama struck another blow destroying American jobs with his new proposal to raise the salary threshold for overtime. This top-down, burdensome regulation will inhibit job creation, burden small businesses, and penalize hard-working Americans. By increasing the wage threshold, businesses in South Carolina and across America will be faced with difficult choices: reducing hours for workers and cutting jobs. This change will hurt hard-working employees, who will face a lack of flexibility, limited opportunity for advancement within their jobs, and lower base salaries. The new mandate joins other harmful administration regulations, including mandatory wages and fixed work schedules, destroying jobs. The failed liberal welfare state policies of the last 50 years have produced increased poverty, and we should change policies to promote a limited government of expanded freedoms, creating jobs.

Last year, drought-related water cutbacks caused an estimated 400,000 acres to be fallowed, costing thousands of jobs and leaving consumers less food choices in the United States. While the solution is certainly not going to be all encompassed in one bill, this will be a great start towards getting California back where we need to be for drought relief. We cannot stand by and watch one more family suffer, small businesses and our economy leaving the State, when we should have those jobs right in the valley. It ends the finger-pointing and blame game, and provides desperately needed short-term relief while advancing commonsense policies to fix the situation in the long term. It would update Federal laws and streamline water permitting so we could build Sites Reservoir in northern California. Indeed, it also ensures sound and real-time science and water delivery methods so we don't have a situation where we are leasing 15,000 acre-feet twice to benefit less than 30 steelhead fish.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. General Leave Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the microloan program, overseen by the Small Business Administration, the SBA, is designed to provide credit for those entrepreneurs that would not otherwise have any access to credit, even basic revolving credit. Among the SBA's capital access programs, the microloan program is unique because it also provides technical assistance to borrowers. It merges the money with the know-how. To borrow a sports reference, microloans punch above their weight. I know the President has used that phrase on a number of occasions. These small-dollar loans are often the most difficult to receive and typically are the deciding factors in an entrepreneur's ability to start a business. This is demonstrated by the large number of first generation entrepreneurs who have received assistance under the microloan program. Think about the number of successful individuals who recall starting a business with funds pooled from family and friends. Well, if no one in your family has started a business or has money to lend, then that entrepreneur's dream quickly fades to a distant memory. This is particularly true in traditionally underserved markets. By making small-dollar loans less complicated and more accessible, we will empower individuals to become entrepreneurs; lift up their families; improve their communities; and, most importantly, create jobs for a whole lot of Americans. H.R. 2670 does that. This bill enhances the microloan program by allowing microloan intermediaries greater flexibility in providing loans and technical assistance to their borrowers. The expectation is that the greater flexibility will result in greater participation by microlenders in the microloan program, thereby increasing the availability of critical small-dollar loans to these micro- entrepreneurs that punch above their size. Despite the greater flexibility, H.R. 2670 also provides safeguards to maintain the primary feature of the program, and that is low-dollar loans offered to micro-entrepreneurs, along [[Page H5100]] with intermediary-provided technical assistance. By modernizing the microloan program, as H.R. 2670 does, we are allowing the little guy a chance to get off the ropes, use their skills, and create innovative ideas to compete with the heavyweights of American industry. We all strive for a stronger, more competitive economy; and this bill aids in that mission. Mr. Speaker, this bill has broad, bipartisan support once again. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2670, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, since 1991, the SBA microloan program has provided millions of dollars in financing and technical assistance to small businesses and entrepreneurs. By providing loans to nonprofit intermediaries, who in turn lend funds to the smallest of small businesses, the program helps borrowers streamline their operations, grow to profitability, and create new jobs. However, the program remains substantially the same as when it was first enacted. Over the years, we have identified a number of the program elements that could be updated to better deploy capital. With that goal in mind, I want to thank Congressman Moulton for introducing this important legislation. The Microloan Modernization Act of 2015 will make a number of targeted improvements to assist small businesses. For borrowers, SBA set the maximum term of a microloan at 6 years. Particularly for larger microloans, this has caused financial strain due to higher monthly payments and is impeding some businesses from growing. Today's bill would allow a repayment period of up to 10 years for loans greater than $10,000, providing borrowers with the flexibility to better manage cash flow, improve operations, and create more jobs. Similarly, SBA has prohibited lines of credit; yet not all businesses need a fixed-rate term loan. A line of credit is sometimes the better product for a microbusiness that has cyclic or uneven cash flow. Today's bill will give borrowers and lenders the flexibility to get them in the right loan product for their needs. For intermediary lenders, today's bill would create a new waiver to the 25-75 rule that restricts the use of technical assistance grants. This waiver process will help intermediaries more efficiently deploy technical assistance funding. Additionally, the legislation will raise the lending cap by 20 percent. By giving successful intermediaries access to an additional $1 million in SBA funding, they will be able to serve more borrowers in high-demand areas. The microloan program fills a critical gap in the capital markets, helping underserved businesses that are too small for the banking sector yet too big to finance with a credit card or loans from friends and family. Again, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Mr. Moulton for introducing this bill. It will go a long way toward increasing access to capital for our Nation's small businesses. Mr. Speaker, I just would like to point out the fact that 62 percent of microborrowers are women and minorities, and so this is filling an important gap that exists for these groups to access capital. {time} 1630 I thank the gentleman for introducing this important piece of legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo), who is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Energy and Trade of the Committee on Small Business. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Committee on Small Business for yielding, and I also thank him for his leadership on all of these important issues. I also want to commend the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton) for his work on this important piece of legislation. Today, I rise in support of H.R. 2670, the Microloan Modernization Act of 2015. The microloan program is unique due to its focus on merging technical assistance with access to capital. For several micro- entrepreneurs, particularly those in underserved markets, this offers a way to get the small dollar loans, which a conventional bank would otherwise deny, while learning important skills, such as developing a business plan, that will be critical as the company finds success and grows. Last year alone, the microloan program was responsible for providing nearly $56 million in capital and aiding small businesses in creating or retaining 15,000 jobs. However, after listening to several entrepreneurs and microloan intermediaries, it became clear that for the microloan program to truly tap into its potential, changes were necessary. H.R. 2670 strives to make those changes and better support entrepreneurs. For example, currently, the statute says that microloan intermediaries may make short-term fixed-rate loans to small firms. Short term can mean different things to different people, but according to SBA regulations, short term means 6 years. While in some instances this may make sense when the loan is a lower amount, this one-size-fits-all approach is not beneficial to small firms. This bill would remedy that by establishing maximum term limits for loans made by intermediaries to their borrowers: 6 years for loans under $10,000, and 10 years for loans over $10,000. While this may seem like a minor change, we all know that allowing borrowers to get the best repayment terms possible is crucial for ensuring low default rates and increasing participation in the microloan program. Mr. Speaker, in summary, this is a commonsense, bipartisan reform that will increase access to capital for those most challenged to receive--our micro-entrepreneurs. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation, and I congratulate Mr. Moulton for advancing this bill and Chairman Chabot for bringing it to the House floor. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2670 and remind them that the reason we in the Small Business Committee work so hard for these entrepreneurs, for these people that are making a difference, is because they hire those in our society, in our communities, that most need jobs. Think of the college graduate who is looking for a job; think of the immigrant who arrived in this country and is looking for a way forward. It is small businesses that oftentimes give these people their first shot at success. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton), the sponsor of the legislation. Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Velazquez for yielding. Mr. Speaker, we often say that small businesses are the engine of economic growth. That is true; and if you look at the data, new businesses--those younger than 5 years old--created nearly all of our economy's new jobs in the past two decades. In order to create the conditions for job creation, the Federal Government must increase access to capital so new entrepreneurs with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business. The Small Business Administration's microloan program fills a critical gap in the capital markets, helping underserved businesses that are too small for the banking sector yet too big to finance with a credit card or loans from friends and family. The program has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in financing and technical assistance to small businesses and entrepreneurs, but the program is in need of reform. That is why I introduced H.R. 2670, the Microloan Modernization Act of 2015, which will make a number of targeted improvements to the program so more borrowers can benefit from access to capital. First, the bill increases the loan limit cap for intermediary lenders. Many successful intermediaries have hit the current $5 million cap and, as a result, deserving small businesses are denied capital through no fault of their own. Second, the bill extends the loan repayment period for loans greater than $10,000. This small change will provide borrowers with the flexibility to better manage cash flow, improve operations, and create more jobs. [[Page H5101]] Third, the bill permits lines of credit, which are currently prohibited by the SBA. Not all businesses need a fixed-rate term loan. Sometimes a more flexible line of credit is the better product for a small business that has cyclic or uneven cash flow. Fourth, the bill creates a waiver for an overly rigid technical assistance formula known as the 25/75 rule to help intermediaries deploy technical assistance more efficiently. Lastly, the bill commissions two studies to explore ways to incentivize intermediaries to participate in the microloan program and determine if mandatory savings accounts would benefit entrepreneurs. The microloan program supported nearly 4,000 small businesses just last year, and two of these successful businesses are located in Lynn, Massachusetts, in my district. Prism Products, an industrial distributor, received a microloan from the SBA to purchase extra inventory. As a result of the loan, owner Lisa Fitzpatrick was able to increase revenue and hire a sales professional with 15 years of experience. In 2013, local restaurateurs Shawn and Noyan Edmond fulfilled their lifelong dream of opening a Caribbean restaurant in downtown Lynn. The microloan enabled the Edmonds to purchase new kitchen equipment and make renovations to the storefront of Rite Spice Caribbean. As our economy recovers from the recession, we need more people like the Edmonds and Lisa Fitzpatrick to take a risk and start a business, and we need the SBA microloan program to help them. That is why the Microloan Modernization Act of 2015 is so critical. In closing, I would like to thank my ranking member, Nydia Velazquez, for her work on this bill; my chairman, Steve Chabot; and my colleagues, Representatives Curbelo, Chu, Takai, and Radewagen, for cosponsoring this bill. I urge my colleagues to support America's newest entrepreneurs and vote ``yes'' on this important legislation. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The microloan program provides very small loans to start-up, newly established, or growing small businesses. Many of these businessowners come from traditionally underserved markets, where personal and commercial credit is hard to come by. As a result, the SBA's microloan program is a critical resource that not only injects much-needed capital, but provides the necessary business training that ensures borrowers are equipped with the knowledge needed to succeed. Since the end of the recession, microlending is up 25 percent nationwide. By the way, for the last couple of years, the default rate on microloans is going down. In fact, SBA requested an additional $10 million for next year to handle demand. I can think of no better time to make long-sought changes to improve the program's efficiency and capital deployment. I wanted to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for introducing the Microloan Modernization Act of 2015. It will give borrowers new repayment flexibility and loan choices, provide more flexibility to intermediaries, and inject additional capital in high-demand areas. I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in closing, as we work to get capital into the hands of entrepreneurs, we need to keep SBA programs relevant. We also must ensure that our lending partners have the flexibility to manage their loan portfolios in a way that makes the most sense for the borrower. H.R. 2670 does that. I want to thank Mr. Moulton and Mr. Curbelo for their leadership on these reforms. And I once again want to recognize the ranking member, Ms. Velazquez, for her leadership and her cooperation in getting this type of legislation to the floor today so that we can pass this. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2670, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2670. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [House] [Pages H5099-H5101] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MICROLOAN MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2015 Mr. CHABOT.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. General Leave Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the microloan program, overseen by the Small Business Administration, the SBA, is designed to provide credit for those entrepreneurs that would not otherwise have any access to credit, even basic revolving credit. Among the SBA's capital access programs, the microloan program is unique because it also provides technical assistance to borrowers. It merges the money with the know-how. To borrow a sports reference, microloans punch above their weight. I know the President has used that phrase on a number of occasions. These small-dollar loans are often the most difficult to receive and typically are the deciding factors in an entrepreneur's ability to start a business. This is demonstrated by the large number of first generation entrepreneurs who have received assistance under the microloan program. Think about the number of successful individuals who recall starting a business with funds pooled from family and friends. Well, if no one in your family has started a business or has money to lend, then that entrepreneur's dream quickly fades to a distant memory. This is particularly true in traditionally underserved markets. By making small-dollar loans less complicated and more accessible, we will empower individuals to become entrepreneurs; lift up their families; improve their communities; and, most importantly, create jobs for a whole lot of Americans. H.R. 2670 does that. This bill enhances the microloan program by allowing microloan intermediaries greater flexibility in providing loans and technical assistance to their borrowers. The expectation is that the greater flexibility will result in greater participation by microlenders in the microloan program, thereby increasing the availability of critical small-dollar loans to these micro- entrepreneurs that punch above their size. Despite the greater flexibility, H.R. 2670 also provides safeguards to maintain the primary feature of the program, and that is low-dollar loans offered to micro-entrepreneurs, along [[Page H5100]] with intermediary-provided technical assistance. By modernizing the microloan program, as H.R. 2670 does, we are allowing the little guy a chance to get off the ropes, use their skills, and create innovative ideas to compete with the heavyweights of American industry. We all strive for a stronger, more competitive economy; and this bill aids in that mission. Mr. Speaker, this bill has broad, bipartisan support once again. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2670, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, since 1991, the SBA microloan program has provided millions of dollars in financing and technical assistance to small businesses and entrepreneurs. By providing loans to nonprofit intermediaries, who in turn lend funds to the smallest of small businesses, the program helps borrowers streamline their operations, grow to profitability, and create new jobs. However, the program remains substantially the same as when it was first enacted. Over the years, we have identified a number of the program elements that could be updated to better deploy capital. With that goal in mind, I want to thank Congressman Moulton for introducing this important legislation. The Microloan Modernization Act of 2015 will make a number of targeted improvements to assist small businesses. For borrowers, SBA set the maximum term of a microloan at 6 years. Particularly for larger microloans, this has caused financial strain due to higher monthly payments and is impeding some businesses from growing. Today's bill would allow a repayment period of up to 10 years for loans greater than $10,000, providing borrowers with the flexibility to better manage cash flow, improve operations, and create more jobs. Similarly, SBA has prohibited lines of credit; yet not all businesses need a fixed-rate term loan. A line of credit is sometimes the better product for a microbusiness that has cyclic or uneven cash flow. Today's bill will give borrowers and lenders the flexibility to get them in the right loan product for their needs. For intermediary lenders, today's bill would create a new waiver to the 25-75 rule that restricts the use of technical assistance grants. This waiver process will help intermediaries more efficiently deploy technical assistance funding. Additionally, the legislation will raise the lending cap by 20 percent. By giving successful intermediaries access to an additional $1 million in SBA funding, they will be able to serve more borrowers in high-demand areas. The microloan program fills a critical gap in the capital markets, helping underserved businesses that are too small for the banking sector yet too big to finance with a credit card or loans from friends and family. Again, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Mr. Moulton for introducing this bill. It will go a long way toward increasing access to capital for our Nation's small businesses. Mr. Speaker, I just would like to point out the fact that 62 percent of microborrowers are women and minorities, and so this is filling an important gap that exists for these groups to access capital. {time} 1630 I thank the gentleman for introducing this important piece of legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo), who is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Energy and Trade of the Committee on Small Business. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Committee on Small Business for yielding, and I also thank him for his leadership on all of these important issues. I also want to commend the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton) for his work on this important piece of legislation. Today, I rise in support of H.R. 2670, the Microloan Modernization Act of 2015. The microloan program is unique due to its focus on merging technical assistance with access to capital. For several micro- entrepreneurs, particularly those in underserved markets, this offers a way to get the small dollar loans, which a conventional bank would otherwise deny, while learning important skills, such as developing a business plan, that will be critical as the company finds success and grows. Last year alone, the microloan program was responsible for providing nearly $56 million in capital and aiding small businesses in creating or retaining 15,000 jobs. However, after listening to several entrepreneurs and microloan intermediaries, it became clear that for the microloan program to truly tap into its potential, changes were necessary. H.R. 2670 strives to make those changes and better support entrepreneurs. For example, currently, the statute says that microloan intermediaries may make short-term fixed-rate loans to small firms. Short term can mean different things to different people, but according to SBA regulations, short term means 6 years. While in some instances this may make sense when the loan is a lower amount, this one-size-fits-all approach is not beneficial to small firms. This bill would remedy that by establishing maximum term limits for loans made by intermediaries to their borrowers: 6 years for loans under $10,000, and 10 years for loans over $10,000. While this may seem like a minor change, we all know that allowing borrowers to get the best repayment terms possible is crucial for ensuring low default rates and increasing participation in the microloan program. Mr. Speaker, in summary, this is a commonsense, bipartisan reform that will increase access to capital for those most challenged to receive--our micro-entrepreneurs. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation, and I congratulate Mr. Moulton for advancing this bill and Chairman Chabot for bringing it to the House floor. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2670 and remind them that the reason we in the Small Business Committee work so hard for these entrepreneurs, for these people that are making a difference, is because they hire those in our society, in our communities, that most need jobs. Think of the college graduate who is looking for a job; think of the immigrant who arrived in this country and is looking for a way forward. It is small businesses that oftentimes give these people their first shot at success. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton), the sponsor of the legislation. Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Velazquez for yielding. Mr. Speaker, we often say that small businesses are the engine of economic growth. That is true; and if you look at the data, new businesses--those younger than 5 years old--created nearly all of our economy's new jobs in the past two decades. In order to create the conditions for job creation, the Federal Government must increase access to capital so new entrepreneurs with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business.

Prism Products, an industrial distributor, received a microloan from the SBA to purchase extra inventory. As a result of the loan, owner Lisa Fitzpatrick was able to increase revenue and hire a sales professional with 15 years of experience. In 2013, local restaurateurs Shawn and Noyan Edmond fulfilled their lifelong dream of opening a Caribbean restaurant in downtown Lynn. The microloan enabled the Edmonds to purchase new kitchen equipment and make renovations to the storefront of Rite Spice Caribbean. As our economy recovers from the recession, we need more people like the Edmonds and Lisa Fitzpatrick to take a risk and start a business, and we need the SBA microloan program to help them. That is why the Microloan Modernization Act of 2015 is so critical.

Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo), who is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Energy and Trade of the Committee on Small Business. Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Committee on Small Business for yielding, and I also thank him for his leadership on all of these important issues. I also want to commend the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton) for his work on this important piece of legislation. Today, I rise in support of H.R. 2670, the Microloan Modernization Act of 2015. The microloan program is unique due to its focus on merging technical assistance with access to capital. For several micro- entrepreneurs, particularly those in underserved markets, this offers a way to get the small dollar loans, which a conventional bank would otherwise deny, while learning important skills, such as developing a business plan, that will be critical as the company finds success and grows. Last year alone, the microloan program was responsible for providing nearly $56 million in capital and aiding small businesses in creating or retaining 15,000 jobs. However, after listening to several entrepreneurs and microloan intermediaries, it became clear that for the microloan program to truly tap into its potential, changes were necessary. H.R. 2670 strives to make those changes and better support entrepreneurs. For example, currently, the statute says that microloan intermediaries may make short-term fixed-rate loans to small firms. Short term can mean different things to different people, but according to SBA regulations, short term means 6 years. While in some instances this may make sense when the loan is a lower amount, this one-size-fits-all approach is not beneficial to small firms. This bill would remedy that by establishing maximum term limits for loans made by intermediaries to their borrowers: 6 years for loans under $10,000, and 10 years for loans over $10,000. While this may seem like a minor change, we all know that allowing borrowers to get the best repayment terms possible is crucial for ensuring low default rates and increasing participation in the microloan program. Mr. Speaker, in summary, this is a commonsense, bipartisan reform that will increase access to capital for those most challenged to receive--our micro-entrepreneurs. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation, and I congratulate Mr. Moulton for advancing this bill and Chairman Chabot for bringing it to the House floor. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2670 and remind them that the reason we in the Small Business Committee work so hard for these entrepreneurs, for these people that are making a difference, is because they hire those in our society, in our communities, that most need jobs. Think of the college graduate who is looking for a job; think of the immigrant who arrived in this country and is looking for a way forward. It is small businesses that oftentimes give these people their first shot at success. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton), the sponsor of the legislation. Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Velazquez for yielding. Mr. Speaker, we often say that small businesses are the engine of economic growth. That is true; and if you look at the data, new businesses--those younger than 5 years old--created nearly all of our economy's new jobs in the past two decades. In order to create the conditions for job creation, the Federal Government must increase access to capital so new entrepreneurs with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business. The Small Business Administration's microloan program fills a critical gap in the capital markets, helping underserved businesses that are too small for the banking sector yet too big to finance with a credit card or loans from friends and family. The program has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in financing and technical assistance to small businesses and entrepreneurs, but the program is in need of reform. That is why I introduced H.R. 2670, the Microloan Modernization Act of 2015, which will make a number of targeted improvements to the program so more borrowers can benefit from access to capital. First, the bill increases the loan limit cap for intermediary lenders. Many successful intermediaries have hit the current $5 million cap and, as a result, deserving small businesses are denied capital through no fault of their own. Second, the bill extends the loan repayment period for loans greater than $10,000. This small change will provide borrowers with the flexibility to better manage cash flow, improve operations, and create more jobs. [[Page H5101]] Third, the bill permits lines of credit, which are currently prohibited by the SBA. Not all businesses need a fixed-rate term loan. Sometimes a more flexible line of credit is the better product for a small business that has cyclic or uneven cash flow. Fourth, the bill creates a waiver for an overly rigid technical assistance formula known as the 25/75 rule to help intermediaries deploy technical assistance more efficiently. Lastly, the bill commissions two studies to explore ways to incentivize intermediaries to participate in the microloan program and determine if mandatory savings accounts would benefit entrepreneurs. The microloan program supported nearly 4,000 small businesses just last year, and two of these successful businesses are located in Lynn, Massachusetts, in my district. Prism Products, an industrial distributor, received a microloan from the SBA to purchase extra inventory. As a result of the loan, owner Lisa Fitzpatrick was able to increase revenue and hire a sales professional with 15 years of experience. In 2013, local restaurateurs Shawn and Noyan Edmond fulfilled their lifelong dream of opening a Caribbean restaurant in downtown Lynn. The microloan enabled the Edmonds to purchase new kitchen equipment and make renovations to the storefront of Rite Spice Caribbean. As our economy recovers from the recession, we need more people like the Edmonds and Lisa Fitzpatrick to take a risk and start a business, and we need the SBA microloan program to help them. That is why the Microloan Modernization Act of 2015 is so critical. In closing, I would like to thank my ranking member, Nydia Velazquez, for her work on this bill; my chairman, Steve Chabot; and my colleagues, Representatives Curbelo, Chu, Takai, and Radewagen, for cosponsoring this bill. I urge my colleagues to support America's newest entrepreneurs and vote ``yes'' on this important legislation. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The microloan program provides very small loans to start-up, newly established, or growing small businesses. Many of these businessowners come from traditionally underserved markets, where personal and commercial credit is hard to come by. As a result, the SBA's microloan program is a critical resource that not only injects much-needed capital, but provides the necessary business training that ensures borrowers are equipped with the knowledge needed to succeed. Since the end of the recession, microlending is up 25 percent nationwide. By the way, for the last couple of years, the default rate on microloans is going down. In fact, SBA requested an additional $10 million for next year to handle demand. I can think of no better time to make long-sought changes to improve the program's efficiency and capital deployment. I wanted to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for introducing the Microloan Modernization Act of 2015. It will give borrowers new repayment flexibility and loan choices, provide more flexibility to intermediaries, and inject additional capital in high-demand areas. I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, in closing, as we work to get capital into the hands of entrepreneurs, we need to keep SBA programs relevant. We also must ensure that our lending partners have the flexibility to manage their loan portfolios in a way that makes the most sense for the borrower. H.R. 2670 does that. I want to thank Mr. Moulton and Mr. Curbelo for their leadership on these reforms. And I once again want to recognize the ranking member, Ms. Velazquez, for her leadership and her cooperation in getting this type of legislation to the floor today so that we can pass this. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2670, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2670. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_13.csv,19514,19514,19581,"[congressional record volume 161, number 108 (monday, july 13, 2015)] [house] [pages h5099-h5101] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] microloan modernization act of 2015 mr. chabot. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 2670) to amend the small business act to provide for expanded participation in the microloan program, and for other purposes. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 2670 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``microloan modernization act of 2015''. sec. 2. waivers of 25/75 rule.

lift up their families; improve their communities; and, most importantly, create jobs for a whole lot of americans. h.r. 2670 does that. this bill enhances the microloan program by allowing microloan intermediaries greater flexibility in providing loans and technical assistance to their borrowers. the expectation is that the greater flexibility will result in greater participation by microlenders in the microloan program, thereby increasing the availability of critical small-dollar loans to these micro- entrepreneurs that punch above their size. despite the greater flexibility, h.r. 2670 also provides safeguards to maintain the primary feature of the program, and that is low-dollar loans offered to micro-entrepreneurs, along [[page h5100]] with intermediary-provided technical assistance. by modernizing the microloan program, as h.r. 2670 does, we are allowing the little guy a chance to get off the ropes, use their skills, and create innovative ideas to compete with the heavyweights of american industry. we all strive for a stronger, more competitive economy; and this bill aids in that mission. mr. speaker, this bill has broad, bipartisan support once again. i urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on h.r. 2670, and i reserve the balance of my time. ms. velazquez. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, since 1991, the sba microloan program has provided millions of dollars in financing and technical assistance to small businesses and entrepreneurs. by providing loans to nonprofit intermediaries, who in turn lend funds to the smallest of small businesses, the program helps borrowers streamline their operations, grow to profitability, and create new jobs. however, the program remains substantially the same as when it was first enacted. over the years, we have identified a number of the program elements that could be updated to better deploy capital. with that goal in mind, i want to thank congressman moulton for introducing this important legislation. the microloan modernization act of 2015 will make a number of targeted improvements to assist small businesses. for borrowers, sba set the maximum term of a microloan at 6 years. particularly for larger microloans, this has caused financial strain due to higher monthly payments and is impeding some businesses from growing. today's bill would allow a repayment period of up to 10 years for loans greater than $10,000, providing borrowers with the flexibility to better manage cash flow, improve operations, and create more jobs. similarly, sba has prohibited lines of credit; yet not all businesses need a fixed-rate term loan. a line of credit is sometimes the better product for a microbusiness that has cyclic or uneven cash flow. today's bill will give borrowers and lenders the flexibility to get them in the right loan product for their needs. for intermediary lenders, today's bill would create a new waiver to the 25-75 rule that restricts the use of technical assistance grants. this waiver process will help intermediaries more efficiently deploy technical assistance funding. additionally, the legislation will raise the lending cap by 20 percent. by giving successful intermediaries access to an additional $1 million in sba funding, they will be able to serve more borrowers in high-demand areas. the microloan program fills a critical gap in the capital markets, helping underserved businesses that are too small for the banking sector yet too big to finance with a credit card or loans from friends and family. again, mr. speaker, i would like to thank mr. moulton for introducing this bill. it will go a long way toward increasing access to capital for our nation's small businesses. mr. speaker, i just would like to point out the fact that 62 percent of microborrowers are women and minorities, and so this is filling an important gap that exists for these groups to access capital. {time} 1630 i thank the gentleman for introducing this important piece of legislation, and i reserve the balance of my time. mr. chabot. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from florida (mr. curbelo), who is the chairman of the subcommittee on agriculture, energy and trade of the committee on small business. mr. curbelo of florida. mr. speaker, i thank the chairman of the committee on small business for yielding, and i also thank him for his leadership on all of these important issues. i also want to commend the gentleman from massachusetts (mr. moulton) for his work on this important piece of legislation. today, i rise in support of h.r. 2670, the microloan modernization act of 2015. the microloan program is unique due to its focus on merging technical assistance with access to capital. for several micro- entrepreneurs, particularly those in underserved markets, this offers a way to get the small dollar loans, which a conventional bank would otherwise deny, while learning important skills, such as developing a business plan, that will be critical as the company finds success and grows. last year alone, the microloan program was responsible for providing nearly $56 million in capital and aiding small businesses in creating or retaining 15,000 jobs. however, after listening to several entrepreneurs and microloan intermediaries, it became clear that for the microloan program to truly tap into its potential, changes were necessary. h.r. 2670 strives to make those changes and better support entrepreneurs. for example, currently, the statute says that microloan intermediaries may make short-term fixed-rate loans to small firms. short term can mean different things to different people, but according to sba regulations, short term means 6 years. while in some instances this may make sense when the loan is a lower amount, this one-size-fits-all approach is not beneficial to small firms. this bill would remedy that by establishing maximum term limits for loans made by intermediaries to their borrowers: 6 years for loans under $10,000, and 10 years for loans over $10,000. while this may seem like a minor change, we all know that allowing borrowers to get the best repayment terms possible is crucial for ensuring low default rates and increasing participation in the microloan program. mr. speaker, in summary, this is a commonsense, bipartisan reform that will increase access to capital for those most challenged to receive--our micro-entrepreneurs. i am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation, and i congratulate mr. moulton for advancing this bill and chairman chabot for bringing it to the house floor. i urge my colleagues to support h.r. 2670 and remind them that the reason we in the small business committee work so hard for these entrepreneurs, for these people that are making a difference, is because they hire those in our society, in our communities, that most need jobs. think of the college graduate who is looking for a job;

CREC-2015-07-13-pt1-PgH5095-5,CREC-2015-07-13,114,SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT COMPANY CAPITAL ACT OF 2015,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [House] [Pages H5095-H5096] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT COMPANY CAPITAL ACT OF 2015 Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1023) to amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to provide for increased limitations on leverage for multiple licenses under common control. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 1023 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Investment Company Capital Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. INCREASED LIMITATIONS ON LEVERAGE FOR MULTIPLE LICENSES UNDER COMMON CONTROL. Section 303(b)(2)(B) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 683(b)(2)(B)) is amended by striking ``$225,000,000'' and inserting ``$350,000,000''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. General Leave Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. When an entrepreneur starts a business, one of the first challenges they face is getting the money they need to produce their new product or patent their great idea. For small businesses, this has remained a constant struggle. However, we also know that small businesses are vital to our economic growth and, since the recession, have accounted for 60 percent of new net jobs in this country. For these reasons, over 60 years ago Congress created the Small Business Administration, the SBA, and tasked it with the vital mission of ensuring that small businesses can get the capital they need. The Small Business Investment Company, or SBIC, program is a public- private partnership that provides small businesses access to equity and debt financing. It has been extremely successful over the years providing billions in private capital to help promising businesses grow into household names. Pandora, Whole Foods, Apple, even Nike, were all small businesses that received early financing from the SBIC program. In fiscal year 2014 alone, SBICs invested $5.46 billion in small firms that employ approximately 113,000 workers all across America. In my home State of Ohio, more than 2,000 people have jobs today because the SBIC program helped small businesses there in Ohio access the resources that they needed to grow. Under current law, successful SBICs under common control, frequently called the family of funds, are limited in the amount of funds they can provide to small businesses. By merely raising this cap from $225 million to $350 million, as this legislation would do, we could stimulate up to $750 million a year in capital that would be available to the next Nike or Apple. Given the volatile fiscal climate, we can all agree that small businesses would benefit from such a valuable increase in private investment. H.R. 1023 increases this flow of private funds to small businesses at no cost--let me repeat--no cost to the taxpayer. The committee passed this bill with bipartisan support, both Republican and Democrat support. I want to thank several members of the Committee on Small Business for their support and work on this bill, including Representatives Bost, Chu, Curbelo, Gibson, Hahn, Hanna, Knight, Lawrence, Luetkemeyer, and Meng. I would urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1023. I want to thank Ileana--I want to thank Nydia Velazquez for her strong leadership on this bill and much of the other bipartisan work that we have done in the committee. Ileana is another Member who I strongly support and admire greatly. At this point, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. I, too, want to thank the chairman of the Small Business Committee for working in a bipartisan way to craft this legislation. Indeed, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen is a good friend of mine from Florida. So I don't take any offense. Small business investment companies have assisted thousands of high- growth companies over the years, providing nearly $75 billion in capital. By design, the program fills the gap in the capital markets for business that has outgrown the SBA's 7(a) guaranteed loan program, but remain too small or too risky for traditional private equity markets to bear. SBICs operate in a unique public-private partnership with SBA. Once managers raise enough private capital, the [[Page H5096]] agency provides matching funds, which are pooled together and invested in high-growth small businesses. To maximize the impact of the program, the most successful fund managers are permitted to hold more than one SBIC license at a time, known as a family of funds, with the benefit of drawing additional SBA leverage. The current leverage caps, implemented in 2010, allow single licensees to draw $175 million and family-of-fund licensees to draw $225 million. H.R. 1023, the Small Business Investment Company Capital Act of 2015, would increase that cap by an additional 55 percent to $350 million. According to SBA data, only seven SBICs would be able to take advantage of the increase, limiting the actual amount of capital that will reach our small business community. The roughly 150 other SBIC families are unlikely to ever need this increase. Similarly, concentrating additional taxpayer-backed leverage in just a few asset managers necessitates the need for more oversight. I look forward to working with the chairman to strike the right balance ensuring this capital is deployed efficiently, but with less risk. The SBIC program has done a lot of good for the small business community over the years. In fact, since 2010, SBICs have quadrupled their output to over $3.4 billion last year alone, but it is still coming up short in its assistance to women, minorities, and veterans. These groups receive just 6 percent of total SBIC capital. It is my hope, as we work with the Senate on finalized language, steps can be taken to address this inequity. Providing ways to get more capital into the hands of small business owners is a top priority for both sides of the aisle in this committee. I want to thank Chairman Chabot for introducing this legislation, and I am hopeful the increase in leverage will provide new capital opportunities to entrepreneurs from every walk of life. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Collins). Mr. COLLINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1023, the Small Business Investment Company Capital Act of 2015. Small businesses serve as America's economic engine, driving essential job creation. In my Western New York district, small businesses provide the good-paying jobs that people need to support their families. However, we need to do more to encourage small business growth. This legislation aids the SBIC program, which utilizes private investment funds to provide long-term loans and capital to small businesses in need. Without this vital program, many of the small businesses in our country would not be able to succeed. Since inception, the SBIC program has invested $73 billion in more than 118,000 U.S. small businesses. In western New York, this program has supported companies like Gemcor in West Seneca and Synacor in Buffalo and is critical to the jobs they provide. This crucial investment is why I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1023. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself the balance of my time. Since its creation in 1958, the SBIC program has injected billions of dollars into promising startups and small businesses. With the help of the SBIC, some of these small businesses grow into Fortune 500 companies. Apple, Inc., was once an SBIC client. Today it is one of the largest companies in the world by market capitalization. By providing businesses with capital to grow, the SBIC program has also been a driver of job creation. In 2014 alone, the program helped create or retain 113,000 jobs. I look forward to working with the chairman and our colleagues in the Senate on this legislation. I urge a ``yes'' vote. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In closing, Mr. Speaker, let me just reiterate the impact this minor change could have on small businesses all across this country. H.R. 1023 would increase the amount of capital available to small business and enable well-managed SBICs, at no cost to the taxpayer, to increase investment in small businesses. This legislation is a commonsense, bipartisan reform, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1023. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. MENG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1023, the Small Business Investment Company Capital Act. As a co-sponsor of this bi-partisan legislation and a member of the Small Business Committee, I recognize the importance of supporting small businesses and providing them with resources for success. This bill provides small businesses with such tools by raising the maximum debt that the Small Business Administration can guarantee to borrowers in the Small Business Investment Company, or SBIC program, from $225 million to $350 million. Currently, 30% of SBICs in the program are hitting or approaching the $225 million cap, thus restricting them from further investment. This bill will allow SBICs to increase its cap by $125 million, allowing it to invest in many underserved companies, including those led by minorities, women, and veterans. The Congressional Budget Office has stated that by adopting this bill, there is no expected additional cost to administer the program, nor will there be an additional cost to the taxpayer as businesses participating in the program pay fees that would offset such costs. In the last five years, SBICs have invested more than $1.6 billion in my home state of New York. Last year alone, over $5.46 billion was invested in 1,085 companies and SBICs supported over 113,000 jobs. As we continue to work to get our economy back on track, we must join together to support small businesses, which drive our nation's economy. This bill previously passed in the House of Representatives as H.R. 6504 in the 112th Congress. I urge my colleagues to, once again, vote in support of this bill that supports our nation's small businesses. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Collins of New York). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1023. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [House] [Pages H5095-H5096] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT COMPANY CAPITAL ACT OF 2015 Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1023) to amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to provide for increased limitations on leverage for multiple licenses under common control. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 1023 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Investment Company Capital Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. INCREASED LIMITATIONS ON LEVERAGE FOR MULTIPLE LICENSES UNDER COMMON CONTROL. Section 303(b)(2)(B) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 683(b)(2)(B)) is amended by striking ``$225,000,000'' and inserting ``$350,000,000''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. General Leave Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. When an entrepreneur starts a business, one of the first challenges they face is getting the money they need to produce their new product or patent their great idea. For small businesses, this has remained a constant struggle. However, we also know that small businesses are vital to our economic growth and, since the recession, have accounted for 60 percent of new net jobs in this country. For these reasons, over 60 years ago Congress created the Small Business Administration, the SBA, and tasked it with the vital mission of ensuring that small businesses can get the capital they need. The Small Business Investment Company, or SBIC, program is a public- private partnership that provides small businesses access to equity and debt financing. It has been extremely successful over the years providing billions in private capital to help promising businesses grow into household names. Pandora, Whole Foods, Apple, even Nike, were all small businesses that received early financing from the SBIC program. In fiscal year 2014 alone, SBICs invested $5.46 billion in small firms that employ approximately 113,000 workers all across America. In my home State of Ohio, more than 2,000 people have jobs today because the SBIC program helped small businesses there in Ohio access the resources that they needed to grow. Under current law, successful SBICs under common control, frequently called the family of funds, are limited in the amount of funds they can provide to small businesses. By merely raising this cap from $225 million to $350 million, as this legislation would do, we could stimulate up to $750 million a year in capital that would be available to the next Nike or Apple. Given the volatile fiscal climate, we can all agree that small businesses would benefit from such a valuable increase in private investment. H.R. 1023 increases this flow of private funds to small businesses at no cost--let me repeat--no cost to the taxpayer. The committee passed this bill with bipartisan support, both Republican and Democrat support. I want to thank several members of the Committee on Small Business for their support and work on this bill, including Representatives Bost, Chu, Curbelo, Gibson, Hahn, Hanna, Knight, Lawrence, Luetkemeyer, and Meng. I would urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1023. I want to thank Ileana--I want to thank Nydia Velazquez for her strong leadership on this bill and much of the other bipartisan work that we have done in the committee. Ileana is another Member who I strongly support and admire greatly. At this point, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. I, too, want to thank the chairman of the Small Business Committee for working in a bipartisan way to craft this legislation. Indeed, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen is a good friend of mine from Florida. So I don't take any offense. Small business investment companies have assisted thousands of high- growth companies over the years, providing nearly $75 billion in capital. By design, the program fills the gap in the capital markets for business that has outgrown the SBA's 7(a) guaranteed loan program, but remain too small or too risky for traditional private equity markets to bear. SBICs operate in a unique public-private partnership with SBA. Once managers raise enough private capital, the [[Page H5096]] agency provides matching funds, which are pooled together and invested in high-growth small businesses. To maximize the impact of the program, the most successful fund managers are permitted to hold more than one SBIC license at a time, known as a family of funds, with the benefit of drawing additional SBA leverage. The current leverage caps, implemented in 2010, allow single licensees to draw $175 million and family-of-fund licensees to draw $225 million. H.R. 1023, the Small Business Investment Company Capital Act of 2015, would increase that cap by an additional 55 percent to $350 million. According to SBA data, only seven SBICs would be able to take advantage of the increase, limiting the actual amount of capital that will reach our small business community. The roughly 150 other SBIC families are unlikely to ever need this increase. Similarly, concentrating additional taxpayer-backed leverage in just a few asset managers necessitates the need for more oversight. I look forward to working with the chairman to strike the right balance ensuring this capital is deployed efficiently, but with less risk. The SBIC program has done a lot of good for the small business community over the years. In fact, since 2010, SBICs have quadrupled their output to over $3.4 billion last year alone, but it is still coming up short in its assistance to women, minorities, and veterans. These groups receive just 6 percent of total SBIC capital. It is my hope, as we work with the Senate on finalized language, steps can be taken to address this inequity. Providing ways to get more capital into the hands of small business owners is a top priority for both sides of the aisle in this committee. I want to thank Chairman Chabot for introducing this legislation, and I am hopeful the increase in leverage will provide new capital opportunities to entrepreneurs from every walk of life.

the chairman to strike the right balance ensuring this capital is deployed efficiently, but with less risk. the sbic program has done a lot of good for the small business community over the years. in fact, since 2010, sbics have quadrupled their output to over $3.4 billion last year alone, but it is still coming up short in its assistance to women, minorities, and veterans. these groups receive just 6 percent of total sbic capital. it is my hope, as we work with the senate on finalized language, steps can be taken to address this inequity. providing ways to get more capital into the hands of small business owners is a top priority for both sides of the aisle in this committee. i want to thank chairman chabot for introducing this legislation, and i am hopeful the increase in leverage will provide new capital opportunities to entrepreneurs from every walk of life. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. chabot. mr. speaker, i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from new york (mr. collins). mr. collins of new york. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h.r. 1023, the small business investment company capital act of 2015. small businesses serve as america's economic engine, driving essential job creation. in my western new york district, small businesses provide the good-paying jobs that people need to support their families. however, we need to do more to encourage small business growth. this legislation aids the sbic program, which utilizes private investment funds to provide long-term loans and capital to small businesses in need. without this vital program, many of the small businesses in our country would not be able to succeed. since inception, the sbic program has invested $73 billion in more than 118,000 u.s. small businesses. in western new york, this program has supported companies like gemcor in west seneca and synacor in buffalo and is critical to the jobs they provide. this crucial investment is why i urge my colleagues to join me in supporting h.r. 1023. ms. velazquez. mr. speaker, i am prepared to close, and i yield myself the balance of my time. since its creation in 1958, the sbic program has injected billions of dollars into promising startups and small businesses. with the help of the sbic, some of these small businesses grow into fortune 500 companies. apple, inc., was once an sbic client. today it is one of the largest companies in the world by market capitalization. by providing businesses with capital to grow, the sbic program has also been a driver of job creation. in 2014 alone, the program helped create or retain 113,000 jobs. i look forward to working with the chairman and our colleagues in the senate on this legislation. i urge a ``yes'' vote. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. chabot. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. in closing, mr. speaker, let me just reiterate the impact this minor change could have on small businesses all across this country. h.r. 1023 would increase the amount of capital available to small business and enable well-managed sbics, at no cost to the taxpayer, to increase investment in small businesses. this legislation is a commonsense, bipartisan reform, and i urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on h.r. 1023. i yield back the balance of my time. ms. meng. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h.r. 1023, the small business investment company capital act. as a co-sponsor of this bi-partisan legislation and a member of the small business committee, i recognize the importance of supporting small businesses and providing them with resources for success. this bill provides small businesses with such tools by raising the maximum debt that the small business administration can guarantee to borrowers in the small business investment company, or sbic program, from $225 million to $350 million. currently, 30% of sbics in the program are hitting or approaching the $225 million cap, thus restricting them from further investment. this bill will allow sbics to increase its cap by $125 million, allowing it to invest in many underserved companies, including those led by minorities, women, and veterans. the congressional budget office has stated that by adopting this bill, there is no expected additional cost to administer the program, nor will there be an additional cost to the taxpayer as businesses participating in the program pay fees that would offset such costs. in the last five years, sbics have invested more than $1.6 billion in my home state of new york. last year alone, over $5.46 billion was invested in 1,085 companies and sbics supported over 113,000 jobs. as we continue to work to get our economy back on track, we must join together to support small businesses, which drive our nation's economy. this bill previously passed in the house of representatives as h.r. 6504 in the 112th congress. i urge my colleagues to, once again, vote in support of this bill that supports our nation's small businesses. the speaker pro tempore (mr. collins of new york). the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from ohio (mr. chabot) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 1023. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2499) to amend the Small Business Act to increase access to capital for veteran entrepreneurs, to help create jobs, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 2499 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Entrepreneurship Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. PERMANENT SBA EXPRESS LOAN GUARANTEE FEE WAIVER FOR VETERANS. Section 7(a)(31) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(a)(31)) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``(G) Guarantee fee waiver for veterans.-- ``(i) Guarantee fee waiver.--The Administrator may not collect a guarantee fee described in paragraph (18) in connection with a loan made under this paragraph to a veteran or spouse of a veteran on or after October 1, 2015. ``(ii) Exception.--If the President's budget for the upcoming fiscal year, submitted to Congress pursuant to section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, includes a cost for the program established under this subsection that is above zero, the requirements of clause (i) shall not apply to loans made during such upcoming fiscal year. ``(iii) Definition.--In this subparagraph, the term `veteran or spouse of a veteran' means-- ``(I) a veteran, as defined in section 3(q)(4); ``(II) an individual who is eligible to participate in the Transition Assistance Program established under section 1144 of title 10, United States Code; ``(III) a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces named in section 10101 of title 10, United States Code; ``(IV) the spouse of an individual described in subclause (I), (II), or (III); or ``(V) the surviving spouse (as defined in section 101 of title 38, United States Code) of an individual described in subclause (I), (II), or (III) who died while serving on active duty or as a result of a disability that is service- connected (as defined in such section).''. SEC. 3. REPORT ON ACCESSIBILITY AND OUTREACH TO FEMALE VETERANS BY THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION. Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit to Congress a report assessing the level of outreach to and consultation with female veterans regarding access to capital by women's business centers (as described in section 29 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 656)) and Veterans Business Outreach Centers (as referred to in section 32 of such Act (15 U.S.C. 657b)). The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. General Leave Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Every day, American soldiers are risking their lives and leaving family and friends and loved ones behind to protect our freedoms and defend the United States. Currently, there are over 21 million veterans living all across the United States. When these brave men and women return home, they strive to transition seamlessly, hopefully, back into their civilian lives. Veterans face challenges in that transition, one of those being employment. Our most recent veterans who have served in Active Duty at any time since September 2001 have a higher unemployment rate than the average civilian. In particular, our recent female veterans have an unemployment rate that is over twice the national average. While finding employment upon transition to civilian life is a challenge, [[Page H5102]] many veterans find that skills learned during military service translate well into entrepreneurship. Yet many veterans have found it difficult to obtain the funds needed to start a small business. In looking for ways to finance their new businesses, veterans may turn to the Small Business Administration, the SBA, for loan assistance. In fiscal year 2014, veterans received over 2,000 7(a) loans, totaling almost $600 million, but I believe we can do more to get these loans into the hands of veterans. Already the SBA Administrator is using her authority to waive certain fees charged to veterans. One way to increase veterans' access to capital is to make SBA loans more affordable for veterans by permanently waiving the up-front fee charged by the SBA to borrowers through the agency's 7(a) express loan program. H.R. 2499 does just that, all at no cost to the taxpayer. H.R. 2499 strikes a delicate balance between providing a fee waiver to help America's veterans while safeguarding scarce taxpayer dollars by creating an exception to the fee waiver in any year where an appropriation is necessary to cover the cost of the overall 7(a) loan program. This ensures that this fee waiver will never have a cost to the taxpayer. I believe, as many Americans do, that we must support our veterans, and this legislation provides support to veteran entrepreneurs for years to come at no cost. It is a smart, commonsense approach which had broad bipartisan support and passed out of our committee by a voice vote, meaning basically everyone supported it on the committee. Further, this bill has support from major veterans' groups who are well aware of the challenges that brave veterans face in transitioning to civilian life. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2499, and I reserve the balance of my time. {time} 1645 Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Veterans play a significant role in the U.S. economy. They own 2.4 million businesses, employ 5.8 million people, and have generated well over $1 trillion in receipts. Like most small businesses, access to capital is still hard to come by, yet is vital to their existence, paving the way for growth and continued job creation. As the Federal Government's main provider of small business assistance, the SBA guarantees loans to veteran-owned businesses through a number of lending programs. In 2013, the agency's 7(a) program provided over 2,000 veterans with loans, totaling $600 million. This, however, represented only 4 percent overall. In an effort to increase veteran lending volume, the SBA has waived the borrower fees paid by veterans on small-dollar and SBA Express loans. In 2014, the impact of the waiver was a mixed bag. While veterans saw a 23 percent increase in loans of $150,000 or less, the program experienced an 8 percent decrease in veteran loans overall. The initiative has had more success this year with veteran lending seeing a 20 percent increase, which is outpacing the 7(a) program's overall growth. To build on that trend, H.R. 2499 will make the fee waiver permanent for veterans who are seeking an SBA Express loan. It will reduce costs, spur more veterans to borrow, and, in turn, will grow businesses and create jobs. I want to thank Chairman Chabot for introducing this bill to keep more dollars in veteran entrepreneurs' hands. We know that every little bit counts when trying to start or to grow a small business, and I cannot think of a group that is more deserving than that of our veterans. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Knight). Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2499, the Veterans Entrepreneurship Act of 2015. This will expand opportunities for veterans who return home and want to apply their skills and disciplines in starting businesses. What we are doing today is talking about letting our leaders who are out in the field and are defending our Nation come home and do the same thing here, bring their entrepreneurial skills and bring their leadership skills to small business, to the business industry, and to do it in the way they have done when protecting the Nation. Our fighting men and women are uniquely inclined to succeed in business ventures. They are hard workers and natural leaders and are trained to build teams and to think critically in high-pressure environments. Veteran-owned small businesses make up about 9 percent of all small firms and nearly 4 million businesses, with average annual revenues of almost $500,000. These are people who know how to succeed. These are people who know how to lead. This bill is just taking away some of the obstacles, making it a little bit easier for our leaders to come back into the entrepreneurship of America and succeed. While the economic environment is improving generally, some of our vets are having a tough time getting access to the funds they need to put their skills into action. Particularly, female veterans are dealing with outsized obstacles in transitioning to the private sector. The unemployment rate for women warfighters who have come home from Iraq and Afghanistan is 11.4 percent, more than twice that of what our male veterans' national average is. It is time we turned our attention to addressing the problems faced by our veteran entrepreneurs, who have made such tremendous sacrifices and who want to continue to pursue the American Dream. This bill takes a prudent, responsible step in harnessing their skills and expertise in order to add value to the economy and in lowering the barriers for these trained leaders to get their ideas off the ground. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, in closing, the 7(a) loan program provides a critical source of capital for our veterans. This year the SBA lending to veteran-owned firms is on track to exceed $1 billion for the first time ever. Today's bill will save veterans millions of dollars every year at no cost to the taxpayers. That means that veteran-owned businesses can invest or reinvest this money into their businesses. Our Nation's veterans are some of the most prolific small business creators, establishing thousands of firms every year. I would like to thank Chairman Chabot for taking steps to expand access to capital for this important group of job creators. I look forward to working with him and our colleagues in the Senate to move this legislation forward. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all of the staff of the Small Business Committee for their hard work, especially a staff member on my side, Justin Pelletier. I urge a ``yes'' vote. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. In closing, I would, first of all, like to acknowledge that Mr. Knight, who just spoke, is a veteran himself, and we certainly appreciate his service to our country. Again, I want to stress that H.R. 2499 will provide greater assistance to our veterans without imposing any additional costs on taxpayers. The enactment of H.R. 2499 then represents only a small token of the appreciation that we can show to our veterans as they take their skills learned through service to create small businesses that will help create jobs, thus serving our country a second time. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2499. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2499, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed.

Every day, American soldiers are risking their lives and leaving family and friends and loved ones behind to protect our freedoms and defend the United States. Currently, there are over 21 million veterans living all across the United States. When these brave men and women return home, they strive to transition seamlessly, hopefully, back into their civilian lives. Veterans face challenges in that transition, one of those being employment. Our most recent veterans who have served in Active Duty at any time since September 2001 have a higher unemployment rate than the average civilian. In particular, our recent female veterans have an unemployment rate that is over twice the national average. While finding employment upon transition to civilian life is a challenge, [[Page H5102]] many veterans find that skills learned during military service translate well into entrepreneurship. Yet many veterans have found it difficult to obtain the funds needed to start a small business. In looking for ways to finance their new businesses, veterans may turn to the Small Business Administration, the SBA, for loan assistance. In fiscal year 2014, veterans received over 2,000 7(a) loans, totaling almost $600 million, but I believe we can do more to get these loans into the hands of veterans. Already the SBA Administrator is using her authority to waive certain fees charged to veterans. One way to increase veterans' access to capital is to make SBA loans more affordable for veterans by permanently waiving the up-front fee charged by the SBA to borrowers through the agency's 7(a) express loan program. H.R. 2499 does just that, all at no cost to the taxpayer. H.R. 2499 strikes a delicate balance between providing a fee waiver to help America's veterans while safeguarding scarce taxpayer dollars by creating an exception to the fee waiver in any year where an appropriation is necessary to cover the cost of the overall 7(a) loan program. This ensures that this fee waiver will never have a cost to the taxpayer. I believe, as many Americans do, that we must support our veterans, and this legislation provides support to veteran entrepreneurs for years to come at no cost. It is a smart, commonsense approach which had broad bipartisan support and passed out of our committee by a voice vote, meaning basically everyone supported it on the committee. Further, this bill has support from major veterans' groups who are well aware of the challenges that brave veterans face in transitioning to civilian life. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2499, and I reserve the balance of my time. {time} 1645 Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Veterans play a significant role in the U.S. economy. They own 2.4 million businesses, employ 5.8 million people, and have generated well over $1 trillion in receipts. Like most small businesses, access to capital is still hard to come by, yet is vital to their existence, paving the way for growth and continued job creation. As the Federal Government's main provider of small business assistance, the SBA guarantees loans to veteran-owned businesses through a number of lending programs. In 2013, the agency's 7(a) program provided over 2,000 veterans with loans, totaling $600 million. This, however, represented only 4 percent overall. In an effort to increase veteran lending volume, the SBA has waived the borrower fees paid by veterans on small-dollar and SBA Express loans. In 2014, the impact of the waiver was a mixed bag. While veterans saw a 23 percent increase in loans of $150,000 or less, the program experienced an 8 percent decrease in veteran loans overall. The initiative has had more success this year with veteran lending seeing a 20 percent increase, which is outpacing the 7(a) program's overall growth. To build on that trend, H.R. 2499 will make the fee waiver permanent for veterans who are seeking an SBA Express loan. It will reduce costs, spur more veterans to borrow, and, in turn, will grow businesses and create jobs. I want to thank Chairman Chabot for introducing this bill to keep more dollars in veteran entrepreneurs' hands. We know that every little bit counts when trying to start or to grow a small business, and I cannot think of a group that is more deserving than that of our veterans. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Knight). Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2499, the Veterans Entrepreneurship Act of 2015. This will expand opportunities for veterans who return home and want to apply their skills and disciplines in starting businesses. What we are doing today is talking about letting our leaders who are out in the field and are defending our Nation come home and do the same thing here, bring their entrepreneurial skills and bring their leadership skills to small business, to the business industry, and to do it in the way they have done when protecting the Nation. Our fighting men and women are uniquely inclined to succeed in business ventures. They are hard workers and natural leaders and are trained to build teams and to think critically in high-pressure environments. Veteran-owned small businesses make up about 9 percent of all small firms and nearly 4 million businesses, with average annual revenues of almost $500,000. These are people who know how to succeed. These are people who know how to lead. This bill is just taking away some of the obstacles, making it a little bit easier for our leaders to come back into the entrepreneurship of America and succeed. While the economic environment is improving generally, some of our vets are having a tough time getting access to the funds they need to put their skills into action. Particularly, female veterans are dealing with outsized obstacles in transitioning to the private sector. The unemployment rate for women warfighters who have come home from Iraq and Afghanistan is 11.4 percent, more than twice that of what our male veterans' national average is. It is time we turned our attention to addressing the problems faced by our veteran entrepreneurs, who have made such tremendous sacrifices and who want to continue to pursue the American Dream. This bill takes a prudent, responsible step in harnessing their skills and expertise in order to add value to the economy and in lowering the barriers for these trained leaders to get their ideas off the ground. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, in closing, the 7(a) loan program provides a critical source of capital for our veterans. This year the SBA lending to veteran-owned firms is on track to exceed $1 billion for the first time ever. Today's bill will save veterans millions of dollars every year at no cost to the taxpayers. That means that veteran-owned businesses can invest or reinvest this money into their businesses. Our Nation's veterans are some of the most prolific small business creators, establishing thousands of firms every year. I would like to thank Chairman Chabot for taking steps to expand access to capital for this important group of job creators. I look forward to working with him and our colleagues in the Senate to move this legislation forward. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all of the staff of the Small Business Committee for their hard work, especially a staff member on my side, Justin Pelletier. I urge a ``yes'' vote. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. In closing, I would, first of all, like to acknowledge that Mr. Knight, who just spoke, is a veteran himself, and we certainly appreciate his service to our country. Again, I want to stress that H.R. 2499 will provide greater assistance to our veterans without imposing any additional costs on taxpayers. The enactment of H.R. 2499 then represents only a small token of the appreciation that we can show to our veterans as they take their skills learned through service to create small businesses that will help create jobs, thus serving our country a second time. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2499. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2499, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 208) to require the Administrator of the Small Business Administration to establish a program to make loans to certain businesses, homeowners, and renters affected by Superstorm Sandy, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 208 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Superstorm Sandy Relief and Disaster Loan Program Improvement Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

SEC. 7. INCREASING TRANSPARENCY IN LOAN APPROVALS. Section 7(b) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(b)) is further amended by inserting after paragraph (11) (as added by section 6) the following: ``(12) Increasing transparency in loan approvals.--The Administrator shall establish and implement clear, written policies and procedures for analyzing the ability of a loan applicant to repay a loan made under this subsection.''. SEC. 8. SAFEGUARDING TAXPAYERS' INTERESTS.

SEC. 11. REPORT TO CONGRESS ON IMPLEMENTATION OF CERTAIN PROGRAMS. (a) Initial Report.--The Administrator of the Small Business Administration shall report to Congress not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act on the implementation and status of the private disaster loan program established in section 7(c) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(c)), the Immediate Disaster Assistance program established in section 42 of such Act (15 U.S.C. 657n), and the expedited disaster assistance business loan program established in section 12085 of the Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act of 2008 (15 U.S.C. 636j).

(c) Report on Consultation.--Not later than 6 months after date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall report to Congress on the consultation required under subsection (b). The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. General Leave Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. A natural disaster exposes us to the worst of nature. Yet, in some powerful way, it brings out the best in people. Communities ban together. Neighbors help neighbors, and volunteers donate their time and energy all in an effort to rebuild. In the last decade, America has faced some of its worst natural disasters, with Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and, more recently, Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In the aftermath of any disaster, it is imperative that the Federal Government programs operate as efficiently and effectively as possible so that victims are able to rebuild and return to their normal lives as soon as possible. Following Hurricane Sandy, there have been startling reports regarding the Small Business Administration's inability to properly administer the disaster loan program. The SBA was unwilling to implement and utilize preexisting statutory authority that would have assisted the agency in its response to Sandy. {time} 1615 Mr. Speaker, despite our living in the Internet era with smartphones, email, and apps, the SBA was shocked and surprised at the volume of electronic disaster assistance applications it received, and the systems were overwhelmed and unable to process applications. In a poor pun, the SBA's disaster loan program was a disaster itself for the victims of Hurricane Sandy. The legislation before us, H.R. 208, is a corrective to those who suffered twice--first, by a disaster and, second, by the SBA's inability to effectively provide disaster assistance. As Congress did with those who suffered from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, this legislation would allow those in the areas affected by Sandy to apply for disaster assistance, irrespective of the artificial and nonbinding deadlines imposed by the SBA. Further, given the struggles that the SBA had in responding to Hurricane Sandy, H.R. 208 makes practical changes to the disaster loan program to help ensure that victims of future disasters do not suffer as those who felt the brunt of Sandy did. For example, H.R. 208 requires the SBA to update their disaster plan to account for a disaster with extreme application volumes and allows those affected by disasters to use SBA disaster loans to build safe rooms as a mitigating measure against future similar disasters. Mr. Speaker, this legislation also makes smart changes to create parity among disaster victims by requiring the SBA to establish credit standards so that similarly situated borrowers are treated in an identical manner following a disaster. These changes, among others, will ensure that the SBA is fully capable of responding to the next catastrophic disaster. Unfortunately, we all know there will be one or probably many. [[Page H5098]] I want to thank Ranking Member Velazquez, once again, for her leadership on this issue and for working with me to develop a bill that strives to ensure those affected by disasters can rebuild quickly. Mr. Speaker, this bill has broad, bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 208, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, when Hurricane Sandy made landfall in 2012, New York City was one of the hardest hit areas. Thousands of homes suffered damage, infrastructure was disrupted, and our city's small businesses were impacted physically and economically. Mr. Speaker, 32,000 New Yorkers lost their jobs that November, losses many economists attribute to the storm's economic impact. After disasters like these, it is not uncommon for as many as 40 percent of impacted small businesses to fail, depressing commerce and slowing the overall community's recovery. The Small Business Administration's disaster lending functions are meant to provide quick credit to small firms and homeowners that have been impacted by catastrophes. With entrepreneurs' and homeowners' livelihoods at stake, it is vital that the SBA's disaster programs operate effectively. That is why, in 2008, after Katrina, Congress passed reforms meant to improve SBA's disaster response. It became evident after Hurricane Sandy that there is still more work to be done. The Government Accountability Office, the inspector general, and reports from Small Business Committee Democrats have all documented long delays in the processing and disbursement of loans. Our committee found, for instance, that small businesses waited 46 days to get their application processed by SBA, a threefold increase over previous Atlantic storms. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 208 takes steps to address these shortcomings and ensure those affected by Hurricane Sandy are treated fairly. To begin, the bill would allow small businesses to apply again for loans. As SBA was so unprepared for a disaster of this scale, it is important that those impacted have another chance at securing assistance. The bill would also correct a number of the shortcomings that have held back the SBA's programs from functioning smoothly. Businesses will no longer be prohibited from posting their assets as collateral. This is important as, previously, many entrepreneurs have had to use personal assets for loan collateral. By reducing closing and disbursement delays, H.R. 208 would ensure funds flow more swiftly to businesses after future catastrophes. Lastly, the measure takes steps to require SBA to implement reforms Congress passed following Katrina. The fact is the agency has been woefully slow in making these changes, and this law will help hold it accountable. Mr. Speaker, our small businesses are counting on the SBA in times of crises to provide badly needed help so they can recover quickly and continue supporting our local economies. This legislation, which enjoys bipartisan support, will help improve that process, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, when disasters strike, getting small businesses back on their feet quickly can help local economies recover. For that to happen, the SBA's disaster lending initiatives must work as intended, providing American capital to firms that have suffered physical and economic damage. The legislation we are considering would allow businesses that encountered delays to reapply for assistance and be made whole. It will improve how the agency functions in the future, speeding help to small businesses and homeowners when they are most in need. Mr. Speaker, this is a bipartisan bill, and it will do much good for entrepreneurs impacted by Sandy and for businesses impacted by future disasters. I thank Chairman Chabot for his support on this legislation. I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, in closing, we never know when and where the next disaster will strike, but, unfortunately, we do know that there will be more disasters. Given this, we must ensure that the SBA is truly prepared to help victims in the aftermath of those disasters. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 208 rights the wrongs imposed by the SBA on those who suffered from the effects of Sandy, but H.R. 208 does more than just correct past mistakes; it imposes obligations on the SBA to ensure that the agency learns from history and does not repeat those mistakes so people in this country are actually helped next time and not harmed by the agency. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, earlier today I was pleased to support the Superstorm Sandy Relief and Disaster Loan Program Improvement Act (H.R. 208). This legislation will provide assistance to both homeowners and businesses that were utterly failed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) in the aftermath of the Superstorm Sandy, opening up assistance eligibility for an additional year and making necessary changes to the Disaster Loan Program. Last week, I had the privilege of testifying before the House Small Business Committee regarding the hardships now faced by homeowners who applied for SBA disaster assistance due to a complete lack of information and disclosure in the loan process. This bill will help those who did not even have the opportunity to obtain or file a loan application due to SBA's serious incompetence and disorganization. As the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported, SBA missed its timeliness goals by a longshot and is likely still unprepared for another large-scale disaster. SBA was plagued by missed deadlines, decision backlogs, computer systems failures, and insufficient personnel training--problems that should not have come as a surprise in the aftermath of SBA's abysmal response to Hurricane Katrina. Further, GAO found SBA could once again ``be unprepared for a large volume of applications to be submitted quickly following future disasters, which may result in delays in loan funds for disaster victims.'' These failures cannot continue. Here we are more than two and a half years following Sandy, still correcting failures that have slowed the recovery process. In May, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reopened all Sandy-related flood insurance claims due to widespread fraud and a complete lack of oversight of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These issues were completely foreseeable but were not addressed, and Sandy victims continue to suffer as a result. In addition to reopening the loan application process, H.R. 208 will reduce delays in closing and disbursement on loans, allow the construction of safe rooms, modify collateral requirements, increase transparency, establish new performance measures, and require disaster plan improvements, among other commonsense changes. I commend Ms. Velazquez and Chairman Chabot for their leadership on this issue, and look forward to working with them to further address necessary reforms to the SBA Disaster Loan Program. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 208, Superstorm Sandy Relief and Disaster Loan Program Improvement Act of 2015. I appreciate the support and assistance of both Chairman Chabot and Ranking Member Velazquez to include my legislation, H.R. 2397, the Tornado Family Safety Act of 2015 as part of this legislation. The Small Business Administration is currently afforded the authority to issue physical disaster loans for 120 percent of the value of property destroyed but not covered by insurance. The purpose of the additional 20 percent is so that individuals and business can modify structures to reduce damage from future disasters. In Oklahoma, the threat of tornadoes is ongoing, and we are always in between tornadoes. Planning is essential in order to militate against damage and loss of life. It is for this reason that Section 4 is necessary. It reinforces the intent of Congress that already exists in statute--the SBA should already be including the construction of safe rooms as a use for physical disaster loans because it is mitigating measure. The SBA's existing interpretation of existing language in the Small Business Act is incorrect. Because of misinterpretation of this section previously, the SBA should now understand that physical disaster loans can also be used for other types of storm shelters as well, including, but not limited to structures that protect occupants from not only tornadoes, but from other natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods and wildfires. It is important to note that loans may not be used to upgrade homes or make additions unless as required by local building codes and secondary or vacation homes are not eligible for these loans. The SBA does not duplicate insurance claim payments. Generally, loans are made over 30 years and interest rates are not more than 4 percent for those cannot obtain credit elsewhere and for those that can [[Page H5099]] obtain alternative credit, the rate does not exceed 8 percent for the loan. While local and state governments have an obligation to meet the increase in shelter demand, the construction of the shelters is expensive. Under guidelines from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the International Code Council (ICC), a safe room should withstand 250 mph winds and the impact of a 15-pound plank hitting a wall at 100 mph, according to the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety. Safe rooms designed to the FEMA and ICC standards are recommended for both tornadoes and hurricanes. For individual homes, a safe room could range anywhere from $3,000 to $12,000. For anyone who has experienced Mother Nature's most indiscriminate and unpredictable terrors, you can truly understand the extent to which they devastate lives and property. Again, Mr. Speaker, I support Superstorm Sandy Relief and Disaster Loan Program Improvement Act of 2015. As I have stated before on the floor of the House, I hope every Member reflects on the situation of our fellow Americans during a time of crisis or disaster. While we may hope that our communities remain peaceful and safe from crisis; we certainly must support those that do not escape such natural and man- made calamities. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 208, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to improve the disaster assistance programs of the Small Business Administration.''. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [House] [Pages H5096-H5099] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SUPERSTORM SANDY RELIEF AND DISASTER LOAN PROGRAM IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2015 Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 208) to require the Administrator of the Small Business Administration to establish a program to make loans to certain businesses, homeowners, and renters affected by Superstorm Sandy, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) and the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. General Leave Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. A natural disaster exposes us to the worst of nature. Yet, in some powerful way, it brings out the best in people. Communities ban together. Neighbors help neighbors, and volunteers donate their time and energy all in an effort to rebuild. In the last decade, America has faced some of its worst natural disasters, with Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and, more recently, Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In the aftermath of any disaster, it is imperative that the Federal Government programs operate as efficiently and effectively as possible so that victims are able to rebuild and return to their normal lives as soon as possible. Following Hurricane Sandy, there have been startling reports regarding the Small Business Administration's inability to properly administer the disaster loan program. The SBA was unwilling to implement and utilize preexisting statutory authority that would have assisted the agency in its response to Sandy. {time} 1615 Mr. Speaker, despite our living in the Internet era with smartphones, email, and apps, the SBA was shocked and surprised at the volume of electronic disaster assistance applications it received, and the systems were overwhelmed and unable to process applications. In a poor pun, the SBA's disaster loan program was a disaster itself for the victims of Hurricane Sandy. The legislation before us, H.R. 208, is a corrective to those who suffered twice--first, by a disaster and, second, by the SBA's inability to effectively provide disaster assistance. As Congress did with those who suffered from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, this legislation would allow those in the areas affected by Sandy to apply for disaster assistance, irrespective of the artificial and nonbinding deadlines imposed by the SBA.

[[Page H5098]] I want to thank Ranking Member Velazquez, once again, for her leadership on this issue and for working with me to develop a bill that strives to ensure those affected by disasters can rebuild quickly. Mr. Speaker, this bill has broad, bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 208, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELAZQUEZ.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 208, Superstorm Sandy Relief and Disaster Loan Program Improvement Act of 2015. I appreciate the support and assistance of both Chairman Chabot and Ranking Member Velazquez to include my legislation, H.R. 2397, the Tornado Family Safety Act of 2015 as part of this legislation.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio. General Leave Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. A natural disaster exposes us to the worst of nature. Yet, in some powerful way, it brings out the best in people. Communities ban together. Neighbors help neighbors, and volunteers donate their time and energy all in an effort to rebuild. In the last decade, America has faced some of its worst natural disasters, with Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and, more recently, Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In the aftermath of any disaster, it is imperative that the Federal Government programs operate as efficiently and effectively as possible so that victims are able to rebuild and return to their normal lives as soon as possible. Following Hurricane Sandy, there have been startling reports regarding the Small Business Administration's inability to properly administer the disaster loan program. The SBA was unwilling to implement and utilize preexisting statutory authority that would have assisted the agency in its response to Sandy. {time} 1615 Mr. Speaker, despite our living in the Internet era with smartphones, email, and apps, the SBA was shocked and surprised at the volume of electronic disaster assistance applications it received, and the systems were overwhelmed and unable to process applications. In a poor pun, the SBA's disaster loan program was a disaster itself for the victims of Hurricane Sandy. The legislation before us, H.R. 208, is a corrective to those who suffered twice--first, by a disaster and, second, by the SBA's inability to effectively provide disaster assistance. As Congress did with those who suffered from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, this legislation would allow those in the areas affected by Sandy to apply for disaster assistance, irrespective of the artificial and nonbinding deadlines imposed by the SBA. Further, given the struggles that the SBA had in responding to Hurricane Sandy, H.R. 208 makes practical changes to the disaster loan program to help ensure that victims of future disasters do not suffer as those who felt the brunt of Sandy did. For example, H.R. 208 requires the SBA to update their disaster plan to account for a disaster with extreme application volumes and allows those affected by disasters to use SBA disaster loans to build safe rooms as a mitigating measure against future similar disasters. Mr. Speaker, this legislation also makes smart changes to create parity among disaster victims by requiring the SBA to establish credit standards so that similarly situated borrowers are treated in an identical manner following a disaster. These changes, among others, will ensure that the SBA is fully capable of responding to the next catastrophic disaster. Unfortunately, we all know there will be one or probably many. [[Page H5098]] I want to thank Ranking Member Velazquez, once again, for her leadership on this issue and for working with me to develop a bill that strives to ensure those affected by disasters can rebuild quickly. Mr. Speaker, this bill has broad, bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 208, and I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, when Hurricane Sandy made landfall in 2012, New York City was one of the hardest hit areas. Thousands of homes suffered damage, infrastructure was disrupted, and our city's small businesses were impacted physically and economically. Mr. Speaker, 32,000 New Yorkers lost their jobs that November, losses many economists attribute to the storm's economic impact. After disasters like these, it is not uncommon for as many as 40 percent of impacted small businesses to fail, depressing commerce and slowing the overall community's recovery. The Small Business Administration's disaster lending functions are meant to provide quick credit to small firms and homeowners that have been impacted by catastrophes. With entrepreneurs' and homeowners' livelihoods at stake, it is vital that the SBA's disaster programs operate effectively. That is why, in 2008, after Katrina, Congress passed reforms meant to improve SBA's disaster response. It became evident after Hurricane Sandy that there is still more work to be done. The Government Accountability Office, the inspector general, and reports from Small Business Committee Democrats have all documented long delays in the processing and disbursement of loans. Our committee found, for instance, that small businesses waited 46 days to get their application processed by SBA, a threefold increase over previous Atlantic storms. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 208 takes steps to address these shortcomings and ensure those affected by Hurricane Sandy are treated fairly. To begin, the bill would allow small businesses to apply again for loans. As SBA was so unprepared for a disaster of this scale, it is important that those impacted have another chance at securing assistance. The bill would also correct a number of the shortcomings that have held back the SBA's programs from functioning smoothly. Businesses will no longer be prohibited from posting their assets as collateral. This is important as, previously, many entrepreneurs have had to use personal assets for loan collateral. By reducing closing and disbursement delays, H.R. 208 would ensure funds flow more swiftly to businesses after future catastrophes. Lastly, the measure takes steps to require SBA to implement reforms Congress passed following Katrina. The fact is the agency has been woefully slow in making these changes, and this law will help hold it accountable. Mr. Speaker, our small businesses are counting on the SBA in times of crises to provide badly needed help so they can recover quickly and continue supporting our local economies. This legislation, which enjoys bipartisan support, will help improve that process, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, when disasters strike, getting small businesses back on their feet quickly can help local economies recover. For that to happen, the SBA's disaster lending initiatives must work as intended, providing American capital to firms that have suffered physical and economic damage. The legislation we are considering would allow businesses that encountered delays to reapply for assistance and be made whole. It will improve how the agency functions in the future, speeding help to small businesses and homeowners when they are most in need. Mr. Speaker, this is a bipartisan bill, and it will do much good for entrepreneurs impacted by Sandy and for businesses impacted by future disasters. I thank Chairman Chabot for his support on this legislation. I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, in closing, we never know when and where the next disaster will strike, but, unfortunately, we do know that there will be more disasters. Given this, we must ensure that the SBA is truly prepared to help victims in the aftermath of those disasters. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 208 rights the wrongs imposed by the SBA on those who suffered from the effects of Sandy, but H.R. 208 does more than just correct past mistakes; it imposes obligations on the SBA to ensure that the agency learns from history and does not repeat those mistakes so people in this country are actually helped next time and not harmed by the agency. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, earlier today I was pleased to support the Superstorm Sandy Relief and Disaster Loan Program Improvement Act (H.R. 208). This legislation will provide assistance to both homeowners and businesses that were utterly failed by the Small Business Administration (SBA) in the aftermath of the Superstorm Sandy, opening up assistance eligibility for an additional year and making necessary changes to the Disaster Loan Program. Last week, I had the privilege of testifying before the House Small Business Committee regarding the hardships now faced by homeowners who applied for SBA disaster assistance due to a complete lack of information and disclosure in the loan process. This bill will help those who did not even have the opportunity to obtain or file a loan application due to SBA's serious incompetence and disorganization. As the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported, SBA missed its timeliness goals by a longshot and is likely still unprepared for another large-scale disaster. SBA was plagued by missed deadlines, decision backlogs, computer systems failures, and insufficient personnel training--problems that should not have come as a surprise in the aftermath of SBA's abysmal response to Hurricane Katrina. Further, GAO found SBA could once again ``be unprepared for a large volume of applications to be submitted quickly following future disasters, which may result in delays in loan funds for disaster victims.'' These failures cannot continue. Here we are more than two and a half years following Sandy, still correcting failures that have slowed the recovery process. In May, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reopened all Sandy-related flood insurance claims due to widespread fraud and a complete lack of oversight of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These issues were completely foreseeable but were not addressed, and Sandy victims continue to suffer as a result. In addition to reopening the loan application process, H.R. 208 will reduce delays in closing and disbursement on loans, allow the construction of safe rooms, modify collateral requirements, increase transparency, establish new performance measures, and require disaster plan improvements, among other commonsense changes. I commend Ms. Velazquez and Chairman Chabot for their leadership on this issue, and look forward to working with them to further address necessary reforms to the SBA Disaster Loan Program. Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 208, Superstorm Sandy Relief and Disaster Loan Program Improvement Act of 2015. I appreciate the support and assistance of both Chairman Chabot and Ranking Member Velazquez to include my legislation, H.R. 2397, the Tornado Family Safety Act of 2015 as part of this legislation. The Small Business Administration is currently afforded the authority to issue physical disaster loans for 120 percent of the value of property destroyed but not covered by insurance. The purpose of the additional 20 percent is so that individuals and business can modify structures to reduce damage from future disasters. In Oklahoma, the threat of tornadoes is ongoing, and we are always in between tornadoes. Planning is essential in order to militate against damage and loss of life. It is for this reason that Section 4 is necessary. It reinforces the intent of Congress that already exists in statute--the SBA should already be including the construction of safe rooms as a use for physical disaster loans because it is mitigating measure. The SBA's existing interpretation of existing language in the Small Business Act is incorrect. Because of misinterpretation of this section previously, the SBA should now understand that physical disaster loans can also be used for other types of storm shelters as well, including, but not limited to structures that protect occupants from not only tornadoes, but from other natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods and wildfires. It is important to note that loans may not be used to upgrade homes or make additions unless as required by local building codes and secondary or vacation homes are not eligible for these loans. The SBA does not duplicate insurance claim payments. Generally, loans are made over 30 years and interest rates are not more than 4 percent for those cannot obtain credit elsewhere and for those that can [[Page H5099]] obtain alternative credit, the rate does not exceed 8 percent for the loan. While local and state governments have an obligation to meet the increase in shelter demand, the construction of the shelters is expensive. Under guidelines from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the International Code Council (ICC), a safe room should withstand 250 mph winds and the impact of a 15-pound plank hitting a wall at 100 mph, according to the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety. Safe rooms designed to the FEMA and ICC standards are recommended for both tornadoes and hurricanes. For individual homes, a safe room could range anywhere from $3,000 to $12,000. For anyone who has experienced Mother Nature's most indiscriminate and unpredictable terrors, you can truly understand the extent to which they devastate lives and property. Again, Mr. Speaker, I support Superstorm Sandy Relief and Disaster Loan Program Improvement Act of 2015. As I have stated before on the floor of the House, I hope every Member reflects on the situation of our fellow Americans during a time of crisis or disaster. While we may hope that our communities remain peaceful and safe from crisis; we certainly must support those that do not escape such natural and man- made calamities. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 208, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to improve the disaster assistance programs of the Small Business Administration.''. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_13.csv,22771,22771,22838,"[congressional record volume 161, number 108 (monday, july 13, 2015)] [house] [pages h5096-h5099] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] superstorm sandy relief and disaster loan program improvement act of 2015 mr. chabot. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 208) to require the administrator of the small business administration to establish a program to make loans to certain businesses, homeowners, and renters affected by superstorm sandy, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 208 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``superstorm sandy relief and disaster loan program improvement act of 2015''. sec. 2. findings. congress finds the following: (1) in 2012, superstorm sandy caused substantial physical and economic damage to the united states, and new york in particular.

(h.r. 208). this legislation will provide assistance to both homeowners and businesses that were utterly failed by the small business administration (sba) in the aftermath of the superstorm sandy, opening up assistance eligibility for an additional year and making necessary changes to the disaster loan program. last week, i had the privilege of testifying before the house small business committee regarding the hardships now faced by homeowners who applied for sba disaster assistance due to a complete lack of information and disclosure in the loan process. this bill will help those who did not even have the opportunity to obtain or file a loan application due to sba's serious incompetence and disorganization. as the government accountability office (gao) reported, sba missed its timeliness goals by a longshot and is likely still unprepared for another large-scale disaster. sba was plagued by missed deadlines, decision backlogs, computer systems failures, and insufficient personnel training--problems that should not have come as a surprise in the aftermath of sba's abysmal response to hurricane katrina. further, gao found sba could once again ``be unprepared for a large volume of applications to be submitted quickly following future disasters, which may result in delays in loan funds for disaster victims.'' these failures cannot continue. here we are more than two and a half years following sandy, still correcting failures that have slowed the recovery process. in may, the federal emergency management agency (fema) reopened all sandy-related flood insurance claims due to widespread fraud and a complete lack of oversight of the national flood insurance program (nfip). these issues were completely foreseeable but were not addressed, and sandy victims continue to suffer as a result. in addition to reopening the loan application process, h.r. 208 will reduce delays in closing and disbursement on loans, allow the construction of safe rooms, modify collateral requirements, increase transparency, establish new performance measures, and require disaster plan improvements, among other commonsense changes. i commend ms. velazquez and chairman chabot for their leadership on this issue, and look forward to working with them to further address necessary reforms to the sba disaster loan program. mr. cole. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h.r. 208, superstorm sandy relief and disaster loan program improvement act of 2015. i appreciate the support and assistance of both chairman chabot and ranking member velazquez to include my legislation, h.r. 2397, the tornado family safety act of 2015 as part of this legislation. the small business administration is currently afforded the authority to issue physical disaster loans for 120 percent of the value of property destroyed but not covered by insurance. the purpose of the additional 20 percent is so that individuals and business can modify structures to reduce damage from future disasters. in oklahoma, the threat of tornadoes is ongoing, and we are always in between tornadoes. planning is essential in order to militate against damage and loss of life. it is for this reason that section 4 is necessary. it reinforces the intent of congress that already exists in statute--the sba should already be including the construction of safe rooms as a use for physical disaster loans because it is mitigating measure. the sba's existing interpretation of existing language in the small business act is incorrect. because of misinterpretation of this section previously, the sba should now understand that physical disaster loans can also be used for other types of storm shelters as well, including, but not limited to structures that protect occupants from not only tornadoes, but from other natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods and wildfires. it is important to note that loans may not be used to upgrade homes or make additions unless as required by local building codes and secondary or vacation homes are not eligible for these loans. the sba does not duplicate insurance claim payments. generally, loans are made over 30 years and interest rates are not more than 4 percent for those cannot obtain credit elsewhere and for those that can [[page h5099]] obtain alternative credit, the rate does not exceed 8 percent for the loan. while local and state governments have an obligation to meet the increase in shelter demand, the construction of the shelters is expensive. under guidelines from the federal emergency management agency (fema) and the international code council (icc), a safe room should withstand 250 mph winds and the impact of a 15-pound plank hitting a wall at 100 mph, according to the insurance institute for business and home safety. safe rooms designed to the fema and icc standards are recommended for both tornadoes and hurricanes. for individual homes, a safe room could range anywhere from $3,000 to $12,000. for anyone who has experienced mother nature's most indiscriminate and unpredictable terrors, you can truly understand the extent to which they devastate lives and property. again, mr. speaker, i support superstorm sandy relief and disaster loan program improvement act of 2015. as i have stated before on the floor of the house, i hope every member reflects on the situation of our fellow americans during a time of crisis or disaster. while we may hope that our communities remain peaceful and safe from crisis; we certainly must support those that do not escape such natural and man- made calamities. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from ohio (mr. chabot) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 208, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. the title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``a bill to improve the disaster assistance programs of the small business administration.''. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",22771

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Cook) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Ruiz) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. Cook). General Leave Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The Morongo Band of Mission Indians, a tribe located about 20 miles west of Palm Springs, California, along with the city of Banning and a private property owner who resides in California together have asked Congress to enact H.R. 387, providing for the exchange of certain lands within or adjacent to the Morongo Reservation. The bill also directs the Secretary of the Interior to grant an easement to the city of Banning for the use of certain lands currently held in trust on behalf of the tribe. The easement will provide the city with the ability to install electric, sewer, water, and related utility lines to accommodate commercial activity in the area. This bill will accomplish three goals. First, it will promote the consolidation of the tribe's reservation lands. Second, it will resolve a land use dispute between a private landowner, the city, and the tribe. Third and finally, it will facilitate commercial development on lands adjacent to the tribe's reservation, which will be beneficial for the city of Banning and the tribe as well as for the private landowner. This bill truly represents a win-win-win agreement without any of the parties having to compromise their desired goals. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am proud to rise in support of my bill, H.R. 387, the Economic Development Through Tribal Land Exchange Act. This non-controversial, bipartisan bill passed unanimously out of the House Natural Resources Committee and is supported by the Department of the Interior. The bill would aid economic development in the city of Banning, California, through a land swap that is supported by all of the parties involved. Currently, the Morongo Band of Mission Indians and a private landowner, Mr. Lloyd Fields, would like to exchange two parcels of land which are nearly identical in size and value, but they are restrained from doing so because one of the parcels is currently held in trust by the United States on behalf of the tribe. My bill facilitates an equitable land swap between the Morongo tribe and the landowner to provide more consolidated reservation land for the tribe and commercial development opportunities for the landowner, the city of Banning, and Riverside County. This bill serves as a model for how land use issues can be addressed by communities coming together while upholding the sacred government- to-government relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes. I would like to thank Chairman Robert Martin of the Morongo Band of Mission Indians and the city of Banning for bringing this issue to my attention. I would like to thank my colleague, Representative Paul Cook from California, for being an original cosponsor, and Senator Boxer from California for introducing the bill in the Senate. I would also like to thank Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva for expediting this bill through committee so that we could bring it to the floor today. Mr. Speaker, this is the type of bill that we can all support for the simple reason that it benefits all parties involved and spurs economic development and job creation. We passed this bill unanimously on the floor last year. Let's move it once again. I urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 387. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, in closing, this just basically shows that you can actually get some things done at the local, State, and Federal levels. This battle has been going on for a long while. I used to represent the area when I was in the State House. And when you can finally get all of the parties together and work in a bipartisan fashion, good things can happen. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. This is a clear example, as Representative Paul Cook said, of two neighboring districts from different parties coming together for the benefit of economic development, for the betterment of our tribes, and for the betterment of our counties. At this point, Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank my colleague, Representative Paul Cook, for his support of this legislation, as well as to thank Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva for their work to bring this non-controversial bill to the floor before the end of the summer. [[Page H5104]] Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Torres), my friend and colleague, who also sits on the Indian, Insular and Alaska Native Affairs Subcommittee. {time} 1700 Ms. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 387, which directs the Secretary of the Interior to take certain land into trust for the benefit of Morongo Band of Mission Indians. This legislation is a commonsense approach that will benefit the tribe, the city of Banning, and the larger local economy. Taking land into trust on behalf of tribes is one of the visible and impactful actions our government can undertake to uphold our trust obligations to the 567 sovereign tribal nations around the country. Indian lands are critical for the exercise of tribal self-governance and self-determination and often represent great spiritual and cultural significance to tribal nations. This bill represents an opportunity for the Morongo Band of Mission Indians to consolidate their land base and provide for their people while also resolving longstanding disputes that will clear the way for increased private economic development opportunities for the region. This legislation is a win-win for the tribe, the city, and private enterprise. Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from California, Norma Torres, for her remarks in support of the bill. I would like to thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to again thank Representative Paul Cook for his support of this legislation. I would like to thank Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva for their work to bring this noncontroversial bill to the floor before the end of the summer. I look forward to working together in the future on additional legislation to provide our tribal nations with the tools to create their own economic opportunity through self-determination and self-governance. I urge my colleagues to come together, once again, and pass this commonsense bill that will create jobs and spur economic development for the Morongo Tribe and the city of Banning. Vote ``yes'' on H.R. 387. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Ruiz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 387. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [House] [Pages H5103-H5104] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THROUGH TRIBAL LAND EXCHANGE ACT Mr. COOK.

Mr. Speaker, this is the type of bill that we can all support for the simple reason that it benefits all parties involved and spurs economic development and job creation. We passed this bill unanimously on the floor last year. Let's move it once again. I urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 387. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. COOK. Mr. Speaker, in closing, this just basically shows that you can actually get some things done at the local, State, and Federal levels. This battle has been going on for a long while. I used to represent the area when I was in the State House. And when you can finally get all of the parties together and work in a bipartisan fashion, good things can happen. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. This is a clear example, as Representative Paul Cook said, of two neighboring districts from different parties coming together for the benefit of economic development, for the betterment of our tribes, and for the betterment of our counties. At this point, Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank my colleague, Representative Paul Cook, for his support of this legislation, as well as to thank Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva for their work to bring this non-controversial bill to the floor before the end of the summer. [[Page H5104]] Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Torres), my friend and colleague, who also sits on the Indian, Insular and Alaska Native Affairs Subcommittee. {time} 1700 Ms. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 387, which directs the Secretary of the Interior to take certain land into trust for the benefit of Morongo Band of Mission Indians. This legislation is a commonsense approach that will benefit the tribe, the city of Banning, and the larger local economy. Taking land into trust on behalf of tribes is one of the visible and impactful actions our government can undertake to uphold our trust obligations to the 567 sovereign tribal nations around the country. Indian lands are critical for the exercise of tribal self-governance and self-determination and often represent great spiritual and cultural significance to tribal nations. This bill represents an opportunity for the Morongo Band of Mission Indians to consolidate their land base and provide for their people while also resolving longstanding disputes that will clear the way for increased private economic development opportunities for the region. This legislation is a win-win for the tribe, the city, and private enterprise. Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from California, Norma Torres, for her remarks in support of the bill. I would like to thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would like to again thank Representative Paul Cook for his support of this legislation. I would like to thank Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva for their work to bring this noncontroversial bill to the floor before the end of the summer. I look forward to working together in the future on additional legislation to provide our tribal nations with the tools to create their own economic opportunity through self-determination and self-governance. I urge my colleagues to come together, once again, and pass this commonsense bill that will create jobs and spur economic development for the Morongo Tribe and the city of Banning. Vote ``yes'' on H.R. 387. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Ruiz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 387. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_13.csv,11310,11310,11377,"[congressional record volume 161, number 108 (monday, july 13, 2015)] [house] [pages h5103-h5104] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] economic development through tribal land exchange act mr. cook. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 387) to provide for certain land to be taken into trust for the benefit of morongo band of mission indians, and for other purposes. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 387 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``economic development through tribal land exchange act''. sec. 2. definitions. for the purposes of this act, the following definitions apply: (1) banning.--the term ``banning'' means the city of banning, which is located in riverside county, california adjacent to the morongo indian reservation.

there was no objection. mr. cook. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. the morongo band of mission indians, a tribe located about 20 miles west of palm springs, california, along with the city of banning and a private property owner who resides in california together have asked congress to enact h.r. 387, providing for the exchange of certain lands within or adjacent to the morongo reservation. the bill also directs the secretary of the interior to grant an easement to the city of banning for the use of certain lands currently held in trust on behalf of the tribe. the easement will provide the city with the ability to install electric, sewer, water, and related utility lines to accommodate commercial activity in the area. this bill will accomplish three goals. first, it will promote the consolidation of the tribe's reservation lands. second, it will resolve a land use dispute between a private landowner, the city, and the tribe. third and finally, it will facilitate commercial development on lands adjacent to the tribe's reservation, which will be beneficial for the city of banning and the tribe as well as for the private landowner. this bill truly represents a win-win-win agreement without any of the parties having to compromise their desired goals. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. ruiz. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i am proud to rise in support of my bill, h.r. 387, the economic development through tribal land exchange act. this non-controversial, bipartisan bill passed unanimously out of the house natural resources committee and is supported by the department of the interior. the bill would aid economic development in the city of banning, california, through a land swap that is supported by all of the parties involved. currently, the morongo band of mission indians and a private landowner, mr. lloyd fields, would like to exchange two parcels of land which are nearly identical in size and value, but they are restrained from doing so because one of the parcels is currently held in trust by the united states on behalf of the tribe. my bill facilitates an equitable land swap between the morongo tribe and the landowner to provide more consolidated reservation land for the tribe and commercial development opportunities for the landowner, the city of banning, and riverside county. this bill serves as a model for how land use issues can be addressed by communities coming together while upholding the sacred government- to-government relationship between the federal government and indian tribes. i would like to thank chairman robert martin of the morongo band of mission indians and the city of banning for bringing this issue to my attention. i would like to thank my colleague, representative paul cook from california, for being an original cosponsor, and senator boxer from california for introducing the bill in the senate. i would also like to thank chairman bishop and ranking member grijalva for expediting this bill through committee so that we could bring it to the floor today. mr. speaker, this is the type of bill that we can all support for the simple reason that it benefits all parties involved and spurs economic development and job creation. we passed this bill unanimously on the floor last year. let's move it once again. i urge a ``yes'' vote on h.r. 387. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. cook. mr. speaker, in closing, this just basically shows that you can actually get some things done at the local, state, and federal levels. this battle has been going on for a long while. i used to represent the area when i was in the state house. and when you can finally get all of the parties together and work in a bipartisan fashion, good things can happen. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. ruiz. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. this is a clear example, as representative paul cook said, of two neighboring districts from different parties coming together for the benefit of economic development, for the betterment of our tribes, and for the betterment of our counties. at this point, mr. speaker, i again want to thank my colleague, representative paul cook, for his support of this legislation, as well as to thank chairman bishop and ranking member grijalva for their work to bring this non-controversial bill to the floor before the end of the summer.

OBERSTAR MEMORIAL POST OFFICE BUILDING,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [House] [Pages H5105-H5107] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JAMES L. OBERSTAR MEMORIAL POST OFFICE BUILDING Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 179) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 14 3rd Avenue, NW, in Chisholm, Minnesota, as the ``James L. Oberstar Memorial Post Office Building''. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: S. 179 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. JAMES L. OBERSTAR MEMORIAL POST OFFICE BUILDING. (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 14 3rd Avenue, NW, in Chisholm, Minnesota, shall be known and designated as the ``James L. Oberstar Memorial Post Office Building''. (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ``James L. Oberstar Memorial Post Office Building''. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Trott). Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. {time} 1900 General Leave Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of S. 179, a bill to name a post office in Chisholm, Minnesota, after a very distinguished former Member of this body, Congressman James Oberstar. The bill was introduced by Senator Amy Klobuchar, and our colleague Congressman Richard Nolan has introduced House companion legislation. Mr. Oberstar served in the House for a remarkable 36 years, and I think it is very fitting and appropriate to honor his legacy by lending his name to a post office in his hometown of Chisolm. Congressman Oberstar was born in Chisholm, Minnesota, on September 10, 1934, and graduated from the high school there in 1952. Four years later, he earned a bachelor of arts from the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota. He later earned a master's degree from the College of Europe in Bruges, Belgium. A lot of people knew he was very fluent in French and liked to express himself on many trips in French. Before running for Congress himself, Congressman Oberstar served on the staff for Congressman John Blatnik of Minnesota from 1963 to 1974. In that capacity, he worked with Congressman Blatnik on all of the legislation from the Public Works and Transportation Committee. In the last 3 years he was with Congressman Blatnik, Congressman Oberstar became the chief of staff for that committee. Congressman Oberstar was first elected to represent the people of Minnesota's Eighth District in 1974. Among many notable achievements, he served as chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure in the 110th and 111th Congresses. In total, he served in 18 Congresses. Sadly, Mr. Oberstar passed away on May 3, 2014, in Potomac, Maryland. He certainly was a devoted public servant who left a remarkable legacy of service to the citizens of Minnesota and the United States. Earlier in this Congress, there was another tribute for Congressman Oberstar. At that time, I said this: It is an astounding figure to think that a man worked on this one committee for 47 years of his life, but he did so with great honor and distinction. In fact, I think most everybody knew that there was no one in the Congress and probably never has been anyone in the history of the Congress who has known transportation issues and understood them and worked on them longer and harder and with more effectiveness than Jim Oberstar did. At one point, he was chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee. In 1994, after the election, the Republicans took control, and I had the honor of becoming the chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, and I served for 6 years in that position, which was the maximum allowable on our side. When I took over as chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, I frequently heard Jim Oberstar referred to as ``Mr. Aviation.'' So I went to him and asked for his help, and he helped me, guided me, and gave me advice that, to this day, I appreciate very much. He did so in a very kind and humble way. Of course, then he reached the pinnacle and became chairman of that committee, a committee that he loved. He was a great chairman. He worked across the aisle in a very bipartisan way, and I think he tried to help everyone on both sides of the aisle and others in any way that he possibly could. I just wanted to join in this opportunity to pay tribute to a man who was a great American and a great Member of this body, Congressman James Oberstar. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I certainly associate myself with the remarks of Mr. Duncan. I am asking my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 179. That is the bill that would designate a United States post office located at 14 3rd Avenue Northwest in Jim Oberstar's hometown, Chisholm, Minnesota; and it would be called the James L. Oberstar Memorial Post Office. Mr. Speaker, I am speaking today for a memorial for Jim Oberstar not only because of my position on the committee, but for me, this is an act of love and respect. I am speaking for a man known in this House as one of singular intellect and personal qualities. Jim was a native of Chisholm. He graduated--and anybody who knew Jim will not be surprised at this--summa cum laude from the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota; then he got a master's degree in Belgium. That may be where he picked up his French, which he playfully used on us at every opportunity. Jim was not long out of college when he began working in this House, and working in this House was to determine his destiny for the rest of his life. He first served as clerk of the Committee on Rivers and Harbors, as it was then called. He became administrator of the Committee on Public Works--now called Transportation and Infrastructure--when Representative John Blatnik became chairman in 1970. Four years later, Jim, himself, ran for Congress, succeeding Mr. Blatnik who retired from Minnesota's Eighth District of Congress. Then Jim served 36 extraordinary years in this House, and he became the longest serving Member from Minnesota in the House of Representatives. During that period, Jim Oberstar became the leading expert on transportation and infrastructure in the Nation. Mr. Speaker, for example, he served as chairman of the Subcommittee on Aviation when it passed legislation, increasing our investment in airports and air security, which we are still benefiting from. Later, he became ranking member of the full committee. There, he worked [[Page H5106]] tirelessly for something we are trying to get in this House now, for that gas user fee, which used to be bipartisan and was often raised and helped Jim and those who served with him improve and make our system reliable on the transportation and infrastructure that we so often celebrate today--and I mean, all of it, roads, bridges, and transit alike. We were very fortunate when in 2007, Jim Oberstar was elected chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. It was during his chairmanship that the economy went down; and we really needed an expert on transportation and infrastructure, since investment in transportation and infrastructure is the best investment for the dollar during a recession and that, of course, was the deepest recession since the Great Depression. Jim's work during that period is still blossoming in the States. He held 300 hearings and passed almost 300 bills and resolutions out of committee and through the House. Nearly 200 of those pieces of legislation were approved by both Houses, including the Water Resources Development Act, the bill that authorized the maintenance and construction of America's harbors, as well as funding for important wildlife habitat projects. Mr. Speaker, Jim also was a cyclist. He took transportation seriously. He cycled on the trails that he helped get built and that he so loved. His knowledge of our work was so encyclopedic that Democrats and Republicans alike, when Jim spoke, listened hard because they knew they were getting a once-in-a-lifetime lesson in the complexities associated with transportation and infrastructure in our country. He was a particular leader on intermodalism, which we know as the transportation wave of the future today. It was with enormous sadness that we learned that Jim Oberstar passed away on May 2, 2014. He was 79 years old. Jim will long be remembered for his dedication to public service and for leaving his mark on transportation in our country. It is a mark that will never be erased. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Nolan), a sponsor of the House companion of S. 179, a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the gentleman who represents the very same district that Jim Oberstar represented. Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Representative Duncan and Representative Norton for the fine tributes to a fine Member and a real credit to this institution. This bill honors our friend and our colleague, the late Jim Oberstar, in an important way, by naming the United States post office in his hometown of Chisholm, Minnesota, the James L. Oberstar Memorial Post Office. I will never forget the first day that Jim walked into the Chamber through one of the side doors over here as a former Member of Congress. As he walked in and proceeded down the aisle, Members recognized him, and they started spontaneously, Democrats and Republicans alike, to applaud Jim Oberstar. By the time he got to the well, the whole House was engaged in this spontaneous, bipartisan, genuine, loving, and appreciative applause for Jim Oberstar. I, quite frankly, have never seen anything like it. I hope to see a lot more things like it in the days to come, but what a remarkable moment that was. It was a real genuine spirit of affection for someone who worked really hard, knew his material as well or better than anyone, and was such a good nonpartisan when it came to what is good for America; I have never quite seen anything like it. Jim received more honors than he could count in life; quite frankly, he received even more in his passing, but I think it is safe to say that no honor would please him more than being recognized by his colleagues in the hometown of Chisholm where Jim grew up. Chisholm, on Minnesota's Iron Range, is where he learned the value of ideas as a star on his high school debate team. They say he was a pretty good football player, too, but he liked to recall that the editor of his hometown said to him on a couple of occasions, ``Jim, you are a really good debater. You really know how to argue. You might want to keep working at that''--and how fitting that he would end up in the Congress of the United States. It is also in Chisholm where he learned about public service with his first working job for that editor, peddling papers to the miners and to the mining families and learning about the politics of the community. It is also where he learned hard work from his parents. Jim's dad worked in the mines his entire life and hardly ever missed a day's work. Chisholm is also the place where Jim learned those old-fashioned values that brought him to the House of Representatives. He believed that a good idea was a good idea, and it didn't matter if it was a Republican idea or a Democratic idea. All that mattered was that someone had offered the idea; and he had such enormous respect for the process and for his colleagues that he gave every good idea an open, an honest, and a fair hearing. {time} 1915 And if it turned out to be something good for the Nation, why, it was good enough for Jim, regardless of the origin. So, in urging my colleagues to honor Jim by passing this bill, I would like to ask that we honor him by rededicating ourselves to that spirit of bipartisanship, that spirit of working together, that spirit of getting things done that enabled Jim Oberstar to accomplish the many things that he did that were cited by my colleagues here just a few moments ago. That was the spirit that epitomized Jim Oberstar, and that is how he was so successful in getting things done. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to pass this legislation. Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum). Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for the time. I rise to honor the late Jim Oberstar, the Congressman from Minnesota's Eighth District. For 36 years, Jim Oberstar proudly served the residents of Minnesota's Eighth Congressional District. During his decades of service on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Representative Oberstar made investing in the future prosperity of this country a top priority. His commitment to laying the foundation for a 21st century transportation system helped make travel safer and kept millions of Americans working on the job and strengthened our economy. He worked and accomplished all of that. On August 1, 2007, the Interstate 35W bridge collapsed in Minnesota. Thirteen people lost their lives, including some of my constituents, and many more were injured. Chairman Oberstar moved with incredible speed to draft legislation to respond to the tragedy, and within 48 hours, he had passed a bill on the floor. On August 6, less than 1 week after the disaster, funding for construction of a new bridge was signed into law. But he didn't stop there. Chairman Oberstar worked to call attention to the epidemic of weak bridges all across our country. He fought to make bridge repair and replacement the focus of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Because of his commitment, thousands of bridges were thoroughly inspected, repaired, or, in fact, replaced. Not that Jim's response was anything out of the ordinary, throughout his career, Jim remained committed to fighting for the people he served and the causes he believed in. It is fitting that the post office in Chisholm, Minnesota, will be named the James L. Oberstar Memorial Post Office, because we know the success of a post office, after all, is inextricably linked with interstate highways, runways, docks, railways, and roads, because that is how the mail gets delivered and that is how we are connected throughout this world. [[Page H5107]] The imprint left by Congressman Jim Oberstar on every mode of transportation throughout our country cannot be overstated. And if I may, on a personal note, Jim, both professionally and personally, helped give the new Congresswoman from Minnesota a lot of thanks. So, with that, I want to just say, again, it is more than appropriate that the post office in his hometown of Chisholm, Minnesota, be known as the James L. Oberstar Memorial Post Office Building, a testament to his life's work. Jim, we thank you. Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski). Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 179, to honor the memory of Jim Oberstar, a colleague, mentor, and friend to me and to many more. From his time serving as a staff member to his tenure as the chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Jim spent every day of his 47 years on Capitol Hill working to improve our Nation's infrastructure and, in turn, the lives of Americans across the country. I was proud to serve with Jim on the T and I Committee for 4 years and to share in his passion for all the things that help ensure that our quality of life is high and that our economy is strong. Jim's thoughtful, forward-thinking approach to our Nation's infrastructure needs was built from years of experience and careful deliberation, and it earned him the well-deserved nickname, Mr. Transportation. During his time as chairman, committee members knew that they were going to learn something when they arrived at the committee room, and they are going to leave on a mission. Jim was truly a visionary when it came to our Nation's infrastructure system, but he didn't just talk about what needed to be done. Whether it was modernizing our Nation's airspace, improving rail safety, moving freight on time, repairing our roads, rehabilitating transit systems, or advancing cycling, Jim got things done. That is because Jim had a tireless work ethic and was as a great leader and friend as he was a policy expert. Jim treated people well, and it didn't matter whether you were Republican or Democrat; he was willing to work with you and help your district and constituents. My bicycle is a fixture in my office, and its presence reminds me of Jim and the time I spent cycling with him, when I learned more than I ever expected to be able to learn on a bike ride. Jim was known for his love of the French language, and he spoke it flawlessly. What fewer people know is that Jim perfected his French while serving in a volunteer program that preceded the Peace Corps. He was teaching French and Creole to Americans helping out in Haiti. Jim loved helping people. He was a big promoter of adoption and a defender of life. It was all an outgrowth, I believe, of his strong Catholic faith. Mr. Speaker, Congress and the Nation are better because of Jim Oberstar, and those of us who worked closely with him are better public servants, colleagues, and people because of him. S. 179 is a fitting tribute to Jim Oberstar, and I urge its passage. Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the ranking member and the manager of this legislation. I have had the privilege of being here during the mighty leadership of Jim Oberstar, and I would really call him America's Congressperson. He would be an eloquent spokesperson today for not isolating his advocacy for his own region or State, but he would rise up on the floor of the House to speak eloquently about the need for the refurbishing, the rebuilding, the restoration of America's infrastructure, transportation infrastructure, from highways and bridges and dams to airports and train stations and tracks. Mr. Speaker, I just came in today from Philadelphia on Amtrak, and as you know, on trains, we engage with our fellow travelers. I guess we are called passengers, but we are fellow travelers. It was interesting to engage with these constituents of America who were using this mode of transportation. They made a very valuable point. They said it is not the equipment of Amtrak or whether the Acela can move faster than any other train, it is the infrastructure upon which the train travels. It is the train tracks. It is the investment in that infrastructure to make Amtrak what it needs to be. Now, Congressman Oberstar certainly did not live in this part of the country, but he could see the general landscape of what America needed. I was very interested in hearing my colleague from Minnesota speak of that time when the bridge collapsed. What a tragic incident. All of us were appalled and saddened, and it was amazing how ``General Oberstar,'' if you will, took the leadership role to help America. So I rise today to support this underlying legislation and to simply thank him and to thank his family for sharing Jim Oberstar, the Frenchman, as he would like to say. And in concluding my remarks, might I say ``merci beaucoup'' to you, to the late Jim Oberstar, a man who loved America and could be called America's Congressperson. Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, Jim Oberstar was a rare Member. He managed to awe us by his knowledge at the same time that he nurtured us with his warmth and his kindness. That is why you have heard Members speak so eloquently about him today. He left his mark in this House. I am very pleased that, with this bill, he will leave his own mark in his own hometown with a memorial, a post office named for Jim Oberstar. I urge Members of this House to vote for this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I will just close by saying that I am very grateful to Jim Oberstar. He helped me obtain many things for my district. His last year in Congress, in August of that year, he came to my district to dedicate a beautiful new transit center which the city of Knoxville was kind enough to name after me. I always was grateful for his spending that day with me in Knoxville. I can tell you that I am now in my 27th year in Congress. Twenty-two of those years were spent working with Congressman Oberstar. This Nation, as Mr. Lipinski said a few minutes ago, is a better place today because of the work of Congressman Jim Oberstar. I urge all of my colleagues to support passage of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 179. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [House] [Pages H5105-H5107] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JAMES L. OBERSTAR MEMORIAL POST OFFICE BUILDING Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 179) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 14 3rd Avenue, NW, in Chisholm, Minnesota, as the ``James L. Oberstar Memorial Post Office Building''. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: S. 179 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. JAMES L. OBERSTAR MEMORIAL POST OFFICE BUILDING. (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 14 3rd Avenue, NW, in Chisholm, Minnesota, shall be known and designated as the ``James L. Oberstar Memorial Post Office Building''. (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ``James L. Oberstar Memorial Post Office Building''. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Trott). Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. {time} 1900 General Leave Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of S. 179, a bill to name a post office in Chisholm, Minnesota, after a very distinguished former Member of this body, Congressman James Oberstar. The bill was introduced by Senator Amy Klobuchar, and our colleague Congressman Richard Nolan has introduced House companion legislation. Mr. Oberstar served in the House for a remarkable 36 years, and I think it is very fitting and appropriate to honor his legacy by lending his name to a post office in his hometown of Chisolm. Congressman Oberstar was born in Chisholm, Minnesota, on September 10, 1934, and graduated from the high school there in 1952. Four years later, he earned a bachelor of arts from the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota. He later earned a master's degree from the College of Europe in Bruges, Belgium. A lot of people knew he was very fluent in French and liked to express himself on many trips in French. Before running for Congress himself, Congressman Oberstar served on the staff for Congressman John Blatnik of Minnesota from 1963 to 1974. In that capacity, he worked with Congressman Blatnik on all of the legislation from the Public Works and Transportation Committee. In the last 3 years he was with Congressman Blatnik, Congressman Oberstar became the chief of staff for that committee. Congressman Oberstar was first elected to represent the people of Minnesota's Eighth District in 1974. Among many notable achievements, he served as chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure in the 110th and 111th Congresses. In total, he served in 18 Congresses. Sadly, Mr. Oberstar passed away on May 3, 2014, in Potomac, Maryland.

From his time serving as a staff member to his tenure as the chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Jim spent every day of his 47 years on Capitol Hill working to improve our Nation's infrastructure and, in turn, the lives of Americans across the country.

Jim's thoughtful, forward-thinking approach to our Nation's infrastructure needs was built from years of experience and careful deliberation, and it earned him the well-deserved nickname, Mr. Transportation. During his time as chairman, committee members knew that they were going to learn something when they arrived at the committee room, and they are going to leave on a mission. Jim was truly a visionary when it came to our Nation's infrastructure system, but he didn't just talk about what needed to be done. Whether it was modernizing our Nation's airspace, improving rail safety, moving freight on time, repairing our roads, rehabilitating transit systems, or advancing cycling, Jim got things done. That is because Jim had a tireless work ethic and was as a great leader and friend as he was a policy expert. Jim treated people well, and it didn't matter whether you were Republican or Democrat; he was willing to work with you and help your district and constituents. My bicycle is a fixture in my office, and its presence reminds me of Jim and the time I spent cycling with him, when I learned more than I ever expected to be able to learn on a bike ride. Jim was known for his love of the French language, and he spoke it flawlessly. What fewer people know is that Jim perfected his French while serving in a volunteer program that preceded the Peace Corps. He was teaching French and Creole to Americans helping out in Haiti. Jim loved helping people. He was a big promoter of adoption and a defender of life. It was all an outgrowth, I believe, of his strong Catholic faith. Mr. Speaker, Congress and the Nation are better because of Jim Oberstar, and those of us who worked closely with him are better public servants, colleagues, and people because of him. S. 179 is a fitting tribute to Jim Oberstar, and I urge its passage. Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the ranking member and the manager of this legislation. I have had the privilege of being here during the mighty leadership of Jim Oberstar, and I would really call him America's Congressperson. He would be an eloquent spokesperson today for not isolating his advocacy for his own region or State, but he would rise up on the floor of the House to speak eloquently about the need for the refurbishing, the rebuilding, the restoration of America's infrastructure, transportation infrastructure, from highways and bridges and dams to airports and train stations and tracks. Mr. Speaker, I just came in today from Philadelphia on Amtrak, and as you know, on trains, we engage with our fellow travelers. I guess we are called passengers, but we are fellow travelers. It was interesting to engage with these constituents of America who were using this mode of transportation. They made a very valuable point. They said it is not the equipment of Amtrak or whether the Acela can move faster than any other train, it is the infrastructure upon which the train travels. It is the train tracks. It is the investment in that infrastructure to make Amtrak what it needs to be. Now, Congressman Oberstar certainly did not live in this part of the country, but he could see the general landscape of what America needed. I was very interested in hearing my colleague from Minnesota speak of that time when the bridge collapsed. What a tragic incident. All of us were appalled and saddened, and it was amazing how ``General Oberstar,'' if you will, took the leadership role to help America. So I rise today to support this underlying legislation and to simply thank him and to thank his family for sharing Jim Oberstar, the Frenchman, as he would like to say. And in concluding my remarks, might I say ``merci beaucoup'' to you, to the late Jim Oberstar, a man who loved America and could be called America's Congressperson. Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, Jim Oberstar was a rare Member. He managed to awe us by his knowledge at the same time that he nurtured us with his warmth and his kindness. That is why you have heard Members speak so eloquently about him today. He left his mark in this House. I am very pleased that, with this bill, he will leave his own mark in his own hometown with a memorial, a post office named for Jim Oberstar. I urge Members of this House to vote for this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I will just close by saying that I am very grateful to Jim Oberstar. He helped me obtain many things for my district. His last year in Congress, in August of that year, he came to my district to dedicate a beautiful new transit center which the city of Knoxville was kind enough to name after me. I always was grateful for his spending that day with me in Knoxville. I can tell you that I am now in my 27th year in Congress. Twenty-two of those years were spent working with Congressman Oberstar. This Nation, as Mr. Lipinski said a few minutes ago, is a better place today because of the work of Congressman Jim Oberstar. I urge all of my colleagues to support passage of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 179. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [House] [Pages H5105-H5107] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JAMES L. OBERSTAR MEMORIAL POST OFFICE BUILDING Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 179) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 14 3rd Avenue, NW, in Chisholm, Minnesota, as the ``James L. Oberstar Memorial Post Office Building''. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: S. 179 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. JAMES L. OBERSTAR MEMORIAL POST OFFICE BUILDING. (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal Service located at 14 3rd Avenue, NW, in Chisholm, Minnesota, shall be known and designated as the ``James L. Oberstar Memorial Post Office Building''. (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the United States to the facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ``James L. Oberstar Memorial Post Office Building''. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Trott). Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. {time} 1900 General Leave Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Tennessee? There was no objection. Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of S. 179, a bill to name a post office in Chisholm, Minnesota, after a very distinguished former Member of this body, Congressman James Oberstar. The bill was introduced by Senator Amy Klobuchar, and our colleague Congressman Richard Nolan has introduced House companion legislation. Mr. Oberstar served in the House for a remarkable 36 years, and I think it is very fitting and appropriate to honor his legacy by lending his name to a post office in his hometown of Chisolm. Congressman Oberstar was born in Chisholm, Minnesota, on September 10, 1934, and graduated from the high school there in 1952. Four years later, he earned a bachelor of arts from the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota. He later earned a master's degree from the College of Europe in Bruges, Belgium. A lot of people knew he was very fluent in French and liked to express himself on many trips in French. Before running for Congress himself, Congressman Oberstar served on the staff for Congressman John Blatnik of Minnesota from 1963 to 1974. In that capacity, he worked with Congressman Blatnik on all of the legislation from the Public Works and Transportation Committee. In the last 3 years he was with Congressman Blatnik, Congressman Oberstar became the chief of staff for that committee. Congressman Oberstar was first elected to represent the people of Minnesota's Eighth District in 1974. Among many notable achievements, he served as chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure in the 110th and 111th Congresses. In total, he served in 18 Congresses. Sadly, Mr. Oberstar passed away on May 3, 2014, in Potomac, Maryland. He certainly was a devoted public servant who left a remarkable legacy of service to the citizens of Minnesota and the United States. Earlier in this Congress, there was another tribute for Congressman Oberstar. At that time, I said this: It is an astounding figure to think that a man worked on this one committee for 47 years of his life, but he did so with great honor and distinction. In fact, I think most everybody knew that there was no one in the Congress and probably never has been anyone in the history of the Congress who has known transportation issues and understood them and worked on them longer and harder and with more effectiveness than Jim Oberstar did. At one point, he was chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee. In 1994, after the election, the Republicans took control, and I had the honor of becoming the chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, and I served for 6 years in that position, which was the maximum allowable on our side. When I took over as chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, I frequently heard Jim Oberstar referred to as ``Mr. Aviation.'' So I went to him and asked for his help, and he helped me, guided me, and gave me advice that, to this day, I appreciate very much. He did so in a very kind and humble way. Of course, then he reached the pinnacle and became chairman of that committee, a committee that he loved. He was a great chairman. He worked across the aisle in a very bipartisan way, and I think he tried to help everyone on both sides of the aisle and others in any way that he possibly could. I just wanted to join in this opportunity to pay tribute to a man who was a great American and a great Member of this body, Congressman James Oberstar. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I certainly associate myself with the remarks of Mr. Duncan. I am asking my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 179. That is the bill that would designate a United States post office located at 14 3rd Avenue Northwest in Jim Oberstar's hometown, Chisholm, Minnesota; and it would be called the James L. Oberstar Memorial Post Office. Mr. Speaker, I am speaking today for a memorial for Jim Oberstar not only because of my position on the committee, but for me, this is an act of love and respect. I am speaking for a man known in this House as one of singular intellect and personal qualities. Jim was a native of Chisholm. He graduated--and anybody who knew Jim will not be surprised at this--summa cum laude from the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota; then he got a master's degree in Belgium. That may be where he picked up his French, which he playfully used on us at every opportunity. Jim was not long out of college when he began working in this House, and working in this House was to determine his destiny for the rest of his life. He first served as clerk of the Committee on Rivers and Harbors, as it was then called. He became administrator of the Committee on Public Works--now called Transportation and Infrastructure--when Representative John Blatnik became chairman in 1970. Four years later, Jim, himself, ran for Congress, succeeding Mr. Blatnik who retired from Minnesota's Eighth District of Congress. Then Jim served 36 extraordinary years in this House, and he became the longest serving Member from Minnesota in the House of Representatives. During that period, Jim Oberstar became the leading expert on transportation and infrastructure in the Nation. Mr. Speaker, for example, he served as chairman of the Subcommittee on Aviation when it passed legislation, increasing our investment in airports and air security, which we are still benefiting from. Later, he became ranking member of the full committee. There, he worked [[Page H5106]] tirelessly for something we are trying to get in this House now, for that gas user fee, which used to be bipartisan and was often raised and helped Jim and those who served with him improve and make our system reliable on the transportation and infrastructure that we so often celebrate today--and I mean, all of it, roads, bridges, and transit alike. We were very fortunate when in 2007, Jim Oberstar was elected chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. It was during his chairmanship that the economy went down; and we really needed an expert on transportation and infrastructure, since investment in transportation and infrastructure is the best investment for the dollar during a recession and that, of course, was the deepest recession since the Great Depression. Jim's work during that period is still blossoming in the States. He held 300 hearings and passed almost 300 bills and resolutions out of committee and through the House. Nearly 200 of those pieces of legislation were approved by both Houses, including the Water Resources Development Act, the bill that authorized the maintenance and construction of America's harbors, as well as funding for important wildlife habitat projects. Mr. Speaker, Jim also was a cyclist. He took transportation seriously. He cycled on the trails that he helped get built and that he so loved. His knowledge of our work was so encyclopedic that Democrats and Republicans alike, when Jim spoke, listened hard because they knew they were getting a once-in-a-lifetime lesson in the complexities associated with transportation and infrastructure in our country. He was a particular leader on intermodalism, which we know as the transportation wave of the future today. It was with enormous sadness that we learned that Jim Oberstar passed away on May 2, 2014. He was 79 years old. Jim will long be remembered for his dedication to public service and for leaving his mark on transportation in our country. It is a mark that will never be erased. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Nolan), a sponsor of the House companion of S. 179, a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the gentleman who represents the very same district that Jim Oberstar represented. Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Representative Duncan and Representative Norton for the fine tributes to a fine Member and a real credit to this institution. This bill honors our friend and our colleague, the late Jim Oberstar, in an important way, by naming the United States post office in his hometown of Chisholm, Minnesota, the James L. Oberstar Memorial Post Office. I will never forget the first day that Jim walked into the Chamber through one of the side doors over here as a former Member of Congress. As he walked in and proceeded down the aisle, Members recognized him, and they started spontaneously, Democrats and Republicans alike, to applaud Jim Oberstar. By the time he got to the well, the whole House was engaged in this spontaneous, bipartisan, genuine, loving, and appreciative applause for Jim Oberstar. I, quite frankly, have never seen anything like it. I hope to see a lot more things like it in the days to come, but what a remarkable moment that was. It was a real genuine spirit of affection for someone who worked really hard, knew his material as well or better than anyone, and was such a good nonpartisan when it came to what is good for America; I have never quite seen anything like it. Jim received more honors than he could count in life; quite frankly, he received even more in his passing, but I think it is safe to say that no honor would please him more than being recognized by his colleagues in the hometown of Chisholm where Jim grew up. Chisholm, on Minnesota's Iron Range, is where he learned the value of ideas as a star on his high school debate team. They say he was a pretty good football player, too, but he liked to recall that the editor of his hometown said to him on a couple of occasions, ``Jim, you are a really good debater. You really know how to argue. You might want to keep working at that''--and how fitting that he would end up in the Congress of the United States. It is also in Chisholm where he learned about public service with his first working job for that editor, peddling papers to the miners and to the mining families and learning about the politics of the community. It is also where he learned hard work from his parents. Jim's dad worked in the mines his entire life and hardly ever missed a day's work. Chisholm is also the place where Jim learned those old-fashioned values that brought him to the House of Representatives. He believed that a good idea was a good idea, and it didn't matter if it was a Republican idea or a Democratic idea. All that mattered was that someone had offered the idea; and he had such enormous respect for the process and for his colleagues that he gave every good idea an open, an honest, and a fair hearing. {time} 1915 And if it turned out to be something good for the Nation, why, it was good enough for Jim, regardless of the origin. So, in urging my colleagues to honor Jim by passing this bill, I would like to ask that we honor him by rededicating ourselves to that spirit of bipartisanship, that spirit of working together, that spirit of getting things done that enabled Jim Oberstar to accomplish the many things that he did that were cited by my colleagues here just a few moments ago. That was the spirit that epitomized Jim Oberstar, and that is how he was so successful in getting things done. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to pass this legislation. Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum). Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for the time. I rise to honor the late Jim Oberstar, the Congressman from Minnesota's Eighth District. For 36 years, Jim Oberstar proudly served the residents of Minnesota's Eighth Congressional District. During his decades of service on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Representative Oberstar made investing in the future prosperity of this country a top priority. His commitment to laying the foundation for a 21st century transportation system helped make travel safer and kept millions of Americans working on the job and strengthened our economy. He worked and accomplished all of that. On August 1, 2007, the Interstate 35W bridge collapsed in Minnesota. Thirteen people lost their lives, including some of my constituents, and many more were injured. Chairman Oberstar moved with incredible speed to draft legislation to respond to the tragedy, and within 48 hours, he had passed a bill on the floor. On August 6, less than 1 week after the disaster, funding for construction of a new bridge was signed into law. But he didn't stop there. Chairman Oberstar worked to call attention to the epidemic of weak bridges all across our country. He fought to make bridge repair and replacement the focus of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Because of his commitment, thousands of bridges were thoroughly inspected, repaired, or, in fact, replaced. Not that Jim's response was anything out of the ordinary, throughout his career, Jim remained committed to fighting for the people he served and the causes he believed in. It is fitting that the post office in Chisholm, Minnesota, will be named the James L. Oberstar Memorial Post Office, because we know the success of a post office, after all, is inextricably linked with interstate highways, runways, docks, railways, and roads, because that is how the mail gets delivered and that is how we are connected throughout this world. [[Page H5107]] The imprint left by Congressman Jim Oberstar on every mode of transportation throughout our country cannot be overstated. And if I may, on a personal note, Jim, both professionally and personally, helped give the new Congresswoman from Minnesota a lot of thanks. So, with that, I want to just say, again, it is more than appropriate that the post office in his hometown of Chisholm, Minnesota, be known as the James L. Oberstar Memorial Post Office Building, a testament to his life's work. Jim, we thank you. Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski). Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 179, to honor the memory of Jim Oberstar, a colleague, mentor, and friend to me and to many more. From his time serving as a staff member to his tenure as the chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Jim spent every day of his 47 years on Capitol Hill working to improve our Nation's infrastructure and, in turn, the lives of Americans across the country. I was proud to serve with Jim on the T and I Committee for 4 years and to share in his passion for all the things that help ensure that our quality of life is high and that our economy is strong.

then he got a master's degree in belgium. that may be where he picked up his french, which he playfully used on us at every opportunity. jim was not long out of college when he began working in this house, and working in this house was to determine his destiny for the rest of his life. he first served as clerk of the committee on rivers and harbors, as it was then called. he became administrator of the committee on public works--now called transportation and infrastructure--when representative john blatnik became chairman in 1970. four years later, jim, himself, ran for congress, succeeding mr. blatnik who retired from minnesota's eighth district of congress. then jim served 36 extraordinary years in this house, and he became the longest serving member from minnesota in the house of representatives. during that period, jim oberstar became the leading expert on transportation and infrastructure in the nation. mr. speaker, for example, he served as chairman of the subcommittee on aviation when it passed legislation, increasing our investment in airports and air security, which we are still benefiting from. later, he became ranking member of the full committee. there, he worked [[page h5106]] tirelessly for something we are trying to get in this house now, for that gas user fee, which used to be bipartisan and was often raised and helped jim and those who served with him improve and make our system reliable on the transportation and infrastructure that we so often celebrate today--and i mean, all of it, roads, bridges, and transit alike. we were very fortunate when in 2007, jim oberstar was elected chairman of the committee on transportation and infrastructure. it was during his chairmanship that the economy went down; and we really needed an expert on transportation and infrastructure, since investment in transportation and infrastructure is the best investment for the dollar during a recession and that, of course, was the deepest recession since the great depression. jim's work during that period is still blossoming in the states. he held 300 hearings and passed almost 300 bills and resolutions out of committee and through the house. nearly 200 of those pieces of legislation were approved by both houses, including the water resources development act, the bill that authorized the maintenance and construction of america's harbors, as well as funding for important wildlife habitat projects. mr. speaker, jim also was a cyclist. he took transportation seriously. he cycled on the trails that he helped get built and that he so loved. his knowledge of our work was so encyclopedic that democrats and republicans alike, when jim spoke, listened hard because they knew they were getting a once-in-a-lifetime lesson in the complexities associated with transportation and infrastructure in our country. he was a particular leader on intermodalism, which we know as the transportation wave of the future today. it was with enormous sadness that we learned that jim oberstar passed away on may 2, 2014. he was 79 years old. jim will long be remembered for his dedication to public service and for leaving his mark on transportation in our country. it is a mark that will never be erased. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. duncan of tennessee. i reserve the balance of my time. ms. norton. mr. speaker, i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from minnesota (mr. nolan), a sponsor of the house companion of s. 179, a member of the transportation and infrastructure committee and the gentleman who represents the very same district that jim oberstar represented. mr. nolan. mr. speaker, i would like to thank representative duncan and representative norton for the fine tributes to a fine member and a real credit to this institution. this bill honors our friend and our colleague, the late jim oberstar, in an important way, by naming the united states post office in his hometown of chisholm, minnesota, the james l. oberstar memorial post office. i will never forget the first day that jim walked into the chamber through one of the side doors over here as a former member of congress. as he walked in and proceeded down the aisle, members recognized him, and they started spontaneously, democrats and republicans alike, to applaud jim oberstar. by the time he got to the well, the whole house was engaged in this spontaneous, bipartisan, genuine, loving, and appreciative applause for jim oberstar. i, quite frankly, have never seen anything like it. i hope to see a lot more things like it in the days to come, but what a remarkable moment that was. it was a real genuine spirit of affection for someone who worked really hard, knew his material as well or better than anyone, and was such a good nonpartisan when it came to what is good for america; i have never quite seen anything like it. jim received more honors than he could count in life; quite frankly, he received even more in his passing, but i think it is safe to say that no honor would please him more than being recognized by his colleagues in the hometown of chisholm where jim grew up. chisholm, on minnesota's iron range, is where he learned the value of ideas as a star on his high school debate team. they say he was a pretty good football player, too, but he liked to recall that the editor of his hometown said to him on a couple of occasions, ``jim, you are a really good debater. you really know how to argue. you might want to keep working at that''--and how fitting that he would end up in the congress of the united states. it is also in chisholm where he learned about public service with his first working job for that editor, peddling papers to the miners and to the mining families and learning about the politics of the community. it is also where he learned hard work from his parents. jim's dad worked in the mines his entire life and hardly ever missed a day's work. chisholm is also the place where jim learned those old-fashioned values that brought him to the house of representatives. he believed that a good idea was a good idea, and it didn't matter if it was a republican idea or a democratic idea. all that mattered was that someone had offered the idea; and he had such enormous respect for the process and for his colleagues that he gave every good idea an open, an honest, and a fair hearing. {time} 1915 and if it turned out to be something good for the nation, why, it was good enough for jim, regardless of the origin. so, in urging my colleagues to honor jim by passing this bill, i would like to ask that we honor him by rededicating ourselves to that spirit of bipartisanship, that spirit of working together, that spirit of getting things done that enabled jim oberstar to accomplish the many things that he did that were cited by my colleagues here just a few moments ago. that was the spirit that epitomized jim oberstar, and that is how he was so successful in getting things done. mr. speaker, i strongly urge my colleagues to pass this legislation. mr. duncan of tennessee. mr. speaker, i continue to reserve the balance of my time. ms. norton. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from minnesota (ms. mccollum). ms. mccollum. mr. speaker, i thank the ranking member for the time. i rise to honor the late jim oberstar, the congressman from minnesota's eighth district. for 36 years, jim oberstar proudly served the residents of minnesota's eighth congressional district. during his decades of service on the house transportation and infrastructure committee, representative oberstar made investing in the future prosperity of this country a top priority. his commitment to laying the foundation for a 21st century transportation system helped make travel safer and kept millions of americans working on the job and strengthened our economy. he worked and accomplished all of that. on august 1, 2007, the interstate 35w bridge collapsed in minnesota. thirteen people lost their lives, including some of my constituents, and many more were injured. chairman oberstar moved with incredible speed to draft legislation to respond to the tragedy, and within 48 hours, he had passed a bill on the floor. on august 6, less than 1 week after the disaster, funding for construction of a new bridge was signed into law. but he didn't stop there. chairman oberstar worked to call attention to the epidemic of weak bridges all across our country. he fought to make bridge repair and replacement the focus of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009. because of his commitment, thousands of bridges were thoroughly inspected, repaired, or, in fact, replaced. not that jim's response was anything out of the ordinary, throughout his career, jim remained committed to fighting for the people he served and the causes he believed in. it is fitting that the post office in chisholm, minnesota, will be named the james l. oberstar memorial post office, because we know the success of a post office, after all, is inextricably linked with interstate highways, runways, docks, railways, and roads, because that is how the mail gets delivered and that is how we are connected throughout this world. [[page h5107]] the imprint left by congressman jim oberstar on every mode of transportation throughout our country cannot be overstated. and if i may, on a personal note, jim, both professionally and personally, helped give the new congresswoman from minnesota a lot of thanks. so, with that, i want to just say, again, it is more than appropriate that the post office in his hometown of chisholm, minnesota, be known as the james l. oberstar memorial post office building, a testament to his life's work. jim, we thank you. mr. duncan of tennessee. mr. speaker, i continue to reserve the balance of my time. ms. norton. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from illinois (mr. lipinski). mr. lipinski. mr. speaker, i rise in support of s. 179, to honor the memory of jim oberstar, a colleague, mentor, and friend to me and to many more. from his time serving as a staff member to his tenure as the chairman of the house committee on transportation and infrastructure, jim spent every day of his 47 years on capitol hill working to improve our nation's infrastructure and, in turn, the lives of americans across the country. i was proud to serve with jim on the t and i committee for 4 years and to share in his passion for all the things that help ensure that our quality of life is high and that our economy is strong. jim's thoughtful, forward-thinking approach to our nation's infrastructure needs was built from years of experience and careful deliberation, and it earned him the well-deserved nickname, mr. transportation. during his time as chairman, committee members knew that they were going to learn something when they arrived at the committee room, and they are going to leave on a mission. jim was truly a visionary when it came to our nation's infrastructure system, but he didn't just talk about what needed to be done. whether it was modernizing our nation's airspace, improving rail safety, moving freight on time, repairing our roads, rehabilitating transit systems, or advancing cycling, jim got things done. that is because jim had a tireless work ethic and was as a great leader and friend as he was a policy expert. jim treated people well, and it didn't matter whether you were republican or democrat; he was willing to work with you and help your district and constituents. my bicycle is a fixture in my office, and its presence reminds me of jim and the time i spent cycling with him, when i learned more than i ever expected to be able to learn on a bike ride. jim was known for his love of the french language, and he spoke it flawlessly. what fewer people know is that jim perfected his french while serving in a volunteer program that preceded the peace corps. he was teaching french and creole to americans helping out in haiti. jim loved helping people. he was a big promoter of adoption and a defender of life. it was all an outgrowth, i believe, of his strong catholic faith. mr. speaker, congress and the nation are better because of jim oberstar, and those of us who worked closely with him are better public servants, colleagues, and people because of him. s. 179 is a fitting tribute to jim oberstar, and i urge its passage. mr. duncan of tennessee. mr. speaker, i continue to reserve the balance of my time. ms. norton. mr. speaker, i am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from texas (ms. jackson lee). ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, let me thank the ranking member and the manager of this legislation. i have had the privilege of being here during the mighty leadership of jim oberstar, and i would really call him america's congressperson. he would be an eloquent spokesperson today for not isolating his advocacy for his own region or state, but he would rise up on the floor of the house to speak eloquently about the need for the refurbishing, the rebuilding, the restoration of america's infrastructure, transportation infrastructure, from highways and bridges and dams to airports and train stations and tracks. mr. speaker, i just came in today from philadelphia on amtrak, and as you know, on trains, we engage with our fellow travelers. i guess we are called passengers, but we are fellow travelers. it was interesting to engage with these constituents of america who were using this mode of transportation. they made a very valuable point. they said it is not the equipment of amtrak or whether the acela can move faster than any other train, it is the infrastructure upon which the train travels. it is the train tracks. it is the investment in that infrastructure to make amtrak what it needs to be. now, congressman oberstar certainly did not live in this part of the country, but he could see the general landscape of what america needed. i was very interested in hearing my colleague from minnesota speak of that time when the bridge collapsed. what a tragic incident. all of us were appalled and saddened, and it was amazing how ``general oberstar,'' if you will, took the leadership role to help america. so i rise today to support this underlying legislation and to simply thank him and to thank his family for sharing jim oberstar, the frenchman, as he would like to say. and in concluding my remarks, might i say ``merci beaucoup'' to you, to the late jim oberstar, a man who loved america and could be called america's congressperson. mr. duncan of tennessee. mr. speaker, i continue to reserve the balance of my time. ms. norton. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. mr. speaker, jim oberstar was a rare member. he managed to awe us by his knowledge at the same time that he nurtured us with his warmth and his kindness. that is why you have heard members speak so eloquently about him today. he left his mark in this house. i am very pleased that, with this bill, he will leave his own mark in his own hometown with a memorial, a post office named for jim oberstar. i urge members of this house to vote for this bill. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. duncan. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. i will just close by saying that i am very grateful to jim oberstar. he helped me obtain many things for my district. his last year in congress, in august of that year, he came to my district to dedicate a beautiful new transit center which the city of knoxville was kind enough to name after me. i always was grateful for his spending that day with me in knoxville. i can tell you that i am now in my 27th year in congress. twenty-two of those years were spent working with congressman oberstar. this nation, as mr. lipinski said a few minutes ago, is a better place today because of the work of congressman jim oberstar. i urge all of my colleagues to support passage of this bill, and i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from tennessee (mr. duncan) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, s. 179. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",22423

Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Illinois? There was no objection. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, we are here tonight to have an important conversation, a conversation that is long overdue, a conversation that is crucial to healing America's deep racial wounds, our topic being the Confederate battle flag and why racial symbols matter. The Charleston 9 killings focused many of our attention on the significant appropriateness and bigoted history of this flag. In 2015, why do so many still revere a flag that tolerated the shackling of people because of their skin, a flag that allowed human beings to be counted as three-fifths of a person, a flag that was flown during lynchings, the holding of children, and one that symbolized a movement to deny education and equal treatment under our laws? Fifty years since Selma, we think of the Freedom Riders, marchers, boycotters, protesters, and policymakers who pointed our Nation in a more positive direction. They knew it was time to reject the traditions of the past. The civil rights movement symbolized the quest of equality and a change in mood for America. Thousands from all backgrounds had the courage to join in peaceful protests, lunch counter sit-ins, and boycotts at the expense of being jailed, beaten, or killed. They did this for one Nation and one flag. And in the way of these Americans stood those who believed in the perseverance of inequality, who believed in an America of White and colored, an America of two flags, and the Confederate battle flag represented their America. Jim Crow America saw States that seceded from the Union, reacting to the growth of the civil rights movement, with the use of the Confederate battle flag as the representation of their resistant movement. In 1956, the State of Georgia incorporated the battle flag into its official State flag design. The movement continued into the sixties, where it met renewed and intensified opposition, opposition that waved the Confederate battle flag in the name of continued racial oppression. In 1961, just 2 months after the sentencing of nine students arrested for a lunch counter sit-in in Rock Hill, South Carolina, the Confederate battle flag was raised over South Carolina's State house during a centennial celebration of the Civil War's opening. That same year, in neighboring Georgia, Charlayne Hunter and Hamilton Holmes were the first two African American students to be admitted to the University of Georgia. Their admission only came after a court order sent from Federal court. Eleven days after arriving on campus, Hunter and Holmes were attacked by a mob of White rioters who threw rocks and bottles at them while waving the rebel flag. The attacks were so fierce that the dean of students suspended both Hunter and Holmes for their own safety. Now, even with me highlighting this violence, we are told that the stars and bars are about heritage. That heritage, Mr. Speaker, is not so subtle a reminder to African Americans that they are less than-- maybe not three-fifths of a person, but still not equal. This is a reminder that there are two classes of citizens. And despite our Declaration of Independence clearly stating that all men are created equal, this is a reminder that there is a lesser class and will never be equal. But why are we honoring the heritage and flag of the hooded night riders of the Klan at our State houses and in this Congress instead of the flag of the Freedom Riders who died for a single, fair, and equal America? Two years after Martin Luther King, Jr., delivered his ``I have dream'' speech before 600 civil rights marchers, including our friend and colleague from Georgia, Congressman John Lewis, a different group of civil rights heroes were greeted by police officers in Selma, Alabama, proudly displaying the Confederate flag on the side of their helmets. These officers brutally beat the marchers, and their actions were a reminder that Dr. King's speech had not yet resonated in the hearts of those who needed to hear it most. But it was the undeterred resilience of the protesters who refused to back down and refused to resort to violence that persevered. It was the love, the respect, and the mutual understanding that displayed what was the strongest symbol of strength, honor, and heritage than the Confederate battle flag. Mr. Speaker, we have come a long way since 1965, but we still have a ways to go. We must move forward. The needed progress, however, will not come if the Federal Government continues to provide American citizens with reminders of our hateful and oppressive past in a manner that legitimizes such hate. I am glad to host this important Special Order hour with my colleague from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) to talk about where we go from here and why we continue to give energy to symbols of hate and division. I yield to the kind gentleman from Newark, New Jersey (Mr. Payne). Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois. This is a very timely topic, as we have seen what has transpired in our Nation over the past several weeks. It is incredible to me how fast this issue has moved over the past month. But it always seems that it takes a horrific act in this country for us to wake up and realize that maybe something isn't right. {time} 1930 Nine people at church study on a Wednesday night, not knowing their fate, were gunned down in cold blood by someone who actually said: You know, they were so nice to me, I almost didn't do it, but I had to. Last week in South Carolina, there was a monumental step in removing the Confederate flag from its State capitol, where it had shamefully flown for 54 years; but here in our Nation's Capitol last week, Republicans tried to go back to the future. House Republicans had to pull a vote on a spending bill because some of their Members opposed a measure that would ban Confederate flags from national cemeteries, and when the Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, presented an opportunity for Republicans to do the right thing and immediately remove the Confederate flag from the Capitol Grounds, they punted. South Carolina, the birthplace of the Confederacy, had the courage to do what the House Republicans did not, remove that dreaded symbol. It is the symbol of an incomprehensible hate, a hate that manifested itself in a massacre. Since that unfortunate day 1 month ago, we, as a nation, have been forced to look inward at who we are and who we want to be. Mr. Speaker, out of this immense grief of that dark day in Charleston came a resounding call throughout our Nation to remove the Confederate flag and other symbols of racism and racial supremacy. For many, the removal of these symbols is a logical step in the trajectory of our Nation, a necessary action on the path toward the more perfect Union. For others, calls to remove these symbols of hate are seen as an attack [[Page H5110]] on the Southern identity, heritage, and culture; but arguing that the Confederate flag is a symbol of Southern pride celebrates a single homogenous culture. It means listening to only some voices at the expense of others. It means ignoring the African American experience throughout our Nation's history from the dark period of slavery to the civil rights movement to the present day. According to a report by the Equal Justice Initiative, 3,959 African Americans in 12 States were killed by the terror of lynching between 1877 and 1950, 3,959 Americans lynched. If we are going to refer to the past and debate over the Confederate flag, certainly, we need to take all of this into account. The Confederate flag has always stood for racial supremacy and bigotry, and if we are to realize our Nation's promise of justice and full equality, we cannot embrace this symbol. Eradicating symbols of hatred, violence, and cruel oppression steeped in racism is a critical step to confronting prejudice in our society. Now, Mr. Speaker, we have all heard complaints that this debate does not matter and that removing the Confederate flag and other symbols of hatred is a distraction from the larger problems facing our Nation, such as rampant gun violence. I agree that significantly more must be done to address racism and persistent inequality in our Nation. I agree that we need meaningful gun reform from expanding background checks to reducing unchecked online ammunition purchases. I agree that we need to create jobs, reduce wealth disparities, and expand educational opportunities. But symbols matter; symbols legitimize public opinion and, in doing so, entrench attitudes and beliefs. At the same time, they create a meaning, shape actions, and connect us to one another. Just as a symbol can connect us, they can tear us apart. Mr. Speaker, as I go to my seat, I was talking to my staff the other day about this and how much we were happy to see that flag lowered. The symbol is gone, but the sentiment remains. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Congressman Payne, for those words. Right now, it is my pleasure to introduce the Congressman from North Carolina and the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressman Butterfield. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, let me first thank you, Congresswoman Kelly and Congressman Payne, for your leadership. Your leadership is very much appreciated, and your constituents in your respective districts should be very proud of each one of you. I know the Congressional Black Caucus is proud of you. For the past several weeks, Mr. Speaker, the Nation has been focused on the Confederate battle flag. Most fair-minded Americans have been asking the question: Why is this flag continuing to fly on State grounds and Federal lands? And why are policymakers refusing to squarely address this issue? The Confederate battle flag, Mr. Speaker, represents an era of American history that ended--or at least it should have ended--150 years ago. This flag represents the years following President Lincoln's election. Those years starting in December of 1860 saw 11 Southern States leave the Union. The fancy name for their leaving the Union, Mr. Speaker, was called secession, but the reality was that these Southern States were rebelling. They were in rebellion against the Union. They organized a so-called government called the Confederate States of America. They took up arms, Mr. Speaker, and they fought against the Union for 4 long years until they surrendered. They then returned to the Union. The Confederate flag represents that era where Southern States were resisting freedom for 4 million slaves. There continues to be elements today in our society who subscribe to separation of the races--how unfortunate. There continues to be elements in our society who believe in White supremacy. The question now, Mr. Speaker, is: Do we constructively address the question of hate groups in America? Do we continue to insist that other States remove symbols of White supremacy as South Carolina has done? Or do we continue to simply ignore racism? Other States continue to display Confederate flags, and even in this Capitol--even in this Capitol--you will find eight statues of Confederate soldiers who fought against the Stars and Stripes. Mr. Speaker, I call upon every American to bury for good the dark history of slavery and bigotry. We are a great nation, and we will be even greater when we can judge our neighbor on the content of their character and not on the color of their skin. Let's remove these symbols from our view. I thank each one of the floor managers. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Congressman Butterfield, for those fine words. Many questions, many questions: Why are they still holding on? Is it just heritage and tradition? Or is it something more? At this time, Mr. Speaker, I would like to introduce the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, the gentlewoman from Illinois, and my friend, the gentleman from New Jersey, for their important leadership they are exercising here this evening. Mr. Speaker, I have come to speak about why symbols matter and why this symbol, the Confederate flag, must not stop with the flag, but must also go to what to do not only about the flag, but about the guns that took down the Charleston 9. To be sure, symbols matter, Mr. Speaker. To take two of the most powerful symbols in the world, the cross and the Star of David, we know well these symbols can sometimes mean everything. We also know that the Confederate flag is a symbol of a different and lower order. A symbol stands for more than itself; the symbol tells a story. The religious symbols evoke tears; they evoke joy, and they evoke their own set of stories. The Confederate flag, when it led to the extraordinary tragedy of the Charleston 9 will always--should always--make us think of the gun that was responsible for the Charleston 9--not just the symbol, but the story behind the symbol. In the 19th century, the flag signaled the importance of slavery. In the 20th century, it had a different meaning. Robert E. Lee had told his soldiers: Put down the flag. We are one Union now. He was, in a real sense, the counterpart to Abraham Lincoln, who was trying to draw us together after Lee had lost that war. In the 20th century, the flag was revived. It was revived by Southern Democrats--Dixiecrats, as they called themselves. It has been, in the 20th century and, now, the 21st century, a symbol of discrimination and racism. No matter what it stood for in the 19th century about heritage, it lost that meaning when, in the 20th century, George Wallace raised it and said ``segregation now'' and ``segregation forever.'' Nobody who now speaks of heritage then said: Wait a minute, Governor Wallace, don't take away our heritage. Only when African Americans have the nerve to raise the notion, after we lost nine good people in Charleston, does it somehow now become a symbol of heritage. I will give Senator Mitch McConnell some credit. He wants to remove the statue of Jefferson Davis from the Kentucky State Capitol, but when asked about removing the Jefferson Davis statue from the United States Capitol, Mr. McConnell grew silent. We have got to come to grips with what this flag meant to this boy who used a gun. I am not going to forget those who died and what we owe those who died. The Dixiecrats bolted from Harry S. Truman when Truman refused to embrace their racism. These were Southern Democrats, and we owe them the 21st century meaning of the Confederate flag. Mr. Speaker, why are we talking about this symbol and not another symbol? The other symbol is the gun in America. The grace of the people of Charleston so overwhelmed the country that there were many who were simply grateful that, instead of bursting forward with rage, they showed their extraordinary Christian heritage, the heritage they undoubtedly shared with the gunman. We were so grateful, all of us, and so proud that we have not talked about [[Page H5111]] what took the lives of these nine good people. Well, I want to talk about it because the Confederate flag for me now will always represent those nine people and the gun that took their lives. That 21-year-old kid didn't know anything about them except their Christian love when they invited him into their sanctuary. But, he knew about what that flag stood for, and he raised that flag before he went into that sanctuary. {time} 2000 We must not forget not only the flag--we cannot live by symbols alone--we must not forget the gun that took down the Charleston 9. Now, I understand--I read--that Senator Manchin and Senator Toomey are interested in reviving their gun safety legislation. There are several bills here in the House that do that in one form or another. We know what happened. There was a breakdown in the background check system, which is why this young man was even able to get a gun. He would have been denied a gun if those who opposed any bill hadn't assured that the bill would have only a 3-day time period, during which, if you couldn't find something on the individual, then he got his gun, no matter who he was. That is how he got his gun. There are some of us who know full well that the Confederate flag has done more than put the flag back on the agenda--on the Nation's agenda--it has put gun safety once again on the agenda. I must say, I don't believe we, who celebrate the extraordinary grace of the families of the Charleston 9, owe them only our speeches about the flag. They probably, once they saw it come down, have moved on; and now, they have only their loved ones to think about. If I were one of them, I would wonder: What are those who celebrate the flag coming down going to do about making sure that, never again, will people like our loved ones have to suffer because of gunfire? The flag is the symbol that is important to raising our consciousness in the long run. If all we have is our memory of the symbol and not why that symbol became important, then we will leave on the table a real memorial to the Charleston 9. I appreciate the time. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Congresswoman Holmes. I am so glad that you and Congressman Payne brought up the issue of the gun because we cannot forget that either. I look at Charleston as when racism and hate found the gun. At this time, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Fudge), our former head of the Congressional Black Caucus. Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I want to thank my colleagues, Congressman Payne and Congresswoman Kelly, for leading the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour tonight. Mr. Speaker, if you have not noticed, the people of this country are fed up. Quite frankly, so am I. We are at a point in our Nation's history when we can no longer give lip service to equality and opportunities to succeed. We must take action to show we mean what we say; otherwise, it is nothing more than empty rhetoric. Mr. Speaker, the Confederate flag is more than just a piece of fabric. It is more than just a visual representation of the Confederacy or part of the storied history of the South. If that were true, we would not be having this conversation today. We would not have buried nine Americans murdered because of the color of their skin, and the Confederate battle flag would still be flying in the State of South Carolina. Let's be honest about the history of the Confederate battle flag. While the majority of this House may want to ignore the facts and rewrite history, we will not be ignored. The Confederate battle flag and any adaptation of it is a painful reminder of intimidation, torture, and murder for all of us in the Black community. It is a flying symbol of hatred and injustice that tells Black and Brown people in this country: Your lives have no value, and you don't matter. It is an embarrassment to all Americans that the majority of this House introduced a spending amendment which included language allowing the battle flag on Federal properties. It is just plain shameful that they would go even further and use procedure to stifle a motion to openly discuss a ban of the Confederate battle flag imagery from the Capitol Grounds. How can the Members of the majority of this House continue to say that they represent all Americans when they refuse to have a real discussion about what is really happening in our country? Have we learned nothing from what has happened in the past few weeks? In a June Gallup poll, African Americans ranked race relations as the most important issue facing the United States. Will taking down the Confederate battle flag immediately change this perspective? Absolutely not--but it will certainly do more than letting it continue to fly. Mr. Speaker, it is time we do away with lip service. It is time we listen to our constituents and take real action toward healing the racial wounds of this country. It is time we move forward. The flag must come down. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Fudge for her eloquent words and the truth of what happened in Congress last week and what we need to do to go forward. At this time, I yield to the gentlewoman from Houston, Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the managers of this very Special Order and my words to them and to this House. I want you to take note of the spirit in which these Members have come. If our constituents are seeing us and watching us, if those who agree with us are watching, no one has come with anger and a cry of hysteria. They have come with a reasoned request and pronouncement of the wrongness of the present situation in this House. Let me say that it was in 1864 that the States were given the call to send forward two statutes to come to represent their States in the United States Congress. In addition, we know that the United States Congress has a number of flags representing various States. This was to be the people's House, and the people's House would reflect the people of the United States of America. History should be something that grows with the Nation and reflects the goodness of the Nation. Yes, there is history that should be taught, such as the ugliness and violence of the slave history; but it is not to be honored. I join my colleagues today to be able to call for the taking down of signs of Confederacy in the United States Capitol--in particular, as I am in the House of Representatives, in the people's House. Let me give you a credible basis upon which to do so, why this Supreme Court decision has been so ignored. Let me cite it for my colleagues, Walker III v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, issued on June 18, 2015--ironically, the day after the martyrdom of nine wonderful African Americans practicing their Christian faith. This particular decision indicates that the State of Texas was to be supported. This was a case that engaged many of our constituents in Texas. We organize and galvanize. I want to thank Dr. Clark, the president of the Missionary Baptist General Convention of Texas, and Reverend Max Miller, who came up as we argued this case. We were convincing. The Texas Department of Motor Vehicles board agreed that a Confederate license plate issued by the State of Texas would be offensive and would be considered, in essence, a public action or public speech. For those who want to raise the question of the First Amendment, this cry that we, as members of the Congressional Black Caucus, are making is perfectly constitutional and legitimate. We are talking about flags that are flown on State property or Federal property. This caucus should be congratulated. It is succinct in its argument; it is detailed in its argument, and no First Amendment opposition can be raised because the Supreme Court of the United States has said that we can deny utilizing the Confederate flag that may be considered State action as it is placed on Federal lands on the Federal property here. [[Page H5112]] Our colleagues, in particular Hakeem Jeffries and Mr. Huffman and others, understood that when they acted last week. Now, the considerate thing to have done is there are amendments to stay in place, the Interior bill to be voted on, and the right thing would have been done because they argued the point that this was State or Federal action. We now come again to try and clarify for our colleagues that these flags should come down. In the privileged resolutions that have gone on last week, they made the point very clear that it was an insult to the dignity of the House. I have introduced H. Res. 342 that I hope will complement, and it is one that talks about the enhancement of unity in America and stands on the Walker decision and, in particular, makes it very clear that divisive symbols--license plates, specialty license plates, replicas, and flags--on public buildings or government property and symbols on State or Federal action, State public speech--that is a speech of those you represent--should not be allowed. How divisive is that point of view? It is not. The divisiveness is those that stand on a false sense of history, yet want to offend those who likewise have great leadership. Let me make this point about the battle flag, this Confederate flag. Might I ask the question: Have southerners not fought in the War of 1812, in World War I, in World War II, in the Korean war, in the Hungarian war in the fifties, and in Vietnam and shed their blood under this flag, have they not been honored when they have shed their blood? Not only that, when Confederate soldiers died, they were honored appropriately in graves where those who desired to honor that shedding of the blood were allowed to do so. We did not run into the funerals of those Southern fallen soldiers and cast upon them and curse them and deny them. They were allowed to be honored appropriately, and they now go into the annals of history. When you understand what grounds they stood on, what their general stood on, such as Jefferson Davis, who called the individuals who were slaves as unprofitable savages--that is what one general who has been honored has called them, ``unprofitable savages''--is that the history that we should be honoring? Is that what we should be lifting up? Is that what should be placed in the place of honor in the United States Congress? Is that engaged in the uplifting of the dignity of the House? Or is it insulting the dignity of the House? To my colleagues, I stand with you today to join in trying to create an understanding of the rightness of the work of our colleagues last week on the Interior bill, of the rightness of the Congressional Black Caucus going, as someone would say, on and on and on about this flag; and my good friend from New Jersey said it is symbols, and we need to bridge the gap of the inequity and wealth, we need education, we need jobs. Let me be very clear, Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Black Caucus and my colleagues and the Democratic Caucus and good will Republicans are fighting for jobs--or should be--fighting for education. We are not languishing along the side highway of life. We fought to maintain the ObamaCare or the Affordable Care Act. We are not ignoring the other desires of our constituents. Let me close on this final point, and I am glad that my colleague from the District of Columbia raised it, and Congresswoman Kelly has been a leader, and Congresswoman Kelly, let's rise again, and that is the horror of gun violence. {time} 2015 Let me say to Director Comey, since I am on the Judiciary Committee, thank you for your honesty, but let me make it very clear that we suffered this loophole because of the opposition to the sensibleness of the Brady anti-gun violence legislation. Imbedded in it was this nonsensical point that, if I don't hear from you, then I am going to sell it. Who is selling it? The gun store. I have no opposition to our fellow citizens who make their living and provide for their families by selling guns. I do have opposition to the evil and vile perpetrator who went into that Mother Emanuel Church and killed illegally with a gun that he should not have had. He did so because the 3-day time had expired, because there was a time when the NICS was closed--that is the entity that the FBI relies upon--and the 3 days expired, and the owner said, ``I am going to sell the gun.'' This week I will be introducing a single piece of legislation--and I ask my colleagues to join me--I know there are many other bills--to eliminate the 3-day period of discretion, that no discretion will exist. They either answer the question that he or she is eligible or it is denied. So on the graves of these wonderful martyrs, I stand in honor of them. I mourn them, and I mourn for their families. I say to them: We will never forget. Once and for all, bring the flag down and remove these items in this place of honor that have denigrated and considered one race of people vile and unequal. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Congresswoman Jackson Lee. Always detailed and insightful. Thank you for all of your work on the Judiciary Committee. It is very much appreciated and hailed. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries), who took center stage last week as we discussed and worked toward the removal of the flag. Mr. JEFFRIES. I want to thank my good friend, the distinguished gentlewoman from Illinois, Robin Kelly, for once again presiding over this important CBC Special Order hour, as well as her co-anchor, the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey, who is right across the Hudson River, and who so ably serves the communities of Newark and beyond. Mr. Speaker, this evening we have heard from so many distinguished members of the Congressional Black Caucus, most recently from the gentlewoman from Texas, with whom I serve on the Judiciary Committee, about the importance of the moment in time in which we find ourselves right now related to not just the Confederate battle flag, but perhaps more importantly: What is the legacy that we want to have as Americans, as Members of Congress, in dealing with the complicated issue of race? It is an honor and a privilege to once again have the chance to come to the House floor to have this conversation. This is a most distinguished venue from which to speak to the American people, an appropriate one, I would add, given the House's constitutional relationship to the people of America, this, of course, being the only institution that was envisioned by the Founding Fathers as one in which the people serving in the institution would be directly elected by the people. The Senate's Members, of course, in its original constitutional version, were elected by the State legislature. Then, of course, the Presidency, to this day, is a vehicle through which the individual is selected by the Electoral College. So this is the people's House, the institution most intimately connected to the people of America and the place where we should be able to speak truth to power. We witnessed that last week as we were forced, unfortunately, to discuss the issue of the Confederate battle flag at a moment when people of all races--Democrats and Republicans, Blacks, Whites, the extraordinary leadership from the Governor of South Carolina, and the distinguished gentleman from South Carolina, Jim Clyburn--came together. At the moment when the Confederate battle flag was coming down in South Carolina, there were Members of this House trying to lift it up. It was quite unfortunate that we needed to detour from this moment that we were having in America, led in South Carolina, to address the battle flag issue on this House floor; but I am hopeful that, as we move forward now in a more productive way, we can begin to confront some of the public policy challenges that we face in America that supporters of the Confederate battle flag have fought against. As others have detailed during the presentation here today, the battle flag, which met its initial defeat in 1865 at the end of the Civil War, remained [[Page H5113]] largely dormant in American history until 1954 in the Supreme Court's decision of Brown vs. Board of Education. It was decided that this facade of separate and equal was constitutionally suspect and that African Americans were being denied the opportunity of being educated in quality public schools in the Deep South and in other places in America. Really, it was in the mid-fifties and then into the early sixties when the Confederate battle flag was resurrected as a symbol of the segregationists who were fighting to uphold Jim Crow. It was a symbol of those who were fighting to stop the efforts of courageous individuals like Congressman John Lewis, who in 1965 was the co-chair of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. It was a symbol of those who were trying to fight efforts by John Lewis and others to make sure that the franchise--the right to vote-- was colorblind in nature and that the 15th Amendment could actually be brought to life all throughout America and in the Deep South, where there were those who were trying to prevent African Americans from being able to vote. The battle flag was resurrected in the fifties and in the sixties to stop certain things from happening. It seems to me that, rather than having the discussion about whether it should come down, no reasonable person can take the position that it should have a place of honor. So it is extraordinary to me that we had to take to the House floor last week and have to come to the House floor today to continue to address this issue. Hopefully, reason will prevail over the next couple of weeks or the next couple of days--even prior to the August recess--and we can move beyond the Confederate battle flag issue and address some important, substantive issues that many would argue remain as part of the legacy of the Confederacy. We don't want to see the ghosts of the Confederacy invading the United States Congress from a policy perspective. Those nine souls--God-fearing, church-going African Americans--who were killed simply because of the color of their skin died because of someone who charged into that church with the intention of sparking a race war that was inspired, in part, by the Confederate battle flag. One of the things that has happened as a result of that tragedy is the battle flag has come down, but that is just the beginning of the work that we need to do in response to that tragedy and the conditions that so many people find themselves in all across America. As has been mentioned, we have got to confront the gun violence issue that we have in the United States. How can it be that we have 5 percent of the world's population, but 50 percent of the world's guns? It is estimated that we have more than 285 million guns in circulation. Nobody can give you an exact estimate because a chokehold has been placed around the Federal agencies charged with preventing gun violence and dealing with gun safety in America. It is an incredible act of legislative malpractice, but it is estimated that we have got over 285 million guns in America. Isn't it reasonable, particularly in the aftermath of this tragedy in Charleston, South Carolina, that we come together and figure out a way to prevent those guns, consistent with the Second Amendment, from falling into the hands of individuals who would do us harm? It seems to me to be a reasonable thing that we can do as Americans. It also seems important that we would find a way 50 years after the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act to stop trying to prevent Americans from exercising their sacred franchise and participating in American democracy. Yet, something happened in the aftermath of 2008, a real interesting moment in November of that year, that seemed to have shocked a whole lot of people across this country. As a result, 2 years later, when there was a midterm election, subsequent to that, there was an outbreak with this concern of voter fraud, fabricated because no one can point to any evidence of an epidemic of voter fraud. Not a scintilla of evidence has been presented anywhere in this country that we have got a problem that needs to be addressed; but we have had all of these voter suppression laws enacted that are consistent with the ghosts of the Confederacy and what those folks stood for who were waving the Confederate battle flag in opposition to the changes of the fifties and sixties. What shocks me is that even the Supreme Court has gotten into the act by decimating the section 5 preclearance through claiming that section 4 is outdated, and this House refuses to act on fixing the Voting Rights Act. I would argue that--again, consistent with our democracy and the spirit of coming together--that, perhaps, that is one of the things we can address so that we can take down, on the one hand, the divisive symbol of hatred--the Confederate battle flag--from here in this Capitol and in whatever form it hangs all across America so that we can lift up policies that make Americans safer, policies that are consistent with our values and that everyone--White, Black, Latino, Asian, Democrats, and Republicans--should be able to rally around. I am thankful for Congresswoman Kelly's and Congressman Payne's leadership--this wonderful tandem, R. Kelly and D. Payne, who are tremendous advocates here in the Congress--and for their giving me this opportunity to share these thoughts. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Congressman Jeffries, for reminding us about the Voting Rights Act. Again, thank you for everything you did last week in this Congress. It was so commendable. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green), who gave a passionate speech on the floor last week about the flag. {time} 2030 Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. I am honored to be with the team of Kelly and Payne tonight. You do outstanding work, and you also provide an opportunity for other Members to have an opportunity to call to the attention of our constituents some of the concerns that we have to address in Congress. I will always be grateful for the wonderful work that you do in Congress. I am also very grateful and thankful to the many persons who worked to bring down the Confederate battle flag in South Carolina. It was not easy. There are many who said they never thought they would see it happen, but it did, and it happened because of a willingness to forgive and an understanding that we had an opportunity to do something meaningful for a good many people across the length and breadth of this country who saw the Confederate battle flag as a symbol of segregation, a symbol of racism and bigotry, a symbol of slavery. Not all did, but it was painful for a good many who did see it this way, many who suffered the indignation and humiliation of segregation, who suffered knowing that their bloodline had suffered slavery. So I am here tonight to thank those who worked so hard to get this done. It was not easy, and I want to thank you for what you did. But I also know that there are a good many people now who would like to see us go back to normal. They are ready to get back to the normal things that we have in this great country of ours, the richest country in the world. For them, normal is a very pleasant thing. Normal means new homes. Normal means greater opportunities. But let's talk about normal for some others in this country because normal is not always the same for everyone. Normal for the month of June 2015 unemployment: normal for Whites was 4.6 percent, that is the unemployment rate. That is normal for Whites. Normal for Latinos was 6.6 percent, and normal for Blacks was 9.5 percent. Now, I have already heard the arguments about how President Obama ought to resolve this; this is all his fault. Not so, my friends. If you look back through the vista of time, you will find that unemployment for African Americans is usually about twice the unemployment rate for White Americans. This is not something new to President Obama. This is not something that started in 2008 when he was elected or when he was sworn in in 2009. This is not something that is new to us, those of us who know and see the pain and suffering that results from a lack of employment. We understand that the flag coming down was a great moment for us symbolically. It was symbolism. Now, the [[Page H5114]] substance is what we ultimately have to deal with, and the substance is the normal life that people lead under conditions that are abnormal for many others in this country. Let's look at normal as it relates to lending for businesses. Minority businessowners in 2012--this is the latest information that I have from the Federal Reserve--paid interest rates that were 32 percent higher than what Whites paid--32 percent higher. That is normal. Some people don't want to go back to this normal state of affairs. They see the flag coming down as an indication that we need to move on in other substantive areas. Lending, mortgage lending is an important area. Normal for African Americans meant that in 2013 only 4.8 percent of loans made to buy homes were made to Blacks, when Blacks comprise 13.2 percent of the total population. Normal for Latinos meant that in 2013 only 7.3 percent of the loans made to buy homes were made to Latinos, Hispanics, when they make up 17.15 percent of the total population. That is normal. Normal in 2013 meant the conventional mortgage loan denial rate was, and this is according to CNN, 10.4 percent for Whites, 13.3 percent for Asians, 21.9 percent for Hispanics, and 27.6 percent for African Americans. There are a good many people who don't live normal lives in this normal climate that we want to get back to--we, in a generic sense. I, not the personal pronoun for me, I don't want to get back to this. I want to see us move on with substantive change. I appreciate what was done in bringing down the flag. I celebrate its coming down, but it is time for us to initiate greater action in areas where we can integrate the money. I am an integrationist. I think we ought to integrate every aspect of American society, including the money. Let's talk about normal. Normal means that Black applicants are 2.1 times more likely to be denied loans by mortgage lenders than non- Hispanic Whites. That is normal. For Hispanics, it means that they are 1.7 times more likely to be denied loans. That is normal. For Asians, 1.2 times more likely. So I am saying to us that we have got to create a new normal. It is time for us, those of us who sit on committees of jurisdiction, to use our influence on these committees of jurisdiction to bring about the substantive change that lowering the flag and placing it in its place of honor, proper place where it should be, lowering that Confederate flag. That means that we must do that, but do it in such a way that we acknowledge that there is more work to be done, and we can do it on our committees of jurisdiction. So, given that I serve on the Committee on Financial Services, I will be calling to the attention of the committee the need to investigate the mortgage lending culture in banks. We need to understand why it is that African Americans and Latinos who are equally as qualified as Whites can go into a bank and not get a loan when a White can. We have got to find out why. I know that there are many people who are uncomfortable with the language of Black and White and Brown, but that is the language we have to use to communicate clearly a message of what is taking place. So on my committee, I am going to push for an investigation of banks. We need to know why banks consistently do this. Not all banks, but we need to know why those who do it are doing it. The way you do this is to test, to send people out who are equally qualified of different ethnicities and acquire the empirical evidence. In every instance--maybe with a few exceptions, but in every instance, in a general sense, we find that Blacks and Browns who are equally as qualified as Whites do not receive their loans. I encourage all of my colleagues to use your committees of jurisdiction to create a new state of normalcy for those who have been suffering continuously. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you so much, Congressman Green, for your words, your passion, and your call to action. I would like to thank all of my colleagues for participating tonight. Symbols of the Confederacy have been an inescapable and often haunting part of life in many Southern States. Every day the Confederate flag is flown proudly in front yards, worn on T-shirts, and you will find them on pickup trucks, and that is the right that folks have. Many argue this is a symbol of Southern history, tradition, and honor. I would argue against the merits of that. After all, what are we proudly honoring and looking upon nostalgically? The Confederate flag represents a dark time in our Nation's history, full of pain, suffering, and loss. Why do we allow the mascot of terrorist groups to fly high on the government grounds? Would we permit ISIS the luxury of putting their symbols on our Federal grounds? In modern society, people have made a decision to eradicate materials that do not represent our country's core values: the value of inclusion, the value of nondiscrimination, and the value that our Nation can be the beacon of hope for everyone regardless of the color of their skin. The institution of slavery destroyed families, killed millions, and formed the beginning of a systemic inequality faced by African Americans today. That is what the Confederacy sought to preserve when it seceded from our great Nation. Every time a Confederate flag flies, whether it is the intent of the owner or not, that is what is being celebrated. Mr. Speaker, we need to take down the flag and we also need to have a serious conversation about gun violence. On behalf of Congressman Payne and me, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus, to discuss tonight's CBC Special Order Hour: ``The Confederate Battle Flag: Why Symbols Matter.'' I stand here today fully acknowledging that the eradication of this hurtful flag from state and federal grounds is only one step in fully addressing race relations in this country; but, just as so many of my CBC colleagues have stood on this very floor to exclaim that ``Black Lives Matter,'' so too do symbols. Symbols of hatred, institutionalized racism and white supremacy, they matter. Symbols like the flags of Apartheid South Africa and Rhodesia, embraced by Dylann Roof, the terrorist responsible for the unspeakable events at Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston last month, Mr. Speaker, they matter. Last week, the South Carolina legislature voted overwhelmingly in favor of removing--once and for all--the confederate battle flag from their Capitol grounds. I applaud the state of South Carolina for this historic gesture and for the outstanding leadership necessary to ensure that this flag comes down in the aftermath of the ``Emmanuel Nine'' tragedy. I implore other southern states that still fly the battle flag on state grounds to follow suit and have the flag removed. As a Member of Congress, I pledge my support to any legislation that completely eradicates this symbol from all federal lands. To understand why the confederate battle flag has been offensive to millions of Americans for so many years requires a proper framing of American History. The version of the confederate battle flag that most people are familiar with today was first used by the Army of Tennessee during the Civil War. Shortly thereafter, it became widely known as the symbol of the Confederacy--eleven states who wished to secede from the Union over the right to own slaves. For the many Americans who deny a basic historical fact by refusing to believe that slavery was a central point of conflict in the Civil War, I quote directly from the declaration of secession from my home state of Texas: ``We hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States, and of the confederacy itself were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable.'' Similarly, overt references to slavery as a motivation to secede from the Union are also present in the declarations of secession of South Carolina, Georgia and Mississippi. Repeatedly, throughout the 20th century, the confederate battle flag flew as a symbol of direct defiance to advancements in civil rights. The flag was first displayed at the South Carolina state Capitol in 1938 after angry Members of Congress defeated a bill that would have made lynching a federal crime. In the 1940s, the flag became the symbol of the Dixiecrats, the segregationist political faction birthed out of its firm stance against the civil rights agenda of the national Democratic party of the time. Members of the Dixiecrats were faithfully devoted to maintaining the segregation of the Jim Crow South, many of [[Page H5115]] whom stood on this very House floor decades ago, extolling the virtues of an American society that subjugated its black citizens. In 1962, the flag was raised to the dome of the South Carolina state Capitol after President Kennedy called on Congress to end poll taxes and literacy tests for voting, and the Supreme Court declared segregation in public transportation unconstitutional. The raising of the confederate battle flag flew as a symbol of resistance in South Carolina to two landmark achievements of progress that our country relied on to move forward in its quest for racial equality. While the confederate battle flag may represent ``Southern Heritage'' to some, to millions of other Americans it represents an opposition to the racial equality we still fight for today. This flag is a symbol of the painful history that this country has worked hard to overcome; and in order to continue moving forward, it is a symbol that we must finally put behind us. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [House] [Pages H5109-H5115] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Illinois? There was no objection. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, we are here tonight to have an important conversation, a conversation that is long overdue, a conversation that is crucial to healing America's deep racial wounds, our topic being the Confederate battle flag and why racial symbols matter. The Charleston 9 killings focused many of our attention on the significant appropriateness and bigoted history of this flag. In 2015, why do so many still revere a flag that tolerated the shackling of people because of their skin, a flag that allowed human beings to be counted as three-fifths of a person, a flag that was flown during lynchings, the holding of children, and one that symbolized a movement to deny education and equal treatment under our laws? Fifty years since Selma, we think of the Freedom Riders, marchers, boycotters, protesters, and policymakers who pointed our Nation in a more positive direction. They knew it was time to reject the traditions of the past. The civil rights movement symbolized the quest of equality and a change in mood for America. Thousands from all backgrounds had the courage to join in peaceful protests, lunch counter sit-ins, and boycotts at the expense of being jailed, beaten, or killed. They did this for one Nation and one flag. And in the way of these Americans stood those who believed in the perseverance of inequality, who believed in an America of White and colored, an America of two flags, and the Confederate battle flag represented their America. Jim Crow America saw States that seceded from the Union, reacting to the growth of the civil rights movement, with the use of the Confederate battle flag as the representation of their resistant movement. In 1956, the State of Georgia incorporated the battle flag into its official State flag design. The movement continued into the sixties, where it met renewed and intensified opposition, opposition that waved the Confederate battle flag in the name of continued racial oppression. In 1961, just 2 months after the sentencing of nine students arrested for a lunch counter sit-in in Rock Hill, South Carolina, the Confederate battle flag was raised over South Carolina's State house during a centennial celebration of the Civil War's opening. That same year, in neighboring Georgia, Charlayne Hunter and Hamilton Holmes were the first two African American students to be admitted to the University of Georgia. Their admission only came after a court order sent from Federal court. Eleven days after arriving on campus, Hunter and Holmes were attacked by a mob of White rioters who threw rocks and bottles at them while waving the rebel flag. The attacks were so fierce that the dean of students suspended both Hunter and Holmes for their own safety. Now, even with me highlighting this violence, we are told that the stars and bars are about heritage. That heritage, Mr. Speaker, is not so subtle a reminder to African Americans that they are less than-- maybe not three-fifths of a person, but still not equal. This is a reminder that there are two classes of citizens. And despite our Declaration of Independence clearly stating that all men are created equal, this is a reminder that there is a lesser class and will never be equal. But why are we honoring the heritage and flag of the hooded night riders of the Klan at our State houses and in this Congress instead of the flag of the Freedom Riders who died for a single, fair, and equal America? Two years after Martin Luther King, Jr., delivered his ``I have dream'' speech before 600 civil rights marchers, including our friend and colleague from Georgia, Congressman John Lewis, a different group of civil rights heroes were greeted by police officers in Selma, Alabama, proudly displaying the Confederate flag on the side of their helmets. These officers brutally beat the marchers, and their actions were a reminder that Dr. King's speech had not yet resonated in the hearts of those who needed to hear it most. But it was the undeterred resilience of the protesters who refused to back down and refused to resort to violence that persevered. It was the love, the respect, and the mutual understanding that displayed what was the strongest symbol of strength, honor, and heritage than the Confederate battle flag. Mr. Speaker, we have come a long way since 1965, but we still have a ways to go. We must move forward. The needed progress, however, will not come if the Federal Government continues to provide American citizens with reminders of our hateful and oppressive past in a manner that legitimizes such hate. I am glad to host this important Special Order hour with my colleague from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) to talk about where we go from here and why we continue to give energy to symbols of hate and division. I yield to the kind gentleman from Newark, New Jersey (Mr. Payne). Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois. This is a very timely topic, as we have seen what has transpired in our Nation over the past several weeks. It is incredible to me how fast this issue has moved over the past month. But it always seems that it takes a horrific act in this country for us to wake up and realize that maybe something isn't right. {time} 1930 Nine people at church study on a Wednesday night, not knowing their fate, were gunned down in cold blood by someone who actually said: You know, they were so nice to me, I almost didn't do it, but I had to. Last week in South Carolina, there was a monumental step in removing the Confederate flag from its State capitol, where it had shamefully flown for 54 years; but here in our Nation's Capitol last week, Republicans tried to go back to the future. House Republicans had to pull a vote on a spending bill because some of their Members opposed a measure that would ban Confederate flags from national cemeteries, and when the Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, presented an opportunity for Republicans to do the right thing and immediately remove the Confederate flag from the Capitol Grounds, they punted. South Carolina, the birthplace of the Confederacy, had the courage to do what the House Republicans did not, remove that dreaded symbol. It is the symbol of an incomprehensible hate, a hate that manifested itself in a massacre. Since that unfortunate day 1 month ago, we, as a nation, have been forced to look inward at who we are and who we want to be. Mr. Speaker, out of this immense grief of that dark day in Charleston came a resounding call throughout our Nation to remove the Confederate flag and other symbols of racism and racial supremacy. For many, the removal of these symbols is a logical step in the trajectory of our Nation, a necessary action on the path toward the more perfect Union. For others, calls to remove these symbols of hate are seen as an attack [[Page H5110]] on the Southern identity, heritage, and culture; but arguing that the Confederate flag is a symbol of Southern pride celebrates a single homogenous culture. It means listening to only some voices at the expense of others. It means ignoring the African American experience throughout our Nation's history from the dark period of slavery to the civil rights movement to the present day. According to a report by the Equal Justice Initiative, 3,959 African Americans in 12 States were killed by the terror of lynching between 1877 and 1950, 3,959 Americans lynched. If we are going to refer to the past and debate over the Confederate flag, certainly, we need to take all of this into account. The Confederate flag has always stood for racial supremacy and bigotry, and if we are to realize our Nation's promise of justice and full equality, we cannot embrace this symbol. Eradicating symbols of hatred, violence, and cruel oppression steeped in racism is a critical step to confronting prejudice in our society. Now, Mr. Speaker, we have all heard complaints that this debate does not matter and that removing the Confederate flag and other symbols of hatred is a distraction from the larger problems facing our Nation, such as rampant gun violence. I agree that significantly more must be done to address racism and persistent inequality in our Nation. I agree that we need meaningful gun reform from expanding background checks to reducing unchecked online ammunition purchases. I agree that we need to create jobs, reduce wealth disparities, and expand educational opportunities. But symbols matter; symbols legitimize public opinion and, in doing so, entrench attitudes and beliefs. At the same time, they create a meaning, shape actions, and connect us to one another. Just as a symbol can connect us, they can tear us apart. Mr. Speaker, as I go to my seat, I was talking to my staff the other day about this and how much we were happy to see that flag lowered. The symbol is gone, but the sentiment remains. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Congressman Payne, for those words. Right now, it is my pleasure to introduce the Congressman from North Carolina and the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressman Butterfield. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, let me first thank you, Congresswoman Kelly and Congressman Payne, for your leadership. Your leadership is very much appreciated, and your constituents in your respective districts should be very proud of each one of you. I know the Congressional Black Caucus is proud of you. For the past several weeks, Mr. Speaker, the Nation has been focused on the Confederate battle flag. Most fair-minded Americans have been asking the question: Why is this flag continuing to fly on State grounds and Federal lands? And why are policymakers refusing to squarely address this issue? The Confederate battle flag, Mr. Speaker, represents an era of American history that ended--or at least it should have ended--150 years ago. This flag represents the years following President Lincoln's election. Those years starting in December of 1860 saw 11 Southern States leave the Union. The fancy name for their leaving the Union, Mr. Speaker, was called secession, but the reality was that these Southern States were rebelling. They were in rebellion against the Union. They organized a so-called government called the Confederate States of America. They took up arms, Mr. Speaker, and they fought against the Union for 4 long years until they surrendered. They then returned to the Union. The Confederate flag represents that era where Southern States were resisting freedom for 4 million slaves. There continues to be elements today in our society who subscribe to separation of the races--how unfortunate. There continues to be elements in our society who believe in White supremacy. The question now, Mr. Speaker, is: Do we constructively address the question of hate groups in America? Do we continue to insist that other States remove symbols of White supremacy as South Carolina has done? Or do we continue to simply ignore racism? Other States continue to display Confederate flags, and even in this Capitol--even in this Capitol--you will find eight statues of Confederate soldiers who fought against the Stars and Stripes. Mr. Speaker, I call upon every American to bury for good the dark history of slavery and bigotry. We are a great nation, and we will be even greater when we can judge our neighbor on the content of their character and not on the color of their skin. Let's remove these symbols from our view. I thank each one of the floor managers. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Congressman Butterfield, for those fine words. Many questions, many questions: Why are they still holding on? Is it just heritage and tradition? Or is it something more? At this time, Mr. Speaker, I would like to introduce the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, the gentlewoman from Illinois, and my friend, the gentleman from New Jersey, for their important leadership they are exercising here this evening. Mr. Speaker, I have come to speak about why symbols matter and why this symbol, the Confederate flag, must not stop with the flag, but must also go to what to do not only about the flag, but about the guns that took down the Charleston 9. To be sure, symbols matter, Mr. Speaker. To take two of the most powerful symbols in the world, the cross and the Star of David, we know well these symbols can sometimes mean everything. We also know that the Confederate flag is a symbol of a different and lower order. A symbol stands for more than itself; the symbol tells a story. The religious symbols evoke tears; they evoke joy, and they evoke their own set of stories. The Confederate flag, when it led to the extraordinary tragedy of the Charleston 9 will always--should always--make us think of the gun that was responsible for the Charleston 9--not just the symbol, but the story behind the symbol. In the 19th century, the flag signaled the importance of slavery. In the 20th century, it had a different meaning. Robert E. Lee had told his soldiers: Put down the flag. We are one Union now. He was, in a real sense, the counterpart to Abraham Lincoln, who was trying to draw us together after Lee had lost that war. In the 20th century, the flag was revived. It was revived by Southern Democrats--Dixiecrats, as they called themselves. It has been, in the 20th century and, now, the 21st century, a symbol of discrimination and racism. No matter what it stood for in the 19th century about heritage, it lost that meaning when, in the 20th century, George Wallace raised it and said ``segregation now'' and ``segregation forever.'' Nobody who now speaks of heritage then said: Wait a minute, Governor Wallace, don't take away our heritage. Only when African Americans have the nerve to raise the notion, after we lost nine good people in Charleston, does it somehow now become a symbol of heritage. I will give Senator Mitch McConnell some credit. He wants to remove the statue of Jefferson Davis from the Kentucky State Capitol, but when asked about removing the Jefferson Davis statue from the United States Capitol, Mr. McConnell grew silent. We have got to come to grips with what this flag meant to this boy who used a gun. I am not going to forget those who died and what we owe those who died. The Dixiecrats bolted from Harry S. Truman when Truman refused to embrace their racism. These were Southern Democrats, and we owe them the 21st century meaning of the Confederate flag. Mr. Speaker, why are we talking about this symbol and not another symbol? The other symbol is the gun in America. The grace of the people of Charleston so overwhelmed the country that there were many who were simply grateful that, instead of bursting forward with rage, they showed their extraordinary Christian heritage, the heritage they undoubtedly shared with the gunman. We were so grateful, all of us, and so proud that we have not talked about [[Page H5111]] what took the lives of these nine good people. Well, I want to talk about it because the Confederate flag for me now will always represent those nine people and the gun that took their lives. That 21-year-old kid didn't know anything about them except their Christian love when they invited him into their sanctuary. But, he knew about what that flag stood for, and he raised that flag before he went into that sanctuary. {time} 2000 We must not forget not only the flag--we cannot live by symbols alone--we must not forget the gun that took down the Charleston 9. Now, I understand--I read--that Senator Manchin and Senator Toomey are interested in reviving their gun safety legislation. There are several bills here in the House that do that in one form or another. We know what happened. There was a breakdown in the background check system, which is why this young man was even able to get a gun. He would have been denied a gun if those who opposed any bill hadn't assured that the bill would have only a 3-day time period, during which, if you couldn't find something on the individual, then he got his gun, no matter who he was. That is how he got his gun. There are some of us who know full well that the Confederate flag has done more than put the flag back on the agenda--on the Nation's agenda--it has put gun safety once again on the agenda. I must say, I don't believe we, who celebrate the extraordinary grace of the families of the Charleston 9, owe them only our speeches about the flag. They probably, once they saw it come down, have moved on; and now, they have only their loved ones to think about. If I were one of them, I would wonder: What are those who celebrate the flag coming down going to do about making sure that, never again, will people like our loved ones have to suffer because of gunfire? The flag is the symbol that is important to raising our consciousness in the long run. If all we have is our memory of the symbol and not why that symbol became important, then we will leave on the table a real memorial to the Charleston 9. I appreciate the time. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Congresswoman Holmes. I am so glad that you and Congressman Payne brought up the issue of the gun because we cannot forget that either. I look at Charleston as when racism and hate found the gun. At this time, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Fudge), our former head of the Congressional Black Caucus. Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I want to thank my colleagues, Congressman Payne and Congresswoman Kelly, for leading the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour tonight. Mr. Speaker, if you have not noticed, the people of this country are fed up. Quite frankly, so am I. We are at a point in our Nation's history when we can no longer give lip service to equality and opportunities to succeed. We must take action to show we mean what we say; otherwise, it is nothing more than empty rhetoric. Mr. Speaker, the Confederate flag is more than just a piece of fabric. It is more than just a visual representation of the Confederacy or part of the storied history of the South. If that were true, we would not be having this conversation today. We would not have buried nine Americans murdered because of the color of their skin, and the Confederate battle flag would still be flying in the State of South Carolina. Let's be honest about the history of the Confederate battle flag. While the majority of this House may want to ignore the facts and rewrite history, we will not be ignored. The Confederate battle flag and any adaptation of it is a painful reminder of intimidation, torture, and murder for all of us in the Black community. It is a flying symbol of hatred and injustice that tells Black and Brown people in this country: Your lives have no value, and you don't matter. It is an embarrassment to all Americans that the majority of this House introduced a spending amendment which included language allowing the battle flag on Federal properties. It is just plain shameful that they would go even further and use procedure to stifle a motion to openly discuss a ban of the Confederate battle flag imagery from the Capitol Grounds. How can the Members of the majority of this House continue to say that they represent all Americans when they refuse to have a real discussion about what is really happening in our country? Have we learned nothing from what has happened in the past few weeks? In a June Gallup poll, African Americans ranked race relations as the most important issue facing the United States. Will taking down the Confederate battle flag immediately change this perspective? Absolutely not--but it will certainly do more than letting it continue to fly. Mr. Speaker, it is time we do away with lip service. It is time we listen to our constituents and take real action toward healing the racial wounds of this country. It is time we move forward. The flag must come down. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Fudge for her eloquent words and the truth of what happened in Congress last week and what we need to do to go forward. At this time, I yield to the gentlewoman from Houston, Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the managers of this very Special Order and my words to them and to this House. I want you to take note of the spirit in which these Members have come. If our constituents are seeing us and watching us, if those who agree with us are watching, no one has come with anger and a cry of hysteria. They have come with a reasoned request and pronouncement of the wrongness of the present situation in this House. Let me say that it was in 1864 that the States were given the call to send forward two statutes to come to represent their States in the United States Congress. In addition, we know that the United States Congress has a number of flags representing various States. This was to be the people's House, and the people's House would reflect the people of the United States of America. History should be something that grows with the Nation and reflects the goodness of the Nation. Yes, there is history that should be taught, such as the ugliness and violence of the slave history; but it is not to be honored. I join my colleagues today to be able to call for the taking down of signs of Confederacy in the United States Capitol--in particular, as I am in the House of Representatives, in the people's House. Let me give you a credible basis upon which to do so, why this Supreme Court decision has been so ignored. Let me cite it for my colleagues, Walker III v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, issued on June 18, 2015--ironically, the day after the martyrdom of nine wonderful African Americans practicing their Christian faith. This particular decision indicates that the State of Texas was to be supported. This was a case that engaged many of our constituents in Texas. We organize and galvanize. I want to thank Dr. Clark, the president of the Missionary Baptist General Convention of Texas, and Reverend Max Miller, who came up as we argued this case. We were convincing. The Texas Department of Motor Vehicles board agreed that a Confederate license plate issued by the State of Texas would be offensive and would be considered, in essence, a public action or public speech. For those who want to raise the question of the First Amendment, this cry that we, as members of the Congressional Black Caucus, are making is perfectly constitutional and legitimate. We are talking about flags that are flown on State property or Federal property. This caucus should be congratulated. It is succinct in its argument; it is detailed in its argument, and no First Amendment opposition can be raised because the Supreme Court of the United States has said that we can deny utilizing the Confederate flag that may be considered State action as it is placed on Federal lands on the Federal property here. [[Page H5112]] Our colleagues, in particular Hakeem Jeffries and Mr. Huffman and others, understood that when they acted last week. Now, the considerate thing to have done is there are amendments to stay in place, the Interior bill to be voted on, and the right thing would have been done because they argued the point that this was State or Federal action. We now come again to try and clarify for our colleagues that these flags should come down. In the privileged resolutions that have gone on last week, they made the point very clear that it was an insult to the dignity of the House. I have introduced H. Res. 342 that I hope will complement, and it is one that talks about the enhancement of unity in America and stands on the Walker decision and, in particular, makes it very clear that divisive symbols--license plates, specialty license plates, replicas, and flags--on public buildings or government property and symbols on State or Federal action, State public speech--that is a speech of those you represent--should not be allowed. How divisive is that point of view? It is not. The divisiveness is those that stand on a false sense of history, yet want to offend those who likewise have great leadership. Let me make this point about the battle flag, this Confederate flag. Might I ask the question: Have southerners not fought in the War of 1812, in World War I, in World War II, in the Korean war, in the Hungarian war in the fifties, and in Vietnam and shed their blood under this flag, have they not been honored when they have shed their blood? Not only that, when Confederate soldiers died, they were honored appropriately in graves where those who desired to honor that shedding of the blood were allowed to do so. We did not run into the funerals of those Southern fallen soldiers and cast upon them and curse them and deny them. They were allowed to be honored appropriately, and they now go into the annals of history. When you understand what grounds they stood on, what their general stood on, such as Jefferson Davis, who called the individuals who were slaves as unprofitable savages--that is what one general who has been honored has called them, ``unprofitable savages''--is that the history that we should be honoring? Is that what we should be lifting up? Is that what should be placed in the place of honor in the United States Congress? Is that engaged in the uplifting of the dignity of the House? Or is it insulting the dignity of the House? To my colleagues, I stand with you today to join in trying to create an understanding of the rightness of the work of our colleagues last week on the Interior bill, of the rightness of the Congressional Black Caucus going, as someone would say, on and on and on about this flag; and my good friend from New Jersey said it is symbols, and we need to bridge the gap of the inequity and wealth, we need education, we need jobs. Let me be very clear, Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Black Caucus and my colleagues and the Democratic Caucus and good will Republicans are fighting for jobs--or should be--fighting for education. We are not languishing along the side highway of life. We fought to maintain the ObamaCare or the Affordable Care Act. We are not ignoring the other desires of our constituents. Let me close on this final point, and I am glad that my colleague from the District of Columbia raised it, and Congresswoman Kelly has been a leader, and Congresswoman Kelly, let's rise again, and that is the horror of gun violence. {time} 2015 Let me say to Director Comey, since I am on the Judiciary Committee, thank you for your honesty, but let me make it very clear that we suffered this loophole because of the opposition to the sensibleness of the Brady anti-gun violence legislation. Imbedded in it was this nonsensical point that, if I don't hear from you, then I am going to sell it. Who is selling it? The gun store. I have no opposition to our fellow citizens who make their living and provide for their families by selling guns. I do have opposition to the evil and vile perpetrator who went into that Mother Emanuel Church and killed illegally with a gun that he should not have had. He did so because the 3-day time had expired, because there was a time when the NICS was closed--that is the entity that the FBI relies upon--and the 3 days expired, and the owner said, ``I am going to sell the gun.'' This week I will be introducing a single piece of legislation--and I ask my colleagues to join me--I know there are many other bills--to eliminate the 3-day period of discretion, that no discretion will exist. They either answer the question that he or she is eligible or it is denied. So on the graves of these wonderful martyrs, I stand in honor of them. I mourn them, and I mourn for their families. I say to them: We will never forget. Once and for all, bring the flag down and remove these items in this place of honor that have denigrated and considered one race of people vile and unequal. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Congresswoman Jackson Lee. Always detailed and insightful. Thank you for all of your work on the Judiciary Committee. It is very much appreciated and hailed. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries), who took center stage last week as we discussed and worked toward the removal of the flag. Mr. JEFFRIES. I want to thank my good friend, the distinguished gentlewoman from Illinois, Robin Kelly, for once again presiding over this important CBC Special Order hour, as well as her co-anchor, the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey, who is right across the Hudson River, and who so ably serves the communities of Newark and beyond. Mr. Speaker, this evening we have heard from so many distinguished members of the Congressional Black Caucus, most recently from the gentlewoman from Texas, with whom I serve on the Judiciary Committee, about the importance of the moment in time in which we find ourselves right now related to not just the Confederate battle flag, but perhaps more importantly: What is the legacy that we want to have as Americans, as Members of Congress, in dealing with the complicated issue of race? It is an honor and a privilege to once again have the chance to come to the House floor to have this conversation. This is a most distinguished venue from which to speak to the American people, an appropriate one, I would add, given the House's constitutional relationship to the people of America, this, of course, being the only institution that was envisioned by the Founding Fathers as one in which the people serving in the institution would be directly elected by the people. The Senate's Members, of course, in its original constitutional version, were elected by the State legislature. Then, of course, the Presidency, to this day, is a vehicle through which the individual is selected by the Electoral College. So this is the people's House, the institution most intimately connected to the people of America and the place where we should be able to speak truth to power. We witnessed that last week as we were forced, unfortunately, to discuss the issue of the Confederate battle flag at a moment when people of all races--Democrats and Republicans, Blacks, Whites, the extraordinary leadership from the Governor of South Carolina, and the distinguished gentleman from South Carolina, Jim Clyburn--came together. At the moment when the Confederate battle flag was coming down in South Carolina, there were Members of this House trying to lift it up. It was quite unfortunate that we needed to detour from this moment that we were having in America, led in South Carolina, to address the battle flag issue on this House floor; but I am hopeful that, as we move forward now in a more productive way, we can begin to confront some of the public policy challenges that we face in America that supporters of the Confederate battle flag have fought against. As others have detailed during the presentation here today, the battle flag, which met its initial defeat in 1865 at the end of the Civil War, remained [[Page H5113]] largely dormant in American history until 1954 in the Supreme Court's decision of Brown vs. Board of Education. It was decided that this facade of separate and equal was constitutionally suspect and that African Americans were being denied the opportunity of being educated in quality public schools in the Deep South and in other places in America. Really, it was in the mid-fifties and then into the early sixties when the Confederate battle flag was resurrected as a symbol of the segregationists who were fighting to uphold Jim Crow. It was a symbol of those who were fighting to stop the efforts of courageous individuals like Congressman John Lewis, who in 1965 was the co-chair of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. It was a symbol of those who were trying to fight efforts by John Lewis and others to make sure that the franchise--the right to vote-- was colorblind in nature and that the 15th Amendment could actually be brought to life all throughout America and in the Deep South, where there were those who were trying to prevent African Americans from being able to vote. The battle flag was resurrected in the fifties and in the sixties to stop certain things from happening. It seems to me that, rather than having the discussion about whether it should come down, no reasonable person can take the position that it should have a place of honor. So it is extraordinary to me that we had to take to the House floor last week and have to come to the House floor today to continue to address this issue. Hopefully, reason will prevail over the next couple of weeks or the next couple of days--even prior to the August recess--and we can move beyond the Confederate battle flag issue and address some important, substantive issues that many would argue remain as part of the legacy of the Confederacy. We don't want to see the ghosts of the Confederacy invading the United States Congress from a policy perspective. Those nine souls--God-fearing, church-going African Americans--who were killed simply because of the color of their skin died because of someone who charged into that church with the intention of sparking a race war that was inspired, in part, by the Confederate battle flag. One of the things that has happened as a result of that tragedy is the battle flag has come down, but that is just the beginning of the work that we need to do in response to that tragedy and the conditions that so many people find themselves in all across America. As has been mentioned, we have got to confront the gun violence issue that we have in the United States. How can it be that we have 5 percent of the world's population, but 50 percent of the world's guns? It is estimated that we have more than 285 million guns in circulation. Nobody can give you an exact estimate because a chokehold has been placed around the Federal agencies charged with preventing gun violence and dealing with gun safety in America. It is an incredible act of legislative malpractice, but it is estimated that we have got over 285 million guns in America. Isn't it reasonable, particularly in the aftermath of this tragedy in Charleston, South Carolina, that we come together and figure out a way to prevent those guns, consistent with the Second Amendment, from falling into the hands of individuals who would do us harm? It seems to me to be a reasonable thing that we can do as Americans. It also seems important that we would find a way 50 years after the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act to stop trying to prevent Americans from exercising their sacred franchise and participating in American democracy. Yet, something happened in the aftermath of 2008, a real interesting moment in November of that year, that seemed to have shocked a whole lot of people across this country. As a result, 2 years later, when there was a midterm election, subsequent to that, there was an outbreak with this concern of voter fraud, fabricated because no one can point to any evidence of an epidemic of voter fraud. Not a scintilla of evidence has been presented anywhere in this country that we have got a problem that needs to be addressed; but we have had all of these voter suppression laws enacted that are consistent with the ghosts of the Confederacy and what those folks stood for who were waving the Confederate battle flag in opposition to the changes of the fifties and sixties. What shocks me is that even the Supreme Court has gotten into the act by decimating the section 5 preclearance through claiming that section 4 is outdated, and this House refuses to act on fixing the Voting Rights Act. I would argue that--again, consistent with our democracy and the spirit of coming together--that, perhaps, that is one of the things we can address so that we can take down, on the one hand, the divisive symbol of hatred--the Confederate battle flag--from here in this Capitol and in whatever form it hangs all across America so that we can lift up policies that make Americans safer, policies that are consistent with our values and that everyone--White, Black, Latino, Asian, Democrats, and Republicans--should be able to rally around. I am thankful for Congresswoman Kelly's and Congressman Payne's leadership--this wonderful tandem, R. Kelly and D. Payne, who are tremendous advocates here in the Congress--and for their giving me this opportunity to share these thoughts. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Congressman Jeffries, for reminding us about the Voting Rights Act. Again, thank you for everything you did last week in this Congress. It was so commendable. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green), who gave a passionate speech on the floor last week about the flag. {time} 2030 Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. I am honored to be with the team of Kelly and Payne tonight. You do outstanding work, and you also provide an opportunity for other Members to have an opportunity to call to the attention of our constituents some of the concerns that we have to address in Congress. I will always be grateful for the wonderful work that you do in Congress. I am also very grateful and thankful to the many persons who worked to bring down the Confederate battle flag in South Carolina. It was not easy. There are many who said they never thought they would see it happen, but it did, and it happened because of a willingness to forgive and an understanding that we had an opportunity to do something meaningful for a good many people across the length and breadth of this country who saw the Confederate battle flag as a symbol of segregation, a symbol of racism and bigotry, a symbol of slavery. Not all did, but it was painful for a good many who did see it this way, many who suffered the indignation and humiliation of segregation, who suffered knowing that their bloodline had suffered slavery. So I am here tonight to thank those who worked so hard to get this done. It was not easy, and I want to thank you for what you did. But I also know that there are a good many people now who would like to see us go back to normal. They are ready to get back to the normal things that we have in this great country of ours, the richest country in the world. For them, normal is a very pleasant thing. Normal means new homes. Normal means greater opportunities. But let's talk about normal for some others in this country because normal is not always the same for everyone. Normal for the month of June 2015 unemployment: normal for Whites was 4.6 percent, that is the unemployment rate. That is normal for Whites. Normal for Latinos was 6.6 percent, and normal for Blacks was 9.5 percent. Now, I have already heard the arguments about how President Obama ought to resolve this; this is all his fault. Not so, my friends. If you look back through the vista of time, you will find that unemployment for African Americans is usually about twice the unemployment rate for White Americans. This is not something new to President Obama. This is not something that started in 2008 when he was elected or when he was sworn in in 2009. This is not something that is new to us, those of us who know and see the pain and suffering that results from a lack of employment. We understand that the flag coming down was a great moment for us symbolically. It was symbolism. Now, the [[Page H5114]] substance is what we ultimately have to deal with, and the substance is the normal life that people lead under conditions that are abnormal for many others in this country. Let's look at normal as it relates to lending for businesses. Minority businessowners in 2012--this is the latest information that I have from the Federal Reserve--paid interest rates that were 32 percent higher than what Whites paid--32 percent higher. That is normal. Some people don't want to go back to this normal state of affairs. They see the flag coming down as an indication that we need to move on in other substantive areas. Lending, mortgage lending is an important area. Normal for African Americans meant that in 2013 only 4.8 percent of loans made to buy homes were made to Blacks, when Blacks comprise 13.2 percent of the total population. Normal for Latinos meant that in 2013 only 7.3 percent of the loans made to buy homes were made to Latinos, Hispanics, when they make up 17.15 percent of the total population. That is normal. Normal in 2013 meant the conventional mortgage loan denial rate was, and this is according to CNN, 10.4 percent for Whites, 13.3 percent for Asians, 21.9 percent for Hispanics, and 27.6 percent for African Americans. There are a good many people who don't live normal lives in this normal climate that we want to get back to--we, in a generic sense. I, not the personal pronoun for me, I don't want to get back to this. I want to see us move on with substantive change. I appreciate what was done in bringing down the flag. I celebrate its coming down, but it is time for us to initiate greater action in areas where we can integrate the money. I am an integrationist. I think we ought to integrate every aspect of American society, including the money. Let's talk about normal. Normal means that Black applicants are 2.1 times more likely to be denied loans by mortgage lenders than non- Hispanic Whites. That is normal. For Hispanics, it means that they are 1.7 times more likely to be denied loans. That is normal. For Asians, 1.2 times more likely. So I am saying to us that we have got to create a new normal. It is time for us, those of us who sit on committees of jurisdiction, to use our influence on these committees of jurisdiction to bring about the substantive change that lowering the flag and placing it in its place of honor, proper place where it should be, lowering that Confederate flag. That means that we must do that, but do it in such a way that we acknowledge that there is more work to be done, and we can do it on our committees of jurisdiction. So, given that I serve on the Committee on Financial Services, I will be calling to the attention of the committee the need to investigate the mortgage lending culture in banks. We need to understand why it is that African Americans and Latinos who are equally as qualified as Whites can go into a bank and not get a loan when a White can. We have got to find out why. I know that there are many people who are uncomfortable with the language of Black and White and Brown, but that is the language we have to use to communicate clearly a message of what is taking place. So on my committee, I am going to push for an investigation of banks. We need to know why banks consistently do this. Not all banks, but we need to know why those who do it are doing it. The way you do this is to test, to send people out who are equally qualified of different ethnicities and acquire the empirical evidence. In every instance--maybe with a few exceptions, but in every instance, in a general sense, we find that Blacks and Browns who are equally as qualified as Whites do not receive their loans. I encourage all of my colleagues to use your committees of jurisdiction to create a new state of normalcy for those who have been suffering continuously. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you so much, Congressman Green, for your words, your passion, and your call to action. I would like to thank all of my colleagues for participating tonight. Symbols of the Confederacy have been an inescapable and often haunting part of life in many Southern States. Every day the Confederate flag is flown proudly in front yards, worn on T-shirts, and you will find them on pickup trucks, and that is the right that folks have. Many argue this is a symbol of Southern history, tradition, and honor. I would argue against the merits of that. After all, what are we proudly honoring and looking upon nostalgically? The Confederate flag represents a dark time in our Nation's history, full of pain, suffering, and loss. Why do we allow the mascot of terrorist groups to fly high on the government grounds? Would we permit ISIS the luxury of putting their symbols on our Federal grounds? In modern society, people have made a decision to eradicate materials that do not represent our country's core values: the value of inclusion, the value of nondiscrimination, and the value that our Nation can be the beacon of hope for everyone regardless of the color of their skin. The institution of slavery destroyed families, killed millions, and formed the beginning of a systemic inequality faced by African Americans today. That is what the Confederacy sought to preserve when it seceded from our great Nation. Every time a Confederate flag flies, whether it is the intent of the owner or not, that is what is being celebrated. Mr. Speaker, we need to take down the flag and we also need to have a serious conversation about gun violence. On behalf of Congressman Payne and me, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus, to discuss tonight's CBC Special Order Hour: ``The Confederate Battle Flag: Why Symbols Matter.'' I stand here today fully acknowledging that the eradication of this hurtful flag from state and federal grounds is only one step in fully addressing race relations in this country; but, just as so many of my CBC colleagues have stood on this very floor to exclaim that ``Black Lives Matter,'' so too do symbols. Symbols of hatred, institutionalized racism and white supremacy, they matter. Symbols like the flags of Apartheid South Africa and Rhodesia, embraced by Dylann Roof, the terrorist responsible for the unspeakable events at Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston last month, Mr. Speaker, they matter. Last week, the South Carolina legislature voted overwhelmingly in favor of removing--once and for all--the confederate battle flag from their Capitol grounds. I applaud the state of South Carolina for this historic gesture and for the outstanding leadership necessary to ensure that this flag comes down in the aftermath of the ``Emmanuel Nine'' tragedy. I implore other southern states that still fly the battle flag on state grounds to follow suit and have the flag removed. As a Member of Congress, I pledge my support to any legislation that completely eradicates this symbol from all federal lands. To understand why the confederate battle flag has been offensive to millions of Americans for so many years requires a proper framing of American History. The version of the confederate battle flag that most people are familiar with today was first used by the Army of Tennessee during the Civil War. Shortly thereafter, it became widely known as the symbol of the Confederacy--eleven states who wished to secede from the Union over the right to own slaves. For the many Americans who deny a basic historical fact by refusing to believe that slavery was a central point of conflict in the Civil War, I quote directly from the declaration of secession from my home state of Texas: ``We hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States, and of the confederacy itself were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable.'' Similarly, overt references to slavery as a motivation to secede from the Union are also present in the declarations of secession of South Carolina, Georgia and Mississippi. Repeatedly, throughout the 20th century, the confederate battle flag flew as a symbol of direct defiance to advancements in civil rights. The flag was first displayed at the South Carolina state Capitol in 1938 after angry Members of Congress defeated a bill that would have made lynching a federal crime. In the 1940s, the flag became the symbol of the Dixiecrats, the segregationist political faction birthed out of its firm stance against the civil rights agenda of the national Democratic party of the time. Members of the Dixiecrats were faithfully devoted to maintaining the segregation of the Jim Crow South, many of [[Page H5115]] whom stood on this very House floor decades ago, extolling the virtues of an American society that subjugated its black citizens. In 1962, the flag was raised to the dome of the South Carolina state Capitol after President Kennedy called on Congress to end poll taxes and literacy tests for voting, and the Supreme Court declared segregation in public transportation unconstitutional. The raising of the confederate battle flag flew as a symbol of resistance in South Carolina to two landmark achievements of progress that our country relied on to move forward in its quest for racial equality. While the confederate battle flag may represent ``Southern Heritage'' to some, to millions of other Americans it represents an opposition to the racial equality we still fight for today. This flag is a symbol of the painful history that this country has worked hard to overcome; and in order to continue moving forward, it is a symbol that we must finally put behind us. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [House] [Pages H5109-H5115] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be given 5 days to revise and extend their remarks. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Illinois? There was no objection. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, we are here tonight to have an important conversation, a conversation that is long overdue, a conversation that is crucial to healing America's deep racial wounds, our topic being the Confederate battle flag and why racial symbols matter. The Charleston 9 killings focused many of our attention on the significant appropriateness and bigoted history of this flag. In 2015, why do so many still revere a flag that tolerated the shackling of people because of their skin, a flag that allowed human beings to be counted as three-fifths of a person, a flag that was flown during lynchings, the holding of children, and one that symbolized a movement to deny education and equal treatment under our laws? Fifty years since Selma, we think of the Freedom Riders, marchers, boycotters, protesters, and policymakers who pointed our Nation in a more positive direction. They knew it was time to reject the traditions of the past. The civil rights movement symbolized the quest of equality and a change in mood for America. Thousands from all backgrounds had the courage to join in peaceful protests, lunch counter sit-ins, and boycotts at the expense of being jailed, beaten, or killed. They did this for one Nation and one flag. And in the way of these Americans stood those who believed in the perseverance of inequality, who believed in an America of White and colored, an America of two flags, and the Confederate battle flag represented their America. Jim Crow America saw States that seceded from the Union, reacting to the growth of the civil rights movement, with the use of the Confederate battle flag as the representation of their resistant movement. In 1956, the State of Georgia incorporated the battle flag into its official State flag design. The movement continued into the sixties, where it met renewed and intensified opposition, opposition that waved the Confederate battle flag in the name of continued racial oppression. In 1961, just 2 months after the sentencing of nine students arrested for a lunch counter sit-in in Rock Hill, South Carolina, the Confederate battle flag was raised over South Carolina's State house during a centennial celebration of the Civil War's opening. That same year, in neighboring Georgia, Charlayne Hunter and Hamilton Holmes were the first two African American students to be admitted to the University of Georgia. Their admission only came after a court order sent from Federal court. Eleven days after arriving on campus, Hunter and Holmes were attacked by a mob of White rioters who threw rocks and bottles at them while waving the rebel flag. The attacks were so fierce that the dean of students suspended both Hunter and Holmes for their own safety. Now, even with me highlighting this violence, we are told that the stars and bars are about heritage. That heritage, Mr. Speaker, is not so subtle a reminder to African Americans that they are less than-- maybe not three-fifths of a person, but still not equal. This is a reminder that there are two classes of citizens. And despite our Declaration of Independence clearly stating that all men are created equal, this is a reminder that there is a lesser class and will never be equal. But why are we honoring the heritage and flag of the hooded night riders of the Klan at our State houses and in this Congress instead of the flag of the Freedom Riders who died for a single, fair, and equal America? Two years after Martin Luther King, Jr., delivered his ``I have dream'' speech before 600 civil rights marchers, including our friend and colleague from Georgia, Congressman John Lewis, a different group of civil rights heroes were greeted by police officers in Selma, Alabama, proudly displaying the Confederate flag on the side of their helmets. These officers brutally beat the marchers, and their actions were a reminder that Dr. King's speech had not yet resonated in the hearts of those who needed to hear it most. But it was the undeterred resilience of the protesters who refused to back down and refused to resort to violence that persevered. It was the love, the respect, and the mutual understanding that displayed what was the strongest symbol of strength, honor, and heritage than the Confederate battle flag. Mr. Speaker, we have come a long way since 1965, but we still have a ways to go. We must move forward. The needed progress, however, will not come if the Federal Government continues to provide American citizens with reminders of our hateful and oppressive past in a manner that legitimizes such hate. I am glad to host this important Special Order hour with my colleague from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) to talk about where we go from here and why we continue to give energy to symbols of hate and division. I yield to the kind gentleman from Newark, New Jersey (Mr. Payne). Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois. This is a very timely topic, as we have seen what has transpired in our Nation over the past several weeks. It is incredible to me how fast this issue has moved over the past month. But it always seems that it takes a horrific act in this country for us to wake up and realize that maybe something isn't right. {time} 1930 Nine people at church study on a Wednesday night, not knowing their fate, were gunned down in cold blood by someone who actually said: You know, they were so nice to me, I almost didn't do it, but I had to. Last week in South Carolina, there was a monumental step in removing the Confederate flag from its State capitol, where it had shamefully flown for 54 years; but here in our Nation's Capitol last week, Republicans tried to go back to the future. House Republicans had to pull a vote on a spending bill because some of their Members opposed a measure that would ban Confederate flags from national cemeteries, and when the Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, presented an opportunity for Republicans to do the right thing and immediately remove the Confederate flag from the Capitol Grounds, they punted. South Carolina, the birthplace of the Confederacy, had the courage to do what the House Republicans did not, remove that dreaded symbol. It is the symbol of an incomprehensible hate, a hate that manifested itself in a massacre. Since that unfortunate day 1 month ago, we, as a nation, have been forced to look inward at who we are and who we want to be. Mr. Speaker, out of this immense grief of that dark day in Charleston came a resounding call throughout our Nation to remove the Confederate flag and other symbols of racism and racial supremacy. For many, the removal of these symbols is a logical step in the trajectory of our Nation, a necessary action on the path toward the more perfect Union. For others, calls to remove these symbols of hate are seen as an attack [[Page H5110]] on the Southern identity, heritage, and culture; but arguing that the Confederate flag is a symbol of Southern pride celebrates a single homogenous culture. It means listening to only some voices at the expense of others. It means ignoring the African American experience throughout our Nation's history from the dark period of slavery to the civil rights movement to the present day. According to a report by the Equal Justice Initiative, 3,959 African Americans in 12 States were killed by the terror of lynching between 1877 and 1950, 3,959 Americans lynched. If we are going to refer to the past and debate over the Confederate flag, certainly, we need to take all of this into account. The Confederate flag has always stood for racial supremacy and bigotry, and if we are to realize our Nation's promise of justice and full equality, we cannot embrace this symbol. Eradicating symbols of hatred, violence, and cruel oppression steeped in racism is a critical step to confronting prejudice in our society. Now, Mr. Speaker, we have all heard complaints that this debate does not matter and that removing the Confederate flag and other symbols of hatred is a distraction from the larger problems facing our Nation, such as rampant gun violence. I agree that significantly more must be done to address racism and persistent inequality in our Nation. I agree that we need meaningful gun reform from expanding background checks to reducing unchecked online ammunition purchases. I agree that we need to create jobs, reduce wealth disparities, and expand educational opportunities. But symbols matter; symbols legitimize public opinion and, in doing so, entrench attitudes and beliefs. At the same time, they create a meaning, shape actions, and connect us to one another. Just as a symbol can connect us, they can tear us apart. Mr. Speaker, as I go to my seat, I was talking to my staff the other day about this and how much we were happy to see that flag lowered. The symbol is gone, but the sentiment remains. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Congressman Payne, for those words. Right now, it is my pleasure to introduce the Congressman from North Carolina and the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congressman Butterfield. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, let me first thank you, Congresswoman Kelly and Congressman Payne, for your leadership. Your leadership is very much appreciated, and your constituents in your respective districts should be very proud of each one of you. I know the Congressional Black Caucus is proud of you. For the past several weeks, Mr. Speaker, the Nation has been focused on the Confederate battle flag. Most fair-minded Americans have been asking the question: Why is this flag continuing to fly on State grounds and Federal lands? And why are policymakers refusing to squarely address this issue? The Confederate battle flag, Mr. Speaker, represents an era of American history that ended--or at least it should have ended--150 years ago. This flag represents the years following President Lincoln's election. Those years starting in December of 1860 saw 11 Southern States leave the Union. The fancy name for their leaving the Union, Mr. Speaker, was called secession, but the reality was that these Southern States were rebelling. They were in rebellion against the Union. They organized a so-called government called the Confederate States of America. They took up arms, Mr. Speaker, and they fought against the Union for 4 long years until they surrendered. They then returned to the Union. The Confederate flag represents that era where Southern States were resisting freedom for 4 million slaves. There continues to be elements today in our society who subscribe to separation of the races--how unfortunate. There continues to be elements in our society who believe in White supremacy. The question now, Mr. Speaker, is: Do we constructively address the question of hate groups in America? Do we continue to insist that other States remove symbols of White supremacy as South Carolina has done? Or do we continue to simply ignore racism? Other States continue to display Confederate flags, and even in this Capitol--even in this Capitol--you will find eight statues of Confederate soldiers who fought against the Stars and Stripes. Mr. Speaker, I call upon every American to bury for good the dark history of slavery and bigotry. We are a great nation, and we will be even greater when we can judge our neighbor on the content of their character and not on the color of their skin. Let's remove these symbols from our view. I thank each one of the floor managers. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Congressman Butterfield, for those fine words. Many questions, many questions: Why are they still holding on? Is it just heritage and tradition? Or is it something more? At this time, Mr. Speaker, I would like to introduce the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton. Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, the gentlewoman from Illinois, and my friend, the gentleman from New Jersey, for their important leadership they are exercising here this evening. Mr. Speaker, I have come to speak about why symbols matter and why this symbol, the Confederate flag, must not stop with the flag, but must also go to what to do not only about the flag, but about the guns that took down the Charleston 9. To be sure, symbols matter, Mr. Speaker. To take two of the most powerful symbols in the world, the cross and the Star of David, we know well these symbols can sometimes mean everything. We also know that the Confederate flag is a symbol of a different and lower order. A symbol stands for more than itself; the symbol tells a story. The religious symbols evoke tears; they evoke joy, and they evoke their own set of stories. The Confederate flag, when it led to the extraordinary tragedy of the Charleston 9 will always--should always--make us think of the gun that was responsible for the Charleston 9--not just the symbol, but the story behind the symbol. In the 19th century, the flag signaled the importance of slavery. In the 20th century, it had a different meaning. Robert E. Lee had told his soldiers: Put down the flag. We are one Union now. He was, in a real sense, the counterpart to Abraham Lincoln, who was trying to draw us together after Lee had lost that war. In the 20th century, the flag was revived. It was revived by Southern Democrats--Dixiecrats, as they called themselves. It has been, in the 20th century and, now, the 21st century, a symbol of discrimination and racism. No matter what it stood for in the 19th century about heritage, it lost that meaning when, in the 20th century, George Wallace raised it and said ``segregation now'' and ``segregation forever.'' Nobody who now speaks of heritage then said: Wait a minute, Governor Wallace, don't take away our heritage. Only when African Americans have the nerve to raise the notion, after we lost nine good people in Charleston, does it somehow now become a symbol of heritage. I will give Senator Mitch McConnell some credit. He wants to remove the statue of Jefferson Davis from the Kentucky State Capitol, but when asked about removing the Jefferson Davis statue from the United States Capitol, Mr. McConnell grew silent. We have got to come to grips with what this flag meant to this boy who used a gun. I am not going to forget those who died and what we owe those who died. The Dixiecrats bolted from Harry S. Truman when Truman refused to embrace their racism. These were Southern Democrats, and we owe them the 21st century meaning of the Confederate flag. Mr. Speaker, why are we talking about this symbol and not another symbol? The other symbol is the gun in America. The grace of the people of Charleston so overwhelmed the country that there were many who were simply grateful that, instead of bursting forward with rage, they showed their extraordinary Christian heritage, the heritage they undoubtedly shared with the gunman. We were so grateful, all of us, and so proud that we have not talked about [[Page H5111]] what took the lives of these nine good people. Well, I want to talk about it because the Confederate flag for me now will always represent those nine people and the gun that took their lives. That 21-year-old kid didn't know anything about them except their Christian love when they invited him into their sanctuary. But, he knew about what that flag stood for, and he raised that flag before he went into that sanctuary. {time} 2000 We must not forget not only the flag--we cannot live by symbols alone--we must not forget the gun that took down the Charleston 9. Now, I understand--I read--that Senator Manchin and Senator Toomey are interested in reviving their gun safety legislation. There are several bills here in the House that do that in one form or another. We know what happened. There was a breakdown in the background check system, which is why this young man was even able to get a gun. He would have been denied a gun if those who opposed any bill hadn't assured that the bill would have only a 3-day time period, during which, if you couldn't find something on the individual, then he got his gun, no matter who he was. That is how he got his gun. There are some of us who know full well that the Confederate flag has done more than put the flag back on the agenda--on the Nation's agenda--it has put gun safety once again on the agenda. I must say, I don't believe we, who celebrate the extraordinary grace of the families of the Charleston 9, owe them only our speeches about the flag. They probably, once they saw it come down, have moved on; and now, they have only their loved ones to think about. If I were one of them, I would wonder: What are those who celebrate the flag coming down going to do about making sure that, never again, will people like our loved ones have to suffer because of gunfire? The flag is the symbol that is important to raising our consciousness in the long run. If all we have is our memory of the symbol and not why that symbol became important, then we will leave on the table a real memorial to the Charleston 9. I appreciate the time. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Congresswoman Holmes. I am so glad that you and Congressman Payne brought up the issue of the gun because we cannot forget that either. I look at Charleston as when racism and hate found the gun. At this time, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Fudge), our former head of the Congressional Black Caucus. Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I want to thank my colleagues, Congressman Payne and Congresswoman Kelly, for leading the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour tonight. Mr. Speaker, if you have not noticed, the people of this country are fed up. Quite frankly, so am I. We are at a point in our Nation's history when we can no longer give lip service to equality and opportunities to succeed. We must take action to show we mean what we say; otherwise, it is nothing more than empty rhetoric. Mr. Speaker, the Confederate flag is more than just a piece of fabric. It is more than just a visual representation of the Confederacy or part of the storied history of the South. If that were true, we would not be having this conversation today. We would not have buried nine Americans murdered because of the color of their skin, and the Confederate battle flag would still be flying in the State of South Carolina. Let's be honest about the history of the Confederate battle flag. While the majority of this House may want to ignore the facts and rewrite history, we will not be ignored. The Confederate battle flag and any adaptation of it is a painful reminder of intimidation, torture, and murder for all of us in the Black community. It is a flying symbol of hatred and injustice that tells Black and Brown people in this country: Your lives have no value, and you don't matter. It is an embarrassment to all Americans that the majority of this House introduced a spending amendment which included language allowing the battle flag on Federal properties. It is just plain shameful that they would go even further and use procedure to stifle a motion to openly discuss a ban of the Confederate battle flag imagery from the Capitol Grounds. How can the Members of the majority of this House continue to say that they represent all Americans when they refuse to have a real discussion about what is really happening in our country? Have we learned nothing from what has happened in the past few weeks? In a June Gallup poll, African Americans ranked race relations as the most important issue facing the United States. Will taking down the Confederate battle flag immediately change this perspective? Absolutely not--but it will certainly do more than letting it continue to fly. Mr. Speaker, it is time we do away with lip service. It is time we listen to our constituents and take real action toward healing the racial wounds of this country. It is time we move forward. The flag must come down. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Fudge for her eloquent words and the truth of what happened in Congress last week and what we need to do to go forward. At this time, I yield to the gentlewoman from Houston, Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the managers of this very Special Order and my words to them and to this House. I want you to take note of the spirit in which these Members have come. If our constituents are seeing us and watching us, if those who agree with us are watching, no one has come with anger and a cry of hysteria. They have come with a reasoned request and pronouncement of the wrongness of the present situation in this House. Let me say that it was in 1864 that the States were given the call to send forward two statutes to come to represent their States in the United States Congress. In addition, we know that the United States Congress has a number of flags representing various States. This was to be the people's House, and the people's House would reflect the people of the United States of America. History should be something that grows with the Nation and reflects the goodness of the Nation. Yes, there is history that should be taught, such as the ugliness and violence of the slave history; but it is not to be honored. I join my colleagues today to be able to call for the taking down of signs of Confederacy in the United States Capitol--in particular, as I am in the House of Representatives, in the people's House. Let me give you a credible basis upon which to do so, why this Supreme Court decision has been so ignored. Let me cite it for my colleagues, Walker III v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, issued on June 18, 2015--ironically, the day after the martyrdom of nine wonderful African Americans practicing their Christian faith. This particular decision indicates that the State of Texas was to be supported. This was a case that engaged many of our constituents in Texas. We organize and galvanize. I want to thank Dr. Clark, the president of the Missionary Baptist General Convention of Texas, and Reverend Max Miller, who came up as we argued this case. We were convincing. The Texas Department of Motor Vehicles board agreed that a Confederate license plate issued by the State of Texas would be offensive and would be considered, in essence, a public action or public speech. For those who want to raise the question of the First Amendment, this cry that we, as members of the Congressional Black Caucus, are making is perfectly constitutional and legitimate. We are talking about flags that are flown on State property or Federal property. This caucus should be congratulated. It is succinct in its argument; it is detailed in its argument, and no First Amendment opposition can be raised because the Supreme Court of the United States has said that we can deny utilizing the Confederate flag that may be considered State action as it is placed on Federal lands on the Federal property here. [[Page H5112]] Our colleagues, in particular Hakeem Jeffries and Mr. Huffman and others, understood that when they acted last week. Now, the considerate thing to have done is there are amendments to stay in place, the Interior bill to be voted on, and the right thing would have been done because they argued the point that this was State or Federal action. We now come again to try and clarify for our colleagues that these flags should come down. In the privileged resolutions that have gone on last week, they made the point very clear that it was an insult to the dignity of the House. I have introduced H. Res. 342 that I hope will complement, and it is one that talks about the enhancement of unity in America and stands on the Walker decision and, in particular, makes it very clear that divisive symbols--license plates, specialty license plates, replicas, and flags--on public buildings or government property and symbols on State or Federal action, State public speech--that is a speech of those you represent--should not be allowed. How divisive is that point of view? It is not. The divisiveness is those that stand on a false sense of history, yet want to offend those who likewise have great leadership. Let me make this point about the battle flag, this Confederate flag. Might I ask the question: Have southerners not fought in the War of 1812, in World War I, in World War II, in the Korean war, in the Hungarian war in the fifties, and in Vietnam and shed their blood under this flag, have they not been honored when they have shed their blood? Not only that, when Confederate soldiers died, they were honored appropriately in graves where those who desired to honor that shedding of the blood were allowed to do so. We did not run into the funerals of those Southern fallen soldiers and cast upon them and curse them and deny them. They were allowed to be honored appropriately, and they now go into the annals of history. When you understand what grounds they stood on, what their general stood on, such as Jefferson Davis, who called the individuals who were slaves as unprofitable savages--that is what one general who has been honored has called them, ``unprofitable savages''--is that the history that we should be honoring? Is that what we should be lifting up? Is that what should be placed in the place of honor in the United States Congress? Is that engaged in the uplifting of the dignity of the House? Or is it insulting the dignity of the House? To my colleagues, I stand with you today to join in trying to create an understanding of the rightness of the work of our colleagues last week on the Interior bill, of the rightness of the Congressional Black Caucus going, as someone would say, on and on and on about this flag; and my good friend from New Jersey said it is symbols, and we need to bridge the gap of the inequity and wealth, we need education, we need jobs. Let me be very clear, Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Black Caucus and my colleagues and the Democratic Caucus and good will Republicans are fighting for jobs--or should be--fighting for education. We are not languishing along the side highway of life. We fought to maintain the ObamaCare or the Affordable Care Act. We are not ignoring the other desires of our constituents. Let me close on this final point, and I am glad that my colleague from the District of Columbia raised it, and Congresswoman Kelly has been a leader, and Congresswoman Kelly, let's rise again, and that is the horror of gun violence. {time} 2015 Let me say to Director Comey, since I am on the Judiciary Committee, thank you for your honesty, but let me make it very clear that we suffered this loophole because of the opposition to the sensibleness of the Brady anti-gun violence legislation. Imbedded in it was this nonsensical point that, if I don't hear from you, then I am going to sell it. Who is selling it? The gun store. I have no opposition to our fellow citizens who make their living and provide for their families by selling guns. I do have opposition to the evil and vile perpetrator who went into that Mother Emanuel Church and killed illegally with a gun that he should not have had. He did so because the 3-day time had expired, because there was a time when the NICS was closed--that is the entity that the FBI relies upon--and the 3 days expired, and the owner said, ``I am going to sell the gun.'' This week I will be introducing a single piece of legislation--and I ask my colleagues to join me--I know there are many other bills--to eliminate the 3-day period of discretion, that no discretion will exist. They either answer the question that he or she is eligible or it is denied. So on the graves of these wonderful martyrs, I stand in honor of them. I mourn them, and I mourn for their families. I say to them: We will never forget. Once and for all, bring the flag down and remove these items in this place of honor that have denigrated and considered one race of people vile and unequal. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Congresswoman Jackson Lee. Always detailed and insightful. Thank you for all of your work on the Judiciary Committee. It is very much appreciated and hailed. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries), who took center stage last week as we discussed and worked toward the removal of the flag. Mr. JEFFRIES. I want to thank my good friend, the distinguished gentlewoman from Illinois, Robin Kelly, for once again presiding over this important CBC Special Order hour, as well as her co-anchor, the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey, who is right across the Hudson River, and who so ably serves the communities of Newark and beyond. Mr. Speaker, this evening we have heard from so many distinguished members of the Congressional Black Caucus, most recently from the gentlewoman from Texas, with whom I serve on the Judiciary Committee, about the importance of the moment in time in which we find ourselves right now related to not just the Confederate battle flag, but perhaps more importantly: What is the legacy that we want to have as Americans, as Members of Congress, in dealing with the complicated issue of race? It is an honor and a privilege to once again have the chance to come to the House floor to have this conversation. This is a most distinguished venue from which to speak to the American people, an appropriate one, I would add, given the House's constitutional relationship to the people of America, this, of course, being the only institution that was envisioned by the Founding Fathers as one in which the people serving in the institution would be directly elected by the people. The Senate's Members, of course, in its original constitutional version, were elected by the State legislature. Then, of course, the Presidency, to this day, is a vehicle through which the individual is selected by the Electoral College. So this is the people's House, the institution most intimately connected to the people of America and the place where we should be able to speak truth to power. We witnessed that last week as we were forced, unfortunately, to discuss the issue of the Confederate battle flag at a moment when people of all races--Democrats and Republicans, Blacks, Whites, the extraordinary leadership from the Governor of South Carolina, and the distinguished gentleman from South Carolina, Jim Clyburn--came together. At the moment when the Confederate battle flag was coming down in South Carolina, there were Members of this House trying to lift it up. It was quite unfortunate that we needed to detour from this moment that we were having in America, led in South Carolina, to address the battle flag issue on this House floor; but I am hopeful that, as we move forward now in a more productive way, we can begin to confront some of the public policy challenges that we face in America that supporters of the Confederate battle flag have fought against. As others have detailed during the presentation here today, the battle flag, which met its initial defeat in 1865 at the end of the Civil War, remained [[Page H5113]] largely dormant in American history until 1954 in the Supreme Court's decision of Brown vs. Board of Education. It was decided that this facade of separate and equal was constitutionally suspect and that African Americans were being denied the opportunity of being educated in quality public schools in the Deep South and in other places in America. Really, it was in the mid-fifties and then into the early sixties when the Confederate battle flag was resurrected as a symbol of the segregationists who were fighting to uphold Jim Crow. It was a symbol of those who were fighting to stop the efforts of courageous individuals like Congressman John Lewis, who in 1965 was the co-chair of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. It was a symbol of those who were trying to fight efforts by John Lewis and others to make sure that the franchise--the right to vote-- was colorblind in nature and that the 15th Amendment could actually be brought to life all throughout America and in the Deep South, where there were those who were trying to prevent African Americans from being able to vote. The battle flag was resurrected in the fifties and in the sixties to stop certain things from happening. It seems to me that, rather than having the discussion about whether it should come down, no reasonable person can take the position that it should have a place of honor. So it is extraordinary to me that we had to take to the House floor last week and have to come to the House floor today to continue to address this issue. Hopefully, reason will prevail over the next couple of weeks or the next couple of days--even prior to the August recess--and we can move beyond the Confederate battle flag issue and address some important, substantive issues that many would argue remain as part of the legacy of the Confederacy. We don't want to see the ghosts of the Confederacy invading the United States Congress from a policy perspective. Those nine souls--God-fearing, church-going African Americans--who were killed simply because of the color of their skin died because of someone who charged into that church with the intention of sparking a race war that was inspired, in part, by the Confederate battle flag. One of the things that has happened as a result of that tragedy is the battle flag has come down, but that is just the beginning of the work that we need to do in response to that tragedy and the conditions that so many people find themselves in all across America. As has been mentioned, we have got to confront the gun violence issue that we have in the United States. How can it be that we have 5 percent of the world's population, but 50 percent of the world's guns? It is estimated that we have more than 285 million guns in circulation. Nobody can give you an exact estimate because a chokehold has been placed around the Federal agencies charged with preventing gun violence and dealing with gun safety in America. It is an incredible act of legislative malpractice, but it is estimated that we have got over 285 million guns in America. Isn't it reasonable, particularly in the aftermath of this tragedy in Charleston, South Carolina, that we come together and figure out a way to prevent those guns, consistent with the Second Amendment, from falling into the hands of individuals who would do us harm? It seems to me to be a reasonable thing that we can do as Americans. It also seems important that we would find a way 50 years after the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act to stop trying to prevent Americans from exercising their sacred franchise and participating in American democracy. Yet, something happened in the aftermath of 2008, a real interesting moment in November of that year, that seemed to have shocked a whole lot of people across this country. As a result, 2 years later, when there was a midterm election, subsequent to that, there was an outbreak with this concern of voter fraud, fabricated because no one can point to any evidence of an epidemic of voter fraud. Not a scintilla of evidence has been presented anywhere in this country that we have got a problem that needs to be addressed; but we have had all of these voter suppression laws enacted that are consistent with the ghosts of the Confederacy and what those folks stood for who were waving the Confederate battle flag in opposition to the changes of the fifties and sixties. What shocks me is that even the Supreme Court has gotten into the act by decimating the section 5 preclearance through claiming that section 4 is outdated, and this House refuses to act on fixing the Voting Rights Act. I would argue that--again, consistent with our democracy and the spirit of coming together--that, perhaps, that is one of the things we can address so that we can take down, on the one hand, the divisive symbol of hatred--the Confederate battle flag--from here in this Capitol and in whatever form it hangs all across America so that we can lift up policies that make Americans safer, policies that are consistent with our values and that everyone--White, Black, Latino, Asian, Democrats, and Republicans--should be able to rally around. I am thankful for Congresswoman Kelly's and Congressman Payne's leadership--this wonderful tandem, R. Kelly and D. Payne, who are tremendous advocates here in the Congress--and for their giving me this opportunity to share these thoughts. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, Congressman Jeffries, for reminding us about the Voting Rights Act. Again, thank you for everything you did last week in this Congress. It was so commendable. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green), who gave a passionate speech on the floor last week about the flag. {time} 2030 Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. I am honored to be with the team of Kelly and Payne tonight. You do outstanding work, and you also provide an opportunity for other Members to have an opportunity to call to the attention of our constituents some of the concerns that we have to address in Congress. I will always be grateful for the wonderful work that you do in Congress. I am also very grateful and thankful to the many persons who worked to bring down the Confederate battle flag in South Carolina. It was not easy. There are many who said they never thought they would see it happen, but it did, and it happened because of a willingness to forgive and an understanding that we had an opportunity to do something meaningful for a good many people across the length and breadth of this country who saw the Confederate battle flag as a symbol of segregation, a symbol of racism and bigotry, a symbol of slavery. Not all did, but it was painful for a good many who did see it this way, many who suffered the indignation and humiliation of segregation, who suffered knowing that their bloodline had suffered slavery. So I am here tonight to thank those who worked so hard to get this done. It was not easy, and I want to thank you for what you did. But I also know that there are a good many people now who would like to see us go back to normal. They are ready to get back to the normal things that we have in this great country of ours, the richest country in the world. For them, normal is a very pleasant thing. Normal means new homes. Normal means greater opportunities. But let's talk about normal for some others in this country because normal is not always the same for everyone. Normal for the month of June 2015 unemployment: normal for Whites was 4.6 percent, that is the unemployment rate. That is normal for Whites. Normal for Latinos was 6.6 percent, and normal for Blacks was 9.5 percent. Now, I have already heard the arguments about how President Obama ought to resolve this; this is all his fault. Not so, my friends. If you look back through the vista of time, you will find that unemployment for African Americans is usually about twice the unemployment rate for White Americans. This is not something new to President Obama. This is not something that started in 2008 when he was elected or when he was sworn in in 2009. This is not something that is new to us, those of us who know and see the pain and suffering that results from a lack of employment. We understand that the flag coming down was a great moment for us symbolically. It was symbolism. Now, the [[Page H5114]] substance is what we ultimately have to deal with, and the substance is the normal life that people lead under conditions that are abnormal for many others in this country. Let's look at normal as it relates to lending for businesses. Minority businessowners in 2012--this is the latest information that I have from the Federal Reserve--paid interest rates that were 32 percent higher than what Whites paid--32 percent higher. That is normal. Some people don't want to go back to this normal state of affairs. They see the flag coming down as an indication that we need to move on in other substantive areas. Lending, mortgage lending is an important area. Normal for African Americans meant that in 2013 only 4.8 percent of loans made to buy homes were made to Blacks, when Blacks comprise 13.2 percent of the total population. Normal for Latinos meant that in 2013 only 7.3 percent of the loans made to buy homes were made to Latinos, Hispanics, when they make up 17.15 percent of the total population. That is normal. Normal in 2013 meant the conventional mortgage loan denial rate was, and this is according to CNN, 10.4 percent for Whites, 13.3 percent for Asians, 21.9 percent for Hispanics, and 27.6 percent for African Americans. There are a good many people who don't live normal lives in this normal climate that we want to get back to--we, in a generic sense. I, not the personal pronoun for me, I don't want to get back to this. I want to see us move on with substantive change. I appreciate what was done in bringing down the flag. I celebrate its coming down, but it is time for us to initiate greater action in areas where we can integrate the money. I am an integrationist. I think we ought to integrate every aspect of American society, including the money. Let's talk about normal. Normal means that Black applicants are 2.1 times more likely to be denied loans by mortgage lenders than non- Hispanic Whites. That is normal. For Hispanics, it means that they are 1.7 times more likely to be denied loans. That is normal. For Asians, 1.2 times more likely. So I am saying to us that we have got to create a new normal. It is time for us, those of us who sit on committees of jurisdiction, to use our influence on these committees of jurisdiction to bring about the substantive change that lowering the flag and placing it in its place of honor, proper place where it should be, lowering that Confederate flag. That means that we must do that, but do it in such a way that we acknowledge that there is more work to be done, and we can do it on our committees of jurisdiction. So, given that I serve on the Committee on Financial Services, I will be calling to the attention of the committee the need to investigate the mortgage lending culture in banks. We need to understand why it is that African Americans and Latinos who are equally as qualified as Whites can go into a bank and not get a loan when a White can. We have got to find out why. I know that there are many people who are uncomfortable with the language of Black and White and Brown, but that is the language we have to use to communicate clearly a message of what is taking place. So on my committee, I am going to push for an investigation of banks. We need to know why banks consistently do this. Not all banks, but we need to know why those who do it are doing it. The way you do this is to test, to send people out who are equally qualified of different ethnicities and acquire the empirical evidence. In every instance--maybe with a few exceptions, but in every instance, in a general sense, we find that Blacks and Browns who are equally as qualified as Whites do not receive their loans. I encourage all of my colleagues to use your committees of jurisdiction to create a new state of normalcy for those who have been suffering continuously. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you so much, Congressman Green, for your words, your passion, and your call to action. I would like to thank all of my colleagues for participating tonight. Symbols of the Confederacy have been an inescapable and often haunting part of life in many Southern States. Every day the Confederate flag is flown proudly in front yards, worn on T-shirts, and you will find them on pickup trucks, and that is the right that folks have. Many argue this is a symbol of Southern history, tradition, and honor. I would argue against the merits of that. After all, what are we proudly honoring and looking upon nostalgically? The Confederate flag represents a dark time in our Nation's history, full of pain, suffering, and loss. Why do we allow the mascot of terrorist groups to fly high on the government grounds? Would we permit ISIS the luxury of putting their symbols on our Federal grounds? In modern society, people have made a decision to eradicate materials that do not represent our country's core values: the value of inclusion, the value of nondiscrimination, and the value that our Nation can be the beacon of hope for everyone regardless of the color of their skin. The institution of slavery destroyed families, killed millions, and formed the beginning of a systemic inequality faced by African Americans today. That is what the Confederacy sought to preserve when it seceded from our great Nation. Every time a Confederate flag flies, whether it is the intent of the owner or not, that is what is being celebrated. Mr. Speaker, we need to take down the flag and we also need to have a serious conversation about gun violence. On behalf of Congressman Payne and me, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus, to discuss tonight's CBC Special Order Hour: ``The Confederate Battle Flag: Why Symbols Matter.'' I stand here today fully acknowledging that the eradication of this hurtful flag from state and federal grounds is only one step in fully addressing race relations in this country; but, just as so many of my CBC colleagues have stood on this very floor to exclaim that ``Black Lives Matter,'' so too do symbols. Symbols of hatred, institutionalized racism and white supremacy, they matter. Symbols like the flags of Apartheid South Africa and Rhodesia, embraced by Dylann Roof, the terrorist responsible for the unspeakable events at Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston last month, Mr. Speaker, they matter. Last week, the South Carolina legislature voted overwhelmingly in favor of removing--once and for all--the confederate battle flag from their Capitol grounds. I applaud the state of South Carolina for this historic gesture and for the outstanding leadership necessary to ensure that this flag comes down in the aftermath of the ``Emmanuel Nine'' tragedy. I implore other southern states that still fly the battle flag on state grounds to follow suit and have the flag removed. As a Member of Congress, I pledge my support to any legislation that completely eradicates this symbol from all federal lands. To understand why the confederate battle flag has been offensive to millions of Americans for so many years requires a proper framing of American History. The version of the confederate battle flag that most people are familiar with today was first used by the Army of Tennessee during the Civil War. Shortly thereafter, it became widely known as the symbol of the Confederacy--eleven states who wished to secede from the Union over the right to own slaves. For the many Americans who deny a basic historical fact by refusing to believe that slavery was a central point of conflict in the Civil War, I quote directly from the declaration of secession from my home state of Texas: ``We hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various States, and of the confederacy itself were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the African race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable.'' Similarly, overt references to slavery as a motivation to secede from the Union are also present in the declarations of secession of South Carolina, Georgia and Mississippi. Repeatedly, throughout the 20th century, the confederate battle flag flew as a symbol of direct defiance to advancements in civil rights. The flag was first displayed at the South Carolina state Capitol in 1938 after angry Members of Congress defeated a bill that would have made lynching a federal crime. In the 1940s, the flag became the symbol of the Dixiecrats, the segregationist political faction birthed out of its firm stance against the civil rights agenda of the national Democratic party of the time. Members of the Dixiecrats were faithfully devoted to maintaining the segregation of the Jim Crow South, many of [[Page H5115]] whom stood on this very House floor decades ago, extolling the virtues of an American society that subjugated its black citizens. In 1962, the flag was raised to the dome of the South Carolina state Capitol after President Kennedy called on Congress to end poll taxes and literacy tests for voting, and the Supreme Court declared segregation in public transportation unconstitutional. The raising of the confederate battle flag flew as a symbol of resistance in South Carolina to two landmark achievements of progress that our country relied on to move forward in its quest for racial equality. While the confederate battle flag may represent ``Southern Heritage'' to some, to millions of other Americans it represents an opposition to the racial equality we still fight for today. This flag is a symbol of the painful history that this country has worked hard to overcome; and in order to continue moving forward, it is a symbol that we must finally put behind us.

kelly) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. general leave ms. kelly of illinois. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members be given 5 days to revise and extend their remarks. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from illinois? there was no objection. ms. kelly of illinois. mr. speaker, we are here tonight to have an important conversation, a conversation that is long overdue, a conversation that is crucial to healing america's deep racial wounds, our topic being the confederate battle flag and why racial symbols matter. the charleston 9 killings focused many of our attention on the significant appropriateness and bigoted history of this flag. in 2015, why do so many still revere a flag that tolerated the shackling of people because of their skin, a flag that allowed human beings to be counted as three-fifths of a person, a flag that was flown during lynchings, the holding of children, and one that symbolized a movement to deny education and equal treatment under our laws? fifty years since selma, we think of the freedom riders, marchers, boycotters, protesters, and policymakers who pointed our nation in a more positive direction. they knew it was time to reject the traditions of the past. the civil rights movement symbolized the quest of equality and a change in mood for america. thousands from all backgrounds had the courage to join in peaceful protests, lunch counter sit-ins, and boycotts at the expense of being jailed, beaten, or killed. they did this for one nation and one flag. and in the way of these americans stood those who believed in the perseverance of inequality, who believed in an america of white and colored, an america of two flags, and the confederate battle flag represented their america. jim crow america saw states that seceded from the union, reacting to the growth of the civil rights movement, with the use of the confederate battle flag as the representation of their resistant movement. in 1956, the state of georgia incorporated the battle flag into its official state flag design. the movement continued into the sixties, where it met renewed and intensified opposition, opposition that waved the confederate battle flag in the name of continued racial oppression. in 1961, just 2 months after the sentencing of nine students arrested for a lunch counter sit-in in rock hill, south carolina, the confederate battle flag was raised over south carolina's state house during a centennial celebration of the civil war's opening. that same year, in neighboring georgia, charlayne hunter and hamilton holmes were the first two african american students to be admitted to the university of georgia. their admission only came after a court order sent from federal court. eleven days after arriving on campus, hunter and holmes were attacked by a mob of white rioters who threw rocks and bottles at them while waving the rebel flag. the attacks were so fierce that the dean of students suspended both hunter and holmes for their own safety. now, even with me highlighting this violence, we are told that the stars and bars are about heritage. that heritage, mr. speaker, is not so subtle a reminder to african americans that they are less than-- maybe not three-fifths of a person, but still not equal. this is a reminder that there are two classes of citizens. and despite our declaration of independence clearly stating that all men are created equal, this is a reminder that there is a lesser class and will never be equal. but why are we honoring the heritage and flag of the hooded night riders of the klan at our state houses and in this congress instead of the flag of the freedom riders who died for a single, fair, and equal america? two years after martin luther king, jr., delivered his ``i have dream'' speech before 600 civil rights marchers, including our friend and colleague from georgia, congressman john lewis, a different group of civil rights heroes were greeted by police officers in selma, alabama, proudly displaying the confederate flag on the side of their helmets. these officers brutally beat the marchers, and their actions were a reminder that dr. king's speech had not yet resonated in the hearts of those who needed to hear it most. but it was the undeterred resilience of the protesters who refused to back down and refused to resort to violence that persevered. it was the love, the respect, and the mutual understanding that displayed what was the strongest symbol of strength, honor, and heritage than the confederate battle flag. mr. speaker, we have come a long way since 1965, but we still have a ways to go. we must move forward. the needed progress, however, will not come if the federal government continues to provide american citizens with reminders of our hateful and oppressive past in a manner that legitimizes such hate. i am glad to host this important special order hour with my colleague from new jersey (mr. payne) to talk about where we go from here and why we continue to give energy to symbols of hate and division. i yield to the kind gentleman from newark, new jersey (mr. payne). mr. payne. mr. speaker, i thank the gentlewoman from illinois. this is a very timely topic, as we have seen what has transpired in our nation over the past several weeks. it is incredible to me how fast this issue has moved over the past month. but it always seems that it takes a horrific act in this country for us to wake up and realize that maybe something isn't right. {time} 1930 nine people at church study on a wednesday night, not knowing their fate, were gunned down in cold blood by someone who actually said: you know, they were so nice to me, i almost didn't do it, but i had to. last week in south carolina, there was a monumental step in removing the confederate flag from its state capitol, where it had shamefully flown for 54 years; but here in our nation's capitol last week, republicans tried to go back to the future. house republicans had to pull a vote on a spending bill because some of their members opposed a measure that would ban confederate flags from national cemeteries, and when the democratic leader, nancy pelosi, presented an opportunity for republicans to do the right thing and immediately remove the confederate flag from the capitol grounds, they punted. south carolina, the birthplace of the confederacy, had the courage to do what the house republicans did not, remove that dreaded symbol. it is the symbol of an incomprehensible hate, a hate that manifested itself in a massacre. since that unfortunate day 1 month ago, we, as a nation, have been forced to look inward at who we are and who we want to be. mr. speaker, out of this immense grief of that dark day in charleston came a resounding call throughout our nation to remove the confederate flag and other symbols of racism and racial supremacy. for many, the removal of these symbols is a logical step in the trajectory of our nation, a necessary action on the path toward the more perfect union. for others, calls to remove these symbols of hate are seen as an attack [[page h5110]] on the southern identity, heritage, and culture; but arguing that the confederate flag is a symbol of southern pride celebrates a single homogenous culture. it means listening to only some voices at the expense of others. it means ignoring the african american experience throughout our nation's history from the dark period of slavery to the civil rights movement to the present day. according to a report by the equal justice initiative, 3,959 african americans in 12 states were killed by the terror of lynching between 1877 and 1950, 3,959 americans lynched. if we are going to refer to the past and debate over the confederate flag, certainly, we need to take all of this into account. the confederate flag has always stood for racial supremacy and bigotry, and if we are to realize our nation's promise of justice and full equality, we cannot embrace this symbol. eradicating symbols of hatred, violence, and cruel oppression steeped in racism is a critical step to confronting prejudice in our society. now, mr. speaker, we have all heard complaints that this debate does not matter and that removing the confederate flag and other symbols of hatred is a distraction from the larger problems facing our nation, such as rampant gun violence. i agree that significantly more must be done to address racism and persistent inequality in our nation. i agree that we need meaningful gun reform from expanding background checks to reducing unchecked online ammunition purchases. i agree that we need to create jobs, reduce wealth disparities, and expand educational opportunities. but symbols matter; symbols legitimize public opinion and, in doing so, entrench attitudes and beliefs. at the same time, they create a meaning, shape actions, and connect us to one another. just as a symbol can connect us, they can tear us apart. mr. speaker, as i go to my seat, i was talking to my staff the other day about this and how much we were happy to see that flag lowered. the symbol is gone, but the sentiment remains. ms. kelly of illinois. thank you, congressman payne, for those words. right now, it is my pleasure to introduce the congressman from north carolina and the chair of the congressional black caucus, congressman butterfield. mr. butterfield. mr. speaker, let me first thank you, congresswoman kelly and congressman payne, for your leadership. your leadership is very much appreciated, and your constituents in your respective districts should be very proud of each one of you. i know the congressional black caucus is proud of you. for the past several weeks, mr. speaker, the nation has been focused on the confederate battle flag. most fair-minded americans have been asking the question: why is this flag continuing to fly on state grounds and federal lands? and why are policymakers refusing to squarely address this issue? the confederate battle flag, mr. speaker, represents an era of american history that ended--or at least it should have ended--150 years ago. this flag represents the years following president lincoln's election. those years starting in december of 1860 saw 11 southern states leave the union. the fancy name for their leaving the union, mr. speaker, was called secession, but the reality was that these southern states were rebelling. they were in rebellion against the union. they organized a so-called government called the confederate states of america. they took up arms, mr. speaker, and they fought against the union for 4 long years until they surrendered. they then returned to the union. the confederate flag represents that era where southern states were resisting freedom for 4 million slaves. there continues to be elements today in our society who subscribe to separation of the races--how unfortunate. there continues to be elements in our society who believe in white supremacy. the question now, mr. speaker, is: do we constructively address the question of hate groups in america? do we continue to insist that other states remove symbols of white supremacy as south carolina has done? or do we continue to simply ignore racism? other states continue to display confederate flags, and even in this capitol--even in this capitol--you will find eight statues of confederate soldiers who fought against the stars and stripes. mr. speaker, i call upon every american to bury for good the dark history of slavery and bigotry. we are a great nation, and we will be even greater when we can judge our neighbor on the content of their character and not on the color of their skin. let's remove these symbols from our view. i thank each one of the floor managers. ms. kelly of illinois. thank you, congressman butterfield, for those fine words. many questions, many questions: why are they still holding on? is it just heritage and tradition? or is it something more? at this time, mr. speaker, i would like to introduce the gentlewoman from the district of columbia, congresswoman eleanor holmes norton. ms. norton. mr. speaker, i want to thank my good friend, the gentlewoman from illinois, and my friend, the gentleman from new jersey, for their important leadership they are exercising here this evening. mr. speaker, i have come to speak about why symbols matter and why this symbol, the confederate flag, must not stop with the flag, but must also go to what to do not only about the flag, but about the guns that took down the charleston 9. to be sure, symbols matter, mr. speaker. to take two of the most powerful symbols in the world, the cross and the star of david, we know well these symbols can sometimes mean everything. we also know that the confederate flag is a symbol of a different and lower order. a symbol stands for more than itself; the symbol tells a story. the religious symbols evoke tears; they evoke joy, and they evoke their own set of stories. the confederate flag, when it led to the extraordinary tragedy of the charleston 9 will always--should always--make us think of the gun that was responsible for the charleston 9--not just the symbol, but the story behind the symbol. in the 19th century, the flag signaled the importance of slavery. in the 20th century, it had a different meaning. robert e. lee had told his soldiers: put down the flag. we are one union now. he was, in a real sense, the counterpart to abraham lincoln, who was trying to draw us together after lee had lost that war. in the 20th century, the flag was revived. it was revived by southern democrats--dixiecrats, as they called themselves. it has been, in the 20th century and, now, the 21st century, a symbol of discrimination and racism. no matter what it stood for in the 19th century about heritage, it lost that meaning when, in the 20th century, george wallace raised it and said ``segregation now'' and ``segregation forever.'' nobody who now speaks of heritage then said: wait a minute, governor wallace, don't take away our heritage. only when african americans have the nerve to raise the notion, after we lost nine good people in charleston, does it somehow now become a symbol of heritage. i will give senator mitch mcconnell some credit. he wants to remove the statue of jefferson davis from the kentucky state capitol, but when asked about removing the jefferson davis statue from the united states capitol, mr. mcconnell grew silent. we have got to come to grips with what this flag meant to this boy who used a gun. i am not going to forget those who died and what we owe those who died. the dixiecrats bolted from harry s. truman when truman refused to embrace their racism. these were southern democrats, and we owe them the 21st century meaning of the confederate flag. mr. speaker, why are we talking about this symbol and not another symbol? the other symbol is the gun in america. the grace of the people of charleston so overwhelmed the country that there were many who were simply grateful that, instead of bursting forward with rage, they showed their extraordinary christian heritage, the heritage they undoubtedly shared with the gunman. we were so grateful, all of us, and so proud that we have not talked about [[page h5111]] what took the lives of these nine good people. well, i want to talk about it because the confederate flag for me now will always represent those nine people and the gun that took their lives. that 21-year-old kid didn't know anything about them except their christian love when they invited him into their sanctuary. but, he knew about what that flag stood for, and he raised that flag before he went into that sanctuary. {time} 2000 we must not forget not only the flag--we cannot live by symbols alone--we must not forget the gun that took down the charleston 9. now, i understand--i read--that senator manchin and senator toomey are interested in reviving their gun safety legislation. there are several bills here in the house that do that in one form or another. we know what happened. there was a breakdown in the background check system, which is why this young man was even able to get a gun. he would have been denied a gun if those who opposed any bill hadn't assured that the bill would have only a 3-day time period, during which, if you couldn't find something on the individual, then he got his gun, no matter who he was. that is how he got his gun. there are some of us who know full well that the confederate flag has done more than put the flag back on the agenda--on the nation's agenda--it has put gun safety once again on the agenda. i must say, i don't believe we, who celebrate the extraordinary grace of the families of the charleston 9, owe them only our speeches about the flag. they probably, once they saw it come down, have moved on; and now, they have only their loved ones to think about. if i were one of them, i would wonder: what are those who celebrate the flag coming down going to do about making sure that, never again, will people like our loved ones have to suffer because of gunfire? the flag is the symbol that is important to raising our consciousness in the long run. if all we have is our memory of the symbol and not why that symbol became important, then we will leave on the table a real memorial to the charleston 9. i appreciate the time. ms. kelly of illinois. thank you, congresswoman holmes. i am so glad that you and congressman payne brought up the issue of the gun because we cannot forget that either. i look at charleston as when racism and hate found the gun. at this time, i yield to the gentlewoman from ohio (ms. fudge), our former head of the congressional black caucus. ms. fudge. mr. speaker, i thank the gentlewoman for yielding. i want to thank my colleagues, congressman payne and congresswoman kelly, for leading the congressional black caucus special order hour tonight. mr. speaker, if you have not noticed, the people of this country are fed up. quite frankly, so am i. we are at a point in our nation's history when we can no longer give lip service to equality and opportunities to succeed. we must take action to show we mean what we say; otherwise, it is nothing more than empty rhetoric. mr. speaker, the confederate flag is more than just a piece of fabric. it is more than just a visual representation of the confederacy or part of the storied history of the south. if that were true, we would not be having this conversation today. we would not have buried nine americans murdered because of the color of their skin, and the confederate battle flag would still be flying in the state of south carolina. let's be honest about the history of the confederate battle flag. while the majority of this house may want to ignore the facts and rewrite history, we will not be ignored. the confederate battle flag and any adaptation of it is a painful reminder of intimidation, torture, and murder for all of us in the black community. it is a flying symbol of hatred and injustice that tells black and brown people in this country: your lives have no value, and you don't matter. it is an embarrassment to all americans that the majority of this house introduced a spending amendment which included language allowing the battle flag on federal properties. it is just plain shameful that they would go even further and use procedure to stifle a motion to openly discuss a ban of the confederate battle flag imagery from the capitol grounds. how can the members of the majority of this house continue to say that they represent all americans when they refuse to have a real discussion about what is really happening in our country? have we learned nothing from what has happened in the past few weeks? in a june gallup poll, african americans ranked race relations as the most important issue facing the united states. will taking down the confederate battle flag immediately change this perspective? absolutely not--but it will certainly do more than letting it continue to fly. mr. speaker, it is time we do away with lip service. it is time we listen to our constituents and take real action toward healing the racial wounds of this country. it is time we move forward. the flag must come down. ms. kelly of illinois. mr. speaker, i thank congresswoman fudge for her eloquent words and the truth of what happened in congress last week and what we need to do to go forward. at this time, i yield to the gentlewoman from houston, texas (ms. jackson lee). ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, let me thank the managers of this very special order and my words to them and to this house. i want you to take note of the spirit in which these members have come. if our constituents are seeing us and watching us, if those who agree with us are watching, no one has come with anger and a cry of hysteria. they have come with a reasoned request and pronouncement of the wrongness of the present situation in this house. let me say that it was in 1864 that the states were given the call to send forward two statutes to come to represent their states in the united states congress. in addition, we know that the united states congress has a number of flags representing various states. this was to be the people's house, and the people's house would reflect the people of the united states of america. history should be something that grows with the nation and reflects the goodness of the nation. yes, there is history that should be taught, such as the ugliness and violence of the slave history; but it is not to be honored. i join my colleagues today to be able to call for the taking down of signs of confederacy in the united states capitol--in particular, as i am in the house of representatives, in the people's house. let me give you a credible basis upon which to do so, why this supreme court decision has been so ignored. let me cite it for my colleagues, walker iii v. texas division, sons of confederate veterans, issued on june 18, 2015--ironically, the day after the martyrdom of nine wonderful african americans practicing their christian faith. this particular decision indicates that the state of texas was to be supported. this was a case that engaged many of our constituents in texas. we organize and galvanize. i want to thank dr. clark, the president of the missionary baptist general convention of texas, and reverend max miller, who came up as we argued this case. we were convincing. the texas department of motor vehicles board agreed that a confederate license plate issued by the state of texas would be offensive and would be considered, in essence, a public action or public speech. for those who want to raise the question of the first amendment, this cry that we, as members of the congressional black caucus, are making is perfectly constitutional and legitimate. we are talking about flags that are flown on state property or federal property. this caucus should be congratulated. it is succinct in its argument; it is detailed in its argument, and no first amendment opposition can be raised because the supreme court of the united states has said that we can deny utilizing the confederate flag that may be considered state action as it is placed on federal lands on the federal property here. [[page h5112]] our colleagues, in particular hakeem jeffries and mr. huffman and others, understood that when they acted last week. now, the considerate thing to have done is there are amendments to stay in place, the interior bill to be voted on, and the right thing would have been done because they argued the point that this was state or federal action. we now come again to try and clarify for our colleagues that these flags should come down. in the privileged resolutions that have gone on last week, they made the point very clear that it was an insult to the dignity of the house. i have introduced h. res. 342 that i hope will complement, and it is one that talks about the enhancement of unity in america and stands on the walker decision and, in particular, makes it very clear that divisive symbols--license plates, specialty license plates, replicas, and flags--on public buildings or government property and symbols on state or federal action, state public speech--that is a speech of those you represent--should not be allowed. how divisive is that point of view? it is not. the divisiveness is those that stand on a false sense of history, yet want to offend those who likewise have great leadership. let me make this point about the battle flag, this confederate flag. might i ask the question: have southerners not fought in the war of 1812, in world war i, in world war ii, in the korean war, in the hungarian war in the fifties, and in vietnam and shed their blood under this flag, have they not been honored when they have shed their blood? not only that, when confederate soldiers died, they were honored appropriately in graves where those who desired to honor that shedding of the blood were allowed to do so. we did not run into the funerals of those southern fallen soldiers and cast upon them and curse them and deny them. they were allowed to be honored appropriately, and they now go into the annals of history. when you understand what grounds they stood on, what their general stood on, such as jefferson davis, who called the individuals who were slaves as unprofitable savages--that is what one general who has been honored has called them, ``unprofitable savages''--is that the history that we should be honoring? is that what we should be lifting up? is that what should be placed in the place of honor in the united states congress? is that engaged in the uplifting of the dignity of the house? or is it insulting the dignity of the house? to my colleagues, i stand with you today to join in trying to create an understanding of the rightness of the work of our colleagues last week on the interior bill, of the rightness of the congressional black caucus going, as someone would say, on and on and on about this flag; and my good friend from new jersey said it is symbols, and we need to bridge the gap of the inequity and wealth, we need education, we need jobs. let me be very clear, mr. speaker, the congressional black caucus and my colleagues and the democratic caucus and good will republicans are fighting for jobs--or should be--fighting for education. we are not languishing along the side highway of life. we fought to maintain the obamacare or the affordable care act. we are not ignoring the other desires of our constituents. let me close on this final point, and i am glad that my colleague from the district of columbia raised it, and congresswoman kelly has been a leader, and congresswoman kelly, let's rise again, and that is the horror of gun violence. {time} 2015 let me say to director comey, since i am on the judiciary committee, thank you for your honesty, but let me make it very clear that we suffered this loophole because of the opposition to the sensibleness of the brady anti-gun violence legislation. imbedded in it was this nonsensical point that, if i don't hear from you, then i am going to sell it. who is selling it? the gun store. i have no opposition to our fellow citizens who make their living and provide for their families by selling guns. i do have opposition to the evil and vile perpetrator who went into that mother emanuel church and killed illegally with a gun that he should not have had. he did so because the 3-day time had expired, because there was a time when the nics was closed--that is the entity that the fbi relies upon--and the 3 days expired, and the owner said, ``i am going to sell the gun.'' this week i will be introducing a single piece of legislation--and i ask my colleagues to join me--i know there are many other bills--to eliminate the 3-day period of discretion, that no discretion will exist. they either answer the question that he or she is eligible or it is denied. so on the graves of these wonderful martyrs, i stand in honor of them. i mourn them, and i mourn for their families. i say to them: we will never forget. once and for all, bring the flag down and remove these items in this place of honor that have denigrated and considered one race of people vile and unequal. ms. kelly of illinois. thank you, congresswoman jackson lee. always detailed and insightful. thank you for all of your work on the judiciary committee. it is very much appreciated and hailed. mr. speaker, i yield to the gentleman from new york (mr. jeffries), who took center stage last week as we discussed and worked toward the removal of the flag. mr. jeffries. i want to thank my good friend, the distinguished gentlewoman from illinois, robin kelly, for once again presiding over this important cbc special order hour, as well as her co-anchor, the distinguished gentleman from new jersey, who is right across the hudson river, and who so ably serves the communities of newark and beyond. mr. speaker, this evening we have heard from so many distinguished members of the congressional black caucus, most recently from the gentlewoman from texas, with whom i serve on the judiciary committee, about the importance of the moment in time in which we find ourselves right now related to not just the confederate battle flag, but perhaps more importantly: what is the legacy that we want to have as americans, as members of congress, in dealing with the complicated issue of race? it is an honor and a privilege to once again have the chance to come to the house floor to have this conversation. this is a most distinguished venue from which to speak to the american people, an appropriate one, i would add, given the house's constitutional relationship to the people of america, this, of course, being the only institution that was envisioned by the founding fathers as one in which the people serving in the institution would be directly elected by the people. the senate's members, of course, in its original constitutional version, were elected by the state legislature. then, of course, the presidency, to this day, is a vehicle through which the individual is selected by the electoral college. so this is the people's house, the institution most intimately connected to the people of america and the place where we should be able to speak truth to power. we witnessed that last week as we were forced, unfortunately, to discuss the issue of the confederate battle flag at a moment when people of all races--democrats and republicans, blacks, whites, the extraordinary leadership from the governor of south carolina, and the distinguished gentleman from south carolina, jim clyburn--came together. at the moment when the confederate battle flag was coming down in south carolina, there were members of this house trying to lift it up. it was quite unfortunate that we needed to detour from this moment that we were having in america, led in south carolina, to address the battle flag issue on this house floor; but i am hopeful that, as we move forward now in a more productive way, we can begin to confront some of the public policy challenges that we face in america that supporters of the confederate battle flag have fought against. as others have detailed during the presentation here today, the battle flag, which met its initial defeat in 1865 at the end of the civil war, remained [[page h5113]] largely dormant in american history until 1954 in the supreme court's decision of brown vs. board of education. it was decided that this facade of separate and equal was constitutionally suspect and that african americans were being denied the opportunity of being educated in quality public schools in the deep south and in other places in america. really, it was in the mid-fifties and then into the early sixties when the confederate battle flag was resurrected as a symbol of the segregationists who were fighting to uphold jim crow. it was a symbol of those who were fighting to stop the efforts of courageous individuals like congressman john lewis, who in 1965 was the co-chair of the student nonviolent coordinating committee. it was a symbol of those who were trying to fight efforts by john lewis and others to make sure that the franchise--the right to vote-- was colorblind in nature and that the 15th amendment could actually be brought to life all throughout america and in the deep south, where there were those who were trying to prevent african americans from being able to vote. the battle flag was resurrected in the fifties and in the sixties to stop certain things from happening. it seems to me that, rather than having the discussion about whether it should come down, no reasonable person can take the position that it should have a place of honor. so it is extraordinary to me that we had to take to the house floor last week and have to come to the house floor today to continue to address this issue. hopefully, reason will prevail over the next couple of weeks or the next couple of days--even prior to the august recess--and we can move beyond the confederate battle flag issue and address some important, substantive issues that many would argue remain as part of the legacy of the confederacy. we don't want to see the ghosts of the confederacy invading the united states congress from a policy perspective. those nine souls--god-fearing, church-going african americans--who were killed simply because of the color of their skin died because of someone who charged into that church with the intention of sparking a race war that was inspired, in part, by the confederate battle flag. one of the things that has happened as a result of that tragedy is the battle flag has come down, but that is just the beginning of the work that we need to do in response to that tragedy and the conditions that so many people find themselves in all across america. as has been mentioned, we have got to confront the gun violence issue that we have in the united states. how can it be that we have 5 percent of the world's population, but 50 percent of the world's guns? it is estimated that we have more than 285 million guns in circulation. nobody can give you an exact estimate because a chokehold has been placed around the federal agencies charged with preventing gun violence and dealing with gun safety in america. it is an incredible act of legislative malpractice, but it is estimated that we have got over 285 million guns in america. isn't it reasonable, particularly in the aftermath of this tragedy in charleston, south carolina, that we come together and figure out a way to prevent those guns, consistent with the second amendment, from falling into the hands of individuals who would do us harm? it seems to me to be a reasonable thing that we can do as americans. it also seems important that we would find a way 50 years after the passage of the 1965 voting rights act to stop trying to prevent americans from exercising their sacred franchise and participating in american democracy. yet, something happened in the aftermath of 2008, a real interesting moment in november of that year, that seemed to have shocked a whole lot of people across this country. as a result, 2 years later, when there was a midterm election, subsequent to that, there was an outbreak with this concern of voter fraud, fabricated because no one can point to any evidence of an epidemic of voter fraud. not a scintilla of evidence has been presented anywhere in this country that we have got a problem that needs to be addressed; but we have had all of these voter suppression laws enacted that are consistent with the ghosts of the confederacy and what those folks stood for who were waving the confederate battle flag in opposition to the changes of the fifties and sixties. what shocks me is that even the supreme court has gotten into the act by decimating the section 5 preclearance through claiming that section 4 is outdated, and this house refuses to act on fixing the voting rights act. i would argue that--again, consistent with our democracy and the spirit of coming together--that, perhaps, that is one of the things we can address so that we can take down, on the one hand, the divisive symbol of hatred--the confederate battle flag--from here in this capitol and in whatever form it hangs all across america so that we can lift up policies that make americans safer, policies that are consistent with our values and that everyone--white, black, latino, asian, democrats, and republicans--should be able to rally around. i am thankful for congresswoman kelly's and congressman payne's leadership--this wonderful tandem, r. kelly and d. payne, who are tremendous advocates here in the congress--and for their giving me this opportunity to share these thoughts. ms. kelly of illinois. thank you, congressman jeffries, for reminding us about the voting rights act. again, thank you for everything you did last week in this congress. it was so commendable. mr. speaker, i yield to the gentleman from texas (mr. al green), who gave a passionate speech on the floor last week about the flag. {time} 2030 mr. al green of texas. i am honored to be with the team of kelly and payne tonight. you do outstanding work, and you also provide an opportunity for other members to have an opportunity to call to the attention of our constituents some of the concerns that we have to address in congress. i will always be grateful for the wonderful work that you do in congress. i am also very grateful and thankful to the many persons who worked to bring down the confederate battle flag in south carolina. it was not easy. there are many who said they never thought they would see it happen, but it did, and it happened because of a willingness to forgive and an understanding that we had an opportunity to do something meaningful for a good many people across the length and breadth of this country who saw the confederate battle flag as a symbol of segregation, a symbol of racism and bigotry, a symbol of slavery. not all did, but it was painful for a good many who did see it this way, many who suffered the indignation and humiliation of segregation, who suffered knowing that their bloodline had suffered slavery. so i am here tonight to thank those who worked so hard to get this done. it was not easy, and i want to thank you for what you did. but i also know that there are a good many people now who would like to see us go back to normal. they are ready to get back to the normal things that we have in this great country of ours, the richest country in the world. for them, normal is a very pleasant thing. normal means new homes. normal means greater opportunities. but let's talk about normal for some others in this country because normal is not always the same for everyone. normal for the month of june 2015 unemployment: normal for whites was 4.6 percent, that is the unemployment rate. that is normal for whites. normal for latinos was 6.6 percent, and normal for blacks was 9.5 percent. now, i have already heard the arguments about how president obama ought to resolve this; this is all his fault. not so, my friends. if you look back through the vista of time, you will find that unemployment for african americans is usually about twice the unemployment rate for white americans. this is not something new to president obama. this is not something that started in 2008 when he was elected or when he was sworn in in 2009. this is not something that is new to us, those of us who know and see the pain and suffering that results from a lack of employment. we understand that the flag coming down was a great moment for us symbolically. it was symbolism. now, the [[page h5114]] substance is what we ultimately have to deal with, and the substance is the normal life that people lead under conditions that are abnormal for many others in this country. let's look at normal as it relates to lending for businesses. minority businessowners in 2012--this is the latest information that i have from the federal reserve--paid interest rates that were 32 percent higher than what whites paid--32 percent higher. that is normal. some people don't want to go back to this normal state of affairs. they see the flag coming down as an indication that we need to move on in other substantive areas. lending, mortgage lending is an important area. normal for african americans meant that in 2013 only 4.8 percent of loans made to buy homes were made to blacks, when blacks comprise 13.2 percent of the total population. normal for latinos meant that in 2013 only 7.3 percent of the loans made to buy homes were made to latinos, hispanics, when they make up 17.15 percent of the total population. that is normal. normal in 2013 meant the conventional mortgage loan denial rate was, and this is according to cnn, 10.4 percent for whites, 13.3 percent for asians, 21.9 percent for hispanics, and 27.6 percent for african americans. there are a good many people who don't live normal lives in this normal climate that we want to get back to--we, in a generic sense. i, not the personal pronoun for me, i don't want to get back to this. i want to see us move on with substantive change. i appreciate what was done in bringing down the flag. i celebrate its coming down, but it is time for us to initiate greater action in areas where we can integrate the money. i am an integrationist. i think we ought to integrate every aspect of american society, including the money. let's talk about normal. normal means that black applicants are 2.1 times more likely to be denied loans by mortgage lenders than non- hispanic whites. that is normal. for hispanics, it means that they are 1.7 times more likely to be denied loans. that is normal. for asians, 1.2 times more likely. so i am saying to us that we have got to create a new normal. it is time for us, those of us who sit on committees of jurisdiction, to use our influence on these committees of jurisdiction to bring about the substantive change that lowering the flag and placing it in its place of honor, proper place where it should be, lowering that confederate flag. that means that we must do that, but do it in such a way that we acknowledge that there is more work to be done, and we can do it on our committees of jurisdiction. so, given that i serve on the committee on financial services, i will be calling to the attention of the committee the need to investigate the mortgage lending culture in banks. we need to understand why it is that african americans and latinos who are equally as qualified as whites can go into a bank and not get a loan when a white can. we have got to find out why. i know that there are many people who are uncomfortable with the language of black and white and brown, but that is the language we have to use to communicate clearly a message of what is taking place. so on my committee, i am going to push for an investigation of banks. we need to know why banks consistently do this. not all banks, but we need to know why those who do it are doing it. the way you do this is to test, to send people out who are equally qualified of different ethnicities and acquire the empirical evidence. in every instance--maybe with a few exceptions, but in every instance, in a general sense, we find that blacks and browns who are equally as qualified as whites do not receive their loans. i encourage all of my colleagues to use your committees of jurisdiction to create a new state of normalcy for those who have been suffering continuously. ms. kelly of illinois. thank you so much, congressman green, for your words, your passion, and your call to action. i would like to thank all of my colleagues for participating tonight. symbols of the confederacy have been an inescapable and often haunting part of life in many southern states. every day the confederate flag is flown proudly in front yards, worn on t-shirts, and you will find them on pickup trucks, and that is the right that folks have. many argue this is a symbol of southern history, tradition, and honor. i would argue against the merits of that. after all, what are we proudly honoring and looking upon nostalgically? the confederate flag represents a dark time in our nation's history, full of pain, suffering, and loss. why do we allow the mascot of terrorist groups to fly high on the government grounds? would we permit isis the luxury of putting their symbols on our federal grounds? in modern society, people have made a decision to eradicate materials that do not represent our country's core values: the value of inclusion, the value of nondiscrimination, and the value that our nation can be the beacon of hope for everyone regardless of the color of their skin. the institution of slavery destroyed families, killed millions, and formed the beginning of a systemic inequality faced by african americans today. that is what the confederacy sought to preserve when it seceded from our great nation. every time a confederate flag flies, whether it is the intent of the owner or not, that is what is being celebrated. mr. speaker, we need to take down the flag and we also need to have a serious conversation about gun violence. on behalf of congressman payne and me, i yield back the balance of my time. ms. eddie bernice johnson of texas. mr. speaker, i rise today with my colleagues of the congressional black caucus, to discuss tonight's cbc special order hour: ``the confederate battle flag: why symbols matter.'' i stand here today fully acknowledging that the eradication of this hurtful flag from state and federal grounds is only one step in fully addressing race relations in this country; but, just as so many of my cbc colleagues have stood on this very floor to exclaim that ``black lives matter,'' so too do symbols. symbols of hatred, institutionalized racism and white supremacy, they matter. symbols like the flags of apartheid south africa and rhodesia, embraced by dylann roof, the terrorist responsible for the unspeakable events at emmanuel ame church in charleston last month, mr. speaker, they matter. last week, the south carolina legislature voted overwhelmingly in favor of removing--once and for all--the confederate battle flag from their capitol grounds. i applaud the state of south carolina for this historic gesture and for the outstanding leadership necessary to ensure that this flag comes down in the aftermath of the ``emmanuel nine'' tragedy. i implore other southern states that still fly the battle flag on state grounds to follow suit and have the flag removed. as a member of congress, i pledge my support to any legislation that completely eradicates this symbol from all federal lands. to understand why the confederate battle flag has been offensive to millions of americans for so many years requires a proper framing of american history. the version of the confederate battle flag that most people are familiar with today was first used by the army of tennessee during the civil war. shortly thereafter, it became widely known as the symbol of the confederacy--eleven states who wished to secede from the union over the right to own slaves. for the many americans who deny a basic historical fact by refusing to believe that slavery was a central point of conflict in the civil war, i quote directly from the declaration of secession from my home state of texas: ``we hold as undeniable truths that the governments of the various states, and of the confederacy itself were established exclusively by the white race, for themselves and their posterity; that the african race had no agency in their establishment; that they were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race, and in that condition only could their existence in this country be rendered beneficial or tolerable.'' similarly, overt references to slavery as a motivation to secede from the union are also present in the declarations of secession of south carolina, georgia and mississippi. repeatedly, throughout the 20th century, the confederate battle flag flew as a symbol of direct defiance to advancements in civil rights. the flag was first displayed at the south carolina state capitol in 1938 after angry members of congress defeated a bill that would have made lynching a federal crime. in the 1940s, the flag became the symbol of the dixiecrats, the segregationist political faction birthed out of its firm stance against the civil rights agenda of the national democratic party of the time. members of the dixiecrats were faithfully devoted to maintaining the segregation of the jim crow south, many of [[page h5115]] whom stood on this very house floor decades ago, extolling the virtues of an american society that subjugated its black citizens. in 1962, the flag was raised to the dome of the south carolina state capitol after president kennedy called on congress to end poll taxes and literacy tests for voting, and the supreme court declared segregation in public transportation unconstitutional. the raising of the confederate battle flag flew as a symbol of resistance in south carolina to two landmark achievements of progress that our country relied on to move forward in its quest for racial equality. while the confederate battle flag may represent ``southern heritage'' to some, to millions of other americans it represents an opposition to the racial equality we still fight for today. this flag is a symbol of the painful history that this country has worked hard to overcome; and in order to continue moving forward, it is a symbol that we must finally put behind us.

Mr. Tom Price of Georgia: Mr. Speaker, pursuant to section 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I hereby submit for printing in the Congressional Record revisions to the aggregates and allocations set forth pursuant to the Fiscal Year 2016 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget Conference Report, S. Con. Res. 11. The revision is for new budget authority and outlays for provisions designated as program integrity initiatives, pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(B) and (C) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA), contained in H.R. 3020, the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016. S. Con. Res. 11 set the base discretionary 302(a) allocation to the Committee on Appropriations at $1,016,582 million, which is the sum of the fiscal year 2016 discretionary spending limits under section 251(c) of BBEDCA. Section 251(b) of BBEDCA allows for adjustments to the discretionary spending limits for certain purposes including overseas contingencies, disaster relief, and program integrity initiatives. H.R. 3020, the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016, contains $1,484 million in budget authority for program integrity initiatives, which is within the allowable limits for this purpose as established in section 251(b)(2)(B) and (C) of BBEDCA. Accordingly, I am submitting an adjustment to S. Con. Res. 11 for an additional $1,484 million in budget authority to accommodate program integrity funding contained in H.R. 3020. After making this adjustment, H.R. 3020 is within the fiscal year 2016 discretionary spending limits under section 251(c) of BBEDCA and the 302(a) allocation to the Committee on Appropriations established by S. Con. Res. 11. These revisions are provided for bills, joint resolutions, and amendments thereto or conference reports thereon, considered by the House subsequent to this filing, as applicable. For fiscal year 2016, aggregate levels of budget authority and outlays and the allocation to the Committee on Appropriations, established by S. Con. Res. 11, are revised. Associated tables are attached. This revision represents an adjustment for purposes of budgetary enforcement. The revised allocation is to be considered as an allocation included in the budget resolution pursuant to S. Con. Res. 11, as adjusted. Sincerely, Tom Price, M.D., Chairman, Committee on the Budget.

Madam President, cowboy poet Georgie Connell Sicking conveyed my feelings for the Nevada desert in her poem ``Nevada's Subtle Beauty.'' This picture I have in the Chamber has appeared all over the country. It appeared, for example, in the Washington Post a week or so ago, and there are other pictures that show this at more of a distance. The man there is so small compared to the vastness of the Nevada terrain. But here is what Georgie Sicking said in her poem: Have you gone outdoors one morning after a summer rain, With a gentle breeze blowing across a black sage valley And smelled the earthy sagey freshness, none like it on this earth. It sure makes life worth living, and you know when God was giving, He didn't short-change Nevada. Have you ever in the afternoon watched the mountains changing colors, From the shadows as they grow from brown and black to tan and violet, Or sometimes the deepest blue. Ever changing, ever different, they seem to smile, then frown, Waiting for sky colors to be added as the sun goes down. If these things I mention you have seen and felt and known, Beware, for Nevada has a hold on you and will claim you for her own. This is not Iowa terrain. It is very typical Nevada terrain, the deserts of Nevada. It is perfect. It is peaceful. It is the Nevada desert. It feels right. To me, it feels like home. Last Friday, President Obama permanently protected over 700,000 acres of land in Eastern Nevada as the Basin and Range National Monument, which photographer Tyler Roemer has captured beautifully in these pictures. The land President Obama designated as a monument--two basins and one range--is a perfect example of the stark beauty of the Nevada desert. This monument is an area where the Mojave Desert meets the Great Basin and Joshua trees and cactus give way to sagebrush. This monument is an area that is home to desert bighorn sheep, mule deer, elk, and pronghorn antelope. This monument is an area that provided food and shelter for Native Americans and is where one can see their history today in incredible rock art panels we call petroglyphs. This monument is an area that reflects the pioneering western history from early explorers to the ranching that still exists. Four or five years ago, I visited this area. I had been in the area but not here. I went there for a number of reasons. I had been informed of a five-decade-old art project in the middle of the vastness of this desert. While going to see this work of art, I also saw the unique beauty of the Nevada desert, and it is unique. After I completed my trip, in giving this a lot of thought and contemplation, I became passionate about doing something to protect and preserve this incredible work of art and the stark beauty of the desert, both of which are priceless. This picture is part of the City. This work of art has taken 48 years to construct. It is the size of the National Mall here. It is a couple miles long and very wide--almost a mile wide. It is something that is in the center of the Basin and Range National Monument. It is called the City. It is a grand modern art sculpture the size of, I repeat, the National Mall, part of which you can see in this photo from a group called the Triple Aught Foundation. The creator is internationally renowned artist Michael Heizer, who is known all over the world. He has been working on this project, as I indicated, since 1972. [[Page S4988]] The New York Times has called City ``the most ambitious sculpture anyone has ever built, one of those audacious improbable American dreams at the scale of the West, conceived for the ages.'' The canvas which makes up the background of his art is the untouched desert land of the Basin Range, which makes it all the more monumental. Hundreds and hundreds of people worked on this under the guidance of Michael Heizer. He has done remarkable stuff all over the world. The latest thing he did is in Los Angeles--in the middle of the city of Los Angeles at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. That is a big project, but it pales in comparison to this. What he did there, he moved a rock weighing 400 tons 102 miles through the cities of California. It is called Levitated Mass. The thing in L.A.--this 400-ton boulder--looks like it is suspended in space. It is not. But people walk under it. I talked very recently to the Los Angeles County Museum director, and he said this thing needs no advertising. People come to see this. And that is the same way this will be. This is a wonderful piece of art. One of the art critics for the Washington Post said it was the most-- and I am paraphrasing--significant piece of art in the last 50 years in America. When I first brought this up to President Obama, he said: Tell me what it is. Explain it to me. I said: I can't. How, Madam President, as you are presiding over this body, would you describe this? It is really hard to describe, and we are only seeing a tiny bit of this. It is 2 miles long and 1 mile wide, approximately. He has done amazing things. He has developed his own dirt. We have plenty of dirt in the desert, but he was afraid it would be washed away. This will never be washed away--the same up here. As I indicated, he has art projects all over the world, but he is from Nevada. He has spent a lot of his time in Nevada for the last 48 years, in addition to his other projects. So I am very happy this has happened in Nevada. By using his authority under the Antiquities Act, President Obama has helped preserve the life, history, and culture of Nevada--the land I love. Look at this. This has been preserved for my children, my grandchildren, their children, and their grandchildren. This is exquisite. Nevada is growing very rapidly. In the southern part of the State-- Las Vegas--there are about 3 million people now. People are traveling all over Nevada, and we don't have--even though it is a very large State--much unspoiled land, but this is something that has not been spoiled. There are no roads through it, no railroads, no power lines. This is beautiful, and I am so glad the President did this. As renowned journalist Steve Sebelius wrote in his Sunday column in the Las Vegas Review-Journal, ``Preserving the land from development was the right thing to do. History will bear that out, long after the wails of the disaffected have ceased to echo through the desert canyons of Nevada's newest monument.'' I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4987-S4988] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BASIN AND RANGE NATIONAL MONUMENT Mr. REID.

What he did there, he moved a rock weighing 400 tons 102 miles through the cities of California. It is called Levitated Mass. The thing in L.A.--this 400-ton boulder--looks like it is suspended in space. It is not. But people walk under it. I talked very recently to the Los Angeles County Museum director, and he said this thing needs no advertising. People come to see this. And that is the same way this will be. This is a wonderful piece of art. One of the art critics for the Washington Post said it was the most-- and I am paraphrasing--significant piece of art in the last 50 years in America. When I first brought this up to President Obama, he said: Tell me what it is. Explain it to me. I said: I can't. How, Madam President, as you are presiding over this body, would you describe this? It is really hard to describe, and we are only seeing a tiny bit of this. It is 2 miles long and 1 mile wide, approximately. He has done amazing things. He has developed his own dirt. We have plenty of dirt in the desert, but he was afraid it would be washed away. This will never be washed away--the same up here. As I indicated, he has art projects all over the world, but he is from Nevada. He has spent a lot of his time in Nevada for the last 48 years, in addition to his other projects. So I am very happy this has happened in Nevada. By using his authority under the Antiquities Act, President Obama has helped preserve the life, history, and culture of Nevada--the land I love. Look at this. This has been preserved for my children, my grandchildren, their children, and their grandchildren. This is exquisite. Nevada is growing very rapidly. In the southern part of the State-- Las Vegas--there are about 3 million people now. People are traveling all over Nevada, and we don't have--even though it is a very large State--much unspoiled land, but this is something that has not been spoiled. There are no roads through it, no railroads, no power lines. This is beautiful, and I am so glad the President did this. As renowned journalist Steve Sebelius wrote in his Sunday column in the Las Vegas Review-Journal, ``Preserving the land from development was the right thing to do. History will bear that out, long after the wails of the disaffected have ceased to echo through the desert canyons of Nevada's newest monument.'' I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, cowboy poet Georgie Connell Sicking conveyed my feelings for the Nevada desert in her poem ``Nevada's Subtle Beauty.'' This picture I have in the Chamber has appeared all over the country. It appeared, for example, in the Washington Post a week or so ago, and there are other pictures that show this at more of a distance. The man there is so small compared to the vastness of the Nevada terrain. But here is what Georgie Sicking said in her poem: Have you gone outdoors one morning after a summer rain, With a gentle breeze blowing across a black sage valley And smelled the earthy sagey freshness, none like it on this earth. It sure makes life worth living, and you know when God was giving, He didn't short-change Nevada. Have you ever in the afternoon watched the mountains changing colors, From the shadows as they grow from brown and black to tan and violet, Or sometimes the deepest blue. Ever changing, ever different, they seem to smile, then frown, Waiting for sky colors to be added as the sun goes down. If these things I mention you have seen and felt and known, Beware, for Nevada has a hold on you and will claim you for her own. This is not Iowa terrain. It is very typical Nevada terrain, the deserts of Nevada. It is perfect. It is peaceful. It is the Nevada desert. It feels right. To me, it feels like home. Last Friday, President Obama permanently protected over 700,000 acres of land in Eastern Nevada as the Basin and Range National Monument, which photographer Tyler Roemer has captured beautifully in these pictures. The land President Obama designated as a monument--two basins and one range--is a perfect example of the stark beauty of the Nevada desert. This monument is an area where the Mojave Desert meets the Great Basin and Joshua trees and cactus give way to sagebrush. This monument is an area that is home to desert bighorn sheep, mule deer, elk, and pronghorn antelope. This monument is an area that provided food and shelter for Native Americans and is where one can see their history today in incredible rock art panels we call petroglyphs. This monument is an area that reflects the pioneering western history from early explorers to the ranching that still exists. Four or five years ago, I visited this area. I had been in the area but not here. I went there for a number of reasons. I had been informed of a five-decade-old art project in the middle of the vastness of this desert. While going to see this work of art, I also saw the unique beauty of the Nevada desert, and it is unique. After I completed my trip, in giving this a lot of thought and contemplation, I became passionate about doing something to protect and preserve this incredible work of art and the stark beauty of the desert, both of which are priceless. This picture is part of the City. This work of art has taken 48 years to construct. It is the size of the National Mall here. It is a couple miles long and very wide--almost a mile wide. It is something that is in the center of the Basin and Range National Monument. It is called the City. It is a grand modern art sculpture the size of, I repeat, the National Mall, part of which you can see in this photo from a group called the Triple Aught Foundation. The creator is internationally renowned artist Michael Heizer, who is known all over the world. He has been working on this project, as I indicated, since 1972. [[Page S4988]] The New York Times has called City ``the most ambitious sculpture anyone has ever built, one of those audacious improbable American dreams at the scale of the West, conceived for the ages.'' The canvas which makes up the background of his art is the untouched desert land of the Basin Range, which makes it all the more monumental. Hundreds and hundreds of people worked on this under the guidance of Michael Heizer. He has done remarkable stuff all over the world. The latest thing he did is in Los Angeles--in the middle of the city of Los Angeles at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. That is a big project, but it pales in comparison to this.

Madam President, over the Fourth of July recess, I joined with Senator Bill Nelson and we went to Haiti. It is not a popular spot for Members of Congress to go on a weekend, but we made a point of going. It was a return trip for both of us. Our visit the first time was 5 years ago, after the devastating earthquake that left the capital city of Port au Prince in ruins, claimed more than 200,000 lives, and more than 1 million people were displaced from their homes. I recall visiting the island that many years ago, 2 years after the earthquake, and witnessing the ongoing devastation--people still living in tents. So it was with some satisfaction to see that Haiti has come a long way. Buildings are being rebuilt, the overwhelming majority of those displaced have found housing, and the economy is starting to recover. The United States has been a major contributor to Haiti's recovery, and I want to praise the dedicated American Government officials who work in a challenging environment--notably under the incredible and tireless and amazing leadership of our U.S. Ambassador in Haiti, Pam White, a career employee of USAID and now our Nation's Ambassador to Haiti. I noted that the Senate recently confirmed a couple of President Obama's nominees to become Ambassadors. There are now dozens still waiting. Can you imagine the United States of America in our Embassies overseas with no Ambassador month after month after month, when worthy people have been nominated and the U.S. Senate refuses to even consider an Obama nomination for Ambassador? Many of these are not political. They are career. They spent their career working in the State Department. Now, at the end of their career, they are named Ambassador, and the Foreign Relations Committee in the Senate, under Republican leadership, refuses to call President Obama's nominees for these ambassadorial posts. In many countries, the foreign minister in those countries counts the days and weeks that the United States has not had an ambassador. It is an embarrassment. I hope the majority party now will at least give the President and our Nation the opportunity to put good representatives of our countries overseas. Madam President, I wish to say a few words about the current President of Haiti, whose term ends this year. His name is Michel Joseph Martelly. He is known as Sweet Micky, which used to be his stage name when he was a rock and roll singer. He has now been the President 4\1/2\ years and has done some very good things. He wisely guided his nation through the post-earthquake process and a lot of political change. The end of his term marks an important moment for Haiti and its future. Given that the Haitian Parliament dissolved in January, the success and timeliness of these elections cannot be overstated. I urge the political parties and candidates to renounce the use of electoral violence and to participate constructively in the upcoming election. And I hope that the neighboring country, the Dominican Republic, will join with Haiti in resolving some very vexing immigration problems between these two countries. These are problems which involve some of the poorest people on that island of Hispaniola. We need to find a way to treat them in a decent and humane fashion so they can ultimately be located in a place where they can maintain their dignity and their work. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S4989] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HAITI Mr. DURBIN.

CREC-2015-07-13-pt1-PgS4988,CREC-2015-07-13,114,SALUTING CVS HEALTH,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4988-S4989] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SALUTING CVS HEALTH Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the No. 1 preventable cause of death in America today: tobacco. People who use tobacco--smoking or chewing-- develop a myriad of health problems, and many die prematurely. Tobacco companies are a big business in America. They have been for a long time. And they really try their best to recruit new customers when they go into junior high and high schools. Now they are in the e- cigarette business too, but I want to stick with tobacco for a moment. The notion, of course, is, if you can addict a child to nicotine, they will continue to smoke and eventually become a lifelong user of tobacco products. It has been a long time since I have engaged this industry in political contest. It was a little over 25 years ago when I was a Member of the House of Representatives that I boarded an airplane in Phoenix, AZ, at the last minute--a United airplane. I went to the ticket counter and said to the woman at the counter: Can I get on this plane? She said: If you hurry, you can get on there. Here is where you are going to be seated. And I said: Wait a minute. This is in the smoking section of the airplane and you have me in a center seat in the smoking section. Isn't there something you can do? She looked at my ticket and said: No, Congressman, there is something you can do. So I got on that plane and flew from Phoenix to Chicago in the smoking section of the airplane--there used to be such things--and thought to myself: This is madness. Here I sit, a nonsmoker, breathing in all this secondhand smoke, and there is an elderly person in the so- called nonsmoking section two rows away, and there is a lady with a baby, and why in the world do we have to be subjected to this? So I came back to Washington and introduced a bill in the House of Representatives to ban smoking on airplanes. After a lot of work and a lot of good luck, I found out that the largest frequent flyer club in America--the House of Representatives--did not much like smoking on airplanes either, and I won--it surprised a lot of people--beat the tobacco lobby. I called my friend Frank Lautenberg, the Senator from New Jersey, and asked him if he would take up the cause in the Senate. He did it masterfully. The two of us passed the law and changed the way America looked at smoking on airplanes. Neither Senator Lautenberg nor I knew this was a tipping point in history. I did not know it. But people started thinking: If secondhand smoke is dangerous on an airplane, why isn't it dangerous on a train, in a bus, in an office building, in a hospital, in a restaurant? Today, 25-plus years later, if you walked into someone's office on Capitol Hill and they had an ashtray in the middle of the table, you would think: What are they thinking? People do not do that anymore. It used to be standard and no one thought twice about lighting up. That was just your personal preference. Things have changed in America, and the number of people using tobacco products has declined because they have come to understand it is dangerous, it can kill you. But we are not the only country on Earth that has figured this out. Many other countries are ahead of us in terms of regulating tobacco. If you travel overseas, take a look at cigarette packages. Ours still look pretty fancy. They have a little label on them. But in other countries, the cigarette packages are very stark and very limited in what they can say about the product. Most of what they contain are health care warnings: Tobacco can kill you. Tobacco can harm a fetus in a pregnant woman. These stark reminders are to discourage people from using tobacco products because countries overseas, just like the United States, understand how dangerous they are. So it was in that context that I was amazed to read something a few weeks ago. The New York Times published a devastating series of articles on how the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has been playing a global strategy to fight against effective tobacco control laws in other countries--the U.S. Chamber of Commerce fighting tobacco control laws in other countries. Why would the U.S. Chamber of Commerce--once considered a pillar of the American business community--be a champion promoting the sale and consumption of a deadly tobacco product in another country? It does not compute. One reason? The power, the money, and the influence of Big Tobacco is still very strong. The stories and letters published by the New York Times made it clear that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has effectively rented out its letterhead to the tobacco industry, jeopardizing not only the reputation of the Chamber but all the member companies that belong to it. [[Page S4989]] I stand here today to salute one company that has fought back at this revelation of this activity by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. CVS Health--you know them from their drugstores and pharmacies--announced it was going to quit the U.S. Chamber of Commerce because the Chamber's efforts to promote tobacco conflict with the CVS corporate policy that decided over a year ago to stop selling tobacco products in their drugstores. I congratulate CVS Health. It is pretty bold when they decide they are going to walk out on the U.S. Chamber of Commerce because of these rotten policies they have in discouraging tobacco control overseas. Maybe this decision by CVS will give the Chamber of Commerce a reason to think twice about a policy that is going to result in deadly addictions and terrible disease. It should. The Chamber should end this insidious campaign as quickly as possible. Without question, CVS Health has shown again, as they did last year, that protecting the public health is good business and it is essential to good, responsible corporate citizenship. The World Health Organization estimates that tobacco kills more than 6 million people worldwide every year. In the 21st century, 1 billion people--1 billion--are expected to die as a result of tobacco. And many of these deaths are in the poorest nations on Earth--8 out of 10 of today's smokers living in low-income and middle-income countries. It is unconscionable that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is going after the laws to protect the people in these poor countries. More than a decade ago, the World Health Organization adopted an international treaty focused on reducing tobacco consumption. This treaty, supported by 180 countries, obligates nations to employ practices to reduce tobacco use. We have made a lot of progress in the last 10 years. Madam President, 49 countries have passed comprehensive smoke-free laws protecting over 1 billion people. Madam President, 42 countries have strong, graphic warning labels, covering almost 20 percent of the population that buys these products. These policies save lives and prevent cancer, heart disease, and lung cancer. It is hard to imagine how the U.S. Chamber of Commerce can rationalize policies that literally promote the death of innocent people from the use of tobacco. Hats off to the CVS Health corporation for stepping up and showing responsible corporate citizenship in resigning from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Maybe if the U.S. Chamber of Commerce comes to its senses, CVS might consider rejoining it. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4988-S4989] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SALUTING CVS HEALTH Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the No. 1 preventable cause of death in America today: tobacco. People who use tobacco--smoking or chewing-- develop a myriad of health problems, and many die prematurely. Tobacco companies are a big business in America. They have been for a long time. And they really try their best to recruit new customers when they go into junior high and high schools. Now they are in the e- cigarette business too, but I want to stick with tobacco for a moment. The notion, of course, is, if you can addict a child to nicotine, they will continue to smoke and eventually become a lifelong user of tobacco products. It has been a long time since I have engaged this industry in political contest. It was a little over 25 years ago when I was a Member of the House of Representatives that I boarded an airplane in Phoenix, AZ, at the last minute--a United airplane. I went to the ticket counter and said to the woman at the counter: Can I get on this plane? She said: If you hurry, you can get on there. Here is where you are going to be seated. And I said: Wait a minute. This is in the smoking section of the airplane and you have me in a center seat in the smoking section. Isn't there something you can do? She looked at my ticket and said: No, Congressman, there is something you can do. So I got on that plane and flew from Phoenix to Chicago in the smoking section of the airplane--there used to be such things--and thought to myself: This is madness. Here I sit, a nonsmoker, breathing in all this secondhand smoke, and there is an elderly person in the so- called nonsmoking section two rows away, and there is a lady with a baby, and why in the world do we have to be subjected to this? So I came back to Washington and introduced a bill in the House of Representatives to ban smoking on airplanes. After a lot of work and a lot of good luck, I found out that the largest frequent flyer club in America--the House of Representatives--did not much like smoking on airplanes either, and I won--it surprised a lot of people--beat the tobacco lobby. I called my friend Frank Lautenberg, the Senator from New Jersey, and asked him if he would take up the cause in the Senate. He did it masterfully. The two of us passed the law and changed the way America looked at smoking on airplanes. Neither Senator Lautenberg nor I knew this was a tipping point in history. I did not know it. But people started thinking: If secondhand smoke is dangerous on an airplane, why isn't it dangerous on a train, in a bus, in an office building, in a hospital, in a restaurant? Today, 25-plus years later, if you walked into someone's office on Capitol Hill and they had an ashtray in the middle of the table, you would think: What are they thinking? People do not do that anymore. It used to be standard and no one thought twice about lighting up. That was just your personal preference.

Madam President, on the floor now when we return for debate is the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which has been named the Every Child Achieves Act, and is before the Senate this week. We may finish it. The issue is our opportunity on a periodic basis to debate the future of K-12 education in America. Millions of Americans follow this debate. It affects their local schools and school districts. It was under President George W. Bush that there was an amazing bill passed called the No Child Left Behind Act. What was amazing, politically, was that President Bush--a Republican and a conservative-- called for a larger role by the Federal Government in evaluating school districts and teachers and in deciding whether they were succeeding. It was controversial from the start. Ultimately, we have moved away from it. This new bill takes a much different approach. Instead of testing, testing, testing and grading school districts, we are basically shifting the responsibility back to the States to do this. It remains to be seen whether this is or will be an improvement. We learned a lot under No Child Left Behind when we took a close look at test scores. To say what the average test score is at a school meant very little--or nothing--when we broke out the students at the school and found out that some were doing exceedingly well and some not so well at all. We could find groups of students--some minority groups, for example--who were not doing very well at school, but the other kids might have brought the scores up. So now, by disaggregating scores, we can target our efforts and make sure that some students have a fighting chance. It remains to be seen, under this Every Child Achieves Act, whether we have gone far enough or too far in shifting the responsibility back to the States. I will mention very briefly, because I see my friend and colleague from Vermont on the floor, that there is one amendment here that I have offered with Senator Capito. This bipartisan amendment would require States to include information on their State report cards about postsecondary enrollment rates at public and State institutions. It will allow States to go further and include information on private, public, [[Page S4990]] and out-of-State enrollment as well. It would encourage States to produce and publish data on remediation rates on students, so we can better understand which high schools are truly preparing their students for postsecondary education. Much of the data is already collected by the States. So the additional burden would be minimal. Ensuring students coming out of high school are college and career ready is an important goal of the bill. Our commonsense bipartisan amendment would help track whether that goal is being met. The amendment is supported by the Business Roundtable, Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, Education Trust, National Center for Learning Disabilities, National Council of La Raza, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and America Forward. There is one other amendment I have, and I will close on this. When it relates to high school athletics, many of us are concerned about the incidents of concussions occurring in sporting events. I filed an amendment based on my Protecting Student Athletes from Concussions Act. It is supported by the American Academy of Neurology, American College of Sports Medicine, Illinois High School Association, NCAA, Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, National Football League, National Hockey League, and many others. It directs States to develop concussion safety plans for public schools to protect student athletes from this dangerous injury. Most importantly, it would require the adoption of a ``when in doubt, sit it out'' policy, promoted by the medical community. This means that a student athlete suspected of a concussion would be removed from play and prohibited from returning to play that same day, no matter what. It doesn't make any difference how much he pleads or what the score of the game is or who is sitting in the stands. If you think you have evidence of a concussion, be safe. Don't put that student athlete back on the field. It would take the decision on when to put an injured athlete back in the game out of the hands of the coach, the athlete, and the parents. While I don't believe we will be able to get the adoption of the full amendment, I am pleased that a substitute includes a clear statement that allows funds to be used to develop these policies. I thank Chairman Alexander and Senator Murray for working with us to include that. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont. Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, my dear friend, the senior Senator from Kansas, is going to speak next, but he has graciously allowed me to have the very few minutes I asked for, and then he will be recognized as soon as I give my statement. (The remarks of Mr. Leahy pertaining to the submission of S. Res. 222 are printed in today's Record under ``Submitted Resolutions.'') Mr. LEAHY. I yield the floor, and I thank the Senator from Kansas. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas. Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I thank my colleague. I hope he gets better from his cold. He did our sports presentation for us this morning. Maybe he could do the sports news for us every morning. Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield, it is not a cold. There are a few more pollens in the air that we Vermonters are not used to. Mr. ROBERTS. I understand. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4989-S4990] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EVERY CHILD ACHIEVES ACT Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, on the floor now when we return for debate is the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which has been named the Every Child Achieves Act, and is before the Senate this week. We may finish it. The issue is our opportunity on a periodic basis to debate the future of K-12 education in America. Millions of Americans follow this debate. It affects their local schools and school districts. It was under President George W. Bush that there was an amazing bill passed called the No Child Left Behind Act. What was amazing, politically, was that President Bush--a Republican and a conservative-- called for a larger role by the Federal Government in evaluating school districts and teachers and in deciding whether they were succeeding. It was controversial from the start. Ultimately, we have moved away from it. This new bill takes a much different approach. Instead of testing, testing, testing and grading school districts, we are basically shifting the responsibility back to the States to do this. It remains to be seen whether this is or will be an improvement. We learned a lot under No Child Left Behind when we took a close look at test scores. To say what the average test score is at a school meant very little--or nothing--when we broke out the students at the school and found out that some were doing exceedingly well and some not so well at all. We could find groups of students--some minority groups, for example--who were not doing very well at school, but the other kids might have brought the scores up. So now, by disaggregating scores, we can target our efforts and make sure that some students have a fighting chance. It remains to be seen, under this Every Child Achieves Act, whether we have gone far enough or too far in shifting the responsibility back to the States. I will mention very briefly, because I see my friend and colleague from Vermont on the floor, that there is one amendment here that I have offered with Senator Capito. This bipartisan amendment would require States to include information on their State report cards about postsecondary enrollment rates at public and State institutions. It will allow States to go further and include information on private, public, [[Page S4990]] and out-of-State enrollment as well. It would encourage States to produce and publish data on remediation rates on students, so we can better understand which high schools are truly preparing their students for postsecondary education. Much of the data is already collected by the States. So the additional burden would be minimal. Ensuring students coming out of high school are college and career ready is an important goal of the bill. Our commonsense bipartisan amendment would help track whether that goal is being met. The amendment is supported by the Business Roundtable, Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, Education Trust, National Center for Learning Disabilities, National Council of La Raza, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and America Forward. There is one other amendment I have, and I will close on this. When it relates to high school athletics, many of us are concerned about the incidents of concussions occurring in sporting events. I filed an amendment based on my Protecting Student Athletes from Concussions Act. It is supported by the American Academy of Neurology, American College of Sports Medicine, Illinois High School Association, NCAA, Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, National Football League, National Hockey League, and many others. It directs States to develop concussion safety plans for public schools to protect student athletes from this dangerous injury. Most importantly, it would require the adoption of a ``when in doubt, sit it out'' policy, promoted by the medical community. This means that a student athlete suspected of a concussion would be removed from play and prohibited from returning to play that same day, no matter what.

CREC-2015-07-13-pt1-PgS4990,CREC-2015-07-13,114,EVERY CHILD ACHIEVES ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4990-S4991] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EVERY CHILD ACHIEVES ACT Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I rise to talk about the bill we have before us today. We in the Senate have a unique opportunity long overdue and a responsibility to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The acronym is ESEA. This legislation is long overdue. It is vital for our children and their future that we get it right when addressing education policy. The consequences will be seen for years to come. I would like to acknowledge and especially commend the work of Chairman Lamar Alexander and Ranking Member Patty Murray, who worked so hard to get us to this point. This is something rather unique in the Senate. We are coming together. We are percolating with regards to important bills. This is a tremendously important bill. Due to their bipartisan leadership, the Every Child Achieves Act was approved back in April by the HELP Committee, of which I am a proud member, 22 to 0. I was very proud to vote yes. Let me repeat that. It passed 22 to 0. Because of that hard work, led by Senators Alexander and Murray, we are currently debating ESEA in the Senate for the first time since 2001. That is 14 years--14 years--that we have not had a reauthorization bill come to the Senate floor, and there is a lot of hope that it will pass. This is a prime example of what is possible when the Senate functions as it should and committees are actually able to legislate. Recently, 10 national education groups, representing educators, principals, school boards, superintendents, chief State school officers, parents and PTAs, and school business officials, called on the Senate to consider the Every Child Achieves Act to reauthorize the ESEA. Daniel Domenech, executive director of the School Superintendents Association, wrote this in a letter: The nation's K-6th graders have spent every day of their K- 12 experience under an outdated and broken ESEA. Our students want and deserve more. His remarks perfectly summarize the issues at hand. I want to turn to a critical issue for States and school districts. Over the last few years, the administration has doubled down on Federal mandates and has used the waiver process to create law by fiat--thereby circumventing Congress and allowing those who have a Federal agenda in Washington to make too many decisions that are best left to the States and the school districts. It is evident that waivers have been granted only to those States that agree to implement the administration's preferred education policies. That is just not right. In fact, the New York Times has referred to the waiver process as ``the most sweeping use of executive authority to rewrite Federal education law since Washington expanded its involvement in education in the 1960s.'' Under section 9401 of current law, the ``Secretary may waive any statutory or regulatory requirement of this Act for a state education agency, local education agency, Indian tribe or school'' if that entity receives funds and requests a waiver. Language included in the Every Child Achieves Act amends section 9401 to clarify that the waiver process is intended to be led by State and local requests, not Washington mandates. This will help ensure the process is State-driven and will allow for greater flexibility and innovation. In July 2011, the Congressional Research Service issued a report providing an overview of the Secretary's waiver authority under ESEA and warned of potential legal limits and challenges to the Secretary's flexibility proposal. The report states: ``If the Secretary did, as a condition of granting a waiver, require a grantee to take another action not currently required under the ESEA, the likelihood of a successful legal challenge will increase.'' I have worked long and hard for language in the bill--years and years--that will prohibit the Secretary from imposing any additional requirements to waiver requests not authorized by the Congress. I am fully committed to fighting this one-size-fits-all Federal education agenda because I firmly believe local control is best when it comes to education. The Every Child Achieves Act, in its current form, puts an end to Washington mandates and allows Kansans to make their own decisions about the best way to improve education. While this legislation heads in the right direction in reducing the Federal footprint, I want to remind my colleagues it is important that we avoid adding back Federal mandates and prescriptive requirements. As we move forward, I will continue to push to return K-12 education decision-making to State and local control, where we can establish the best policies to ensure that every child receives the highest quality education. Now, I would like to briefly discuss something called Common Core and the Federal overreach in education. Common Core started out as a State- [[Page S4991]] led effort to create high standards that States would voluntarily adopt, but the administration had different ideas. In homes across America, parents are raising questions about what their children are being taught. In many cases, parents are hearing that local curriculum decisions have been driven by the Common Core education standards that most States adopted in a hurry under Federal pressure with little or no public input. Decisions about what children are taught are best made on the local level as close to parents as possible. The Federal Government should not have overriding influence over State and local education decisions. Simply put, the Department of Education has incentivized and coerced States into implementing Common Core education standards. Some within our education community in Kansas have even called this practice a bribe. The administration made it a criterion for States to adopt Common Core standards to have a reasonable chance to receive Federal funding under the multibillion-dollar Race to the Top Program and used Federal funds to develop Common Core-aligned tests. They have also threatened to withhold waivers from the onerous provisions of the No Child Left Behind Act if States do not adopt Common Core or similarly aligned standards and assessments. This is wrong. For that reason, earlier this year, I reintroduced the LOCAL Level Act, S. 182, to explicitly prohibit the Federal Government's role and involvement in Common Core. My legislation would strictly forbid the Federal Government from intervening in a State's education standards, its curricula, and assessments through the use of incentives, mandates, grants, waivers or any form of manipulation. Simply put, my legislation will preserve State education autonomy. A State will now be free from Federal interference in how to decide whether to use Common Core or any other type of academic standard. I am pleased the bill before us includes the language from my LOCAL Level Act and will, once and for all, end the administration's use of waivers to force or incentivize States to adopt Common Core standards. It will end the Obama administration's--and, for that matter, any future administration's--ability to use any tool of coercion to force States to adopt Common Core or any set of standards at all, whether it is Common Core by another name or some new set of standards--period. I thank Chairman Alexander for including my language because I firmly believe it will prohibit the administration from finding additional ways to promote a State's adoption of Common Core. I want to emphasize setting high standards for our schools, our teachers, and our children obviously is the right thing to do. But we will decide those standards in Kansas, and those decisions will be made in other States as well. We need to get the Federal Government out of the classroom and return our community decisions back to where they belong--in the community. If the Every Child Achieves Act becomes law, we can finally say goodbye to Federal interference in what we teach our kids in school. Chairman Alexander has stated that with this bill, we have the first opportunity in 25 years to restore decision-making back to States, local school districts, superintendents, principals and teachers, local school boards, parents, and especially the students. He is right. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia. Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I rise to express my strong support for the Every Child Achieves Act that is pending before the Senate. I want to commend Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray for working in such a great bipartisan fashion that brought this bill to the floor that will improve the quality of education for children across our country. The Every Child Achieves Act puts States and local officials back in control of our local schools. As we heard from the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Roberts, his hard work on this bill also stops the Department of Education from conditioning Federal funding on the adoption of national standards like Common Core. Importantly, this bill also makes sure parents and taxpayers continue to have access to important information about how the schools in their communities are performing. The Every Child Achieves Act deserves the Senate's support this week. Last week, the Senate unanimously adopted an amendment that will allow community school programs the flexibility to use Federal funds to pay for a site resource coordinator at their school or local education agency. This is important to the State of West Virginia. We have community schools. Community school programs provide important health, nutrition, and other key services for many of our West Virginia students who are, unfortunately, living in poverty. The amendment passed last week will allow those programs to better coordinate with community partners to provide resources and support for our children in need. I was happy to work with Senator Brown and my fellow Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Manchin, to see that that amendment passed. I also want to talk briefly about a bipartisan amendment I introduced with Senator Durbin--he spoke about it a few minutes ago on the floor-- that takes important steps to create transparency for students and families. It does so by allowing students and parents to know the quality and progress of their schools as it relates to college readiness. This amendment will require States and local educational agencies to include postsecondary enrollment data on the existing report card measures that are included in the Every Child Achieves Act. It also encourages the inclusion of data on postsecondary remediation. It is supported by dozens of organizations, including the College Summit, the Business Roundtable, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, because this amendment seeks to improve the education outcomes of our students. Parents and students alike deserve to know they are being adequately prepared to enter and succeed in postsecondary education. Including these simple, easy-to-understand measures on State and local report cards will provide them with the information they need to make informed choices about their future education. Additionally, the data will help States and school districts target limited resources to the schools that need it most. This amendment was carefully crafted to avoid putting onerous and additional burdens on our schools and States. Nearly all States already have made the investments necessary to collect, link, and report this data. In fact, the majority of States are already reporting it. Currently, 40 States produce high school feedback reports that include postsecondary enrollment data. More than 30 States already include some measure of postsecondary success, such as remediation rates. Adding postsecondary enrollment and remediation rates to existing report card measures included in Every Child Achieves Act would make sure students, parents, educators, and policymakers have access to critical information about how well our high schools are preparing students to enter and succeed in postsecondary education. The end result will be successfully restoring decisionmaking to those who know best--the students and their parents. I urge everyone to support this amendment and also to support the bill. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4990-S4991] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EVERY CHILD ACHIEVES ACT Mr. ROBERTS.

Madam President, I rise to talk about the bill we have before us today. We in the Senate have a unique opportunity long overdue and a responsibility to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The acronym is ESEA. This legislation is long overdue. It is vital for our children and their future that we get it right when addressing education policy. The consequences will be seen for years to come. I would like to acknowledge and especially commend the work of Chairman Lamar Alexander and Ranking Member Patty Murray, who worked so hard to get us to this point. This is something rather unique in the Senate. We are coming together. We are percolating with regards to important bills. This is a tremendously important bill. Due to their bipartisan leadership, the Every Child Achieves Act was approved back in April by the HELP Committee, of which I am a proud member, 22 to 0. I was very proud to vote yes. Let me repeat that. It passed 22 to 0. Because of that hard work, led by Senators Alexander and Murray, we are currently debating ESEA in the Senate for the first time since 2001. That is 14 years--14 years--that we have not had a reauthorization bill come to the Senate floor, and there is a lot of hope that it will pass. This is a prime example of what is possible when the Senate functions as it should and committees are actually able to legislate. Recently, 10 national education groups, representing educators, principals, school boards, superintendents, chief State school officers, parents and PTAs, and school business officials, called on the Senate to consider the Every Child Achieves Act to reauthorize the ESEA. Daniel Domenech, executive director of the School Superintendents Association, wrote this in a letter: The nation's K-6th graders have spent every day of their K- 12 experience under an outdated and broken ESEA. Our students want and deserve more. His remarks perfectly summarize the issues at hand. I want to turn to a critical issue for States and school districts. Over the last few years, the administration has doubled down on Federal mandates and has used the waiver process to create law by fiat--thereby circumventing Congress and allowing those who have a Federal agenda in Washington to make too many decisions that are best left to the States and the school districts. It is evident that waivers have been granted only to those States that agree to implement the administration's preferred education policies. That is just not right. In fact, the New York Times has referred to the waiver process as ``the most sweeping use of executive authority to rewrite Federal education law since Washington expanded its involvement in education in the 1960s.'' Under section 9401 of current law, the ``Secretary may waive any statutory or regulatory requirement of this Act for a state education agency, local education agency, Indian tribe or school'' if that entity receives funds and requests a waiver. Language included in the Every Child Achieves Act amends section 9401 to clarify that the waiver process is intended to be led by State and local requests, not Washington mandates. This will help ensure the process is State-driven and will allow for greater flexibility and innovation. In July 2011, the Congressional Research Service issued a report providing an overview of the Secretary's waiver authority under ESEA and warned of potential legal limits and challenges to the Secretary's flexibility proposal. The report states: ``If the Secretary did, as a condition of granting a waiver, require a grantee to take another action not currently required under the ESEA, the likelihood of a successful legal challenge will increase.'' I have worked long and hard for language in the bill--years and years--that will prohibit the Secretary from imposing any additional requirements to waiver requests not authorized by the Congress. I am fully committed to fighting this one-size-fits-all Federal education agenda because I firmly believe local control is best when it comes to education. The Every Child Achieves Act, in its current form, puts an end to Washington mandates and allows Kansans to make their own decisions about the best way to improve education. While this legislation heads in the right direction in reducing the Federal footprint, I want to remind my colleagues it is important that we avoid adding back Federal mandates and prescriptive requirements. As we move forward, I will continue to push to return K-12 education decision-making to State and local control, where we can establish the best policies to ensure that every child receives the highest quality education. Now, I would like to briefly discuss something called Common Core and the Federal overreach in education. Common Core started out as a State- [[Page S4991]] led effort to create high standards that States would voluntarily adopt, but the administration had different ideas. In homes across America, parents are raising questions about what their children are being taught. In many cases, parents are hearing that local curriculum decisions have been driven by the Common Core education standards that most States adopted in a hurry under Federal pressure with little or no public input. Decisions about what children are taught are best made on the local level as close to parents as possible. The Federal Government should not have overriding influence over State and local education decisions. Simply put, the Department of Education has incentivized and coerced States into implementing Common Core education standards. Some within our education community in Kansas have even called this practice a bribe. The administration made it a criterion for States to adopt Common Core standards to have a reasonable chance to receive Federal funding under the multibillion-dollar Race to the Top Program and used Federal funds to develop Common Core-aligned tests. They have also threatened to withhold waivers from the onerous provisions of the No Child Left Behind Act if States do not adopt Common Core or similarly aligned standards and assessments. This is wrong. For that reason, earlier this year, I reintroduced the LOCAL Level Act, S. 182, to explicitly prohibit the Federal Government's role and involvement in Common Core. My legislation would strictly forbid the Federal Government from intervening in a State's education standards, its curricula, and assessments through the use of incentives, mandates, grants, waivers or any form of manipulation. Simply put, my legislation will preserve State education autonomy. A State will now be free from Federal interference in how to decide whether to use Common Core or any other type of academic standard. I am pleased the bill before us includes the language from my LOCAL Level Act and will, once and for all, end the administration's use of waivers to force or incentivize States to adopt Common Core standards. It will end the Obama administration's--and, for that matter, any future administration's--ability to use any tool of coercion to force States to adopt Common Core or any set of standards at all, whether it is Common Core by another name or some new set of standards--period. I thank Chairman Alexander for including my language because I firmly believe it will prohibit the administration from finding additional ways to promote a State's adoption of Common Core. I want to emphasize setting high standards for our schools, our teachers, and our children obviously is the right thing to do. But we will decide those standards in Kansas, and those decisions will be made in other States as well. We need to get the Federal Government out of the classroom and return our community decisions back to where they belong--in the community. If the Every Child Achieves Act becomes law, we can finally say goodbye to Federal interference in what we teach our kids in school. Chairman Alexander has stated that with this bill, we have the first opportunity in 25 years to restore decision-making back to States, local school districts, superintendents, principals and teachers, local school boards, parents, and especially the students. He is right. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia. Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I rise to express my strong support for the Every Child Achieves Act that is pending before the Senate. I want to commend Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray for working in such a great bipartisan fashion that brought this bill to the floor that will improve the quality of education for children across our country. The Every Child Achieves Act puts States and local officials back in control of our local schools. As we heard from the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Roberts, his hard work on this bill also stops the Department of Education from conditioning Federal funding on the adoption of national standards like Common Core. Importantly, this bill also makes sure parents and taxpayers continue to have access to important information about how the schools in their communities are performing. The Every Child Achieves Act deserves the Senate's support this week. Last week, the Senate unanimously adopted an amendment that will allow community school programs the flexibility to use Federal funds to pay for a site resource coordinator at their school or local education agency. This is important to the State of West Virginia. We have community schools. Community school programs provide important health, nutrition, and other key services for many of our West Virginia students who are, unfortunately, living in poverty. The amendment passed last week will allow those programs to better coordinate with community partners to provide resources and support for our children in need. I was happy to work with Senator Brown and my fellow Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Manchin, to see that that amendment passed. I also want to talk briefly about a bipartisan amendment I introduced with Senator Durbin--he spoke about it a few minutes ago on the floor-- that takes important steps to create transparency for students and families. It does so by allowing students and parents to know the quality and progress of their schools as it relates to college readiness. This amendment will require States and local educational agencies to include postsecondary enrollment data on the existing report card measures that are included in the Every Child Achieves Act. It also encourages the inclusion of data on postsecondary remediation. It is supported by dozens of organizations, including the College Summit, the Business Roundtable, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, because this amendment seeks to improve the education outcomes of our students. Parents and students alike deserve to know they are being adequately prepared to enter and succeed in postsecondary education. Including these simple, easy-to-understand measures on State and local report cards will provide them with the information they need to make informed choices about their future education. Additionally, the data will help States and school districts target limited resources to the schools that need it most. This amendment was carefully crafted to avoid putting onerous and additional burdens on our schools and States. Nearly all States already have made the investments necessary to collect, link, and report this data. In fact, the majority of States are already reporting it. Currently, 40 States produce high school feedback reports that include postsecondary enrollment data. More than 30 States already include some measure of postsecondary success, such as remediation rates. Adding postsecondary enrollment and remediation rates to existing report card measures included in Every Child Achieves Act would make sure students, parents, educators, and policymakers have access to critical information about how well our high schools are preparing students to enter and succeed in postsecondary education. The end result will be successfully restoring decisionmaking to those who know best--the students and their parents. I urge everyone to support this amendment and also to support the bill. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

CREC-2015-07-13-pt1-PgS4991,CREC-2015-07-13,114,STUDENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4991-S4992] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STUDENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I rise to speak about the urgency of passing the Student Non-Discrimination Act, which takes the same protections that children have against discrimination on the basis of race and national origin and gender and disability, and it extends those protections to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender children-- LGBT children. That is it. It is a simple bill. It stands for the principle that LGBT kids have a right not to be bullied just because of who they are. There are people who will say: What can you do to stop bullying? Kids will be kids. Boys will be boys. I don't think that is right. Because what we [[Page S4992]] are seeing in our schools today is not just teasing; it is not playground behavior. What we are seeing is more than just bullying. We are seeing discrimination. Let me explain what I mean. If a Black child was referred to by a racial slur at school, would we say kids will be kids? If a Jewish student got beat up because he wore a yarmulke to school, would we wave it off and say boys will be boys? If a shop teacher told a female teacher she didn't belong in his class, would we be fine if the school just looked the other way? No, we would not. In fact, there are Federal civil rights laws that are specifically designed to stop this kind of conduct. But if a gay child is relentlessly harassed by his classmates, if a principal tells a girl she can't go to her senior prom because she wants to bring another girl as her date or if a school stands by as teachers, students, and other administrators refer to a transgender child not as ``he'' or ``she'' but as ``it,'' there is no law that was written to protect those children. Our laws fail those children, and that is just wrong. We can change that. The bullying of LGBT children in our schools has reached epidemic proportions. More than 30 percent of LGBT kids report missing a day of school in the previous month because they felt unsafe. Nearly 75 percent of LGBT students say they have been verbally harassed at school, and more than 35 percent of LGBT students report being physically attacked. You cannot learn if you dread going to school. It has been estimated that, on average, LGBT kids comprise 40 percent of all homeless youth. To be sure, family rejection is a leading factor, but LGBT kids' inability to escape verbal harassment and physical attacks makes them drop out, which makes them much more likely to be homeless. That is unacceptable. Our children should not have to experience that kind of hate at school, and, as we have seen all too often, some of them just can't endure it. A few years ago, I met a wonderful woman named Wendy Walsh, the mother of Seth Walsh, whose photo is next to me here. Wendy told me that Seth had endured years of anti-gay harassment at school in Tehachapi, CA. When he was in the fifth grade, other students started calling him gay, and as he got older the harassment became more frequent and more abusive. By seventh grade, taunts and verbal abuse were a constant part of Seth's day. Students called him faggot and queer. He was afraid to use the restroom or to be in the boys' locker room before gym class. Seth had always been a good student, receiving A's and B's, but as the harassment escalated, he started to get failing grades. Friends reported that he became depressed and withdrawn. Wendy desperately tried to get school district officials to do something, but her pleas were brushed aside, and in September of 2010, Seth hanged himself from a tree in his family's backyard. He was 13. Seth left a note expressing his love for family and friends but also his anger at the school. Justin Aaberg was a rising sophomore at high school in Anoka, MN, my home State. Justin played the cello. In fact, he composed music for the cello. His mother Tammy told people that he was a ``sweet boy who seemed to always have a smile on his face.'' Justin came out to his mom when he was 13. In July of 2010, Justin hanged himself in his bedroom. His mother later learned from Justin's friends and from messages he left before his death that he had been the victim of incessant bullying at school. Justin was 15 when he died. Carl Walker Hoover was a Boy Scout and a football player for his school in Springfield, MA. But starting in the sixth grade, the kids at Carl's school started to bully and harass him for ``acting gay'' or ``acting like a girl'' even though he didn't identify as LGBT. When Carl's mother, Sirdeaner Walker, learned about the harassment, she spoke to his principal, his teacher, and his guidance counselor repeatedly, asking the school to intervene. But in April of 2009, Sirdeaner found her son hanging by an extension cord on the second floor of her home. In the letter Carl left behind, he said he simply couldn't take it anymore. Carl was 11 years old. Justin, Seth, and Carl's stories are not anomalies. They are just a few of the many tragic cases in an epidemic of school bullying against LGBT kids or kids who are perceived to be LGBT. The bill we are debating this week is an education bill, a bill about taking the steps necessary to secure better and brighter futures for our children. It is our responsibility not just as Senators but as adults to protect children and to help them flourish. Children who are afraid to go to school can't get a good education. Think about the children in your life--your son or your daughter, your grandchild or your niece or nephew--and what it must be like for a child in your life to get up and face the school day ahead not with excitement but with anxiety and fear, with dread and shame. This shouldn't happen in America. In America, we have passed laws that guard against harassment in our schools on the basis of race, national origin, sex, and disability, but LGBT students face bullying and intimidation without recourse. This amendment would simply provide LGBT kids with the same legal remedies available to other kids under our Federal civil rights laws. It says that schools would have to listen when a parent calls and says: My child isn't safe, and then the school has to do something about it. It would ensure that LGBT kids have the same protections, not some of the same protections, as other kids. This is not a revolutionary idea. In fact, more than a dozen States have already passed laws that protect students from discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and it is working. In States that have protections for sexual orientation and gender identity in schools, LGBT students report nearly one-third fewer instances of physical harassment and nearly half as many instances of physical assault as in States lacking these protections. We have come incredibly far in our understanding of LGBT people in a very short period of time not just as a country but as a body. In 2013, by a vote of 64 to 32, the Senate passed ENDA, the Employment Non- Discrimination Act, which would prohibit job discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. It would prohibit firing someone or harassing them at work for being gay or transgender. It would protect adults. Now it is time to protect kids and to put in place policies to ensure that a child of 11 or 13 or 15 is allowed to live their life and discover who they are--to discover that maybe they are a great cellist or a first-round NFL draft pick--without facing taunts and intimidation and physical violence in the school. It is our responsibility as a country and as a body to protect our children. I strongly urge my colleagues to do just that by supporting the Student Non-Discrimination Act and voting for it as an amendment to this bill. I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4991-S4992] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STUDENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT Mr. FRANKEN.

But starting in the sixth grade, the kids at Carl's school started to bully and harass him for ``acting gay'' or ``acting like a girl'' even though he didn't identify as LGBT. When Carl's mother, Sirdeaner Walker, learned about the harassment, she spoke to his principal, his teacher, and his guidance counselor repeatedly, asking the school to intervene. But in April of 2009, Sirdeaner found her son hanging by an extension cord on the second floor of her home. In the letter Carl left behind, he said he simply couldn't take it anymore. Carl was 11 years old. Justin, Seth, and Carl's stories are not anomalies. They are just a few of the many tragic cases in an epidemic of school bullying against LGBT kids or kids who are perceived to be LGBT. The bill we are debating this week is an education bill, a bill about taking the steps necessary to secure better and brighter futures for our children. It is our responsibility not just as Senators but as adults to protect children and to help them flourish. Children who are afraid to go to school can't get a good education. Think about the children in your life--your son or your daughter, your grandchild or your niece or nephew--and what it must be like for a child in your life to get up and face the school day ahead not with excitement but with anxiety and fear, with dread and shame. This shouldn't happen in America. In America, we have passed laws that guard against harassment in our schools on the basis of race, national origin, sex, and disability, but LGBT students face bullying and intimidation without recourse. This amendment would simply provide LGBT kids with the same legal remedies available to other kids under our Federal civil rights laws. It says that schools would have to listen when a parent calls and says: My child isn't safe, and then the school has to do something about it. It would ensure that LGBT kids have the same protections, not some of the same protections, as other kids. This is not a revolutionary idea. In fact, more than a dozen States have already passed laws that protect students from discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and it is working. In States that have protections for sexual orientation and gender identity in schools, LGBT students report nearly one-third fewer instances of physical harassment and nearly half as many instances of physical assault as in States lacking these protections. We have come incredibly far in our understanding of LGBT people in a very short period of time not just as a country but as a body. In 2013, by a vote of 64 to 32, the Senate passed ENDA, the Employment Non- Discrimination Act, which would prohibit job discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. It would prohibit firing someone or harassing them at work for being gay or transgender. It would protect adults. Now it is time to protect kids and to put in place policies to ensure that a child of 11 or 13 or 15 is allowed to live their life and discover who they are--to discover that maybe they are a great cellist or a first-round NFL draft pick--without facing taunts and intimidation and physical violence in the school. It is our responsibility as a country and as a body to protect our children. I strongly urge my colleagues to do just that by supporting the Student Non-Discrimination Act and voting for it as an amendment to this bill. I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4991-S4992] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STUDENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I rise to speak about the urgency of passing the Student Non-Discrimination Act, which takes the same protections that children have against discrimination on the basis of race and national origin and gender and disability, and it extends those protections to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender children-- LGBT children. That is it. It is a simple bill. It stands for the principle that LGBT kids have a right not to be bullied just because of who they are. There are people who will say: What can you do to stop bullying? Kids will be kids. Boys will be boys. I don't think that is right. Because what we [[Page S4992]] are seeing in our schools today is not just teasing; it is not playground behavior. What we are seeing is more than just bullying. We are seeing discrimination. Let me explain what I mean. If a Black child was referred to by a racial slur at school, would we say kids will be kids? If a Jewish student got beat up because he wore a yarmulke to school, would we wave it off and say boys will be boys? If a shop teacher told a female teacher she didn't belong in his class, would we be fine if the school just looked the other way? No, we would not. In fact, there are Federal civil rights laws that are specifically designed to stop this kind of conduct. But if a gay child is relentlessly harassed by his classmates, if a principal tells a girl she can't go to her senior prom because she wants to bring another girl as her date or if a school stands by as teachers, students, and other administrators refer to a transgender child not as ``he'' or ``she'' but as ``it,'' there is no law that was written to protect those children. Our laws fail those children, and that is just wrong. We can change that. The bullying of LGBT children in our schools has reached epidemic proportions. More than 30 percent of LGBT kids report missing a day of school in the previous month because they felt unsafe. Nearly 75 percent of LGBT students say they have been verbally harassed at school, and more than 35 percent of LGBT students report being physically attacked. You cannot learn if you dread going to school. It has been estimated that, on average, LGBT kids comprise 40 percent of all homeless youth. To be sure, family rejection is a leading factor, but LGBT kids' inability to escape verbal harassment and physical attacks makes them drop out, which makes them much more likely to be homeless. That is unacceptable. Our children should not have to experience that kind of hate at school, and, as we have seen all too often, some of them just can't endure it. A few years ago, I met a wonderful woman named Wendy Walsh, the mother of Seth Walsh, whose photo is next to me here. Wendy told me that Seth had endured years of anti-gay harassment at school in Tehachapi, CA. When he was in the fifth grade, other students started calling him gay, and as he got older the harassment became more frequent and more abusive. By seventh grade, taunts and verbal abuse were a constant part of Seth's day. Students called him faggot and queer. He was afraid to use the restroom or to be in the boys' locker room before gym class. Seth had always been a good student, receiving A's and B's, but as the harassment escalated, he started to get failing grades. Friends reported that he became depressed and withdrawn. Wendy desperately tried to get school district officials to do something, but her pleas were brushed aside, and in September of 2010, Seth hanged himself from a tree in his family's backyard. He was 13. Seth left a note expressing his love for family and friends but also his anger at the school. Justin Aaberg was a rising sophomore at high school in Anoka, MN, my home State. Justin played the cello. In fact, he composed music for the cello. His mother Tammy told people that he was a ``sweet boy who seemed to always have a smile on his face.'' Justin came out to his mom when he was 13. In July of 2010, Justin hanged himself in his bedroom. His mother later learned from Justin's friends and from messages he left before his death that he had been the victim of incessant bullying at school. Justin was 15 when he died. Carl Walker Hoover was a Boy Scout and a football player for his school in Springfield, MA. But starting in the sixth grade, the kids at Carl's school started to bully and harass him for ``acting gay'' or ``acting like a girl'' even though he didn't identify as LGBT.

CREC-2015-07-13-pt1-PgS4992,CREC-2015-07-13,114,PROTECTING STUDENT PRIVACY ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4992-S4993] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PROTECTING STUDENT PRIVACY ACT Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, we do not have to look any further than the recent data breaches at the Government Office of Personnel Management, Target, Home Depot, Sony, Neiman Marcus, and countless others to know there are pitfalls to the rush to store our personal, sensitive data online. And there is no information more personal and more sensitive than that of school-aged children. The business of sifting through and storing the records of grade school and high school students is growing as fast as students are. By collecting personal information about students' test results and learning abilities, teachers may find better ways to educate their students. We can help improve their test scores, improve academic achievement, and prepare students for the future. The increased use of data analysis of student performance holds promise for increasing student achievement, but at the same time there are perils from a privacy perspective. Putting the sensitive information of students in the hands of third parties and private sector companies raises a number of very serious questions about the privacy rights of parents and their children. The information being collected is about students as young as 5 years old. [[Page S4993]] As a nation, we have already decided that children require extra protection, and that is why in the House of Representatives I was the principal author of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, which is what it is called. COPPA is the communications constitution for protecting children when they are online. I believe very deeply that parents, not private companies, should have the right to control information about their children, even when a child's data is in the hands of a private company. We know that the pre-K through 12 educational software and digital content market is currently worth more than $8 billion. I will say that again. An $8 billion industry has now been built up around pre-K through 12 educational software, and nearly all of America's school districts rely on cloud services for a diverse range of functions that include data collection and analysis related to student performance. As data analytics companies increasingly play a role in the education area, Congress must act to ensure that safeguards are in place for student data that is shared with third parties. Show-and-tell should be a classroom exercise with students, not with students' personal and sensitive information. A child's educational record should not be sold as a product on the open market. That is why earlier this year I introduced the Protecting Student Privacy Act with Senators Hatch and Kirk. That is why today my colleague Senator Hatch and I are offering a bipartisan amendment which the Senators will be asked to vote on which will establish a commission to report to Congress on how we protect student privacy and parental rights in the digital age. These recommendations the Senators will be voting on here today will include a number of things--No. 1, how to prevent marketers from using educational records to target students with advertisements. The goal here is to help young scholars make the grade--not to have private sector companies make a sale. They should not be using the information they have in order to target young kids with products. That should be an issue for which we have a national policy. No. 2, when should student information be deleted? Permanent records of children shouldn't be held permanently by private sector companies, but only by students and their parents. No. 3 is how parents should be able to access and correct private information about their children. Just as there could be an erroneous charge on a credit report and that should not prevent someone from getting a loan, a false grade or a false bit of information on a report card shouldn't prevent a young person from getting into the college of their choice, and parents should have the ability to say they want that changed. No. 4, how do we ensure that outside vendors, outside companies that handle and store this sensitive information put in place the strongest possible data security standards? This is a business. These companies are making money, saying: We will store this information so you don't have to build more physical storehouses. We will put this information up into the cloud. That will be a real cost savings for the school system. Well, how much security is that private sector company now going to build around the cloud with all of that information? Are they going to have the highest level of cyber security protections built in? Or are they just going to buy something that is dirt cheap and say they have security precautions but, like Target, like Sony, like the Office of Personnel Management, they will not have actually put in place the security protections which will ensure that children's most sensitive information is not compromised as it is being stored up in the cloud. The reality is that our data is being increasingly compromised, and companies of all shapes and sizes must devote the resources necessary to protect that information. As it is stored in the cloud and as it is being subjected to malicious attacks, there must be a security system that can repel those attacks. The amendment Senator Hatch and I bring to the floor here this afternoon at 5:30 brings together privacy experts, parents, school leaders, public advocates, and the technology industry in order to tackle how to best balance protecting students' personal information while promoting greater academic achievement. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment. There is a Dickensian quality to this digital world. It is the best of technology and the worst of technology simultaneously. It can be used to enable and ennoble. It can be used to degrade and debase. How we choose will only be determined by human beings and by those who represent them in the Senate. We have to ensure that we put in place policies that ensure we have the best use of these digital technologies while not having children and their parents be robbed of the private information that is so sensitive to the long term well-being of a child as they are developing. That is what this amendment is all about here today. I urge an ``aye'' vote. Madam President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

No. 2, when should student information be deleted? Permanent records of children shouldn't be held permanently by private sector companies, but only by students and their parents. No. 3 is how parents should be able to access and correct private information about their children. Just as there could be an erroneous charge on a credit report and that should not prevent someone from getting a loan, a false grade or a false bit of information on a report card shouldn't prevent a young person from getting into the college of their choice, and parents should have the ability to say they want that changed. No. 4, how do we ensure that outside vendors, outside companies that handle and store this sensitive information put in place the strongest possible data security standards? This is a business. These companies are making money, saying: We will store this information so you don't have to build more physical storehouses. We will put this information up into the cloud. That will be a real cost savings for the school system. Well, how much security is that private sector company now going to build around the cloud with all of that information? Are they going to have the highest level of cyber security protections built in? Or are they just going to buy something that is dirt cheap and say they have security precautions but, like Target, like Sony, like the Office of Personnel Management, they will not have actually put in place the security protections which will ensure that children's most sensitive information is not compromised as it is being stored up in the cloud. The reality is that our data is being increasingly compromised, and companies of all shapes and sizes must devote the resources necessary to protect that information. As it is stored in the cloud and as it is being subjected to malicious attacks, there must be a security system that can repel those attacks. The amendment Senator Hatch and I bring to the floor here this afternoon at 5:30 brings together privacy experts, parents, school leaders, public advocates, and the technology industry in order to tackle how to best balance protecting students' personal information while promoting greater academic achievement. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment. There is a Dickensian quality to this digital world. It is the best of technology and the worst of technology simultaneously. It can be used to enable and ennoble. It can be used to degrade and debase. How we choose will only be determined by human beings and by those who represent them in the Senate. We have to ensure that we put in place policies that ensure we have the best use of these digital technologies while not having children and their parents be robbed of the private information that is so sensitive to the long term well-being of a child as they are developing. That is what this amendment is all about here today. I urge an ``aye'' vote. Madam President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa. ____________________",package_114_13.csv,6627,6627,6694,"[congressional record volume 161, number 108 (monday, july 13, 2015)] [senate] [pages s4992-s4993] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] protecting student privacy act mr. markey. madam president, we do not have to look any further than the recent data breaches at the government office of personnel management, target, home depot, sony, neiman marcus, and countless others to know there are pitfalls to the rush to store our personal, sensitive data online. and there is no information more personal and more sensitive than that of school-aged children. the business of sifting through and storing the records of grade school and high school students is growing as fast as students are. by collecting personal information about students' test results and learning abilities, teachers may find better ways to educate their students. we can help improve their test scores, improve academic achievement, and prepare students for the future. the increased use of data analysis of student performance holds promise for increasing student achievement, but at the same time there are perils from a privacy perspective. putting the sensitive information of students in the hands of third parties and private sector companies raises a number of very serious questions about the privacy rights of parents and their children. the information being collected is about students as young as 5 years old. [[page s4993]] as a nation, we have already decided that children require extra protection, and that is why in the house of representatives i was the principal author of the children's online privacy protection act, or coppa, which is what it is called. coppa is the communications constitution for protecting children when they are online. i believe very deeply that parents, not private companies, should have the right to control information about their children, even when a child's data is in the hands of a private company. we know that the pre-k through 12 educational software and digital content market is currently worth more than $8 billion. i will say that again. an $8 billion industry has now been built up around pre-k through 12 educational software, and nearly all of america's school districts rely on cloud services for a diverse range of functions that include data collection and analysis related to student performance. as data analytics companies increasingly play a role in the education area, congress must act to ensure that safeguards are in place for student data that is shared with third parties. show-and-tell should be a classroom exercise with students, not with students' personal and sensitive information. a child's educational record should not be sold as a product on the open market. that is why earlier this year i introduced the protecting student privacy act with senators hatch and kirk. that is why today my colleague senator hatch and i are offering a bipartisan amendment which the senators will be asked to vote on which will establish a commission to report to congress on how we protect student privacy and parental rights in the digital age. these recommendations the senators will be voting on here today will include a number of things--no. 1, how to prevent marketers from using educational records to target students with advertisements. the goal here is to help young scholars make the grade--not to have private sector companies make a sale. they should not be using the information they have in order to target young kids with products. that should be an issue for which we have a national policy. no. 2, when should student information be deleted? permanent records of children shouldn't be held permanently by private sector companies, but only by students and their parents. no. 3 is how parents should be able to access and correct private information about their children. just as there could be an erroneous charge on a credit report and that should not prevent someone from getting a loan, a false grade or a false bit of information on a report card shouldn't prevent a young person from getting into the college of their choice, and parents should have the ability to say they want that changed. no. 4, how do we ensure that outside vendors, outside companies that handle and store this sensitive information put in place the strongest possible data security standards?

CREC-2015-07-13-pt1-PgS4993-2,CREC-2015-07-13,114,SANCTUARY POLICY,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S4993-S4994] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SANCTUARY POLICY Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, just 12 days ago, Kate Steinle was walking along Pier 14 in San Francisco with her father when she was shot by an individual in this country illegally. At the age of 32--a very young age--her life was taken. Friends and family mourned her death and laid her to rest late last week. Kate Steinle should be with us today. Her death is a result of weak immigration policies, an insecure border, and a lack of will to enforce the law. Her alleged killer was deported five times and has a rap sheet that dates back to 1991. Despite his criminal background, San Francisco's sanctuary policy allowed this man to walk the streets. Today we are learning that there are thousands of detainers placed each year on undocumented immigrants by Federal officials, but these detainers go ignored. Detainers are requests to another law enforcement entity that it wants to take custody of a person. The Federal Government will ask, for instance, a State or local jurisdiction to hold an individual for 48 hours until the Federal Government can assume custody. According to government documents provided by the Center for Immigration Studies, between January and September of 2014, there were 8,811 declined detainers in 276 counties in 43 States, including the District of Columbia. Of the 8,811 declined detainers, 62 percent of them were associated with over 5,000 individuals who were previously charged, convicted of a crime or presented some other public safety concern. And nearly 1,900 of the released offenders were arrested for another crime once they were released by the sanctuary jurisdiction. This is very disturbing--not only to me but to most Americans. There is no good rationale for noncooperation between Federal officials and State and local law enforcement. Public safety is put at risk when State and local officials provide sanctuary to lawbreaking immigrants just to make some political point. But San Francisco isn't the only one to shoulder blame here. The Obama administration has turned a blind eye to law enforcement in this area, even releasing thousands of criminal aliens on its own, many of whom have gone on to commit serious crimes--even murder. They have also turned a blind eye to sanctuary cities, all while challenging States to take a more aggressive approach to immigration and enforcing immigration laws. That is why I wrote to Attorney General Lynch and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Johnson just last week. I urged them to take control of the situation so that detainers are not ignored and undocumented individuals are safely transferred to Federal custody and put into deportation proceedings. I implored them to take a more direct role in this matter. This administration needs to stop turning a blind eye to State and local jurisdictions that thumb their nose at the law and harbor criminals who are evading immigration authorities. [[Page S4994]] But this isn't a new issue for this administration. I wrote to then- Secretary Napolitano in 2011 and asked her to intervene in Cook County, IL, another sanctuary jurisdiction. I wrote to her again, along with then-Attorney General Holder, about sanctuary cities in January of 2012. They failed to do anything at the time. In fact, since then, administration officials have made it clear that detainers did not have to be honored. The man charged with the murder of Kate Steinle told officials that he sought refuge and moved to San Francisco precisely because of its sanctuary policy. This is a tipping point, however. There are many other victims we need to remember. That is why, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I plan to hold a hearing on the President's immigration policies and the tragic effect they are having on Americans. I have invited the head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as well as the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to testify. Before they testify, I plan to have relatives of victims present to tell Congress how their loved ones and how their lives have been forever changed because of criminal aliens. This hearing will take place next Tuesday. This is far too important an issue to go unresolved. The heartbreaking death of Kate Steinle at the hands of a criminal alien in the country illegally underscores the need for swift and decisive action to prevent further tragedies of this nature. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1177, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 1177) to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to ensure that every child achieves. Pending: Alexander/Murray amendment No. 2089, in the nature of a substitute. Murray (for Peters) amendment No. 2095 (to amendment No. 2089), to allow local educational agencies to use parent and family engagement funds for financial literacy activities.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I believe that providing all of our students with a quality education is one of our most important national priorities. The workforce in the years to come will depend on today's students being able to create and take on the jobs of tomorrow, and providing students with the chance to learn, grow, and thrive will help our country continue to compete and lead in the 21st-century global economy. Today we are continuing our work on the Senate floor to make sure all of our students have access to a quality education by working to fix the badly broken No Child Left Behind law. I thank Chairman Alexander, the senior Senator from Tennessee, for working with me on this bipartisan bill. He has been a great partner throughout this process. The bipartisan bill, the Every Child Achieves Act, is a good step in the right direction. It gives our States more flexibility while also including Federal guardrails to make sure all students have access to a quality public education. But I want to work, of course, to continue to improve and strengthen this bill throughout this process on the Senate floor. I want to make sure struggling schools get the resources they need. I want to make sure all of our kids, especially our most vulnerable students, are able to succeed in the classroom. Finishing this process and getting a bill signed into law isn't going to be easy. Nothing in Congress ever is. But students and parents and teachers in communities across our country--including in my home State of Washington--are looking to Congress to fix this broken law. We cannot let them down. We need to work across the aisle to provide a quality education for all students, regardless of where they live or how they learn or how much money their parents make. So I look forward to continuing to work with Chairman Alexander as we move this through the Senate floor and to conference--and I think he agrees with me--and, hopefully, to the President to get it signed into law. I see the chairman is here. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I do agree with the Senator on our goal. We had a good week last week. We had a large number of amendments that were agreed to, a number were adopted in addition to ones we had in committee. We need to finish this week. We need Senators to do what members of the committee did, which is to pursue a result exercising some restraint. If we all insist on everything we have a right to insist on, nothing would ever happen. As Senator Murray said, teachers, Governors, school boards, and parents are expecting us to get this job done. We can do it. The House did its part last week. We can finish our work this week. Put it together and then she is correct, we want a result, not just a political speech, which means we need to have the President's signature in the end. So we have a bipartisan process. We are 7 years overdue. This is a bill everybody in the country who cares about education wants us to act on. We have had a remarkable consensus on what we need to do. Basically, what we are saying is that we want to keep the important measurements of student achievement so parents and teachers and communities can know how children are doing, how schools are doing, whether anyone is being left behind, but we want to restore to States and local school boards and communities and classroom teachers the responsibility for deciding what to do about the results of those tests and make sure they are appropriate and make sure there are not too many tests. We believe that is the real way to improve teaching, to improve schools, and to have real accountability. So we have taken lots of different opinions and we have put them together in a bill. I was thinking over the weekend, having a bill on elementary and secondary education is like going to a football game at the University of Tennessee. There are 100,000 people in the stands, and they all are experts on football, whether it is Iowa or Washington or Tennessee. Well, we are all experts--and so are most of our citizens experts on education--but we need to have a consensus here. We are close to one. I thank Senator Murray and the majority leader and the Democratic leader for creating an environment in which we so far have been able to succeed. Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. [[Page S4995]] Mr. DAINES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Nuclear Agreement With Iran Mr. DAINES. Madam President, as we speak, negotiations are ongoing between Iran and the P5+1 countries regarding one of the greatest threats to global security today; that is, a potentially nuclear- capable Iran. If both sides reach a final negotiated agreement, this body will have to consider whether the agreement truly prevents Iran from becoming a nuclear state or whether it paves the way for the leading state sponsor of terror to obtain a nuclear weapon. Agreeing to a bad deal would pose a serious threat to the national security of the United States, to Israel, and our other allies. We cannot take this decision lightly. We should not base our votes on the legacy of the President. We will be dealing with the consequences of this potential agreement long after President Obama leaves office. There are specific terms of any final agreement that are vital to preventing Iran's nuclear weapons capability. One-hundred percent certainty is impossible in matters of intelligence, particularly with a regime like Iran's that has a history of being less than forthright about its nuclear program. In fact, on June 21, the Iranian Parliament voted to bar inspectors from military sites. As they were passing this resolution to bar inspectors from military sites, they were chanting ``Death to America.'' Let's not forget that Iran is the leading state sponsor of terrorism in the world. It is critical that the International Atomic Energy Agency be able to conduct extensive inspections at all military facilities, including unannounced inspections, to ensure that Iran is upholding its commitments. A final deal must ensure that we have verifiable evidence that Iran is complying with the terms of the agreement before lifting sanctions. A final deal must permit international inspection to occur anytime, anywhere. A final deal must require Iran to disclose and dismantle its nuclear infrastructure, its uranium stockpile, and all other aspects of its nuclear program as specified in six--let me repeat--six U.N. Security Council resolutions. A final deal must ensure Iranians never get a nuclear weapon. If Iran does violate these terms, the deal must guarantee that strong sanctions go back into place immediately. It took years to get in place the sanctions we have today. It was largely because of these sanctions that Iran was forced to come to the negotiating table. The sanctions are working. I would also like to address the notion that we either come to a deal or we resort to military action. This is a false choice. In fact, accepting a bad deal now will make military action more likely down the road. A bad deal will provide Iran with an influx of cash to continue sponsoring terrorism around the world, while failing to prevent them from ultimately obtaining a nuclear weapon when this deal expires. Like so many Montanans I have heard from, I truly hope negotiations are successful. However, I am concerned the that based on the framework agreement that we have seen so far, the final agreement will ultimately fail to safeguard our national security and prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. No deal is better than a bad deal. If the final agreement the President presents falls short of the requirements I have talked about today, I will not support it. Over the past month, we have now blown through four deadlines. It is starting to look like Groundhog Day in Vienna. safe kids act Madam President, on a separate note, this past week the Senate began debating legislation about our Nation's educational system. In the same week, we learned more about a major data breach at the Office of Personnel Management, which put more than 21 million American's personnel information at risk. Those events and the policy debates bring to light an issue that often does not gather a lot of information; that is, protecting our student's personal information and data in the digital age. As a father of four, this issue is particularly personal to me. To date, countless schools across the United States utilize electronic records to update student information and transfer data from one school to another. But as the data is collected, it is important students' privacy is maintained and that the data is being stored safely and securely. In 2014, a working group was formed to address the issue of student data privacy. This group produced the Student Data Privacy Pledge, which intended to set self-imposed principles to ensure that information collected from students is kept both secure as well as private. This week, I will be introducing legislation called the SAFE KIDS Act, that builds on these ideas by empowering the Federal Trade Commission to oversee and enforce the collection, storage, and usage of covered information. This bill will put important reforms in place to protect students privacy, to establish greater security and transparency measures, and to encourage innovation among education technology providers, and better ensure accountability in keeping our students' information safe. As someone who spent more than 12 years in the technology sector, I am excited to see technology being used in innovative ways in our schools. As a father of four, I also want to ensure that there are proper safeguards in place to protect our kids' personal data in an increasingly data-driven world. I also want to thank Senator Blumenthal for joining me this week to introduce this important legislation to protect students' personal information and for his continued work on this issue. With that in mind, I will yield the floor so we can hear more from Senator Blumenthal on this most important issue. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I thank my colleague Senator Daines for his extraordinarily valuable work on this bipartisan bill, which will help protect students, help safeguard the privacy of young people, which would be considered separately from the measure now before us, the Every Child Achieves Act, which will strengthen the Federal Government's commitment to ensuring that every child has access to a high-quality education. The bill Senator Daines and I are offering ensures that every child is protected during their education from invasive and intrusive sharing and selling of highly private information about their educational progress--all kinds of sensitive, personal data that are accumulated and collected by school authorities and the companies that contract with them in the course of that child's education. When a parent signs a take-home form permitting their children to use a learning application in math class, for example, they have no assurance right now--none--regarding what information the app company will collect or how the app company will protect that information. That kind of very personal, identifiable, confidential information is inadequately protected in many school systems around the country. If that app company fails to protect the personal information of the student and their family, it could be stolen by hackers. It could be breached. We have seen how Federal files have been breached on a scale that none of us would ever have imagined--supposedly protected information--and we are talking about companies leaving vulnerable children's information potentially on the same scale--millions of children being at risk of their data being breached and stolen by hackers. But we are also talking about that information being bought and sold, exchanged by companies. The current protections against that commercial exploitation are inadequate. Children and their parents and their families deserve better protection of their privacy. It is a big business. It is a huge and burgeoning business for those companies. They may serve a very worthwhile purpose for many of those children and for many school authorities who need someone to organize and apply software to the raw information that is collected in test scores or other kinds of educational data. But it is not data that belongs to the companies; it belongs to the student and the school authorities, and it ought to be protected not only because of who owns it [[Page S4996]] but because of whom it belongs to. It belongs to students as a matter of morality, not just legality. We are introducing student digital privacy legislation, the SAFE KIDS Act. This week Senator Daines and I will introduce it to establish strong and vital protections that will give parents the peace of mind they need and deserve. Our bill would prohibit companies from reselling student data--something corporations should never profit from doing. The SAFE KIDS Act would also prohibit companies from using student data, including a personal profile of a student, for any targeted advertising. This kind of marketing goes on in our society. Our legislation also requires companies that hold student data to enact robust protections, such as proper encryption of that data, which will prevent the theft of personal information. Under our bill, parents are empowered to access their children's information, request corrections of any erroneous information, and request deletion of certain student data. Our bill charges the FTC with the responsibility to implement and enforce the SAFE KIDS Act, and it enables States to enact stronger, more demanding protections if they choose to do so. It establishes a floor, not a ceiling. It does not preempt stronger measures if States choose to move forward. This measure is in no way incompatible with the provision and amendment on which we will vote tonight that deals with another aspect of this issue in establishing a commission. I support that amendment. The commission would issue recommendations on a number of specific topics, such as preventing targeted advertising, limiting data retention, and providing parents with complete information. Those issues are complex, and they need the kinds of studies and research the commission would provide. And the results of that commission would help to inform the FTC regulations that would be issued under the SAFE KIDS Act that Senator Daines and I are introducing this week. I look forward to supporting the Hatch-Markey amendment, voting for it, and I urge my colleagues to support it and the SAFE KIDS Act because they enable a comprehensive approach to student privacy. Make no mistake--this data is in danger and so is the privacy of our students. In a world that has become enormously invasive and intrusive and where personal information is so much at risk, our students, children, and their families deserve this protection. I urge my colleagues to support it. Background Checks and Gun Violence Madam President, I wish to talk for just a moment about the disclosure last week that Dylan Roof, the alleged killer of nine innocent people in Charleston, SC, was able to buy guns without first passing a background check. The reason, very simply, was the default- to-proceed loophole in the law, which allows--but does not require-- firearms retailers to proceed with a gun sale after 3 days if an applicant's background check is still pending. Undoubtedly, more facts will come to light. Certain facts are unknown now as we speak, but the FBI acknowledges that a completed background check would have uncovered Dylan Roof's prior arrest on a drug charge and his drug addiction. Those discoveries would have barred him from purchasing the .45-caliber handgun he used to take nine lives in that unspeakable, horrific tragedy. In effect, Dylan Roof's exploitation of this loophole is not an anomaly. In the last 5 years, the default to proceed loophole has led firearms retailers to proceed with 15,729 gun sales to prohibited persons--people who were deemed ineligible to purchase a firearm once their background checks were completed. In effect, those 15,729 people were able to circumvent the law because of that loophole that enabled them to do so on a default to proceed after 3 days. After that default-to-proceed loophole is exploited, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives then has the difficult, dangerous, and often impossible job to retrieve the firearms that are sold. In fact, it is often impossible to even expect that they can once those firearms are sold without proper recordkeeping or any recordkeeping. We make that job harder every day by underfunding and hamstringing the work of the ATF in our appropriations bills. That creates that impossible task for them. Responsible gun retailers can act today. The law allows retailers to decide whether to permit gun sales to proceed after that 3-day default period has elapsed. They have a duty to ensure that their products do not get into the hands of dangerous individuals. They have that moral duty. They have that social responsibility. In 2008, Walmart, which is the Nation's largest gun store, agreed not to transfer firearms without a background check even if the 3 days have passed without it. The short-term inconvenience to retailers is minimal. In the vast majority of cases, a background check is completed within minutes and the retailer knows whether they may proceed with the sale. After the horror visited on the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, no responsible gun retailer should give the benefit of the doubt and hand over a gun without a definitive completion of that background check. Over the weekend, my colleague Senator Murphy and I urged the Senate Judiciary Committee to immediately review this failure in our background check system and potential remedies, lest this legislative body's silence on the matter be taken as a consent on the repeated failures we have witnessed. In the long run, this system must be made as effective and error proof as possible, and it should be extended to sales not covered now by the law. As Senator Murphy and I and many of our colleagues in the Senate have urged consistently and repeatedly, the failure to adopt a comprehensive, universal background check system is inexcusable, but we also have to make sure loopholes in the current law are eliminated, as the FBI and the Department of Justice have recommended, by extending that 3-day time period and otherwise increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the background check system. Senator Murphy and I will be taking additional steps to try to make it more effective. Gun retailers can step up in the meantime to stop dangerous people from getting their hands on dangerous weapons and taking lives--innocent lives--as happened in Charleston. They can, very simply, stop selling guns to people who have not passed that background check even if the 3 days have expired, even if that default period has come and gone. They can do that on their own. I look forward to working with my colleagues, including continuing the great work Senator Murphy and I have sought to do together in making America safer and better and improving our background check system and making sure commonsense, sensible gun violence prevention measures become the law of the land. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The Senator from Maryland. Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much. Mr. President, first, I compliment the Senator from Connecticut on his initial statement related to student privacy. I think it is an essential element to clarify that privacy is meant to protect but not inadvertently inhibit our ability to give help to those who desperately need it. Certainly, I wish to associate myself with his remarks on doing something about the background check, the timely response. I think the massacre at Emanuel AME Church deeply troubled the Nation, and the very least that can come out of this is not only the flag coming down and all that meant, but other barriers to safety should come down as well. I want the Senator from Connecticut to know that he has my admiration and my support. Protecting Federal Employees Mr. President, while we are waiting for the vote, in approximately 15 minutes, I know Senator Kaine will be coming to the floor to talk about an important postsecondary education remediation reform, but I want to comment on the 21 million Federal employees whose personnel records have been hacked by--it looks like--a foreign government. I am not going to go into the who and the attributing of who did the hacking, but I do want to say that, first of all, those Federal employees need to feel they have a government on [[Page S4997]] their side to now protect them. We should have protected them in the first place with the security of dot-gov and certainly our personnel records. Now, in addition to a bill I have introduced and cosponsored with my colleague from Maryland, Senator Cardin, where we have put in additional credit protection, credit monitoring, and liability protection, I have also sent a letter to the President today. The President of the United States is not only the Commander in Chief but he is the Chief Executive Officer of something called the U.S Government dot-gov, and therefore, OPM is his HR operation. With all due respect to our President, I have called upon him, on behalf of the 300,000 Federal employees and Federal retirees who I have in my State, that they take additional and immediate action to provide lifetime credit monitoring, lifetime credit protection and unlimited liability, and that we also get a new contractor. I know we want to get a new contractor that does security checks, but I want a new contractor that is supposed to be answering the phone. I want a new contractor answering the phone and responding to my Federal employees, and I have conveyed that to the new Acting Director of OPM, Beth Cobert. I think she has a lot of skill and a lot of knowledge. I know she comes to the White House from the private sector, McKinsey & Company, but I conveyed to her that it is outrageous what is happening to Federal employees. They try to call to get help to find out what has happened to them, and they are on the phone for 1 hour or 2 hours, and when they finally make contact, they get disconnected. These are our Federal employees, who we count on, many of whom to protect the Nation--many of whom to protect the Nation. Our cyber shield is down to protect them, and we are also not protecting them in terms of our response to our cyber shield being down. Who are these Federal employees in Maryland? Well, first of all, they are people who work at the National Institutes of Health trying to find cures from dreaded diseases and all of the laboratory staff and so on who support them. Or they are over at FDA or they are over at Goddard Space Flight Center helping to manage the Hubble telescope. In addition to that, we have people involved in and also who are direct hands-on with national security. Maryland is the home to many Foreign Service officers. They not only have the information about their own Social Security numbers and their own health information but that of their spouses and their minor children. We are also the home to the National Security Agency. Most of the National Security Agency is made up of civilian DOD personnel with the highest of security clearances. So my feeling is we have to get in there really quickly to protect them. We have to also do something about this contractor--that he ups his game or we tell him up and out. Up your game or up and out. The third thing is the President really needs to convene an all- hands-on-deck on how we are going to protect dot-gov in this country. There will be more to say about this bill and so on, but I see Senator Kaine is now on the floor to discuss and present his postsecondary remediation amendment, so I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia. Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Maryland, and I second the comments she has made about the status of our employees who have been jeopardized. I am excited to work together on the legislation introduced last Friday to provide them some protection. Amendment No. 2118 Mr. President, I do rise on behalf of an amendment that will be voted on within the next hour, Kaine amendment No. 2118, which is a bipartisan amendment to the Every Child Achieves Act. It is an amendment to promote career readiness indicators and make sure our students, when they finish high school, are not just ready for college but they are ready for careers. This is part of a series of amendments I have worked on in a bipartisan basis, some of which have been included in the underlying bill and one of which was passed as a floor amendment last week. I thank the managers, Senators Alexander and Murray, for working together to support this bipartisan amendment. We need to work to make sure we help all of our students graduate from high school ready for postsecondary education and the workforce. Over the past 40 years, the percentage of jobs that require some form of postsecondary education has doubled from 29 percent to now nearly 60 percent, but the education system hasn't kept pace with the demand for a more highly educated and skilled workforce. More importantly, we need to define what that is--highly educated and skilled--to incorporate career and technical training, which, for a variety of reasons in the last generation or so, was sort of an undervalued part of the spectrum of American public education. Within a very few years--by 2020, when our pages are now going to be out in the workforce--two-thirds of jobs will require at least some form of postsecondary education. But projections demonstrate that as a nation we will fall short by nearly 5 million workers. We are already seeing these shortages and having to deal with them, for example, through specialty visas. That is fine for the economy, but wouldn't it be better if we could train those in school right now to be skilled in the areas where the jobs are needed? The career readiness amendment addresses this problem by encouraging--not requiring but encouraging--States to include in their accountability systems the types of indicators that demonstrate students are ready for postsecondary education and the workforce. These indicators would include State-designed measures to integrate rigorous academics, work-based learning and career and technical education, or technical skill attainment and placement. That will be the core of this bill. By doing this, we send a strong message to schools, businesses, parents, and students that it is critical to be prepared for the workforce of the 21st century regardless of postsecondary education plans. As I have talked to educators, counselors, and parents, they have often commented upon the degree to which career and technical training has sort of been downgraded and that students aren't encouraged in that area, even though there are great professions to achieve in this area. Under the amendment, schools and districts would have an incentive to partner with businesses and industries to provide career pathways for students. It is important for State accountability systems. I say this as a Virginian who is very proud of the Virginia accountability system. It is currently kind of managed by my wife, who is the secretary of education in Virginia. But it is important for these systems to measure and reward schools for helping students earn industry-recognized credentials or earn credit for college while in high school. Just as an example, if you are a Virginia student and you take the Virginia Standards of Learning Test and you pass, that doesn't necessarily mean anything in North Carolina, and much less Oregon. But if you are a Virginia high school student and you pass a Cisco Systems administrator exam, you can take that credential, move to Oregon and get a job tomorrow. These industry credentials are, in many ways, more known, more valued, and more portable than high school credentials State by State. Schools across the country are providing this kind of important learning opportunity. Here are just two examples, and then I will conclude. In Alexandria, just across the Potomac, the Academy of Finance at T.C. Williams High School instructs students in money management skills, financial planning, and business development. Students complete a 3-year sequential program, start working at an on- site credit union in the school, and they get early college credit for that financial literacy. At the other end of the State--in southwest Virginia, in Vinton, near the city of Roanoke--William Byrd High School, after struggling during the 1990s to prepare students for college and career, sought input from nearby businesses and implemented programs in engineering, communication, business, and marketing to match local job needs. These partnerships are helpful [[Page S4998]] in helping students find jobs, and they have also engendered student interest in the curriculum. The school has a 90-percent graduation rate, and 83 percent of students go on to postsecondary education. I want to thank Senators Portman and Baldwin--I think Senator Portman was planning on speaking, and may still--for their involvement and working together with me on this particular amendment and on the Senate CTE Caucus. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan initiative, and again, I thank the bill managers for working together with us. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Capito). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes to make a presentation. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 2080 Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise in support of an amendment I have offered along with my friend, the junior Senator from Massachusetts. This amendment advances an important priority: protecting student privacy in an era of vast data collection and tenuous security protections. Advances in education technology are revolutionizing the way students learn in today's classroom. Going forward, it is important to balance the need for innovation to allow students to take advantage of the new learning tools with the need to make sure children's private information is protected. We must also ensure continuing to improve education through research, while not necessarily allowing researchers and their employers access to sensitive data. To this end, our amendment sets up a commission to come back with recommendations for how to update our outdated Federal education privacy law. The commission's membership consists of experts, parents, teachers, technology professionals, researchers, and State officials--a broad array of leaders capable of providing diverse perspectives on these issues. Within 270 days, the commission is required to report to Congress on the current mechanisms for transparency, parental involvement, research usage, and third-party vendor usage as well as provide recommendations on how to improve the law to better protect students. As we seek to identify the best ways of protecting student data, this commission will serve to outline some commonsense and effective options for reform that we ought to consider. This amendment has received support from a wide variety of organizations from Microsoft to the National PTA to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, demonstrating how this is a commonsense, bipartisan idea that we can all support. I urge my colleagues to support this important innovation. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Under the previous order, the question now occurs on agreeing to amendment No. 2080, offered by the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, for Mr. Hatch. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Blunt), the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Graham), the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Kirk), the Senator from Alaska (Ms. Murkowski), the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Paul), the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Risch), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey), and the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Florida (Mr. Nelson) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced--yeas 89, nays 0, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 231 Leg.] YEAS--89 Alexander Ayotte Baldwin Barrasso Bennet Blumenthal Booker Boozman Boxer Brown Burr Cantwell Capito Cardin Carper Casey Cassidy Coats Cochran Collins Coons Corker Cornyn Cotton Crapo Daines Donnelly Durbin Enzi Ernst Feinstein Fischer Flake Franken Gardner Gillibrand Grassley Hatch Heinrich Heitkamp Heller Hirono Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kaine King Klobuchar Lankford Leahy Lee Manchin Markey McCain McCaskill McConnell Menendez Merkley Mikulski Moran Murphy Murray Perdue Peters Portman Reed Reid Roberts Rounds Sanders Sasse Schatz Schumer Scott Sessions Shaheen Shelby Stabenow Sullivan Tester Thune Tillis Udall Warner Warren Whitehouse Wicker Wyden NOT VOTING--11 Blunt Cruz Graham Kirk Murkowski Nelson Paul Risch Rubio Toomey Vitter The amendment (No. 2080) was agreed to. Amendment No. 2118 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs on agreeing to amendment No. 2118, offered by the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, for Mr. Kaine. The amendment (No. 2118) was agreed to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, there has been some conversation on the floor. We are working out the order of proceeding. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Wicker and Senator Shaheen be recognized first for a colloquy, followed by remarks by Senator Brown, followed by remarks by myself, followed by remarks by Senator Baldwin. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. ALEXANDER. Reserving the right to object, I ask the Presiding Officer, are we in morning business? The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, we are still on the bill. Mr. ALEXANDER. I have no objection. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Mississippi. Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Shaheen and I be allowed to enter into a colloquy concerning the 20th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 20th Anniversary of the Srebrenica Massacre Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from New Hampshire today to speak about a moving and important commemoration that she and I attended over the weekend. We were part of the U.S. delegation led by former President Bill Clinton that traveled to Bosnia and Herzegovina to remember the victims of the Srebrenica massacre 20 years ago. We were honored to be joined in this delegation by Representative Peter King from New York, and I think it is significant that former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was part of that delegation. On July 11, 1995, more than 8,000 Bosniak Muslim men and boys were brutalized and murdered by Serbian forces that overran a United Nations safe haven during the Bosnian war. It was the worst massacre on European soil since the horrors of World War II. Today, Senator Shaheen and I wear green and white flowers on our lapels. These flowers were crocheted by Srebrenica mothers and widows in remembrance of the lives that were lost 20 years ago. The white is said to symbolize innocence, and the green represents hope. It is said to be significant that the center is green because hope remains central to the country's future and to the region's future. Two decades provide us with a helpful benchmark for reflecting on the progress that has been made and on the [[Page S4999]] progress that needs to be made. The decades have certainly not erased the deep scars left by the atrocities at Srebrenica, but the hurt continues to heal. International courts have recognized the massacre as a genocide, and a number of the perpetrators have been imprisoned. Peace is now present in the Western Balkans and we need to do what we can to help maintain this peace. The Bosnian and Herzegovinian leadership is now applying for membership in the European Union. We wish them well in making the progress that will be necessary to attain this status. Tough decisions still need to be made by the leadership, by the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina with regard to governance, corruption, and combating extremes. There is still way too much rhetoric that centers on ethnicity and continues to divide Bosnians rather than unite them. But we can celebrate the fact that this region is no longer home to the suffering and violence that predated the historic Dayton Accords, and we can celebrate the contribution and achievement of the Americans in reaching the Dayton Accords and in getting us to where we are now with two decades of peace. I know that these views are shared by my colleague from New Hampshire. At this point, perhaps she would like to join in this colloquy. Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I would like to join Senator Wicker from Mississippi in talking about what we saw and heard when we were in Bosnia. Unfortunately, the story that came out about that inspiring commemoration was about the attack by some of the Bosniaks who were attending on the Serbian Prime Minister, Aleksandar Vucic, who had attended the ceremony. But the larger story was one of reconciliation. The Bosniak mayor of Srebrenica, Camil Durakovic, condemned the attackers, and he was joined by the Tripartite Presidents in condemning the attackers. After the attack, the Serbian Prime Minister said that it should not distract attention from the innocent victims of Srebrenica. He said that his ``arms of reconciliation remain stretched towards the Bosniaks.'' Fortunately, we heard the same from the mayor of Srebrenica, who actually had invited the Prime Minister. I am very proud of Mayor Durakovic because he is actually a Bosnian- American whose family fled from Srebrenica in July of 1995, and they settled in New Hampshire. He went to high school there, and he got a degree from Southern New Hampshire University. He returned to Srebrenica in 2005 and was elected mayor in 2012. Aside from that isolated, unfortunate incident with the Prime Minister, the ceremony was a solemn tribute and remembrance to the victims of Srebrenica. There was a spirit of unity and harmony. The theme again and again was of reconciliation. As my colleague points out, it is particularly important for us to continue to support this reconciliation, for us to continue to support Bosnia and Herzegovina and their efforts to continue to look west to join the EU. Across many centuries, the Balkans has been a flashpoint for conflicts that have spread to the rest of Europe and the entire world. In fact, 101 years ago next month, World War I began with the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand right in Sarajevo. We walked by the block where he was assassinated. As we have seen most recently in Greece and as we are seeing in the Balkans and in other countries in Eastern Europe, the Russians are quick to exploit any trouble in the southeast corner of Europe in order to spread their influence and destabilize the West. Wouldn't my colleague agree that it is important for us in the United States to join the EU in supporting the Bosniaks, the Serbs, the Croatians, the Muslims, the Orthodox Christians, and the Roman Catholics so that they can come together and show the world that we really can create a multi- ethnic, multi-sectarian state that can serve as a model for the Middle East and for countries around the world? Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I do agree. I would contrast the magnanimous statements of the Tripresidency and the gesture of the Serbian President in attending with the disappointing actions of the Russian leadership, under the leadership of President Putin, in actually vetoing a Security Council resolution simply to commemorate the 20th anniversary as a genocide. Russia refused to accept a well- established fact, confirmed by international courts such as the International Court of Justice, such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. They vetoed--they were the only vote against it, but it acted as a veto--thus keeping the United Nations officially from going on record as saying this was a genocide and that these acts should be condemned. Such defiance is a disservice not only to the victims at Srebrenica but also to relations in the area going forward. I would just contrast that with the very brave step on the part of the Serbian President, coming to Srebrenica and being part of the commemorative ceremony. I will tell my colleagues that former President Clinton spoke on behalf of this Republican and spoke on behalf of Democrats alike, making a very instructive and constructive address at the occasion, specifically commending the Serbian President. I would say, with regard to the rock throwing incident and what the President of Serbia actually did, his glasses were broken, and he and members of his delegation were brought to their knees. I would say that if the 50 or so people who threw those rocks had heard the remarks inside the ceremony, perhaps they would not have felt so bitter as to throw those rocks. I know there are wounds that need to be healed. But I think the conciliatory words inside, if they had been broadcast to the entire crowd, would have perhaps caused that incident, which got all the publicity, not to happen. This was about 50 people causing a disturbance in a crowd of, I would say, about 5,000 people gathered outside. It was a very important ceremony--actually, a funeral, you might say. So I would have to just say that the Russian leadership really should be ashamed of standing in the way of international recognition of this genocide. They thought they were doing their Serbian neighbors a favor, but, on the other hand, the Serbian President stepped forward in a very brave way to create unity in this region, and I think my colleague would agree with that. Mrs. SHAHEEN. Absolutely, and I know Senator Wicker shared my gratitude as we walked through the streets of Sarajevo and as we met people in Srebrenica for the appreciation they showed the United States for our actions in helping to end that awful war in Bosnia and for our actions in supporting Bosnia as they try to look westward and as they try to keep their country moving forward, addressing the corruption and the democracy issues they face. I think it is in our interest as Americans to support those efforts to help them, as they continue to move their country forward, in every way we can. Mr. WICKER. The Senator from New Hampshire is exactly right. It is in the United States' interest that we care about the Balkans, that we care about Bosnia and Herzegovina. We owe it to the U.S. troops who were deployed there in 1995 and later, who kept the peace and made it work. There is no country on the face of the Earth that could have done that but the United States of America. We owe it to the memory of the leadership, not only of President Clinton, who basically hosted the Dayton Accords in the United States of America, but also Republicans such as Speaker Gingrich. It was Gingrich and Clinton who joined together and convinced this government to support the Dayton Agreement and support the necessary deployment to make sure this worked. As the Senator pointed out, we owe it to history going forward to remember that World War I broke out in Sarajevo, that the events leading up to World War II largely occurred in the Balkans, and to do what we can in the interest of U.S. citizens to say that this will not again be a flashpoint for conflict in Europe and conflict internationally. Mrs. SHAHEEN. I know the Senator shares my views that we owe it to the victims of Srebrenica. I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Wicker to do everything we can to support the efforts in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mr. WICKER. I look forward to working on a bipartisan basis to make sure [[Page S5000]] that this peace holds, to make sure that progress is made on the ethnic issues--that we give Bosnians and Herzegovinians every reason to continue to want to embrace Europe and to embrace the United States and to embrace fairness and anticorruption and all the work that it is going to take there. I appreciate the delegation. I appreciate Secretary Albright. I appreciate President Clinton leading the delegation. And I appreciate the indulgence of our fellow Senators in hearing this colloquy. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. American Workers and Overtime Pay Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, too many Americans are still struggling in today's economy. Despite comments by some candidates for President, Americans work hard but still have trouble getting by. We know that Americans on average are working longer hours than workers in almost every other rich country in the world--significantly longer hours. Simply, they are not getting the pay they have earned and the compensation and the lifestyle to which they aspire and have worked so hard toward. For many workers, it feels as though the harder and longer they work, the less they have to show for it. And they are not imagining things. Since the 1970s, middle class wages have been stagnant while the number of hours spent on the job has gone up. In short, Americans are working more for less. The middle class has shrunk in every State in this country. The Pew Research Center studies show that the share of adults in middle-income households has fallen from 61 percent in 1970 to 51 percent in 2013. In Ohio the share of families that are middle class is now below 50 percent. We need to do more to build on-ramps for middle-class hard- working Americans instead of saying that Americans are not working hard enough, instead of asking workers to do more and more for less money. It is not uncommon today for salaried workers--salaried workers, not millionaire salaried workers but lower income and middle-income salaried workers--to work 50-, 60-, 70-hour weeks without getting a cent in overtime. When workers put in extra time, it should be reflected in their paychecks. Right now a number of employers are gaming the system to avoid paying overtime, and American workers are losing wages as a result. It is past time for overtime hours to mean overtime pay again. That is why my colleagues and I sent a letter to the President earlier this year urging the administration to restore the strength of overtime payrolls. Forty years ago, we as a nation decided that most workers, whether they were paid hourly or a salary, should receive overtime pay when working more than 40 hours a week, but the teeth in that law have been eroded. The strength of that law, the power of that law, and the effectiveness of that law have been eroded over the past 40 years. In 1975, 65 percent of all salaried workers were covered by overtime pay rules. Currently, just 8 percent of salaried workers are covered. That could be a night manager in a fast food restaurant making $30,000 a year classified as management--classified because that person is salaried--and asked to work more than 40 hours and still only making $30,000 a year. So 40 years ago, 65 percent of salaried workers would have been paid time and a half for those extra hours beyond 40 for that night manager, but today they don't get paid over time. They may work 50 hours, they may work 60 hours, but they simply are not compensated for it. The salary threshold of $23,600 a year has remained static for decades because it hasn't been indexed for inflation. So in 1975, somebody making $23,000 a year was paid overtime for beyond 40 hours. Today someone making $23,000 a year isn't. If they are making $30,000 or $40,000, they aren't paid overtime. So we see what has happened. The salary threshold was put in place to exempt highly paid executives, but because it hasn't increased in 40 years--they didn't build an inflation number into it or a cost of living adjustment--instead of hitting CEOs and lawyers who shouldn't get paid overtime in hours excess of 40, workers earning as little as $455 a week now go without overtime pay just because they are salaried and just because they are called management. It allows employers the opportunity to put somebody on salary, work them many more hours, and then fail to compensate them. The current threshold is now so low that it is below the poverty line for a family of four. So a salaried worker making a few dollars below the poverty line and working 50 or 60 hours doesn't get paid overtime. That is actually what has happened. The American public is starting to understand this, and that is why so many people are calling on the President to do this. Overtime pay should be available to everyone who puts in the extra time--not just those earning a poverty level wage. That is why I applaud the Department of Labor's proposed rule that would strengthen overtime standards and take them back--not quite even as good, but we are pretty satisfied with this--to the 1975 level. The new rule will more than double the salary threshold for earning overtime pay from $23,000 annually to $50,000. That would mean that 40 percent of salaried workers are now eligible for overtime. In my State, as a result of this rule, 160,000 Ohioans would get a raise, as would 5 million Americans in States such as Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and all over this country. This means more money in the pockets of American workers. The rule proposes lengthening the threshold to the 40th percentile of income for full-time salaried workers instead of setting a raw number. This means that the strength of the rule is less likely to erode over time. Not only will this rule help families make ends meet, it also boosts consumer spending, creates jobs, and bolsters the American economy. Just like raising the minimum wage, when more money is put in the pocket of somebody making $8 an hour or $9 an hour or when you put more money in the pocket of a midlevel manager making $30,000 a year in a fast-food restaurant--if you put more money in their pocket--they are going to spend that money. They are not going to invest that money in a Swiss bank account. They are going to spend that money in the community, buy more groceries, go into the hardware stores and do more to fix up their houses and do more to generate economic activity and create jobs for our economy. But there is still more we need to do to support American workers. This is an important step toward building our middle class. There is still more we need to do to support American workers. We need to give hourly workers a raise by raising the minimum wage. The legislation a number of us on the floor have worked on, the Raise the Wage Act, would increase the minimum wage incrementally to $12 an hour by 2020, giving a raise to 1 million Ohioans, 28 million people across the country--1 million Ohioans. Tipped workers shouldn't have to struggle to get by. They deserve to earn a living wage to help put food on the table. Lots of people in this body are unaware, as some Americans are. People here should be more aware of it, but people here tend not to know people that work in diners. People who work in diners as waitresses and waiters in diners can be paid as little as $2.13 an hour. The minimum wage for working in a diner in a so-called tipped wage or for the people who push wheelchairs in airports or in some case for many other kinds of jobs is $2.13 an hour. It is not $7.25, which is the minimum wage for everyone else. That is why we need to move on raising the minimum wage, on bringing the tipped wage up to at least 70 percent of the minimum wage. Workers will be happier and they will be more productive when they are healthy, when they are making decent salaries, making a little bit better wages. Americans also deserve a day off when they get sick. Forty-three million Americans--2 million in my State--have no paid sick leave at all. They are faced with impossible choices. Do they stay home to care for a sick child or go to work so they can put food on the table? Workers are happier and more productive when they are healthy. Guaranteeing paid sick leave would save precious health care resources, it would give employers safe and stable workplaces, and it would give families peace of mind. It would mean that [[Page S5001]] workers are not going to work when they are sick, infecting other workers and affecting productivity and profits at that business. That is why we should pass the Healthy Family Act. Overtime is important. Minimum wage is important. The Healthy Family Act for sick leave days is important. All are steps that we need to support hard-working American families. We know what has happened in the economy the last 10 years. We know the wealthiest 5 percent are doing better and better and better. Profits are up for companies. Executives are making bigger and bigger bonuses. But working class, lower-middle-class workers are simply not getting ahead or even able to tread water to stay even, for that matter. The minimum wage will help, paying overtime will help, and the Healthy Family Act will help. The Toledo Blade put it well last week: ``America's widening income gap isn't an inescapable outcome of the free market, but a political choice that can be mitigated with intelligent public policies.'' This is a political choice. We have seen this body and the body on the other side of the Capitol continue to give more tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. We won't invest in infrastructure, we won't invest in working families, we won't help raise wages, we won't help with overtime, and we won't help with workers who just need a few sick days off, as people in bodies such as this typically have. I urge the Department of Labor to finalize their strong overtime proposal as quickly as possible. It will make a huge difference in the lives of millions of Americans. With that, I yield back. 20th Anniversary of the Normalization of Diplomatic Relations Between the United States and Vietnam Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here to recognize a historic milestone: the 20th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations between the United States and Vietnam. This occasion has some personal significance for me and my family. My father served as Deputy Ambassador to Vietnam; in effect, the chief operating officer of that conflict. I lived with him in that country for several months during the Vietnam war. If he were alive today, he would be proud of the work both countries have done to reconcile our past. It took immense courage on both sides to look beyond the scars of that war and envision a future in which our two countries could become partners and friends. No one embodies this courage more than our friend John McCain, who played a major role in establishing diplomatic relations between our two countries, and Secretary of State John Kerry, then a Senator, who was his Democratic partner. Given Senator McCain's experience as a prisoner in Vietnam, his subsequent efforts to strengthen the peace and forgiveness between our two Nations are an enduring inspiration, the power of which I was privileged to see firsthand when I traveled with Senator McCain to Hanoi in 2012 and 2014. Senator McCain said 20 years ago, ``I believe it is my duty to encourage this country to build from the losses and the hopes of our tragic war in Vietnam a better peace for both the American and the Vietnamese people.'' Today, the American and the Vietnamese people can be proud of the progress made to forge a lasting peace and friendship. Two years ago, President Obama and Vietnamese President Truong Tan Sang launched the U.S.-Vietnam Comprehensive Partnership, opening a new phase of bilateral relations between our nations based on mutual respect and common interests. I met recently with Nguyen Phu Trong, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam to discuss our shared interests and opportunities for closer collaboration on a range of issues, including regional stability, economic cooperation, and the lingering human and environmental consequences of that war. I had the honor of meeting with General Secretary Trong while traveling to Vietnam with Senator McCain last summer. I am pleased he has made this historic visit to the United States. I am hopeful Vietnam will bring our interests and values into closer alignment, particularly on human rights, the rights of civil society, transparency, and good governance issues. To that end, I look forward to working together to achieve closer ties. As the United States and Vietnam continue to deepen our relationship, we should continue to address the legacies of that war, particularly the health effects and environmental contamination associated with Agent Orange and other herbicides. Here at home, we take our commitment to caring for our veterans very seriously. Although the war has ended, many American veterans and their families still battle a range of health problems and serious diseases associated with their service in Vietnam. We must ensure that veterans get the care they need to combat the long-term health problems related to exposure to Agent Orange. Those contamination and health problems are also serious in Vietnam. I am grateful for Senator Leahy's leadership on the Appropriations Committee, which has enabled the United States to pursue remediation projects to clean up the dioxin contamination at Da Nang International Airport and other hot spots and to support related health and disability programs. I urge all of us that we continue to support these initiatives which strengthen our bilateral relationship. Considerable work remains. According to initial assessments of Bien Hoa Air Base, the contamination there is more severe and cleanup is expected to be more complex and costly than at Da Nang. In addition, health-related problems and disabilities persist in areas sprayed with Agent Orange or otherwise contaminated by dioxin. In 2008, actor, advocate, and long-time friend Dick Hughes brought this issue closely to my attention and he has shared with me compelling stories about Vietnamese families who have been affected by diseases and disabilities related to Agent Orange exposure. Some of the suffering ascribed to Agent Orange has been harrowing and heartbreaking. Dick has years of experience working on humanitarian issues in Vietnam and is a compelling witness to that suffering. We first met when I was a teenager in Saigon and Dick had established a program called the Shoeshine Boys Project, to care for homeless children who had been orphaned or left alone during the war. He brought them together and sent them on the streets with shoeshine boxes as a way of making a living and finding something they could do and provided them care and a home when they came home at nightfall. Over 8 years, that project helped thousands of children in cities all across Vietnam. Dick attributes the success of that project to close partnerships forged with local communities and the project's management by Vietnamese citizens. When Dick returned to the United States, he continued to advocate for postwar humanitarian causes and he started a foundation to raise awareness about the effects of Agent Orange on the Vietnamese population. Dick remains a trusted friend and tireless advocate to the Vietnamese people. As our two countries work together on a new and more engaged future, we should expand our efforts to improve the health and well-being of the Vietnamese people. We can learn from Dick's experience about the power of partnership and the value of local leadership, and together we can continue to repair the damage--physical, psychological, and political--of the path we share. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin. Amendment No. 2093 Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Student Non-Discrimination Act, which Senator Franken is offering as an amendment to the Every Child Achieves Act. The Student Non- Discrimination Act would help protect our students from bullying, harassment, and discrimination. I am a proud cosponsor of this amendment and hopeful the Senate will agree to this amendment this week. As we consider the Every Child Achieves Act, as we did in committee back in April, and as we have discussed it on the floor over the last week, I have been guided by a core principle: that this law should ensure that every [[Page S5002]] child, regardless of his or her background, regardless of his or her family's income, has access to the opportunities provided by a great education, a high-quality education. Now, part of providing that opportunity is ensuring that every student is able to come to school and succeed in an environment that is safe, supportive, and free from discrimination. While the Every Child Achieves Act helps advance opportunity for students in numerous ways, it falls short in addressing a significant problem limiting the achievement of some of our most vulnerable students. Unfortunately, there are still far too many stories of harassment, of bullying, and of discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students at the hands of their peers but also, sadly, sometimes at the hands of their teachers or administrators as well. There remains no Federal law that explicitly protects these students and provides them and their families with recourse when they face bullying and harassment that limits their educational opportunities. No student can achieve if he cannot feel safe at school. No student will excel if she spends each day in fear of just being herself. I hear from so many students in my State about the need for us to stand up against bullying. For example, a young woman in Madison wrote to me, and I quote from her letter: [A]s a student myself, I hear the words ``gay'', ``faggot, ``queer'' and others get tossed around . . . daily, and I do what I can to deter these words from being used in negative ways by others, but one voice can't make much of a difference. . . . I'm asking you to help raise awareness in schools anyway that you can. I would tell this young woman in Madison that her voice speaking out on this matter can make a difference. Another young woman from Kimberly, WI, contacted me about her friend who committed suicide after suffering bullying. She wrote: He made everyone else come alive and be the better people that they were inside. But he killed himself because he thought he had no way out of the pain, no way to make those kids stop, other than to make sure he was not living anymore. Across the country, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender or LGBT youth experience bullying harassment at school more frequently than their non-LGBT peers. According to a national survey by the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network, in the past year, nearly three- quarters of students were verbally harassed and more than 16 percent were physically assaulted because of their sexual orientation. More than 60 percent of students who reported an incident of harassment said that school staff did nothing in response. It is unsurprising, then, that nearly one-third of students reported missing school at least once in the last month because they did not feel safe. I believe we must fix this immediately. That is why I support including Senator Franken's Student Non-Discrimination Act as an amendment to the Every Child Achieves Act currently being debated before the Senate. Senator Franken's amendment would provide real and strong protections for LGBT students in public, elementary, and secondary schools. It would also provide recourse through the Department of Education and, if necessary, in the courts to help students vindicate their rights. This amendment is closely modeled on existing Federal education protections, which have helped ensure that students have remedies when they face unfair treatment based on race, ethnicity, sex, and disability. LGBT students are just as deserving of the opportunity to succeed in the school environment that is supportive and nurturing rather than discriminatory and unwelcoming. If we are truly to ensure through this legislation that every child achieves, we must act to address the bullying, harassment, and discrimination that limits educational opportunities of too many students. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader. Cloture Motion Mr. McCONNELL.

Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1177, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 1177) to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to ensure that every child achieves. Pending: Alexander/Murray amendment No. 2089, in the nature of a substitute. Murray (for Peters) amendment No. 2095 (to amendment No. 2089), to allow local educational agencies to use parent and family engagement funds for financial literacy activities. Murray (for Warren/Gardner) amendment No. 2120 (to amendment No. 2089), to amend section 1111(d) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 regarding the cross-tabulation of student data. Alexander (for Kirk) amendment No. 2161 (to amendment No. 2089), to ensure that States measure and report on indicators of student access to critical educational resources and identify disparities in such resources.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I believe that providing all of our students with a quality education is one of our most important national priorities. The workforce in the years to come will depend on today's students being able to create and take on the jobs of tomorrow, and providing students with the chance to learn, grow, and thrive will help our country continue to compete and lead in the 21st-century global economy. Today we are continuing our work on the Senate floor to make sure all of our students have access to a quality education by working to fix the badly broken No Child Left Behind law. I thank Chairman Alexander, the senior Senator from Tennessee, for working with me on this bipartisan bill. He has been a great partner throughout this process. The bipartisan bill, the Every Child Achieves Act, is a good step in the right direction. It gives our States more flexibility while also including Federal guardrails to make sure all students have access to a quality public education. But I want to work, of course, to continue to improve and strengthen this bill throughout this process on the Senate floor. I want to make sure struggling schools get the resources they need. I want to make sure all of our kids, especially our most vulnerable students, are able to succeed in the classroom. Finishing this process and getting a bill signed into law isn't going to be easy. Nothing in Congress ever is. But students and parents and teachers in communities across our country--including in my home State of Washington--are looking to Congress to fix this broken law. We cannot let them down. We need to work across the aisle to provide a quality education for all students, regardless of where they live or how they learn or how much money their parents make. So I look forward to continuing to work with Chairman Alexander as we move this through the Senate floor and to conference--and I think he agrees with me--and, hopefully, to the President to get it signed into law. I see the chairman is here. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I do agree with the Senator on our goal. We had a good week last week. We had a large number of amendments that were agreed to, a number were adopted in addition to ones we had in committee. We need to finish this week. We need Senators to do what members of the committee did, which is to pursue a result exercising some restraint. If we all insist on everything we have a right to insist on, nothing would ever happen. As Senator Murray said, teachers, Governors, school boards, and parents are expecting us to get this job done. We can do it. The House did its part last week. We can finish our work this week. Put it together and then she is correct, we want a result, not just a political speech, which means we need to have the President's signature in the end. So we have a bipartisan process. We are 7 years overdue. This is a bill everybody in the country who cares about education wants us to act on. We have had a remarkable consensus on what we need to do. Basically, what we are saying is that we want to keep the important measurements of student achievement so parents and teachers and communities can know how children are doing, how schools are doing, whether anyone is being left behind, but we want to restore to States and local school boards and communities and classroom teachers the responsibility for deciding what to do about the results of those tests and make sure they are appropriate and make sure there are not too many tests. We believe that is the real way to improve teaching, to improve schools, and to have real accountability. So we have taken lots of different opinions and we have put them together in a bill. I was thinking over the weekend, having a bill on elementary and secondary education is like going to a football game at the University of Tennessee. There are 100,000 people in the stands, and they all are experts on football, whether it is Iowa or Washington or Tennessee. Well, we are all experts--and so are most of our citizens experts on education--but we need to have a consensus here. We are close to one. I thank Senator Murray and the majority leader and the Democratic leader for creating an environment in which we so far have been able to succeed. Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. [[Page S4995]] Mr. DAINES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Nuclear Agreement With Iran Mr. DAINES. Madam President, as we speak, negotiations are ongoing between Iran and the P5+1 countries regarding one of the greatest threats to global security today; that is, a potentially nuclear- capable Iran. If both sides reach a final negotiated agreement, this body will have to consider whether the agreement truly prevents Iran from becoming a nuclear state or whether it paves the way for the leading state sponsor of terror to obtain a nuclear weapon. Agreeing to a bad deal would pose a serious threat to the national security of the United States, to Israel, and our other allies. We cannot take this decision lightly. We should not base our votes on the legacy of the President. We will be dealing with the consequences of this potential agreement long after President Obama leaves office. There are specific terms of any final agreement that are vital to preventing Iran's nuclear weapons capability. One-hundred percent certainty is impossible in matters of intelligence, particularly with a regime like Iran's that has a history of being less than forthright about its nuclear program. In fact, on June 21, the Iranian Parliament voted to bar inspectors from military sites. As they were passing this resolution to bar inspectors from military sites, they were chanting ``Death to America.'' Let's not forget that Iran is the leading state sponsor of terrorism in the world. It is critical that the International Atomic Energy Agency be able to conduct extensive inspections at all military facilities, including unannounced inspections, to ensure that Iran is upholding its commitments. A final deal must ensure that we have verifiable evidence that Iran is complying with the terms of the agreement before lifting sanctions. A final deal must permit international inspection to occur anytime, anywhere. A final deal must require Iran to disclose and dismantle its nuclear infrastructure, its uranium stockpile, and all other aspects of its nuclear program as specified in six--let me repeat--six U.N. Security Council resolutions. A final deal must ensure Iranians never get a nuclear weapon. If Iran does violate these terms, the deal must guarantee that strong sanctions go back into place immediately. It took years to get in place the sanctions we have today. It was largely because of these sanctions that Iran was forced to come to the negotiating table. The sanctions are working. I would also like to address the notion that we either come to a deal or we resort to military action. This is a false choice. In fact, accepting a bad deal now will make military action more likely down the road. A bad deal will provide Iran with an influx of cash to continue sponsoring terrorism around the world, while failing to prevent them from ultimately obtaining a nuclear weapon when this deal expires. Like so many Montanans I have heard from, I truly hope negotiations are successful. However, I am concerned the that based on the framework agreement that we have seen so far, the final agreement will ultimately fail to safeguard our national security and prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. No deal is better than a bad deal. If the final agreement the President presents falls short of the requirements I have talked about today, I will not support it. Over the past month, we have now blown through four deadlines. It is starting to look like Groundhog Day in Vienna. safe kids act Madam President, on a separate note, this past week the Senate began debating legislation about our Nation's educational system. In the same week, we learned more about a major data breach at the Office of Personnel Management, which put more than 21 million American's personnel information at risk. Those events and the policy debates bring to light an issue that often does not gather a lot of information; that is, protecting our student's personal information and data in the digital age. As a father of four, this issue is particularly personal to me. To date, countless schools across the United States utilize electronic records to update student information and transfer data from one school to another. But as the data is collected, it is important students' privacy is maintained and that the data is being stored safely and securely. In 2014, a working group was formed to address the issue of student data privacy. This group produced the Student Data Privacy Pledge, which intended to set self-imposed principles to ensure that information collected from students is kept both secure as well as private. This week, I will be introducing legislation called the SAFE KIDS Act, that builds on these ideas by empowering the Federal Trade Commission to oversee and enforce the collection, storage, and usage of covered information. This bill will put important reforms in place to protect students privacy, to establish greater security and transparency measures, and to encourage innovation among education technology providers, and better ensure accountability in keeping our students' information safe. As someone who spent more than 12 years in the technology sector, I am excited to see technology being used in innovative ways in our schools. As a father of four, I also want to ensure that there are proper safeguards in place to protect our kids' personal data in an increasingly data-driven world. I also want to thank Senator Blumenthal for joining me this week to introduce this important legislation to protect students' personal information and for his continued work on this issue. With that in mind, I will yield the floor so we can hear more from Senator Blumenthal on this most important issue. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I thank my colleague Senator Daines for his extraordinarily valuable work on this bipartisan bill, which will help protect students, help safeguard the privacy of young people, which would be considered separately from the measure now before us, the Every Child Achieves Act, which will strengthen the Federal Government's commitment to ensuring that every child has access to a high-quality education. The bill Senator Daines and I are offering ensures that every child is protected during their education from invasive and intrusive sharing and selling of highly private information about their educational progress--all kinds of sensitive, personal data that are accumulated and collected by school authorities and the companies that contract with them in the course of that child's education. When a parent signs a take-home form permitting their children to use a learning application in math class, for example, they have no assurance right now--none--regarding what information the app company will collect or how the app company will protect that information. That kind of very personal, identifiable, confidential information is inadequately protected in many school systems around the country. If that app company fails to protect the personal information of the student and their family, it could be stolen by hackers. It could be breached. We have seen how Federal files have been breached on a scale that none of us would ever have imagined--supposedly protected information--and we are talking about companies leaving vulnerable children's information potentially on the same scale--millions of children being at risk of their data being breached and stolen by hackers. But we are also talking about that information being bought and sold, exchanged by companies. The current protections against that commercial exploitation are inadequate. Children and their parents and their families deserve better protection of their privacy. It is a big business. It is a huge and burgeoning business for those companies. They may serve a very worthwhile purpose for many of those children and for many school authorities who need someone to organize and apply software to the raw information that is collected in test scores or other kinds of educational data. But it is not data that belongs to the companies; it belongs to the student and the school authorities, and it ought to be protected not only because of who owns it [[Page S4996]] but because of whom it belongs to. It belongs to students as a matter of morality, not just legality. We are introducing student digital privacy legislation, the SAFE KIDS Act. This week Senator Daines and I will introduce it to establish strong and vital protections that will give parents the peace of mind they need and deserve. Our bill would prohibit companies from reselling student data--something corporations should never profit from doing. The SAFE KIDS Act would also prohibit companies from using student data, including a personal profile of a student, for any targeted advertising. This kind of marketing goes on in our society. Our legislation also requires companies that hold student data to enact robust protections, such as proper encryption of that data, which will prevent the theft of personal information. Under our bill, parents are empowered to access their children's information, request corrections of any erroneous information, and request deletion of certain student data. Our bill charges the FTC with the responsibility to implement and enforce the SAFE KIDS Act, and it enables States to enact stronger, more demanding protections if they choose to do so. It establishes a floor, not a ceiling. It does not preempt stronger measures if States choose to move forward. This measure is in no way incompatible with the provision and amendment on which we will vote tonight that deals with another aspect of this issue in establishing a commission. I support that amendment. The commission would issue recommendations on a number of specific topics, such as preventing targeted advertising, limiting data retention, and providing parents with complete information. Those issues are complex, and they need the kinds of studies and research the commission would provide. And the results of that commission would help to inform the FTC regulations that would be issued under the SAFE KIDS Act that Senator Daines and I are introducing this week. I look forward to supporting the Hatch-Markey amendment, voting for it, and I urge my colleagues to support it and the SAFE KIDS Act because they enable a comprehensive approach to student privacy. Make no mistake--this data is in danger and so is the privacy of our students. In a world that has become enormously invasive and intrusive and where personal information is so much at risk, our students, children, and their families deserve this protection. I urge my colleagues to support it. Background Checks and Gun Violence Madam President, I wish to talk for just a moment about the disclosure last week that Dylan Roof, the alleged killer of nine innocent people in Charleston, SC, was able to buy guns without first passing a background check. The reason, very simply, was the default- to-proceed loophole in the law, which allows--but does not require-- firearms retailers to proceed with a gun sale after 3 days if an applicant's background check is still pending. Undoubtedly, more facts will come to light. Certain facts are unknown now as we speak, but the FBI acknowledges that a completed background check would have uncovered Dylan Roof's prior arrest on a drug charge and his drug addiction. Those discoveries would have barred him from purchasing the .45-caliber handgun he used to take nine lives in that unspeakable, horrific tragedy. In effect, Dylan Roof's exploitation of this loophole is not an anomaly. In the last 5 years, the default to proceed loophole has led firearms retailers to proceed with 15,729 gun sales to prohibited persons--people who were deemed ineligible to purchase a firearm once their background checks were completed. In effect, those 15,729 people were able to circumvent the law because of that loophole that enabled them to do so on a default to proceed after 3 days. After that default-to-proceed loophole is exploited, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives then has the difficult, dangerous, and often impossible job to retrieve the firearms that are sold. In fact, it is often impossible to even expect that they can once those firearms are sold without proper recordkeeping or any recordkeeping. We make that job harder every day by underfunding and hamstringing the work of the ATF in our appropriations bills. That creates that impossible task for them. Responsible gun retailers can act today. The law allows retailers to decide whether to permit gun sales to proceed after that 3-day default period has elapsed. They have a duty to ensure that their products do not get into the hands of dangerous individuals. They have that moral duty. They have that social responsibility. In 2008, Walmart, which is the Nation's largest gun store, agreed not to transfer firearms without a background check even if the 3 days have passed without it. The short-term inconvenience to retailers is minimal. In the vast majority of cases, a background check is completed within minutes and the retailer knows whether they may proceed with the sale. After the horror visited on the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, no responsible gun retailer should give the benefit of the doubt and hand over a gun without a definitive completion of that background check. Over the weekend, my colleague Senator Murphy and I urged the Senate Judiciary Committee to immediately review this failure in our background check system and potential remedies, lest this legislative body's silence on the matter be taken as a consent on the repeated failures we have witnessed. In the long run, this system must be made as effective and error proof as possible, and it should be extended to sales not covered now by the law. As Senator Murphy and I and many of our colleagues in the Senate have urged consistently and repeatedly, the failure to adopt a comprehensive, universal background check system is inexcusable, but we also have to make sure loopholes in the current law are eliminated, as the FBI and the Department of Justice have recommended, by extending that 3-day time period and otherwise increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the background check system. Senator Murphy and I will be taking additional steps to try to make it more effective. Gun retailers can step up in the meantime to stop dangerous people from getting their hands on dangerous weapons and taking lives--innocent lives--as happened in Charleston. They can, very simply, stop selling guns to people who have not passed that background check even if the 3 days have expired, even if that default period has come and gone. They can do that on their own. I look forward to working with my colleagues, including continuing the great work Senator Murphy and I have sought to do together in making America safer and better and improving our background check system and making sure commonsense, sensible gun violence prevention measures become the law of the land. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The Senator from Maryland. Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much. Mr. President, first, I compliment the Senator from Connecticut on his initial statement related to student privacy. I think it is an essential element to clarify that privacy is meant to protect but not inadvertently inhibit our ability to give help to those who desperately need it. Certainly, I wish to associate myself with his remarks on doing something about the background check, the timely response. I think the massacre at Emanuel AME Church deeply troubled the Nation, and the very least that can come out of this is not only the flag coming down and all that meant, but other barriers to safety should come down as well. I want the Senator from Connecticut to know that he has my admiration and my support. Protecting Federal Employees Mr. President, while we are waiting for the vote, in approximately 15 minutes, I know Senator Kaine will be coming to the floor to talk about an important postsecondary education remediation reform, but I want to comment on the 21 million Federal employees whose personnel records have been hacked by--it looks like--a foreign government. I am not going to go into the who and the attributing of who did the hacking, but I do want to say that, first of all, those Federal employees need to feel they have a government on [[Page S4997]] their side to now protect them. We should have protected them in the first place with the security of dot-gov and certainly our personnel records. Now, in addition to a bill I have introduced and cosponsored with my colleague from Maryland, Senator Cardin, where we have put in additional credit protection, credit monitoring, and liability protection, I have also sent a letter to the President today. The President of the United States is not only the Commander in Chief but he is the Chief Executive Officer of something called the U.S Government dot-gov, and therefore, OPM is his HR operation. With all due respect to our President, I have called upon him, on behalf of the 300,000 Federal employees and Federal retirees who I have in my State, that they take additional and immediate action to provide lifetime credit monitoring, lifetime credit protection and unlimited liability, and that we also get a new contractor. I know we want to get a new contractor that does security checks, but I want a new contractor that is supposed to be answering the phone. I want a new contractor answering the phone and responding to my Federal employees, and I have conveyed that to the new Acting Director of OPM, Beth Cobert. I think she has a lot of skill and a lot of knowledge. I know she comes to the White House from the private sector, McKinsey & Company, but I conveyed to her that it is outrageous what is happening to Federal employees. They try to call to get help to find out what has happened to them, and they are on the phone for 1 hour or 2 hours, and when they finally make contact, they get disconnected. These are our Federal employees, who we count on, many of whom to protect the Nation--many of whom to protect the Nation. Our cyber shield is down to protect them, and we are also not protecting them in terms of our response to our cyber shield being down. Who are these Federal employees in Maryland? Well, first of all, they are people who work at the National Institutes of Health trying to find cures from dreaded diseases and all of the laboratory staff and so on who support them. Or they are over at FDA or they are over at Goddard Space Flight Center helping to manage the Hubble telescope. In addition to that, we have people involved in and also who are direct hands-on with national security. Maryland is the home to many Foreign Service officers. They not only have the information about their own Social Security numbers and their own health information but that of their spouses and their minor children. We are also the home to the National Security Agency. Most of the National Security Agency is made up of civilian DOD personnel with the highest of security clearances. So my feeling is we have to get in there really quickly to protect them. We have to also do something about this contractor--that he ups his game or we tell him up and out. Up your game or up and out. The third thing is the President really needs to convene an all- hands-on-deck on how we are going to protect dot-gov in this country. There will be more to say about this bill and so on, but I see Senator Kaine is now on the floor to discuss and present his postsecondary remediation amendment, so I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia. Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Maryland, and I second the comments she has made about the status of our employees who have been jeopardized. I am excited to work together on the legislation introduced last Friday to provide them some protection. Amendment No. 2118 Mr. President, I do rise on behalf of an amendment that will be voted on within the next hour, Kaine amendment No. 2118, which is a bipartisan amendment to the Every Child Achieves Act. It is an amendment to promote career readiness indicators and make sure our students, when they finish high school, are not just ready for college but they are ready for careers. This is part of a series of amendments I have worked on in a bipartisan basis, some of which have been included in the underlying bill and one of which was passed as a floor amendment last week. I thank the managers, Senators Alexander and Murray, for working together to support this bipartisan amendment. We need to work to make sure we help all of our students graduate from high school ready for postsecondary education and the workforce. Over the past 40 years, the percentage of jobs that require some form of postsecondary education has doubled from 29 percent to now nearly 60 percent, but the education system hasn't kept pace with the demand for a more highly educated and skilled workforce. More importantly, we need to define what that is--highly educated and skilled--to incorporate career and technical training, which, for a variety of reasons in the last generation or so, was sort of an undervalued part of the spectrum of American public education. Within a very few years--by 2020, when our pages are now going to be out in the workforce--two-thirds of jobs will require at least some form of postsecondary education. But projections demonstrate that as a nation we will fall short by nearly 5 million workers. We are already seeing these shortages and having to deal with them, for example, through specialty visas. That is fine for the economy, but wouldn't it be better if we could train those in school right now to be skilled in the areas where the jobs are needed? The career readiness amendment addresses this problem by encouraging--not requiring but encouraging--States to include in their accountability systems the types of indicators that demonstrate students are ready for postsecondary education and the workforce. These indicators would include State-designed measures to integrate rigorous academics, work-based learning and career and technical education, or technical skill attainment and placement. That will be the core of this bill. By doing this, we send a strong message to schools, businesses, parents, and students that it is critical to be prepared for the workforce of the 21st century regardless of postsecondary education plans. As I have talked to educators, counselors, and parents, they have often commented upon the degree to which career and technical training has sort of been downgraded and that students aren't encouraged in that area, even though there are great professions to achieve in this area. Under the amendment, schools and districts would have an incentive to partner with businesses and industries to provide career pathways for students. It is important for State accountability systems. I say this as a Virginian who is very proud of the Virginia accountability system. It is currently kind of managed by my wife, who is the secretary of education in Virginia. But it is important for these systems to measure and reward schools for helping students earn industry-recognized credentials or earn credit for college while in high school. Just as an example, if you are a Virginia student and you take the Virginia Standards of Learning Test and you pass, that doesn't necessarily mean anything in North Carolina, and much less Oregon. But if you are a Virginia high school student and you pass a Cisco Systems administrator exam, you can take that credential, move to Oregon and get a job tomorrow. These industry credentials are, in many ways, more known, more valued, and more portable than high school credentials State by State. Schools across the country are providing this kind of important learning opportunity. Here are just two examples, and then I will conclude. In Alexandria, just across the Potomac, the Academy of Finance at T.C. Williams High School instructs students in money management skills, financial planning, and business development. Students complete a 3-year sequential program, start working at an on- site credit union in the school, and they get early college credit for that financial literacy. At the other end of the State--in southwest Virginia, in Vinton, near the city of Roanoke--William Byrd High School, after struggling during the 1990s to prepare students for college and career, sought input from nearby businesses and implemented programs in engineering, communication, business, and marketing to match local job needs. These partnerships are helpful [[Page S4998]] in helping students find jobs, and they have also engendered student interest in the curriculum. The school has a 90-percent graduation rate, and 83 percent of students go on to postsecondary education. I want to thank Senators Portman and Baldwin--I think Senator Portman was planning on speaking, and may still--for their involvement and working together with me on this particular amendment and on the Senate CTE Caucus. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan initiative, and again, I thank the bill managers for working together with us. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Capito). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes to make a presentation. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 2080 Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise in support of an amendment I have offered along with my friend, the junior Senator from Massachusetts. This amendment advances an important priority: protecting student privacy in an era of vast data collection and tenuous security protections. Advances in education technology are revolutionizing the way students learn in today's classroom. Going forward, it is important to balance the need for innovation to allow students to take advantage of the new learning tools with the need to make sure children's private information is protected. We must also ensure continuing to improve education through research, while not necessarily allowing researchers and their employers access to sensitive data. To this end, our amendment sets up a commission to come back with recommendations for how to update our outdated Federal education privacy law. The commission's membership consists of experts, parents, teachers, technology professionals, researchers, and State officials--a broad array of leaders capable of providing diverse perspectives on these issues. Within 270 days, the commission is required to report to Congress on the current mechanisms for transparency, parental involvement, research usage, and third-party vendor usage as well as provide recommendations on how to improve the law to better protect students. As we seek to identify the best ways of protecting student data, this commission will serve to outline some commonsense and effective options for reform that we ought to consider. This amendment has received support from a wide variety of organizations from Microsoft to the National PTA to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, demonstrating how this is a commonsense, bipartisan idea that we can all support. I urge my colleagues to support this important innovation. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Under the previous order, the question now occurs on agreeing to amendment No. 2080, offered by the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, for Mr. Hatch. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Blunt), the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Graham), the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Kirk), the Senator from Alaska (Ms. Murkowski), the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Paul), the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Risch), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey), and the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Florida (Mr. Nelson) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced--yeas 89, nays 0, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 231 Leg.] YEAS--89 Alexander Ayotte Baldwin Barrasso Bennet Blumenthal Booker Boozman Boxer Brown Burr Cantwell Capito Cardin Carper Casey Cassidy Coats Cochran Collins Coons Corker Cornyn Cotton Crapo Daines Donnelly Durbin Enzi Ernst Feinstein Fischer Flake Franken Gardner Gillibrand Grassley Hatch Heinrich Heitkamp Heller Hirono Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kaine King Klobuchar Lankford Leahy Lee Manchin Markey McCain McCaskill McConnell Menendez Merkley Mikulski Moran Murphy Murray Perdue Peters Portman Reed Reid Roberts Rounds Sanders Sasse Schatz Schumer Scott Sessions Shaheen Shelby Stabenow Sullivan Tester Thune Tillis Udall Warner Warren Whitehouse Wicker Wyden NOT VOTING--11 Blunt Cruz Graham Kirk Murkowski Nelson Paul Risch Rubio Toomey Vitter The amendment (No. 2080) was agreed to. Amendment No. 2118 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs on agreeing to amendment No. 2118, offered by the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, for Mr. Kaine. The amendment (No. 2118) was agreed to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, there has been some conversation on the floor. We are working out the order of proceeding. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Wicker and Senator Shaheen be recognized first for a colloquy, followed by remarks by Senator Brown, followed by remarks by myself, followed by remarks by Senator Baldwin. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. ALEXANDER. Reserving the right to object, I ask the Presiding Officer, are we in morning business? The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, we are still on the bill. Mr. ALEXANDER. I have no objection. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Mississippi. Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Shaheen and I be allowed to enter into a colloquy concerning the 20th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 20th Anniversary of the Srebrenica Massacre Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from New Hampshire today to speak about a moving and important commemoration that she and I attended over the weekend. We were part of the U.S. delegation led by former President Bill Clinton that traveled to Bosnia and Herzegovina to remember the victims of the Srebrenica massacre 20 years ago. We were honored to be joined in this delegation by Representative Peter King from New York, and I think it is significant that former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was part of that delegation. On July 11, 1995, more than 8,000 Bosniak Muslim men and boys were brutalized and murdered by Serbian forces that overran a United Nations safe haven during the Bosnian war. It was the worst massacre on European soil since the horrors of World War II. Today, Senator Shaheen and I wear green and white flowers on our lapels. These flowers were crocheted by Srebrenica mothers and widows in remembrance of the lives that were lost 20 years ago. The white is said to symbolize innocence, and the green represents hope. It is said to be significant that the center is green because hope remains central to the country's future and to the region's future. Two decades provide us with a helpful benchmark for reflecting on the progress that has been made and on the [[Page S4999]] progress that needs to be made. The decades have certainly not erased the deep scars left by the atrocities at Srebrenica, but the hurt continues to heal. International courts have recognized the massacre as a genocide, and a number of the perpetrators have been imprisoned. Peace is now present in the Western Balkans and we need to do what we can to help maintain this peace. The Bosnian and Herzegovinian leadership is now applying for membership in the European Union. We wish them well in making the progress that will be necessary to attain this status. Tough decisions still need to be made by the leadership, by the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina with regard to governance, corruption, and combating extremes. There is still way too much rhetoric that centers on ethnicity and continues to divide Bosnians rather than unite them. But we can celebrate the fact that this region is no longer home to the suffering and violence that predated the historic Dayton Accords, and we can celebrate the contribution and achievement of the Americans in reaching the Dayton Accords and in getting us to where we are now with two decades of peace. I know that these views are shared by my colleague from New Hampshire. At this point, perhaps she would like to join in this colloquy. Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I would like to join Senator Wicker from Mississippi in talking about what we saw and heard when we were in Bosnia. Unfortunately, the story that came out about that inspiring commemoration was about the attack by some of the Bosniaks who were attending on the Serbian Prime Minister, Aleksandar Vucic, who had attended the ceremony. But the larger story was one of reconciliation. The Bosniak mayor of Srebrenica, Camil Durakovic, condemned the attackers, and he was joined by the Tripartite Presidents in condemning the attackers. After the attack, the Serbian Prime Minister said that it should not distract attention from the innocent victims of Srebrenica. He said that his ``arms of reconciliation remain stretched towards the Bosniaks.'' Fortunately, we heard the same from the mayor of Srebrenica, who actually had invited the Prime Minister. I am very proud of Mayor Durakovic because he is actually a Bosnian- American whose family fled from Srebrenica in July of 1995, and they settled in New Hampshire. He went to high school there, and he got a degree from Southern New Hampshire University. He returned to Srebrenica in 2005 and was elected mayor in 2012. Aside from that isolated, unfortunate incident with the Prime Minister, the ceremony was a solemn tribute and remembrance to the victims of Srebrenica. There was a spirit of unity and harmony. The theme again and again was of reconciliation. As my colleague points out, it is particularly important for us to continue to support this reconciliation, for us to continue to support Bosnia and Herzegovina and their efforts to continue to look west to join the EU. Across many centuries, the Balkans has been a flashpoint for conflicts that have spread to the rest of Europe and the entire world. In fact, 101 years ago next month, World War I began with the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand right in Sarajevo. We walked by the block where he was assassinated. As we have seen most recently in Greece and as we are seeing in the Balkans and in other countries in Eastern Europe, the Russians are quick to exploit any trouble in the southeast corner of Europe in order to spread their influence and destabilize the West. Wouldn't my colleague agree that it is important for us in the United States to join the EU in supporting the Bosniaks, the Serbs, the Croatians, the Muslims, the Orthodox Christians, and the Roman Catholics so that they can come together and show the world that we really can create a multi- ethnic, multi-sectarian state that can serve as a model for the Middle East and for countries around the world? Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I do agree. I would contrast the magnanimous statements of the Tripresidency and the gesture of the Serbian President in attending with the disappointing actions of the Russian leadership, under the leadership of President Putin, in actually vetoing a Security Council resolution simply to commemorate the 20th anniversary as a genocide. Russia refused to accept a well- established fact, confirmed by international courts such as the International Court of Justice, such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. They vetoed--they were the only vote against it, but it acted as a veto--thus keeping the United Nations officially from going on record as saying this was a genocide and that these acts should be condemned. Such defiance is a disservice not only to the victims at Srebrenica but also to relations in the area going forward. I would just contrast that with the very brave step on the part of the Serbian President, coming to Srebrenica and being part of the commemorative ceremony. I will tell my colleagues that former President Clinton spoke on behalf of this Republican and spoke on behalf of Democrats alike, making a very instructive and constructive address at the occasion, specifically commending the Serbian President. I would say, with regard to the rock throwing incident and what the President of Serbia actually did, his glasses were broken, and he and members of his delegation were brought to their knees. I would say that if the 50 or so people who threw those rocks had heard the remarks inside the ceremony, perhaps they would not have felt so bitter as to throw those rocks. I know there are wounds that need to be healed. But I think the conciliatory words inside, if they had been broadcast to the entire crowd, would have perhaps caused that incident, which got all the publicity, not to happen. This was about 50 people causing a disturbance in a crowd of, I would say, about 5,000 people gathered outside. It was a very important ceremony--actually, a funeral, you might say. So I would have to just say that the Russian leadership really should be ashamed of standing in the way of international recognition of this genocide. They thought they were doing their Serbian neighbors a favor, but, on the other hand, the Serbian President stepped forward in a very brave way to create unity in this region, and I think my colleague would agree with that. Mrs. SHAHEEN. Absolutely, and I know Senator Wicker shared my gratitude as we walked through the streets of Sarajevo and as we met people in Srebrenica for the appreciation they showed the United States for our actions in helping to end that awful war in Bosnia and for our actions in supporting Bosnia as they try to look westward and as they try to keep their country moving forward, addressing the corruption and the democracy issues they face. I think it is in our interest as Americans to support those efforts to help them, as they continue to move their country forward, in every way we can. Mr. WICKER. The Senator from New Hampshire is exactly right. It is in the United States' interest that we care about the Balkans, that we care about Bosnia and Herzegovina. We owe it to the U.S. troops who were deployed there in 1995 and later, who kept the peace and made it work. There is no country on the face of the Earth that could have done that but the United States of America. We owe it to the memory of the leadership, not only of President Clinton, who basically hosted the Dayton Accords in the United States of America, but also Republicans such as Speaker Gingrich. It was Gingrich and Clinton who joined together and convinced this government to support the Dayton Agreement and support the necessary deployment to make sure this worked. As the Senator pointed out, we owe it to history going forward to remember that World War I broke out in Sarajevo, that the events leading up to World War II largely occurred in the Balkans, and to do what we can in the interest of U.S. citizens to say that this will not again be a flashpoint for conflict in Europe and conflict internationally. Mrs. SHAHEEN. I know the Senator shares my views that we owe it to the victims of Srebrenica. I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Wicker to do everything we can to support the efforts in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mr. WICKER. I look forward to working on a bipartisan basis to make sure [[Page S5000]] that this peace holds, to make sure that progress is made on the ethnic issues--that we give Bosnians and Herzegovinians every reason to continue to want to embrace Europe and to embrace the United States and to embrace fairness and anticorruption and all the work that it is going to take there. I appreciate the delegation. I appreciate Secretary Albright. I appreciate President Clinton leading the delegation. And I appreciate the indulgence of our fellow Senators in hearing this colloquy. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. American Workers and Overtime Pay Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, too many Americans are still struggling in today's economy. Despite comments by some candidates for President, Americans work hard but still have trouble getting by. We know that Americans on average are working longer hours than workers in almost every other rich country in the world--significantly longer hours. Simply, they are not getting the pay they have earned and the compensation and the lifestyle to which they aspire and have worked so hard toward. For many workers, it feels as though the harder and longer they work, the less they have to show for it. And they are not imagining things. Since the 1970s, middle class wages have been stagnant while the number of hours spent on the job has gone up. In short, Americans are working more for less. The middle class has shrunk in every State in this country. The Pew Research Center studies show that the share of adults in middle-income households has fallen from 61 percent in 1970 to 51 percent in 2013. In Ohio the share of families that are middle class is now below 50 percent. We need to do more to build on-ramps for middle-class hard- working Americans instead of saying that Americans are not working hard enough, instead of asking workers to do more and more for less money. It is not uncommon today for salaried workers--salaried workers, not millionaire salaried workers but lower income and middle-income salaried workers--to work 50-, 60-, 70-hour weeks without getting a cent in overtime. When workers put in extra time, it should be reflected in their paychecks. Right now a number of employers are gaming the system to avoid paying overtime, and American workers are losing wages as a result. It is past time for overtime hours to mean overtime pay again. That is why my colleagues and I sent a letter to the President earlier this year urging the administration to restore the strength of overtime payrolls. Forty years ago, we as a nation decided that most workers, whether they were paid hourly or a salary, should receive overtime pay when working more than 40 hours a week, but the teeth in that law have been eroded. The strength of that law, the power of that law, and the effectiveness of that law have been eroded over the past 40 years. In 1975, 65 percent of all salaried workers were covered by overtime pay rules. Currently, just 8 percent of salaried workers are covered. That could be a night manager in a fast food restaurant making $30,000 a year classified as management--classified because that person is salaried--and asked to work more than 40 hours and still only making $30,000 a year. So 40 years ago, 65 percent of salaried workers would have been paid time and a half for those extra hours beyond 40 for that night manager, but today they don't get paid over time. They may work 50 hours, they may work 60 hours, but they simply are not compensated for it. The salary threshold of $23,600 a year has remained static for decades because it hasn't been indexed for inflation. So in 1975, somebody making $23,000 a year was paid overtime for beyond 40 hours. Today someone making $23,000 a year isn't. If they are making $30,000 or $40,000, they aren't paid overtime. So we see what has happened. The salary threshold was put in place to exempt highly paid executives, but because it hasn't increased in 40 years--they didn't build an inflation number into it or a cost of living adjustment--instead of hitting CEOs and lawyers who shouldn't get paid overtime in hours excess of 40, workers earning as little as $455 a week now go without overtime pay just because they are salaried and just because they are called management. It allows employers the opportunity to put somebody on salary, work them many more hours, and then fail to compensate them. The current threshold is now so low that it is below the poverty line for a family of four. So a salaried worker making a few dollars below the poverty line and working 50 or 60 hours doesn't get paid overtime. That is actually what has happened. The American public is starting to understand this, and that is why so many people are calling on the President to do this. Overtime pay should be available to everyone who puts in the extra time--not just those earning a poverty level wage. That is why I applaud the Department of Labor's proposed rule that would strengthen overtime standards and take them back--not quite even as good, but we are pretty satisfied with this--to the 1975 level. The new rule will more than double the salary threshold for earning overtime pay from $23,000 annually to $50,000. That would mean that 40 percent of salaried workers are now eligible for overtime. In my State, as a result of this rule, 160,000 Ohioans would get a raise, as would 5 million Americans in States such as Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and all over this country. This means more money in the pockets of American workers. The rule proposes lengthening the threshold to the 40th percentile of income for full-time salaried workers instead of setting a raw number. This means that the strength of the rule is less likely to erode over time. Not only will this rule help families make ends meet, it also boosts consumer spending, creates jobs, and bolsters the American economy. Just like raising the minimum wage, when more money is put in the pocket of somebody making $8 an hour or $9 an hour or when you put more money in the pocket of a midlevel manager making $30,000 a year in a fast-food restaurant--if you put more money in their pocket--they are going to spend that money. They are not going to invest that money in a Swiss bank account. They are going to spend that money in the community, buy more groceries, go into the hardware stores and do more to fix up their houses and do more to generate economic activity and create jobs for our economy. But there is still more we need to do to support American workers. This is an important step toward building our middle class. There is still more we need to do to support American workers. We need to give hourly workers a raise by raising the minimum wage. The legislation a number of us on the floor have worked on, the Raise the Wage Act, would increase the minimum wage incrementally to $12 an hour by 2020, giving a raise to 1 million Ohioans, 28 million people across the country--1 million Ohioans. Tipped workers shouldn't have to struggle to get by. They deserve to earn a living wage to help put food on the table. Lots of people in this body are unaware, as some Americans are. People here should be more aware of it, but people here tend not to know people that work in diners. People who work in diners as waitresses and waiters in diners can be paid as little as $2.13 an hour. The minimum wage for working in a diner in a so-called tipped wage or for the people who push wheelchairs in airports or in some case for many other kinds of jobs is $2.13 an hour. It is not $7.25, which is the minimum wage for everyone else. That is why we need to move on raising the minimum wage, on bringing the tipped wage up to at least 70 percent of the minimum wage. Workers will be happier and they will be more productive when they are healthy, when they are making decent salaries, making a little bit better wages. Americans also deserve a day off when they get sick. Forty-three million Americans--2 million in my State--have no paid sick leave at all. They are faced with impossible choices. Do they stay home to care for a sick child or go to work so they can put food on the table? Workers are happier and more productive when they are healthy. Guaranteeing paid sick leave would save precious health care resources, it would give employers safe and stable workplaces, and it would give families peace of mind. It would mean that [[Page S5001]] workers are not going to work when they are sick, infecting other workers and affecting productivity and profits at that business. That is why we should pass the Healthy Family Act. Overtime is important. Minimum wage is important. The Healthy Family Act for sick leave days is important. All are steps that we need to support hard-working American families. We know what has happened in the economy the last 10 years. We know the wealthiest 5 percent are doing better and better and better. Profits are up for companies. Executives are making bigger and bigger bonuses. But working class, lower-middle-class workers are simply not getting ahead or even able to tread water to stay even, for that matter. The minimum wage will help, paying overtime will help, and the Healthy Family Act will help. The Toledo Blade put it well last week: ``America's widening income gap isn't an inescapable outcome of the free market, but a political choice that can be mitigated with intelligent public policies.'' This is a political choice. We have seen this body and the body on the other side of the Capitol continue to give more tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. We won't invest in infrastructure, we won't invest in working families, we won't help raise wages, we won't help with overtime, and we won't help with workers who just need a few sick days off, as people in bodies such as this typically have. I urge the Department of Labor to finalize their strong overtime proposal as quickly as possible. It will make a huge difference in the lives of millions of Americans. With that, I yield back. 20th Anniversary of the Normalization of Diplomatic Relations Between the United States and Vietnam Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here to recognize a historic milestone: the 20th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations between the United States and Vietnam. This occasion has some personal significance for me and my family. My father served as Deputy Ambassador to Vietnam; in effect, the chief operating officer of that conflict. I lived with him in that country for several months during the Vietnam war. If he were alive today, he would be proud of the work both countries have done to reconcile our past. It took immense courage on both sides to look beyond the scars of that war and envision a future in which our two countries could become partners and friends. No one embodies this courage more than our friend John McCain, who played a major role in establishing diplomatic relations between our two countries, and Secretary of State John Kerry, then a Senator, who was his Democratic partner. Given Senator McCain's experience as a prisoner in Vietnam, his subsequent efforts to strengthen the peace and forgiveness between our two Nations are an enduring inspiration, the power of which I was privileged to see firsthand when I traveled with Senator McCain to Hanoi in 2012 and 2014. Senator McCain said 20 years ago, ``I believe it is my duty to encourage this country to build from the losses and the hopes of our tragic war in Vietnam a better peace for both the American and the Vietnamese people.'' Today, the American and the Vietnamese people can be proud of the progress made to forge a lasting peace and friendship. Two years ago, President Obama and Vietnamese President Truong Tan Sang launched the U.S.-Vietnam Comprehensive Partnership, opening a new phase of bilateral relations between our nations based on mutual respect and common interests. I met recently with Nguyen Phu Trong, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam to discuss our shared interests and opportunities for closer collaboration on a range of issues, including regional stability, economic cooperation, and the lingering human and environmental consequences of that war. I had the honor of meeting with General Secretary Trong while traveling to Vietnam with Senator McCain last summer. I am pleased he has made this historic visit to the United States. I am hopeful Vietnam will bring our interests and values into closer alignment, particularly on human rights, the rights of civil society, transparency, and good governance issues. To that end, I look forward to working together to achieve closer ties. As the United States and Vietnam continue to deepen our relationship, we should continue to address the legacies of that war, particularly the health effects and environmental contamination associated with Agent Orange and other herbicides. Here at home, we take our commitment to caring for our veterans very seriously. Although the war has ended, many American veterans and their families still battle a range of health problems and serious diseases associated with their service in Vietnam. We must ensure that veterans get the care they need to combat the long-term health problems related to exposure to Agent Orange. Those contamination and health problems are also serious in Vietnam. I am grateful for Senator Leahy's leadership on the Appropriations Committee, which has enabled the United States to pursue remediation projects to clean up the dioxin contamination at Da Nang International Airport and other hot spots and to support related health and disability programs. I urge all of us that we continue to support these initiatives which strengthen our bilateral relationship. Considerable work remains. According to initial assessments of Bien Hoa Air Base, the contamination there is more severe and cleanup is expected to be more complex and costly than at Da Nang. In addition, health-related problems and disabilities persist in areas sprayed with Agent Orange or otherwise contaminated by dioxin. In 2008, actor, advocate, and long-time friend Dick Hughes brought this issue closely to my attention and he has shared with me compelling stories about Vietnamese families who have been affected by diseases and disabilities related to Agent Orange exposure. Some of the suffering ascribed to Agent Orange has been harrowing and heartbreaking. Dick has years of experience working on humanitarian issues in Vietnam and is a compelling witness to that suffering. We first met when I was a teenager in Saigon and Dick had established a program called the Shoeshine Boys Project, to care for homeless children who had been orphaned or left alone during the war. He brought them together and sent them on the streets with shoeshine boxes as a way of making a living and finding something they could do and provided them care and a home when they came home at nightfall. Over 8 years, that project helped thousands of children in cities all across Vietnam. Dick attributes the success of that project to close partnerships forged with local communities and the project's management by Vietnamese citizens. When Dick returned to the United States, he continued to advocate for postwar humanitarian causes and he started a foundation to raise awareness about the effects of Agent Orange on the Vietnamese population. Dick remains a trusted friend and tireless advocate to the Vietnamese people. As our two countries work together on a new and more engaged future, we should expand our efforts to improve the health and well-being of the Vietnamese people. We can learn from Dick's experience about the power of partnership and the value of local leadership, and together we can continue to repair the damage--physical, psychological, and political--of the path we share. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin. Amendment No. 2093 Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Student Non-Discrimination Act, which Senator Franken is offering as an amendment to the Every Child Achieves Act. The Student Non- Discrimination Act would help protect our students from bullying, harassment, and discrimination. I am a proud cosponsor of this amendment and hopeful the Senate will agree to this amendment this week. As we consider the Every Child Achieves Act, as we did in committee back in April, and as we have discussed it on the floor over the last week, I have been guided by a core principle: that this law should ensure that every [[Page S5002]] child, regardless of his or her background, regardless of his or her family's income, has access to the opportunities provided by a great education, a high-quality education. Now, part of providing that opportunity is ensuring that every student is able to come to school and succeed in an environment that is safe, supportive, and free from discrimination. While the Every Child Achieves Act helps advance opportunity for students in numerous ways, it falls short in addressing a significant problem limiting the achievement of some of our most vulnerable students. Unfortunately, there are still far too many stories of harassment, of bullying, and of discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students at the hands of their peers but also, sadly, sometimes at the hands of their teachers or administrators as well. There remains no Federal law that explicitly protects these students and provides them and their families with recourse when they face bullying and harassment that limits their educational opportunities. No student can achieve if he cannot feel safe at school. No student will excel if she spends each day in fear of just being herself. I hear from so many students in my State about the need for us to stand up against bullying. For example, a young woman in Madison wrote to me, and I quote from her letter: [A]s a student myself, I hear the words ``gay'', ``faggot, ``queer'' and others get tossed around . . . daily, and I do what I can to deter these words from being used in negative ways by others, but one voice can't make much of a difference. . . . I'm asking you to help raise awareness in schools anyway that you can. I would tell this young woman in Madison that her voice speaking out on this matter can make a difference. Another young woman from Kimberly, WI, contacted me about her friend who committed suicide after suffering bullying. She wrote: He made everyone else come alive and be the better people that they were inside. But he killed himself because he thought he had no way out of the pain, no way to make those kids stop, other than to make sure he was not living anymore. Across the country, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender or LGBT youth experience bullying harassment at school more frequently than their non-LGBT peers. According to a national survey by the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network, in the past year, nearly three- quarters of students were verbally harassed and more than 16 percent were physically assaulted because of their sexual orientation. More than 60 percent of students who reported an incident of harassment said that school staff did nothing in response. It is unsurprising, then, that nearly one-third of students reported missing school at least once in the last month because they did not feel safe. I believe we must fix this immediately. That is why I support including Senator Franken's Student Non-Discrimination Act as an amendment to the Every Child Achieves Act currently being debated before the Senate. Senator Franken's amendment would provide real and strong protections for LGBT students in public, elementary, and secondary schools. It would also provide recourse through the Department of Education and, if necessary, in the courts to help students vindicate their rights. This amendment is closely modeled on existing Federal education protections, which have helped ensure that students have remedies when they face unfair treatment based on race, ethnicity, sex, and disability. LGBT students are just as deserving of the opportunity to succeed in the school environment that is supportive and nurturing rather than discriminatory and unwelcoming. If we are truly to ensure through this legislation that every child achieves, we must act to address the bullying, harassment, and discrimination that limits educational opportunities of too many students. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader. Cloture Motion Mr. McCONNELL.

Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1177, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 1177) to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to ensure that every child achieves. Pending: Alexander/Murray amendment No. 2089, in the nature of a substitute. Murray (for Peters) amendment No. 2095 (to amendment No. 2089), to allow local educational agencies to use parent and family engagement funds for financial literacy activities. Murray (for Warren/Gardner) amendment No. 2120 (to amendment No. 2089), to amend section 1111(d) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 regarding the cross-tabulation of student data. Alexander (for Kirk) amendment No. 2161 (to amendment No. 2089), to ensure that States measure and report on indicators of student access to critical educational resources and identify disparities in such resources. Alexander (for Scott) amendment No. 2132 (to amendment No. 2089), to expand opportunity by allowing Title I funds to follow low-income children.

Murray (for Kaine) amendment No. 2118 (to amendment No. 2089), to amend the State accountability system under section 1113(b)(3) regarding the measures used to ensure that students are ready to enter postsecondary education or the workforce without the need for postsecondary remediation. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I believe that providing all of our students with a quality education is one of our most important national priorities. The workforce in the years to come will depend on today's students being able to create and take on the jobs of tomorrow, and providing students with the chance to learn, grow, and thrive will help our country continue to compete and lead in the 21st-century global economy. Today we are continuing our work on the Senate floor to make sure all of our students have access to a quality education by working to fix the badly broken No Child Left Behind law. I thank Chairman Alexander, the senior Senator from Tennessee, for working with me on this bipartisan bill. He has been a great partner throughout this process. The bipartisan bill, the Every Child Achieves Act, is a good step in the right direction. It gives our States more flexibility while also including Federal guardrails to make sure all students have access to a quality public education. But I want to work, of course, to continue to improve and strengthen this bill throughout this process on the Senate floor. I want to make sure struggling schools get the resources they need. I want to make sure all of our kids, especially our most vulnerable students, are able to succeed in the classroom. Finishing this process and getting a bill signed into law isn't going to be easy. Nothing in Congress ever is. But students and parents and teachers in communities across our country--including in my home State of Washington--are looking to Congress to fix this broken law. We cannot let them down. We need to work across the aisle to provide a quality education for all students, regardless of where they live or how they learn or how much money their parents make. So I look forward to continuing to work with Chairman Alexander as we move this through the Senate floor and to conference--and I think he agrees with me--and, hopefully, to the President to get it signed into law. I see the chairman is here. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee. Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I do agree with the Senator on our goal. We had a good week last week. We had a large number of amendments that were agreed to, a number were adopted in addition to ones we had in committee. We need to finish this week. We need Senators to do what members of the committee did, which is to pursue a result exercising some restraint. If we all insist on everything we have a right to insist on, nothing would ever happen. As Senator Murray said, teachers, Governors, school boards, and parents are expecting us to get this job done. We can do it. The House did its part last week. We can finish our work this week. Put it together and then she is correct, we want a result, not just a political speech, which means we need to have the President's signature in the end. So we have a bipartisan process. We are 7 years overdue. This is a bill everybody in the country who cares about education wants us to act on. We have had a remarkable consensus on what we need to do. Basically, what we are saying is that we want to keep the important measurements of student achievement so parents and teachers and communities can know how children are doing, how schools are doing, whether anyone is being left behind, but we want to restore to States and local school boards and communities and classroom teachers the responsibility for deciding what to do about the results of those tests and make sure they are appropriate and make sure there are not too many tests. We believe that is the real way to improve teaching, to improve schools, and to have real accountability. So we have taken lots of different opinions and we have put them together in a bill. I was thinking over the weekend, having a bill on elementary and secondary education is like going to a football game at the University of Tennessee. There are 100,000 people in the stands, and they all are experts on football, whether it is Iowa or Washington or Tennessee. Well, we are all experts--and so are most of our citizens experts on education--but we need to have a consensus here. We are close to one. I thank Senator Murray and the majority leader and the Democratic leader for creating an environment in which we so far have been able to succeed. Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. [[Page S4995]] Mr. DAINES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Nuclear Agreement With Iran Mr. DAINES. Madam President, as we speak, negotiations are ongoing between Iran and the P5+1 countries regarding one of the greatest threats to global security today; that is, a potentially nuclear- capable Iran. If both sides reach a final negotiated agreement, this body will have to consider whether the agreement truly prevents Iran from becoming a nuclear state or whether it paves the way for the leading state sponsor of terror to obtain a nuclear weapon. Agreeing to a bad deal would pose a serious threat to the national security of the United States, to Israel, and our other allies. We cannot take this decision lightly. We should not base our votes on the legacy of the President. We will be dealing with the consequences of this potential agreement long after President Obama leaves office. There are specific terms of any final agreement that are vital to preventing Iran's nuclear weapons capability. One-hundred percent certainty is impossible in matters of intelligence, particularly with a regime like Iran's that has a history of being less than forthright about its nuclear program. In fact, on June 21, the Iranian Parliament voted to bar inspectors from military sites. As they were passing this resolution to bar inspectors from military sites, they were chanting ``Death to America.'' Let's not forget that Iran is the leading state sponsor of terrorism in the world. It is critical that the International Atomic Energy Agency be able to conduct extensive inspections at all military facilities, including unannounced inspections, to ensure that Iran is upholding its commitments. A final deal must ensure that we have verifiable evidence that Iran is complying with the terms of the agreement before lifting sanctions. A final deal must permit international inspection to occur anytime, anywhere. A final deal must require Iran to disclose and dismantle its nuclear infrastructure, its uranium stockpile, and all other aspects of its nuclear program as specified in six--let me repeat--six U.N. Security Council resolutions. A final deal must ensure Iranians never get a nuclear weapon. If Iran does violate these terms, the deal must guarantee that strong sanctions go back into place immediately. It took years to get in place the sanctions we have today. It was largely because of these sanctions that Iran was forced to come to the negotiating table. The sanctions are working. I would also like to address the notion that we either come to a deal or we resort to military action. This is a false choice. In fact, accepting a bad deal now will make military action more likely down the road. A bad deal will provide Iran with an influx of cash to continue sponsoring terrorism around the world, while failing to prevent them from ultimately obtaining a nuclear weapon when this deal expires. Like so many Montanans I have heard from, I truly hope negotiations are successful. However, I am concerned the that based on the framework agreement that we have seen so far, the final agreement will ultimately fail to safeguard our national security and prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. No deal is better than a bad deal. If the final agreement the President presents falls short of the requirements I have talked about today, I will not support it. Over the past month, we have now blown through four deadlines. It is starting to look like Groundhog Day in Vienna. safe kids act Madam President, on a separate note, this past week the Senate began debating legislation about our Nation's educational system. In the same week, we learned more about a major data breach at the Office of Personnel Management, which put more than 21 million American's personnel information at risk. Those events and the policy debates bring to light an issue that often does not gather a lot of information; that is, protecting our student's personal information and data in the digital age. As a father of four, this issue is particularly personal to me. To date, countless schools across the United States utilize electronic records to update student information and transfer data from one school to another. But as the data is collected, it is important students' privacy is maintained and that the data is being stored safely and securely. In 2014, a working group was formed to address the issue of student data privacy. This group produced the Student Data Privacy Pledge, which intended to set self-imposed principles to ensure that information collected from students is kept both secure as well as private. This week, I will be introducing legislation called the SAFE KIDS Act, that builds on these ideas by empowering the Federal Trade Commission to oversee and enforce the collection, storage, and usage of covered information. This bill will put important reforms in place to protect students privacy, to establish greater security and transparency measures, and to encourage innovation among education technology providers, and better ensure accountability in keeping our students' information safe. As someone who spent more than 12 years in the technology sector, I am excited to see technology being used in innovative ways in our schools. As a father of four, I also want to ensure that there are proper safeguards in place to protect our kids' personal data in an increasingly data-driven world. I also want to thank Senator Blumenthal for joining me this week to introduce this important legislation to protect students' personal information and for his continued work on this issue. With that in mind, I will yield the floor so we can hear more from Senator Blumenthal on this most important issue. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I thank my colleague Senator Daines for his extraordinarily valuable work on this bipartisan bill, which will help protect students, help safeguard the privacy of young people, which would be considered separately from the measure now before us, the Every Child Achieves Act, which will strengthen the Federal Government's commitment to ensuring that every child has access to a high-quality education. The bill Senator Daines and I are offering ensures that every child is protected during their education from invasive and intrusive sharing and selling of highly private information about their educational progress--all kinds of sensitive, personal data that are accumulated and collected by school authorities and the companies that contract with them in the course of that child's education. When a parent signs a take-home form permitting their children to use a learning application in math class, for example, they have no assurance right now--none--regarding what information the app company will collect or how the app company will protect that information. That kind of very personal, identifiable, confidential information is inadequately protected in many school systems around the country. If that app company fails to protect the personal information of the student and their family, it could be stolen by hackers. It could be breached. We have seen how Federal files have been breached on a scale that none of us would ever have imagined--supposedly protected information--and we are talking about companies leaving vulnerable children's information potentially on the same scale--millions of children being at risk of their data being breached and stolen by hackers. But we are also talking about that information being bought and sold, exchanged by companies. The current protections against that commercial exploitation are inadequate. Children and their parents and their families deserve better protection of their privacy. It is a big business. It is a huge and burgeoning business for those companies. They may serve a very worthwhile purpose for many of those children and for many school authorities who need someone to organize and apply software to the raw information that is collected in test scores or other kinds of educational data. But it is not data that belongs to the companies; it belongs to the student and the school authorities, and it ought to be protected not only because of who owns it [[Page S4996]] but because of whom it belongs to. It belongs to students as a matter of morality, not just legality. We are introducing student digital privacy legislation, the SAFE KIDS Act. This week Senator Daines and I will introduce it to establish strong and vital protections that will give parents the peace of mind they need and deserve. Our bill would prohibit companies from reselling student data--something corporations should never profit from doing. The SAFE KIDS Act would also prohibit companies from using student data, including a personal profile of a student, for any targeted advertising. This kind of marketing goes on in our society. Our legislation also requires companies that hold student data to enact robust protections, such as proper encryption of that data, which will prevent the theft of personal information. Under our bill, parents are empowered to access their children's information, request corrections of any erroneous information, and request deletion of certain student data. Our bill charges the FTC with the responsibility to implement and enforce the SAFE KIDS Act, and it enables States to enact stronger, more demanding protections if they choose to do so. It establishes a floor, not a ceiling. It does not preempt stronger measures if States choose to move forward. This measure is in no way incompatible with the provision and amendment on which we will vote tonight that deals with another aspect of this issue in establishing a commission. I support that amendment. The commission would issue recommendations on a number of specific topics, such as preventing targeted advertising, limiting data retention, and providing parents with complete information. Those issues are complex, and they need the kinds of studies and research the commission would provide. And the results of that commission would help to inform the FTC regulations that would be issued under the SAFE KIDS Act that Senator Daines and I are introducing this week. I look forward to supporting the Hatch-Markey amendment, voting for it, and I urge my colleagues to support it and the SAFE KIDS Act because they enable a comprehensive approach to student privacy. Make no mistake--this data is in danger and so is the privacy of our students. In a world that has become enormously invasive and intrusive and where personal information is so much at risk, our students, children, and their families deserve this protection. I urge my colleagues to support it. Background Checks and Gun Violence Madam President, I wish to talk for just a moment about the disclosure last week that Dylan Roof, the alleged killer of nine innocent people in Charleston, SC, was able to buy guns without first passing a background check. The reason, very simply, was the default- to-proceed loophole in the law, which allows--but does not require-- firearms retailers to proceed with a gun sale after 3 days if an applicant's background check is still pending. Undoubtedly, more facts will come to light. Certain facts are unknown now as we speak, but the FBI acknowledges that a completed background check would have uncovered Dylan Roof's prior arrest on a drug charge and his drug addiction. Those discoveries would have barred him from purchasing the .45-caliber handgun he used to take nine lives in that unspeakable, horrific tragedy. In effect, Dylan Roof's exploitation of this loophole is not an anomaly. In the last 5 years, the default to proceed loophole has led firearms retailers to proceed with 15,729 gun sales to prohibited persons--people who were deemed ineligible to purchase a firearm once their background checks were completed. In effect, those 15,729 people were able to circumvent the law because of that loophole that enabled them to do so on a default to proceed after 3 days. After that default-to-proceed loophole is exploited, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives then has the difficult, dangerous, and often impossible job to retrieve the firearms that are sold. In fact, it is often impossible to even expect that they can once those firearms are sold without proper recordkeeping or any recordkeeping. We make that job harder every day by underfunding and hamstringing the work of the ATF in our appropriations bills. That creates that impossible task for them. Responsible gun retailers can act today. The law allows retailers to decide whether to permit gun sales to proceed after that 3-day default period has elapsed. They have a duty to ensure that their products do not get into the hands of dangerous individuals. They have that moral duty. They have that social responsibility. In 2008, Walmart, which is the Nation's largest gun store, agreed not to transfer firearms without a background check even if the 3 days have passed without it. The short-term inconvenience to retailers is minimal. In the vast majority of cases, a background check is completed within minutes and the retailer knows whether they may proceed with the sale. After the horror visited on the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, no responsible gun retailer should give the benefit of the doubt and hand over a gun without a definitive completion of that background check. Over the weekend, my colleague Senator Murphy and I urged the Senate Judiciary Committee to immediately review this failure in our background check system and potential remedies, lest this legislative body's silence on the matter be taken as a consent on the repeated failures we have witnessed. In the long run, this system must be made as effective and error proof as possible, and it should be extended to sales not covered now by the law. As Senator Murphy and I and many of our colleagues in the Senate have urged consistently and repeatedly, the failure to adopt a comprehensive, universal background check system is inexcusable, but we also have to make sure loopholes in the current law are eliminated, as the FBI and the Department of Justice have recommended, by extending that 3-day time period and otherwise increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the background check system. Senator Murphy and I will be taking additional steps to try to make it more effective. Gun retailers can step up in the meantime to stop dangerous people from getting their hands on dangerous weapons and taking lives--innocent lives--as happened in Charleston. They can, very simply, stop selling guns to people who have not passed that background check even if the 3 days have expired, even if that default period has come and gone. They can do that on their own. I look forward to working with my colleagues, including continuing the great work Senator Murphy and I have sought to do together in making America safer and better and improving our background check system and making sure commonsense, sensible gun violence prevention measures become the law of the land. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The Senator from Maryland. Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much. Mr. President, first, I compliment the Senator from Connecticut on his initial statement related to student privacy. I think it is an essential element to clarify that privacy is meant to protect but not inadvertently inhibit our ability to give help to those who desperately need it. Certainly, I wish to associate myself with his remarks on doing something about the background check, the timely response. I think the massacre at Emanuel AME Church deeply troubled the Nation, and the very least that can come out of this is not only the flag coming down and all that meant, but other barriers to safety should come down as well. I want the Senator from Connecticut to know that he has my admiration and my support. Protecting Federal Employees Mr. President, while we are waiting for the vote, in approximately 15 minutes, I know Senator Kaine will be coming to the floor to talk about an important postsecondary education remediation reform, but I want to comment on the 21 million Federal employees whose personnel records have been hacked by--it looks like--a foreign government. I am not going to go into the who and the attributing of who did the hacking, but I do want to say that, first of all, those Federal employees need to feel they have a government on [[Page S4997]] their side to now protect them. We should have protected them in the first place with the security of dot-gov and certainly our personnel records. Now, in addition to a bill I have introduced and cosponsored with my colleague from Maryland, Senator Cardin, where we have put in additional credit protection, credit monitoring, and liability protection, I have also sent a letter to the President today. The President of the United States is not only the Commander in Chief but he is the Chief Executive Officer of something called the U.S Government dot-gov, and therefore, OPM is his HR operation. With all due respect to our President, I have called upon him, on behalf of the 300,000 Federal employees and Federal retirees who I have in my State, that they take additional and immediate action to provide lifetime credit monitoring, lifetime credit protection and unlimited liability, and that we also get a new contractor. I know we want to get a new contractor that does security checks, but I want a new contractor that is supposed to be answering the phone. I want a new contractor answering the phone and responding to my Federal employees, and I have conveyed that to the new Acting Director of OPM, Beth Cobert. I think she has a lot of skill and a lot of knowledge. I know she comes to the White House from the private sector, McKinsey & Company, but I conveyed to her that it is outrageous what is happening to Federal employees. They try to call to get help to find out what has happened to them, and they are on the phone for 1 hour or 2 hours, and when they finally make contact, they get disconnected. These are our Federal employees, who we count on, many of whom to protect the Nation--many of whom to protect the Nation. Our cyber shield is down to protect them, and we are also not protecting them in terms of our response to our cyber shield being down. Who are these Federal employees in Maryland? Well, first of all, they are people who work at the National Institutes of Health trying to find cures from dreaded diseases and all of the laboratory staff and so on who support them. Or they are over at FDA or they are over at Goddard Space Flight Center helping to manage the Hubble telescope. In addition to that, we have people involved in and also who are direct hands-on with national security. Maryland is the home to many Foreign Service officers. They not only have the information about their own Social Security numbers and their own health information but that of their spouses and their minor children. We are also the home to the National Security Agency. Most of the National Security Agency is made up of civilian DOD personnel with the highest of security clearances. So my feeling is we have to get in there really quickly to protect them. We have to also do something about this contractor--that he ups his game or we tell him up and out. Up your game or up and out. The third thing is the President really needs to convene an all- hands-on-deck on how we are going to protect dot-gov in this country. There will be more to say about this bill and so on, but I see Senator Kaine is now on the floor to discuss and present his postsecondary remediation amendment, so I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia. Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Maryland, and I second the comments she has made about the status of our employees who have been jeopardized. I am excited to work together on the legislation introduced last Friday to provide them some protection. Amendment No. 2118 Mr. President, I do rise on behalf of an amendment that will be voted on within the next hour, Kaine amendment No. 2118, which is a bipartisan amendment to the Every Child Achieves Act. It is an amendment to promote career readiness indicators and make sure our students, when they finish high school, are not just ready for college but they are ready for careers. This is part of a series of amendments I have worked on in a bipartisan basis, some of which have been included in the underlying bill and one of which was passed as a floor amendment last week. I thank the managers, Senators Alexander and Murray, for working together to support this bipartisan amendment. We need to work to make sure we help all of our students graduate from high school ready for postsecondary education and the workforce. Over the past 40 years, the percentage of jobs that require some form of postsecondary education has doubled from 29 percent to now nearly 60 percent, but the education system hasn't kept pace with the demand for a more highly educated and skilled workforce. More importantly, we need to define what that is--highly educated and skilled--to incorporate career and technical training, which, for a variety of reasons in the last generation or so, was sort of an undervalued part of the spectrum of American public education. Within a very few years--by 2020, when our pages are now going to be out in the workforce--two-thirds of jobs will require at least some form of postsecondary education. But projections demonstrate that as a nation we will fall short by nearly 5 million workers. We are already seeing these shortages and having to deal with them, for example, through specialty visas. That is fine for the economy, but wouldn't it be better if we could train those in school right now to be skilled in the areas where the jobs are needed? The career readiness amendment addresses this problem by encouraging--not requiring but encouraging--States to include in their accountability systems the types of indicators that demonstrate students are ready for postsecondary education and the workforce. These indicators would include State-designed measures to integrate rigorous academics, work-based learning and career and technical education, or technical skill attainment and placement. That will be the core of this bill. By doing this, we send a strong message to schools, businesses, parents, and students that it is critical to be prepared for the workforce of the 21st century regardless of postsecondary education plans. As I have talked to educators, counselors, and parents, they have often commented upon the degree to which career and technical training has sort of been downgraded and that students aren't encouraged in that area, even though there are great professions to achieve in this area. Under the amendment, schools and districts would have an incentive to partner with businesses and industries to provide career pathways for students. It is important for State accountability systems. I say this as a Virginian who is very proud of the Virginia accountability system. It is currently kind of managed by my wife, who is the secretary of education in Virginia. But it is important for these systems to measure and reward schools for helping students earn industry-recognized credentials or earn credit for college while in high school. Just as an example, if you are a Virginia student and you take the Virginia Standards of Learning Test and you pass, that doesn't necessarily mean anything in North Carolina, and much less Oregon. But if you are a Virginia high school student and you pass a Cisco Systems administrator exam, you can take that credential, move to Oregon and get a job tomorrow. These industry credentials are, in many ways, more known, more valued, and more portable than high school credentials State by State. Schools across the country are providing this kind of important learning opportunity. Here are just two examples, and then I will conclude. In Alexandria, just across the Potomac, the Academy of Finance at T.C. Williams High School instructs students in money management skills, financial planning, and business development. Students complete a 3-year sequential program, start working at an on- site credit union in the school, and they get early college credit for that financial literacy. At the other end of the State--in southwest Virginia, in Vinton, near the city of Roanoke--William Byrd High School, after struggling during the 1990s to prepare students for college and career, sought input from nearby businesses and implemented programs in engineering, communication, business, and marketing to match local job needs. These partnerships are helpful [[Page S4998]] in helping students find jobs, and they have also engendered student interest in the curriculum. The school has a 90-percent graduation rate, and 83 percent of students go on to postsecondary education. I want to thank Senators Portman and Baldwin--I think Senator Portman was planning on speaking, and may still--for their involvement and working together with me on this particular amendment and on the Senate CTE Caucus. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan initiative, and again, I thank the bill managers for working together with us. With that, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Capito). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes to make a presentation. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Amendment No. 2080 Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise in support of an amendment I have offered along with my friend, the junior Senator from Massachusetts. This amendment advances an important priority: protecting student privacy in an era of vast data collection and tenuous security protections. Advances in education technology are revolutionizing the way students learn in today's classroom. Going forward, it is important to balance the need for innovation to allow students to take advantage of the new learning tools with the need to make sure children's private information is protected. We must also ensure continuing to improve education through research, while not necessarily allowing researchers and their employers access to sensitive data. To this end, our amendment sets up a commission to come back with recommendations for how to update our outdated Federal education privacy law. The commission's membership consists of experts, parents, teachers, technology professionals, researchers, and State officials--a broad array of leaders capable of providing diverse perspectives on these issues. Within 270 days, the commission is required to report to Congress on the current mechanisms for transparency, parental involvement, research usage, and third-party vendor usage as well as provide recommendations on how to improve the law to better protect students. As we seek to identify the best ways of protecting student data, this commission will serve to outline some commonsense and effective options for reform that we ought to consider. This amendment has received support from a wide variety of organizations from Microsoft to the National PTA to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, demonstrating how this is a commonsense, bipartisan idea that we can all support. I urge my colleagues to support this important innovation. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Under the previous order, the question now occurs on agreeing to amendment No. 2080, offered by the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, for Mr. Hatch. Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Blunt), the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Graham), the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Kirk), the Senator from Alaska (Ms. Murkowski), the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Paul), the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Risch), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio), the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey), and the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter). Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Florida (Mr. Nelson) is necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced--yeas 89, nays 0, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 231 Leg.] YEAS--89 Alexander Ayotte Baldwin Barrasso Bennet Blumenthal Booker Boozman Boxer Brown Burr Cantwell Capito Cardin Carper Casey Cassidy Coats Cochran Collins Coons Corker Cornyn Cotton Crapo Daines Donnelly Durbin Enzi Ernst Feinstein Fischer Flake Franken Gardner Gillibrand Grassley Hatch Heinrich Heitkamp Heller Hirono Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Johnson Kaine King Klobuchar Lankford Leahy Lee Manchin Markey McCain McCaskill McConnell Menendez Merkley Mikulski Moran Murphy Murray Perdue Peters Portman Reed Reid Roberts Rounds Sanders Sasse Schatz Schumer Scott Sessions Shaheen Shelby Stabenow Sullivan Tester Thune Tillis Udall Warner Warren Whitehouse Wicker Wyden NOT VOTING--11 Blunt Cruz Graham Kirk Murkowski Nelson Paul Risch Rubio Toomey Vitter The amendment (No. 2080) was agreed to.

The amendment (No. 2118) was agreed to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, there has been some conversation on the floor. We are working out the order of proceeding. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Wicker and Senator Shaheen be recognized first for a colloquy, followed by remarks by Senator Brown, followed by remarks by myself, followed by remarks by Senator Baldwin. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. ALEXANDER. Reserving the right to object, I ask the Presiding Officer, are we in morning business? The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, we are still on the bill. Mr. ALEXANDER. I have no objection. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Mississippi. Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Shaheen and I be allowed to enter into a colloquy concerning the 20th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. 20th Anniversary of the Srebrenica Massacre Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from New Hampshire today to speak about a moving and important commemoration that she and I attended over the weekend. We were part of the U.S. delegation led by former President Bill Clinton that traveled to Bosnia and Herzegovina to remember the victims of the Srebrenica massacre 20 years ago. We were honored to be joined in this delegation by Representative Peter King from New York, and I think it is significant that former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was part of that delegation. On July 11, 1995, more than 8,000 Bosniak Muslim men and boys were brutalized and murdered by Serbian forces that overran a United Nations safe haven during the Bosnian war. It was the worst massacre on European soil since the horrors of World War II. Today, Senator Shaheen and I wear green and white flowers on our lapels. These flowers were crocheted by Srebrenica mothers and widows in remembrance of the lives that were lost 20 years ago. The white is said to symbolize innocence, and the green represents hope. It is said to be significant that the center is green because hope remains central to the country's future and to the region's future. Two decades provide us with a helpful benchmark for reflecting on the progress that has been made and on the [[Page S4999]] progress that needs to be made. The decades have certainly not erased the deep scars left by the atrocities at Srebrenica, but the hurt continues to heal. International courts have recognized the massacre as a genocide, and a number of the perpetrators have been imprisoned. Peace is now present in the Western Balkans and we need to do what we can to help maintain this peace. The Bosnian and Herzegovinian leadership is now applying for membership in the European Union. We wish them well in making the progress that will be necessary to attain this status. Tough decisions still need to be made by the leadership, by the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina with regard to governance, corruption, and combating extremes. There is still way too much rhetoric that centers on ethnicity and continues to divide Bosnians rather than unite them. But we can celebrate the fact that this region is no longer home to the suffering and violence that predated the historic Dayton Accords, and we can celebrate the contribution and achievement of the Americans in reaching the Dayton Accords and in getting us to where we are now with two decades of peace. I know that these views are shared by my colleague from New Hampshire. At this point, perhaps she would like to join in this colloquy. Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I would like to join Senator Wicker from Mississippi in talking about what we saw and heard when we were in Bosnia. Unfortunately, the story that came out about that inspiring commemoration was about the attack by some of the Bosniaks who were attending on the Serbian Prime Minister, Aleksandar Vucic, who had attended the ceremony. But the larger story was one of reconciliation. The Bosniak mayor of Srebrenica, Camil Durakovic, condemned the attackers, and he was joined by the Tripartite Presidents in condemning the attackers. After the attack, the Serbian Prime Minister said that it should not distract attention from the innocent victims of Srebrenica. He said that his ``arms of reconciliation remain stretched towards the Bosniaks.'' Fortunately, we heard the same from the mayor of Srebrenica, who actually had invited the Prime Minister. I am very proud of Mayor Durakovic because he is actually a Bosnian- American whose family fled from Srebrenica in July of 1995, and they settled in New Hampshire. He went to high school there, and he got a degree from Southern New Hampshire University. He returned to Srebrenica in 2005 and was elected mayor in 2012. Aside from that isolated, unfortunate incident with the Prime Minister, the ceremony was a solemn tribute and remembrance to the victims of Srebrenica. There was a spirit of unity and harmony. The theme again and again was of reconciliation. As my colleague points out, it is particularly important for us to continue to support this reconciliation, for us to continue to support Bosnia and Herzegovina and their efforts to continue to look west to join the EU. Across many centuries, the Balkans has been a flashpoint for conflicts that have spread to the rest of Europe and the entire world. In fact, 101 years ago next month, World War I began with the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand right in Sarajevo. We walked by the block where he was assassinated. As we have seen most recently in Greece and as we are seeing in the Balkans and in other countries in Eastern Europe, the Russians are quick to exploit any trouble in the southeast corner of Europe in order to spread their influence and destabilize the West. Wouldn't my colleague agree that it is important for us in the United States to join the EU in supporting the Bosniaks, the Serbs, the Croatians, the Muslims, the Orthodox Christians, and the Roman Catholics so that they can come together and show the world that we really can create a multi- ethnic, multi-sectarian state that can serve as a model for the Middle East and for countries around the world? Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I do agree. I would contrast the magnanimous statements of the Tripresidency and the gesture of the Serbian President in attending with the disappointing actions of the Russian leadership, under the leadership of President Putin, in actually vetoing a Security Council resolution simply to commemorate the 20th anniversary as a genocide. Russia refused to accept a well- established fact, confirmed by international courts such as the International Court of Justice, such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. They vetoed--they were the only vote against it, but it acted as a veto--thus keeping the United Nations officially from going on record as saying this was a genocide and that these acts should be condemned. Such defiance is a disservice not only to the victims at Srebrenica but also to relations in the area going forward. I would just contrast that with the very brave step on the part of the Serbian President, coming to Srebrenica and being part of the commemorative ceremony. I will tell my colleagues that former President Clinton spoke on behalf of this Republican and spoke on behalf of Democrats alike, making a very instructive and constructive address at the occasion, specifically commending the Serbian President. I would say, with regard to the rock throwing incident and what the President of Serbia actually did, his glasses were broken, and he and members of his delegation were brought to their knees. I would say that if the 50 or so people who threw those rocks had heard the remarks inside the ceremony, perhaps they would not have felt so bitter as to throw those rocks. I know there are wounds that need to be healed. But I think the conciliatory words inside, if they had been broadcast to the entire crowd, would have perhaps caused that incident, which got all the publicity, not to happen. This was about 50 people causing a disturbance in a crowd of, I would say, about 5,000 people gathered outside. It was a very important ceremony--actually, a funeral, you might say. So I would have to just say that the Russian leadership really should be ashamed of standing in the way of international recognition of this genocide. They thought they were doing their Serbian neighbors a favor, but, on the other hand, the Serbian President stepped forward in a very brave way to create unity in this region, and I think my colleague would agree with that. Mrs. SHAHEEN. Absolutely, and I know Senator Wicker shared my gratitude as we walked through the streets of Sarajevo and as we met people in Srebrenica for the appreciation they showed the United States for our actions in helping to end that awful war in Bosnia and for our actions in supporting Bosnia as they try to look westward and as they try to keep their country moving forward, addressing the corruption and the democracy issues they face. I think it is in our interest as Americans to support those efforts to help them, as they continue to move their country forward, in every way we can. Mr. WICKER. The Senator from New Hampshire is exactly right. It is in the United States' interest that we care about the Balkans, that we care about Bosnia and Herzegovina. We owe it to the U.S. troops who were deployed there in 1995 and later, who kept the peace and made it work. There is no country on the face of the Earth that could have done that but the United States of America. We owe it to the memory of the leadership, not only of President Clinton, who basically hosted the Dayton Accords in the United States of America, but also Republicans such as Speaker Gingrich. It was Gingrich and Clinton who joined together and convinced this government to support the Dayton Agreement and support the necessary deployment to make sure this worked. As the Senator pointed out, we owe it to history going forward to remember that World War I broke out in Sarajevo, that the events leading up to World War II largely occurred in the Balkans, and to do what we can in the interest of U.S. citizens to say that this will not again be a flashpoint for conflict in Europe and conflict internationally. Mrs. SHAHEEN. I know the Senator shares my views that we owe it to the victims of Srebrenica. I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Wicker to do everything we can to support the efforts in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mr. WICKER. I look forward to working on a bipartisan basis to make sure [[Page S5000]] that this peace holds, to make sure that progress is made on the ethnic issues--that we give Bosnians and Herzegovinians every reason to continue to want to embrace Europe and to embrace the United States and to embrace fairness and anticorruption and all the work that it is going to take there. I appreciate the delegation. I appreciate Secretary Albright. I appreciate President Clinton leading the delegation. And I appreciate the indulgence of our fellow Senators in hearing this colloquy. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. American Workers and Overtime Pay Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, too many Americans are still struggling in today's economy. Despite comments by some candidates for President, Americans work hard but still have trouble getting by. We know that Americans on average are working longer hours than workers in almost every other rich country in the world--significantly longer hours. Simply, they are not getting the pay they have earned and the compensation and the lifestyle to which they aspire and have worked so hard toward. For many workers, it feels as though the harder and longer they work, the less they have to show for it. And they are not imagining things. Since the 1970s, middle class wages have been stagnant while the number of hours spent on the job has gone up. In short, Americans are working more for less. The middle class has shrunk in every State in this country. The Pew Research Center studies show that the share of adults in middle-income households has fallen from 61 percent in 1970 to 51 percent in 2013. In Ohio the share of families that are middle class is now below 50 percent. We need to do more to build on-ramps for middle-class hard- working Americans instead of saying that Americans are not working hard enough, instead of asking workers to do more and more for less money. It is not uncommon today for salaried workers--salaried workers, not millionaire salaried workers but lower income and middle-income salaried workers--to work 50-, 60-, 70-hour weeks without getting a cent in overtime. When workers put in extra time, it should be reflected in their paychecks. Right now a number of employers are gaming the system to avoid paying overtime, and American workers are losing wages as a result. It is past time for overtime hours to mean overtime pay again. That is why my colleagues and I sent a letter to the President earlier this year urging the administration to restore the strength of overtime payrolls. Forty years ago, we as a nation decided that most workers, whether they were paid hourly or a salary, should receive overtime pay when working more than 40 hours a week, but the teeth in that law have been eroded. The strength of that law, the power of that law, and the effectiveness of that law have been eroded over the past 40 years. In 1975, 65 percent of all salaried workers were covered by overtime pay rules. Currently, just 8 percent of salaried workers are covered. That could be a night manager in a fast food restaurant making $30,000 a year classified as management--classified because that person is salaried--and asked to work more than 40 hours and still only making $30,000 a year. So 40 years ago, 65 percent of salaried workers would have been paid time and a half for those extra hours beyond 40 for that night manager, but today they don't get paid over time. They may work 50 hours, they may work 60 hours, but they simply are not compensated for it. The salary threshold of $23,600 a year has remained static for decades because it hasn't been indexed for inflation. So in 1975, somebody making $23,000 a year was paid overtime for beyond 40 hours. Today someone making $23,000 a year isn't. If they are making $30,000 or $40,000, they aren't paid overtime. So we see what has happened. The salary threshold was put in place to exempt highly paid executives, but because it hasn't increased in 40 years--they didn't build an inflation number into it or a cost of living adjustment--instead of hitting CEOs and lawyers who shouldn't get paid overtime in hours excess of 40, workers earning as little as $455 a week now go without overtime pay just because they are salaried and just because they are called management. It allows employers the opportunity to put somebody on salary, work them many more hours, and then fail to compensate them. The current threshold is now so low that it is below the poverty line for a family of four. So a salaried worker making a few dollars below the poverty line and working 50 or 60 hours doesn't get paid overtime. That is actually what has happened. The American public is starting to understand this, and that is why so many people are calling on the President to do this. Overtime pay should be available to everyone who puts in the extra time--not just those earning a poverty level wage. That is why I applaud the Department of Labor's proposed rule that would strengthen overtime standards and take them back--not quite even as good, but we are pretty satisfied with this--to the 1975 level. The new rule will more than double the salary threshold for earning overtime pay from $23,000 annually to $50,000. That would mean that 40 percent of salaried workers are now eligible for overtime. In my State, as a result of this rule, 160,000 Ohioans would get a raise, as would 5 million Americans in States such as Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and all over this country. This means more money in the pockets of American workers. The rule proposes lengthening the threshold to the 40th percentile of income for full-time salaried workers instead of setting a raw number. This means that the strength of the rule is less likely to erode over time. Not only will this rule help families make ends meet, it also boosts consumer spending, creates jobs, and bolsters the American economy. Just like raising the minimum wage, when more money is put in the pocket of somebody making $8 an hour or $9 an hour or when you put more money in the pocket of a midlevel manager making $30,000 a year in a fast-food restaurant--if you put more money in their pocket--they are going to spend that money. They are not going to invest that money in a Swiss bank account. They are going to spend that money in the community, buy more groceries, go into the hardware stores and do more to fix up their houses and do more to generate economic activity and create jobs for our economy. But there is still more we need to do to support American workers. This is an important step toward building our middle class. There is still more we need to do to support American workers. We need to give hourly workers a raise by raising the minimum wage. The legislation a number of us on the floor have worked on, the Raise the Wage Act, would increase the minimum wage incrementally to $12 an hour by 2020, giving a raise to 1 million Ohioans, 28 million people across the country--1 million Ohioans. Tipped workers shouldn't have to struggle to get by. They deserve to earn a living wage to help put food on the table. Lots of people in this body are unaware, as some Americans are. People here should be more aware of it, but people here tend not to know people that work in diners. People who work in diners as waitresses and waiters in diners can be paid as little as $2.13 an hour. The minimum wage for working in a diner in a so-called tipped wage or for the people who push wheelchairs in airports or in some case for many other kinds of jobs is $2.13 an hour. It is not $7.25, which is the minimum wage for everyone else. That is why we need to move on raising the minimum wage, on bringing the tipped wage up to at least 70 percent of the minimum wage. Workers will be happier and they will be more productive when they are healthy, when they are making decent salaries, making a little bit better wages. Americans also deserve a day off when they get sick. Forty-three million Americans--2 million in my State--have no paid sick leave at all. They are faced with impossible choices. Do they stay home to care for a sick child or go to work so they can put food on the table? Workers are happier and more productive when they are healthy. Guaranteeing paid sick leave would save precious health care resources, it would give employers safe and stable workplaces, and it would give families peace of mind. It would mean that [[Page S5001]] workers are not going to work when they are sick, infecting other workers and affecting productivity and profits at that business. That is why we should pass the Healthy Family Act. Overtime is important. Minimum wage is important. The Healthy Family Act for sick leave days is important. All are steps that we need to support hard-working American families. We know what has happened in the economy the last 10 years. We know the wealthiest 5 percent are doing better and better and better. Profits are up for companies. Executives are making bigger and bigger bonuses. But working class, lower-middle-class workers are simply not getting ahead or even able to tread water to stay even, for that matter. The minimum wage will help, paying overtime will help, and the Healthy Family Act will help. The Toledo Blade put it well last week: ``America's widening income gap isn't an inescapable outcome of the free market, but a political choice that can be mitigated with intelligent public policies.'' This is a political choice. We have seen this body and the body on the other side of the Capitol continue to give more tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. We won't invest in infrastructure, we won't invest in working families, we won't help raise wages, we won't help with overtime, and we won't help with workers who just need a few sick days off, as people in bodies such as this typically have. I urge the Department of Labor to finalize their strong overtime proposal as quickly as possible. It will make a huge difference in the lives of millions of Americans. With that, I yield back. 20th Anniversary of the Normalization of Diplomatic Relations Between the United States and Vietnam Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here to recognize a historic milestone: the 20th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations between the United States and Vietnam. This occasion has some personal significance for me and my family. My father served as Deputy Ambassador to Vietnam; in effect, the chief operating officer of that conflict. I lived with him in that country for several months during the Vietnam war. If he were alive today, he would be proud of the work both countries have done to reconcile our past. It took immense courage on both sides to look beyond the scars of that war and envision a future in which our two countries could become partners and friends. No one embodies this courage more than our friend John McCain, who played a major role in establishing diplomatic relations between our two countries, and Secretary of State John Kerry, then a Senator, who was his Democratic partner. Given Senator McCain's experience as a prisoner in Vietnam, his subsequent efforts to strengthen the peace and forgiveness between our two Nations are an enduring inspiration, the power of which I was privileged to see firsthand when I traveled with Senator McCain to Hanoi in 2012 and 2014. Senator McCain said 20 years ago, ``I believe it is my duty to encourage this country to build from the losses and the hopes of our tragic war in Vietnam a better peace for both the American and the Vietnamese people.'' Today, the American and the Vietnamese people can be proud of the progress made to forge a lasting peace and friendship. Two years ago, President Obama and Vietnamese President Truong Tan Sang launched the U.S.-Vietnam Comprehensive Partnership, opening a new phase of bilateral relations between our nations based on mutual respect and common interests. I met recently with Nguyen Phu Trong, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam to discuss our shared interests and opportunities for closer collaboration on a range of issues, including regional stability, economic cooperation, and the lingering human and environmental consequences of that war. I had the honor of meeting with General Secretary Trong while traveling to Vietnam with Senator McCain last summer. I am pleased he has made this historic visit to the United States. I am hopeful Vietnam will bring our interests and values into closer alignment, particularly on human rights, the rights of civil society, transparency, and good governance issues. To that end, I look forward to working together to achieve closer ties. As the United States and Vietnam continue to deepen our relationship, we should continue to address the legacies of that war, particularly the health effects and environmental contamination associated with Agent Orange and other herbicides. Here at home, we take our commitment to caring for our veterans very seriously. Although the war has ended, many American veterans and their families still battle a range of health problems and serious diseases associated with their service in Vietnam. We must ensure that veterans get the care they need to combat the long-term health problems related to exposure to Agent Orange. Those contamination and health problems are also serious in Vietnam. I am grateful for Senator Leahy's leadership on the Appropriations Committee, which has enabled the United States to pursue remediation projects to clean up the dioxin contamination at Da Nang International Airport and other hot spots and to support related health and disability programs. I urge all of us that we continue to support these initiatives which strengthen our bilateral relationship. Considerable work remains. According to initial assessments of Bien Hoa Air Base, the contamination there is more severe and cleanup is expected to be more complex and costly than at Da Nang. In addition, health-related problems and disabilities persist in areas sprayed with Agent Orange or otherwise contaminated by dioxin. In 2008, actor, advocate, and long-time friend Dick Hughes brought this issue closely to my attention and he has shared with me compelling stories about Vietnamese families who have been affected by diseases and disabilities related to Agent Orange exposure. Some of the suffering ascribed to Agent Orange has been harrowing and heartbreaking. Dick has years of experience working on humanitarian issues in Vietnam and is a compelling witness to that suffering. We first met when I was a teenager in Saigon and Dick had established a program called the Shoeshine Boys Project, to care for homeless children who had been orphaned or left alone during the war. He brought them together and sent them on the streets with shoeshine boxes as a way of making a living and finding something they could do and provided them care and a home when they came home at nightfall. Over 8 years, that project helped thousands of children in cities all across Vietnam. Dick attributes the success of that project to close partnerships forged with local communities and the project's management by Vietnamese citizens. When Dick returned to the United States, he continued to advocate for postwar humanitarian causes and he started a foundation to raise awareness about the effects of Agent Orange on the Vietnamese population. Dick remains a trusted friend and tireless advocate to the Vietnamese people. As our two countries work together on a new and more engaged future, we should expand our efforts to improve the health and well-being of the Vietnamese people. We can learn from Dick's experience about the power of partnership and the value of local leadership, and together we can continue to repair the damage--physical, psychological, and political--of the path we share. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin. Amendment No. 2093 Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Student Non-Discrimination Act, which Senator Franken is offering as an amendment to the Every Child Achieves Act. The Student Non- Discrimination Act would help protect our students from bullying, harassment, and discrimination. I am a proud cosponsor of this amendment and hopeful the Senate will agree to this amendment this week. As we consider the Every Child Achieves Act, as we did in committee back in April, and as we have discussed it on the floor over the last week, I have been guided by a core principle: that this law should ensure that every [[Page S5002]] child, regardless of his or her background, regardless of his or her family's income, has access to the opportunities provided by a great education, a high-quality education. Now, part of providing that opportunity is ensuring that every student is able to come to school and succeed in an environment that is safe, supportive, and free from discrimination. While the Every Child Achieves Act helps advance opportunity for students in numerous ways, it falls short in addressing a significant problem limiting the achievement of some of our most vulnerable students. Unfortunately, there are still far too many stories of harassment, of bullying, and of discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students at the hands of their peers but also, sadly, sometimes at the hands of their teachers or administrators as well. There remains no Federal law that explicitly protects these students and provides them and their families with recourse when they face bullying and harassment that limits their educational opportunities. No student can achieve if he cannot feel safe at school. No student will excel if she spends each day in fear of just being herself. I hear from so many students in my State about the need for us to stand up against bullying. For example, a young woman in Madison wrote to me, and I quote from her letter: [A]s a student myself, I hear the words ``gay'', ``faggot, ``queer'' and others get tossed around . . . daily, and I do what I can to deter these words from being used in negative ways by others, but one voice can't make much of a difference. . . . I'm asking you to help raise awareness in schools anyway that you can. I would tell this young woman in Madison that her voice speaking out on this matter can make a difference. Another young woman from Kimberly, WI, contacted me about her friend who committed suicide after suffering bullying. She wrote: He made everyone else come alive and be the better people that they were inside. But he killed himself because he thought he had no way out of the pain, no way to make those kids stop, other than to make sure he was not living anymore. Across the country, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender or LGBT youth experience bullying harassment at school more frequently than their non-LGBT peers. According to a national survey by the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network, in the past year, nearly three- quarters of students were verbally harassed and more than 16 percent were physically assaulted because of their sexual orientation. More than 60 percent of students who reported an incident of harassment said that school staff did nothing in response. It is unsurprising, then, that nearly one-third of students reported missing school at least once in the last month because they did not feel safe. I believe we must fix this immediately. That is why I support including Senator Franken's Student Non-Discrimination Act as an amendment to the Every Child Achieves Act currently being debated before the Senate. Senator Franken's amendment would provide real and strong protections for LGBT students in public, elementary, and secondary schools. It would also provide recourse through the Department of Education and, if necessary, in the courts to help students vindicate their rights. This amendment is closely modeled on existing Federal education protections, which have helped ensure that students have remedies when they face unfair treatment based on race, ethnicity, sex, and disability. LGBT students are just as deserving of the opportunity to succeed in the school environment that is supportive and nurturing rather than discriminatory and unwelcoming. If we are truly to ensure through this legislation that every child achieves, we must act to address the bullying, harassment, and discrimination that limits educational opportunities of too many students. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader. Cloture Motion Mr. McCONNELL.

the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] every child achieves act of 2015 the presiding officer. under the previous order, the senate will resume consideration of s. 1177, which the clerk will report. the senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: a bill (s. 1177) to reauthorize the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 to ensure that every child achieves. pending: alexander/murray amendment no. 2089, in the nature of a substitute. murray (for peters) amendment no. 2095 (to amendment no. 2089), to allow local educational agencies to use parent and family engagement funds for financial literacy activities. murray (for warren/gardner) amendment no. 2120 (to amendment no. 2089), to amend section 1111(d) of

2118 (to amendment no. 2089), to amend the state accountability system under section 1113(b)(3) regarding the measures used to ensure that students are ready to enter postsecondary education or the workforce without the need for postsecondary remediation. the presiding officer. the senator from washington. mrs. murray. madam president, i believe that providing all of our students with a quality education is one of our most important national priorities. the workforce in the years to come will depend on today's students being able to create and take on the jobs of tomorrow, and providing students with the chance to learn, grow, and thrive will help our country continue to compete and lead in the 21st-century global economy. today we are continuing our work on the senate floor to make sure all of our students have access to a quality education by working to fix the badly broken no child left behind law. i thank chairman alexander, the senior senator from tennessee, for working with me on this bipartisan bill. he has been a great partner throughout this process. the bipartisan bill, the every child achieves act, is a good step in the right direction. it gives our states more flexibility while also including federal guardrails to make sure all students have access to a quality public education. but i want to work, of course, to continue to improve and strengthen this bill throughout this process on the senate floor. i want to make sure struggling schools get the resources they need. i want to make sure all of our kids, especially our most vulnerable students, are able to succeed in the classroom. finishing this process and getting a bill signed into law isn't going to be easy. nothing in congress ever is. but students and parents and teachers in communities across our country--including in my home state of washington--are looking to congress to fix this broken law. we cannot let them down. we need to work across the aisle to provide a quality education for all students, regardless of where they live or how they learn or how much money their parents make. so i look forward to continuing to work with chairman alexander as we move this through the senate floor and to conference--and i think he agrees with me--and, hopefully, to the president to get it signed into law. i see the chairman is here. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from tennessee. mr. alexander. madam president, i do agree with the senator on our goal. we had a good week last week. we had a large number of amendments that were agreed to, a number were adopted in addition to ones we had in committee. we need to finish this week. we need senators to do what members of the committee did, which is to pursue a result exercising some restraint. if we all insist on everything we have a right to insist on, nothing would ever happen. as senator murray said, teachers, governors, school boards, and parents are expecting us to get this job done. we can do it. the house did its part last week. we can finish our work this week. put it together and then she is correct, we want a result, not just a political speech, which means we need to have the president's signature in the end. so we have a bipartisan process. we are 7 years overdue. this is a bill everybody in the country who cares about education wants us to act on. we have had a remarkable consensus on what we need to do. basically, what we are saying is that we want to keep the important measurements of student achievement so parents and teachers and communities can know how children are doing, how schools are doing, whether anyone is being left behind, but we want to restore to states and local school boards and communities and classroom teachers the responsibility for deciding what to do about the results of those tests and make sure they are appropriate and make sure there are not too many tests. we believe that is the real way to improve teaching, to improve schools, and to have real accountability. so we have taken lots of different opinions and we have put them together in a bill. i was thinking over the weekend, having a bill on elementary and secondary education is like going to a football game at the university of tennessee. there are 100,000 people in the stands, and they all are experts on football, whether it is iowa or washington or tennessee. well, we are all experts--and so are most of our citizens experts on education--but we need to have a consensus here. we are close to one. i thank senator murray and the majority leader and the democratic leader for creating an environment in which we so far have been able to succeed. mrs. murray. madam president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. [[page s4995]] mr. daines. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. nuclear agreement with iran mr. daines. madam president, as we speak, negotiations are ongoing between iran and the p5+1 countries regarding one of the greatest threats to global security today; that is, a potentially nuclear- capable iran. if both sides reach a final negotiated agreement, this body will have to consider whether the agreement truly prevents iran from becoming a nuclear state or whether it paves the way for the leading state sponsor of terror to obtain a nuclear weapon. agreeing to a bad deal would pose a serious threat to the national security of the united states, to israel, and our other allies. we cannot take this decision lightly. we should not base our votes on the legacy of the president. we will be dealing with the consequences of this potential agreement long after president obama leaves office. there are specific terms of any final agreement that are vital to preventing iran's nuclear weapons capability. one-hundred percent certainty is impossible in matters of intelligence, particularly with a regime like iran's that has a history of being less than forthright about its nuclear program. in fact, on june 21, the iranian parliament voted to bar inspectors from military sites. as they were passing this resolution to bar inspectors from military sites, they were chanting ``death to america.'' let's not forget that iran is the leading state sponsor of terrorism in the world. it is critical that the international atomic energy agency be able to conduct extensive inspections at all military facilities, including unannounced inspections, to ensure that iran is upholding its commitments. a final deal must ensure that we have verifiable evidence that iran is complying with the terms of the agreement before lifting sanctions. a final deal must permit international inspection to occur anytime, anywhere. a final deal must require iran to disclose and dismantle its nuclear infrastructure, its uranium stockpile, and all other aspects of its nuclear program as specified in six--let me repeat--six u.n. security council resolutions. a final deal must ensure iranians never get a nuclear weapon. if iran does violate these terms, the deal must guarantee that strong sanctions go back into place immediately. it took years to get in place the sanctions we have today. it was largely because of these sanctions that iran was forced to come to the negotiating table. the sanctions are working. i would also like to address the notion that we either come to a deal or we resort to military action. this is a false choice. in fact, accepting a bad deal now will make military action more likely down the road. a bad deal will provide iran with an influx of cash to continue sponsoring terrorism around the world, while failing to prevent them from ultimately obtaining a nuclear weapon when this deal expires. like so many montanans i have heard from, i truly hope negotiations are successful. however, i am concerned the that based on the framework agreement that we have seen so far, the final agreement will ultimately fail to safeguard our national security and prevent a nuclear-armed iran. no deal is better than a bad deal. if the final agreement the president presents falls short of the requirements i have talked about today, i will not support it. over the past month, we have now blown through four deadlines. it is starting to look like groundhog day in vienna. safe kids act madam president, on a separate note, this past week the senate began debating legislation about our nation's educational system. in the same week, we learned more about a major data breach at the office of personnel management, which put more than 21 million american's personnel information at risk. those events and the policy debates bring to light an issue that often does not gather a lot of information; that is, protecting our student's personal information and data in the digital age. as a father of four, this issue is particularly personal to me. to date, countless schools across the united states utilize electronic records to update student information and transfer data from one school to another. but as the data is collected, it is important students' privacy is maintained and that the data is being stored safely and securely. in 2014, a working group was formed to address the issue of student data privacy. this group produced the student data privacy pledge, which intended to set self-imposed principles to ensure that information collected from students is kept both secure as well as private. this week, i will be introducing legislation called the safe kids act, that builds on these ideas by empowering the federal trade commission to oversee and enforce the collection, storage, and usage of covered information. this bill will put important reforms in place to protect students privacy, to establish greater security and transparency measures, and to encourage innovation among education technology providers, and better ensure accountability in keeping our students' information safe. as someone who spent more than 12 years in the technology sector, i am excited to see technology being used in innovative ways in our schools. as a father of four, i also want to ensure that there are proper safeguards in place to protect our kids' personal data in an increasingly data-driven world. i also want to thank senator blumenthal for joining me this week to introduce this important legislation to protect students' personal information and for his continued work on this issue. with that in mind, i will yield the floor so we can hear more from senator blumenthal on this most important issue. the presiding officer. the senator from connecticut. mr. blumenthal. madam president, i thank my colleague senator daines for his extraordinarily valuable work on this bipartisan bill, which will help protect students, help safeguard the privacy of young people, which would be considered separately from the measure now before us, the every child achieves act, which will strengthen the federal government's commitment to ensuring that every child has access to a high-quality education. the bill senator daines and i are offering ensures that every child is protected during their education from invasive and intrusive sharing and selling of highly private information about their educational progress--all kinds of sensitive, personal data that are accumulated and collected by school authorities and the companies that contract with them in the course of that child's education. when a parent signs a take-home form permitting their children to use a learning application in math class, for example, they have no assurance right now--none--regarding what information the app company will collect or how the app company will protect that information. that kind of very personal, identifiable, confidential information is inadequately protected in many school systems around the country. if that app company fails to protect the personal information of the student and their family, it could be stolen by hackers. it could be breached. we have seen how federal files have been breached on a scale that none of us would ever have imagined--supposedly protected information--and we are talking about companies leaving vulnerable children's information potentially on the same scale--millions of children being at risk of their data being breached and stolen by hackers. but we are also talking about that information being bought and sold, exchanged by companies. the current protections against that commercial exploitation are inadequate. children and their parents and their families deserve better protection of their privacy. it is a big business. it is a huge and burgeoning business for those companies. they may serve a very worthwhile purpose for many of those children and for many school authorities who need someone to organize and apply software to the raw information that is collected in test scores or other kinds of educational data. but it is not data that belongs to the companies; it belongs to the student and the school authorities, and it ought to be protected not only because of who owns it [[page s4996]] but because of whom it belongs to. it belongs to students as a matter of morality, not just legality. we are introducing student digital privacy legislation, the safe kids act. this week senator daines and i will introduce it to establish strong and vital protections that will give parents the peace of mind they need and deserve. our bill would prohibit companies from reselling student data--something corporations should never profit from doing. the safe kids act would also prohibit companies from using student data, including a personal profile of a student, for any targeted advertising. this kind of marketing goes on in our society. our legislation also requires companies that hold student data to enact robust protections, such as proper encryption of that data, which will prevent the theft of personal information. under our bill, parents are empowered to access their children's information, request corrections of any erroneous information, and request deletion of certain student data. our bill charges the ftc with the responsibility to implement and enforce the safe kids act, and it enables states to enact stronger, more demanding protections if they choose to do so. it establishes a floor, not a ceiling. it does not preempt stronger measures if states choose to move forward. this measure is in no way incompatible with the provision and amendment on which we will vote tonight that deals with another aspect of this issue in establishing a commission. i support that amendment. the commission would issue recommendations on a number of specific topics, such as preventing targeted advertising, limiting data retention, and providing parents with complete information. those issues are complex, and they need the kinds of studies and research the commission would provide. and the results of that commission would help to inform the ftc regulations that would be issued under the safe kids act that senator daines and i are introducing this week. i look forward to supporting the hatch-markey amendment, voting for it, and i urge my colleagues to support it and the safe kids act because they enable a comprehensive approach to student privacy. make no mistake--this data is in danger and so is the privacy of our students. in a world that has become enormously invasive and intrusive and where personal information is so much at risk, our students, children, and their families deserve this protection. i urge my colleagues to support it. background checks and gun violence madam president, i wish to talk for just a moment about the disclosure last week that dylan roof, the alleged killer of nine innocent people in charleston, sc, was able to buy guns without first passing a background check. the reason, very simply, was the default- to-proceed loophole in the law, which allows--but does not require-- firearms retailers to proceed with a gun sale after 3 days if an applicant's background check is still pending. undoubtedly, more facts will come to light. certain facts are unknown now as we speak, but the fbi acknowledges that a completed background check would have uncovered dylan roof's prior arrest on a drug charge and his drug addiction. those discoveries would have barred him from purchasing the .45-caliber handgun he used to take nine lives in that unspeakable, horrific tragedy. in effect, dylan roof's exploitation of this loophole is not an anomaly. in the last 5 years, the default to proceed loophole has led firearms retailers to proceed with 15,729 gun sales to prohibited persons--people who were deemed ineligible to purchase a firearm once their background checks were completed. in effect, those 15,729 people were able to circumvent the law because of that loophole that enabled them to do so on a default to proceed after 3 days. after that default-to-proceed loophole is exploited, the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives then has the difficult, dangerous, and often impossible job to retrieve the firearms that are sold. in fact, it is often impossible to even expect that they can once those firearms are sold without proper recordkeeping or any recordkeeping. we make that job harder every day by underfunding and hamstringing the work of the atf in our appropriations bills. that creates that impossible task for them. responsible gun retailers can act today. the law allows retailers to decide whether to permit gun sales to proceed after that 3-day default period has elapsed. they have a duty to ensure that their products do not get into the hands of dangerous individuals. they have that moral duty. they have that social responsibility. in 2008, walmart, which is the nation's largest gun store, agreed not to transfer firearms without a background check even if the 3 days have passed without it. the short-term inconvenience to retailers is minimal. in the vast majority of cases, a background check is completed within minutes and the retailer knows whether they may proceed with the sale. after the horror visited on the emanuel ame church in charleston, no responsible gun retailer should give the benefit of the doubt and hand over a gun without a definitive completion of that background check. over the weekend, my colleague senator murphy and i urged the senate judiciary committee to immediately review this failure in our background check system and potential remedies, lest this legislative body's silence on the matter be taken as a consent on the repeated failures we have witnessed. in the long run, this system must be made as effective and error proof as possible, and it should be extended to sales not covered now by the law. as senator murphy and i and many of our colleagues in the senate have urged consistently and repeatedly, the failure to adopt a comprehensive, universal background check system is inexcusable, but we also have to make sure loopholes in the current law are eliminated, as the fbi and the department of justice have recommended, by extending that 3-day time period and otherwise increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the background check system. senator murphy and i will be taking additional steps to try to make it more effective. gun retailers can step up in the meantime to stop dangerous people from getting their hands on dangerous weapons and taking lives--innocent lives--as happened in charleston. they can, very simply, stop selling guns to people who have not passed that background check even if the 3 days have expired, even if that default period has come and gone. they can do that on their own. i look forward to working with my colleagues, including continuing the great work senator murphy and i have sought to do together in making america safer and better and improving our background check system and making sure commonsense, sensible gun violence prevention measures become the law of the land. i yield the floor. the presiding officer (mr. perdue). the senator from maryland. ms. mikulski. thank you very much. mr. president, first, i compliment the senator from connecticut on his initial statement related to student privacy. i think it is an essential element to clarify that privacy is meant to protect but not inadvertently inhibit our ability to give help to those who desperately need it. certainly, i wish to associate myself with his remarks on doing something about the background check, the timely response. i think the massacre at emanuel ame church deeply troubled the nation, and the very least that can come out of this is not only the flag coming down and all that meant, but other barriers to safety should come down as well. i want the senator from connecticut to know that he has my admiration and my support. protecting federal employees mr. president, while we are waiting for the vote, in approximately 15 minutes, i know senator kaine will be coming to the floor to talk about an important postsecondary education remediation reform, but i want to comment on the 21 million federal employees whose personnel records have been hacked by--it looks like--a foreign government. i am not going to go into the who and the attributing of who did the hacking, but i do want to say that, first of all, those federal employees need to feel they have a government on [[page s4997]] their side to now protect them. we should have protected them in the first place with the security of dot-gov and certainly our personnel records. now, in addition to a bill i have introduced and cosponsored with my colleague from maryland, senator cardin, where we have put in additional credit protection, credit monitoring, and liability protection, i have also sent a letter to the president today. the president of the united states is not only the commander in chief but he is the chief executive officer of something called the u.s government dot-gov, and therefore, opm is his hr operation. with all due respect to our president, i have called upon him, on behalf of the 300,000 federal employees and federal retirees who i have in my state, that they take additional and immediate action to provide lifetime credit monitoring, lifetime credit protection and unlimited liability, and that we also get a new contractor. i know we want to get a new contractor that does security checks, but i want a new contractor that is supposed to be answering the phone. i want a new contractor answering the phone and responding to my federal employees, and i have conveyed that to the new acting director of opm, beth cobert. i think she has a lot of skill and a lot of knowledge. i know she comes to the white house from the private sector, mckinsey & company, but i conveyed to her that it is outrageous what is happening to federal employees. they try to call to get help to find out what has happened to them, and they are on the phone for 1 hour or 2 hours, and when they finally make contact, they get disconnected. these are our federal employees, who we count on, many of whom to protect the nation--many of whom to protect the nation. our cyber shield is down to protect them, and we are also not protecting them in terms of our response to our cyber shield being down. who are these federal employees in maryland? well, first of all, they are people who work at the national institutes of health trying to find cures from dreaded diseases and all of the laboratory staff and so on who support them. or they are over at fda or they are over at goddard space flight center helping to manage the hubble telescope. in addition to that, we have people involved in and also who are direct hands-on with national security. maryland is the home to many foreign service officers. they not only have the information about their own social security numbers and their own health information but that of their spouses and their minor children. we are also the home to the national security agency. most of the national security agency is made up of civilian dod personnel with the highest of security clearances. so my feeling is we have to get in there really quickly to protect them. we have to also do something about this contractor--that he ups his game or we tell him up and out. up your game or up and out. the third thing is the president really needs to convene an all- hands-on-deck on how we are going to protect dot-gov in this country. there will be more to say about this bill and so on, but i see senator kaine is now on the floor to discuss and present his postsecondary remediation amendment, so i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from virginia. mr. kaine. mr. president, i thank my colleague from maryland, and i second the comments she has made about the status of our employees who have been jeopardized. i am excited to work together on the legislation introduced last friday to provide them some protection. amendment no. 2118 mr. president, i do rise on behalf of an amendment that will be voted on within the next hour, kaine amendment no. 2118, which is a bipartisan amendment to the every child achieves act. it is an amendment to promote career readiness indicators and make sure our students, when they finish high school, are not just ready for college but they are ready for careers. this is part of a series of amendments i have worked on in a bipartisan basis, some of which have been included in the underlying bill and one of which was passed as a floor amendment last week. i thank the managers, senators alexander and murray, for working together to support this bipartisan amendment. we need to work to make sure we help all of our students graduate from high school ready for postsecondary education and the workforce. over the past 40 years, the percentage of jobs that require some form of postsecondary education has doubled from 29 percent to now nearly 60 percent, but the education system hasn't kept pace with the demand for a more highly educated and skilled workforce. more importantly, we need to define what that is--highly educated and skilled--to incorporate career and technical training, which, for a variety of reasons in the last generation or so, was sort of an undervalued part of the spectrum of american public education. within a very few years--by 2020, when our pages are now going to be out in the workforce--two-thirds of jobs will require at least some form of postsecondary education. but projections demonstrate that as a nation we will fall short by nearly 5 million workers. we are already seeing these shortages and having to deal with them, for example, through specialty visas. that is fine for the economy, but wouldn't it be better if we could train those in school right now to be skilled in the areas where the jobs are needed? the career readiness amendment addresses this problem by encouraging--not requiring but encouraging--states to include in their accountability systems the types of indicators that demonstrate students are ready for postsecondary education and the workforce. these indicators would include state-designed measures to integrate rigorous academics, work-based learning and career and technical education, or technical skill attainment and placement. that will be the core of this bill. by doing this, we send a strong message to schools, businesses, parents, and students that it is critical to be prepared for the workforce of the 21st century regardless of postsecondary education plans. as i have talked to educators, counselors, and parents, they have often commented upon the degree to which career and technical training has sort of been downgraded and that students aren't encouraged in that area, even though there are great professions to achieve in this area. under the amendment, schools and districts would have an incentive to partner with businesses and industries to provide career pathways for students. it is important for state accountability systems. i say this as a virginian who is very proud of the virginia accountability system. it is currently kind of managed by my wife, who is the secretary of education in virginia. but it is important for these systems to measure and reward schools for helping students earn industry-recognized credentials or earn credit for college while in high school. just as an example, if you are a virginia student and you take the virginia standards of learning test and you pass, that doesn't necessarily mean anything in north carolina, and much less oregon. but if you are a virginia high school student and you pass a cisco systems administrator exam, you can take that credential, move to oregon and get a job tomorrow. these industry credentials are, in many ways, more known, more valued, and more portable than high school credentials state by state. schools across the country are providing this kind of important learning opportunity. here are just two examples, and then i will conclude. in alexandria, just across the potomac, the academy of finance at t.c. williams high school instructs students in money management skills, financial planning, and business development. students complete a 3-year sequential program, start working at an on- site credit union in the school, and they get early college credit for that financial literacy. at the other end of the state--in southwest virginia, in vinton, near the city of roanoke--william byrd high school, after struggling during the 1990s to prepare students for college and career, sought input from nearby businesses and implemented programs in engineering, communication, business, and marketing to match local job needs. these partnerships are helpful [[page s4998]] in helping students find jobs, and they have also engendered student interest in the curriculum. the school has a 90-percent graduation rate, and 83 percent of students go on to postsecondary education. i want to thank senators portman and baldwin--i think senator portman was planning on speaking, and may still--for their involvement and working together with me on this particular amendment and on the senate cte caucus. i urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan initiative, and again, i thank the bill managers for working together with us. with that, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. hatch. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mrs. capito). without objection, it is so ordered. mr. hatch. madam president, i ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes to make a presentation. the presiding officer. is there objection? without objection, it is so ordered. amendment no. 2080 mr. hatch. madam president, i rise in support of an amendment i have offered along with my friend, the junior senator from massachusetts. this amendment advances an important priority: protecting student privacy in an era of vast data collection and tenuous security protections. advances in education technology are revolutionizing the way students learn in today's classroom. going forward, it is important to balance the need for innovation to allow students to take advantage of the new learning tools with the need to make sure children's private information is protected. we must also ensure continuing to improve education through research, while not necessarily allowing researchers and their employers access to sensitive data. to this end, our amendment sets up a commission to come back with recommendations for how to update our outdated federal education privacy law. the commission's membership consists of experts, parents, teachers, technology professionals, researchers, and state officials--a broad array of leaders capable of providing diverse perspectives on these issues. within 270 days, the commission is required to report to congress on the current mechanisms for transparency, parental involvement, research usage, and third-party vendor usage as well as provide recommendations on how to improve the law to better protect students. as we seek to identify the best ways of protecting student data, this commission will serve to outline some commonsense and effective options for reform that we ought to consider. this amendment has received support from a wide variety of organizations from microsoft to the national pta to the u.s. chamber of commerce, demonstrating how this is a commonsense, bipartisan idea that we can all support. i urge my colleagues to support this important innovation. i yield the floor. the presiding officer (mr. coats). under the previous order, the question now occurs on agreeing to amendment no. 2080, offered by the senator from tennessee, mr. alexander, for mr. hatch. mr. alexander. mr. president, i ask for the yeas and nays. the presiding officer. is there a sufficient second? there appears to be a sufficient second. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk called the roll. mr. cornyn. the following senators are necessarily absent: the senator from missouri (mr. blunt), the senator from texas (mr. cruz), the senator from south carolina (mr. graham), the senator from illinois (mr. kirk), the senator from alaska (ms. murkowski), the senator from kentucky (mr. paul), the senator from idaho (mr. risch), the senator from florida (mr. rubio), the senator from pennsylvania (mr. toomey), and the senator from louisiana (mr. vitter). mr. durbin. i announce that the senator from florida (mr. nelson) is necessarily absent. the presiding officer (mr. lankford). are there any other senators in the chamber desiring to vote? the result was announced--yeas 89, nays 0, as follows: [rollcall vote no. 231 leg.] yeas--89 alexander ayotte baldwin barrasso bennet blumenthal booker

objection. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. the senator from mississippi. mr. wicker. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that senator shaheen and i be allowed to enter into a colloquy concerning the 20th anniversary of the srebrenica massacre. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. 20th anniversary of the srebrenica massacre mr. wicker. mr. president, i am pleased to join my colleague from new hampshire today to speak about a moving and important commemoration that she and i attended over the weekend. we were part of the u.s. delegation led by former president bill clinton that traveled to bosnia and herzegovina to remember the victims of the srebrenica massacre 20 years ago. we were honored to be joined in this delegation by representative peter king from new york, and i think it is significant that former secretary of state madeleine albright was part of that delegation. on july 11, 1995, more than 8,000 bosniak muslim men and boys were brutalized and murdered by serbian forces that overran a united nations safe haven during the bosnian war. it was the worst massacre on european soil since the horrors of world war ii. today, senator shaheen and i wear green and white flowers on our lapels. these flowers were crocheted by srebrenica mothers and widows in remembrance of the lives that were lost 20 years ago. the white is said to symbolize innocence, and the green represents hope. it is said to be significant that the center is green because hope remains central to the country's future and to the region's future. two decades provide us with a helpful benchmark for reflecting on the progress that has been made and on the [[page s4999]] progress that needs to be made. the decades have certainly not erased the deep scars left by the atrocities at srebrenica, but the hurt continues to heal. international courts have recognized the massacre as a genocide, and a number of the perpetrators have been imprisoned. peace is now present in the western balkans and we need to do what we can to help maintain this peace. the bosnian and herzegovinian leadership is now applying for membership in the european union. we wish them well in making the progress that will be necessary to attain this status. tough decisions still need to be made by the leadership, by the presidency of bosnia and herzegovina with regard to governance, corruption, and combating extremes. there is still way too much rhetoric that centers on ethnicity and continues to divide bosnians rather than unite them. but we can celebrate the fact that this region is no longer home to the suffering and violence that predated the historic dayton accords, and we can celebrate the contribution and achievement of the americans in reaching the dayton accords and in getting us to where we are now with two decades of peace. i know that these views are shared by my colleague from new hampshire. at this point, perhaps she would like to join in this colloquy. mrs. shaheen. mr. president, i would like to join senator wicker from mississippi in talking about what we saw and heard when we were in bosnia. unfortunately, the story that came out about that inspiring commemoration was about the attack by some of the bosniaks who were attending on the serbian prime minister, aleksandar vucic, who had attended the ceremony. but the larger story was one of reconciliation. the bosniak mayor of srebrenica, camil durakovic, condemned the attackers, and he was joined by the tripartite presidents in condemning the attackers. after the attack, the serbian prime minister said that it should not distract attention from the innocent victims of srebrenica. he said that his ``arms of reconciliation remain stretched towards the bosniaks.'' fortunately, we heard the same from the mayor of srebrenica, who actually had invited the prime minister. i am very proud of mayor durakovic because he is actually a bosnian- american whose family fled from srebrenica in july of 1995, and they settled in new hampshire. he went to high school there, and he got a degree from southern new hampshire university. he returned to srebrenica in 2005 and was elected mayor in 2012. aside from that isolated, unfortunate incident with the prime minister, the ceremony was a solemn tribute and remembrance to the victims of srebrenica. there was a spirit of unity and harmony. the theme again and again was of reconciliation. as my colleague points out, it is particularly important for us to continue to support this reconciliation, for us to continue to support bosnia and herzegovina and their efforts to continue to look west to join the eu. across many centuries, the balkans has been a flashpoint for conflicts that have spread to the rest of europe and the entire world. in fact, 101 years ago next month, world war i began with the assassination of archduke ferdinand right in sarajevo. we walked by the block where he was assassinated. as we have seen most recently in greece and as we are seeing in the balkans and in other countries in eastern europe, the russians are quick to exploit any trouble in the southeast corner of europe in order to spread their influence and destabilize the west. wouldn't my colleague agree that it is important for us in the united states to join the eu in supporting the bosniaks, the serbs, the croatians, the muslims, the orthodox christians, and the roman catholics so that they can come together and show the world that we really can create a multi- ethnic, multi-sectarian state that can serve as a model for the middle east and for countries around the world? mr. wicker. mr. president, i do agree. i would contrast the magnanimous statements of the tripresidency and the gesture of the serbian president in attending with the disappointing actions of the russian leadership, under the leadership of president putin, in actually vetoing a security council resolution simply to commemorate the 20th anniversary as a genocide. russia refused to accept a well- established fact, confirmed by international courts such as the international court of justice, such as the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia. they vetoed--they were the only vote against it, but it acted as a veto--thus keeping the united nations officially from going on record as saying this was a genocide and that these acts should be condemned. such defiance is a disservice not only to the victims at srebrenica but also to relations in the area going forward. i would just contrast that with the very brave step on the part of the serbian president, coming to srebrenica and being part of the commemorative ceremony. i will tell my colleagues that former president clinton spoke on behalf of this republican and spoke on behalf of democrats alike, making a very instructive and constructive address at the occasion, specifically commending the serbian president. i would say, with regard to the rock throwing incident and what the president of serbia actually did, his glasses were broken, and he and members of his delegation were brought to their knees. i would say that if the 50 or so people who threw those rocks had heard the remarks inside the ceremony, perhaps they would not have felt so bitter as to throw those rocks. i know there are wounds that need to be healed. but i think the conciliatory words inside, if they had been broadcast to the entire crowd, would have perhaps caused that incident, which got all the publicity, not to happen. this was about 50 people causing a disturbance in a crowd of, i would say, about 5,000 people gathered outside. it was a very important ceremony--actually, a funeral, you might say. so i would have to just say that the russian leadership really should be ashamed of standing in the way of international recognition of this genocide. they thought they were doing their serbian neighbors a favor, but, on the other hand, the serbian president stepped forward in a very brave way to create unity in this region, and i think my colleague would agree with that. mrs. shaheen. absolutely, and i know senator wicker shared my gratitude as we walked through the streets of sarajevo and as we met people in srebrenica for the appreciation they showed the united states for our actions in helping to end that awful war in bosnia and for our actions in supporting bosnia as they try to look westward and as they try to keep their country moving forward, addressing the corruption and the democracy issues they face. i think it is in our interest as americans to support those efforts to help them, as they continue to move their country forward, in every way we can. mr. wicker. the senator from new hampshire is exactly right. it is in the united states' interest that we care about the balkans, that we care about bosnia and herzegovina. we owe it to the u.s. troops who were deployed there in 1995 and later, who kept the peace and made it work. there is no country on the face of the earth that could have done that but the united states of america. we owe it to the memory of the leadership, not only of president clinton, who basically hosted the dayton accords in the united states of america, but also republicans such as speaker gingrich. it was gingrich and clinton who joined together and convinced this government to support the dayton agreement and support the necessary deployment to make sure this worked. as the senator pointed out, we owe it to history going forward to remember that world war i broke out in sarajevo, that the events leading up to world war ii largely occurred in the balkans, and to do what we can in the interest of u.s. citizens to say that this will not again be a flashpoint for conflict in europe and conflict internationally. mrs. shaheen. i know the senator shares my views that we owe it to the victims of srebrenica. i look forward to continuing to work with senator wicker to do everything we can to support the efforts in bosnia and herzegovina. mr. wicker. i look forward to working on a bipartisan basis to make sure [[page s5000]] that this peace holds, to make sure that progress is made on the ethnic issues--that we give bosnians and herzegovinians every reason to continue to want to embrace europe and to embrace the united states and to embrace fairness and anticorruption and all the work that it is going to take there. i appreciate the delegation. i appreciate secretary albright. i appreciate president clinton leading the delegation. and i appreciate the indulgence of our fellow senators in hearing this colloquy. with that, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from ohio. american workers and overtime pay mr. brown. mr. president, too many americans are still struggling in today's economy. despite comments by some candidates for president, americans work hard but still have trouble getting by. we know that americans on average are working longer hours than workers in almost every other rich country in the world--significantly longer hours. simply, they are not getting the pay they have earned and the compensation and the lifestyle to which they aspire and have worked so hard toward. for many workers, it feels as though the harder and longer they work, the less they have to show for it. and they are not imagining things. since the 1970s, middle class wages have been stagnant while the number of hours spent on the job has gone up. in short, americans are working more for less. the middle class has shrunk in every state in this country. the pew research center studies show that the share of adults in middle-income households has fallen from 61 percent in 1970 to 51 percent in 2013. in ohio the share of families that are middle class is now below 50 percent. we need to do more to build on-ramps for middle-class hard- working americans instead of saying that americans are not working hard enough, instead of asking workers to do more and more for less money. it is not uncommon today for salaried workers--salaried workers, not millionaire salaried workers but lower income and middle-income salaried workers--to work 50-, 60-, 70-hour weeks without getting a cent in overtime. when workers put in extra time, it should be reflected in their paychecks. right now a number of employers are gaming the system to avoid paying overtime, and american workers are losing wages as a result. it is past time for overtime hours to mean overtime pay again. that is why my colleagues and i sent a letter to the president earlier this year urging the administration to restore the strength of overtime payrolls. forty years ago, we as a nation decided that most workers, whether they were paid hourly or a salary, should receive overtime pay when working more than 40 hours a week, but the teeth in that law have been eroded. the strength of that law, the power of that law, and the effectiveness of that law have been eroded over the past 40 years. in 1975, 65 percent of all salaried workers were covered by overtime pay rules. currently, just 8 percent of salaried workers are covered. that could be a night manager in a fast food restaurant making $30,000 a year classified as management--classified because that person is salaried--and asked to work more than 40 hours and still only making $30,000 a year. so 40 years ago, 65 percent of salaried workers would have been paid time and a half for those extra hours beyond 40 for that night manager, but today they don't get paid over time. they may work 50 hours, they may work 60 hours, but they simply are not compensated for it. the salary threshold of $23,600 a year has remained static for decades because it hasn't been indexed for inflation. so in 1975, somebody making $23,000 a year was paid overtime for beyond 40 hours. today someone making $23,000 a year isn't. if they are making $30,000 or $40,000, they aren't paid overtime. so we see what has happened. the salary threshold was put in place to exempt highly paid executives, but because it hasn't increased in 40 years--they didn't build an inflation number into it or a cost of living adjustment--instead of hitting ceos and lawyers who shouldn't get paid overtime in hours excess of 40, workers earning as little as $455 a week now go without overtime pay just because they are salaried and just because they are called management. it allows employers the opportunity to put somebody on salary, work them many more hours, and then fail to compensate them. the current threshold is now so low that it is below the poverty line for a family of four. so a salaried worker making a few dollars below the poverty line and working 50 or 60 hours doesn't get paid overtime. that is actually what has happened. the american public is starting to understand this, and that is why so many people are calling on the president to do this. overtime pay should be available to everyone who puts in the extra time--not just those earning a poverty level wage. that is why i applaud the department of labor's proposed rule that would strengthen overtime standards and take them back--not quite even as good, but we are pretty satisfied with this--to the 1975 level. the new rule will more than double the salary threshold for earning overtime pay from $23,000 annually to $50,000. that would mean that 40 percent of salaried workers are now eligible for overtime. in my state, as a result of this rule, 160,000 ohioans would get a raise, as would 5 million americans in states such as oklahoma, rhode island, wisconsin, and all over this country. this means more money in the pockets of american workers. the rule proposes lengthening the threshold to the 40th percentile of income for full-time salaried workers instead of setting a raw number. this means that the strength of the rule is less likely to erode over time. not only will this rule help families make ends meet, it also boosts consumer spending, creates jobs, and bolsters the american economy. just like raising the minimum wage, when more money is put in the pocket of somebody making $8 an hour or $9 an hour or when you put more money in the pocket of a midlevel manager making $30,000 a year in a fast-food restaurant--if you put more money in their pocket--they are going to spend that money. they are not going to invest that money in a swiss bank account. they are going to spend that money in the community, buy more groceries, go into the hardware stores and do more to fix up their houses and do more to generate economic activity and create jobs for our economy. but there is still more we need to do to support american workers. this is an important step toward building our middle class. there is still more we need to do to support american workers. we need to give hourly workers a raise by raising the minimum wage. the legislation a number of us on the floor have worked on, the raise the wage act, would increase the minimum wage incrementally to $12 an hour by 2020, giving a raise to 1 million ohioans, 28 million people across the country--1 million ohioans. tipped workers shouldn't have to struggle to get by. they deserve to earn a living wage to help put food on the table. lots of people in this body are unaware, as some americans are. people here should be more aware of it, but people here tend not to know people that work in diners. people who work in diners as waitresses and waiters in diners can be paid as little as $2.13 an hour. the minimum wage for working in a diner in a so-called tipped wage or for the people who push wheelchairs in airports or in some case for many other kinds of jobs is $2.13 an hour. it is not $7.25, which is the minimum wage for everyone else. that is why we need to move on raising the minimum wage, on bringing the tipped wage up to at least 70 percent of the minimum wage. workers will be happier and they will be more productive when they are healthy, when they are making decent salaries, making a little bit better wages. americans also deserve a day off when they get sick. forty-three million americans--2 million in my state--have no paid sick leave at all. they are faced with impossible choices. do they stay home to care for a sick child or go to work so they can put food on the table? workers are happier and more productive when they are healthy. guaranteeing paid sick leave would save precious health care resources, it would give employers safe and stable workplaces, and it would give families peace of mind. it would mean that [[page s5001]] workers are not going to work when they are sick, infecting other workers and affecting productivity and profits at that business. that is why we should pass the healthy family act. overtime is important. minimum wage is important. the healthy family act for sick leave days is important. all are steps that we need to support hard-working american families. we know what has happened in the economy the last 10 years. we know the wealthiest 5 percent are doing better and better and better. profits are up for companies. executives are making bigger and bigger bonuses. but working class, lower-middle-class workers are simply not getting ahead or even able to tread water to stay even, for that matter. the minimum wage will help, paying overtime will help, and the healthy family act will help. the toledo blade put it well last week: ``america's widening income gap isn't an inescapable outcome of the free market, but a political choice that can be mitigated with intelligent public policies.'' this is a political choice. we have seen this body and the body on the other side of the capitol continue to give more tax cuts for the wealthiest americans. we won't invest in infrastructure, we won't invest in working families, we won't help raise wages, we won't help with overtime, and we won't help with workers who just need a few sick days off, as people in bodies such as this typically have. i urge the department of labor to finalize their strong overtime proposal as quickly as possible. it will make a huge difference in the lives of millions of americans. with that, i yield back. 20th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations between the united states and vietnam mr. whitehouse. mr. president, i am here to recognize a historic milestone: the 20th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations between the united states and vietnam. this occasion has some personal significance for me and my family. my father served as deputy ambassador to vietnam; in effect, the chief operating officer of that conflict. i lived with him in that country for several months during the vietnam war. if he were alive today, he would be proud of the work both countries have done to reconcile our past. it took immense courage on both sides to look beyond the scars of that war and envision a future in which our two countries could become partners and friends. no one embodies this courage more than our friend john mccain, who played a major role in establishing diplomatic relations between our two countries, and secretary of state john kerry, then a senator, who was his democratic partner. given senator mccain's experience as a prisoner in vietnam, his subsequent efforts to strengthen the peace and forgiveness between our two nations are an enduring inspiration, the power of which i was privileged to see firsthand when i traveled with senator mccain to hanoi in 2012 and 2014. senator mccain said 20 years ago, ``i believe it is my duty to encourage this country to build from the losses and the hopes of our tragic war in vietnam a better peace for both the american and the vietnamese people.'' today, the american and the vietnamese people can be proud of the progress made to forge a lasting peace and friendship. two years ago, president obama and vietnamese president truong tan sang launched the u.s.-vietnam comprehensive partnership, opening a new phase of bilateral relations between our nations based on mutual respect and common interests. i met recently with nguyen phu trong, the general secretary of the central committee of the communist party of vietnam to discuss our shared interests and opportunities for closer collaboration on a range of issues, including regional stability, economic cooperation, and the lingering human and environmental consequences of that war. i had the honor of meeting with general secretary trong while traveling to vietnam with senator mccain last summer. i am pleased he has made this historic visit to the united states. i am hopeful vietnam will bring our interests and values into closer alignment, particularly on human rights, the rights of civil society, transparency, and good governance issues. to that end, i look forward to working together to achieve closer ties. as the united states and vietnam continue to deepen our relationship, we should continue to address the legacies of that war, particularly the health effects and environmental contamination associated with agent orange and other herbicides. here at home, we take our commitment to caring for our veterans very seriously. although the war has ended, many american veterans and their families still battle a range of health problems and serious diseases associated with their service in vietnam. we must ensure that veterans get the care they need to combat the long-term health problems related to exposure to agent orange. those contamination and health problems are also serious in vietnam. i am grateful for senator leahy's leadership on the appropriations committee, which has enabled the united states to pursue remediation projects to clean up the dioxin contamination at da nang international airport and other hot spots and to support related health and disability programs. i urge all of us that we continue to support these initiatives which strengthen our bilateral relationship. considerable work remains. according to initial assessments of bien hoa air base, the contamination there is more severe and cleanup is expected to be more complex and costly than at da nang. in addition, health-related problems and disabilities persist in areas sprayed with agent orange or otherwise contaminated by dioxin. in 2008, actor, advocate, and long-time friend dick hughes brought this issue closely to my attention and he has shared with me compelling stories about vietnamese families who have been affected by diseases and disabilities related to agent orange exposure. some of the suffering ascribed to agent orange has been harrowing and heartbreaking. dick has years of experience working on humanitarian issues in vietnam and is a compelling witness to that suffering. we first met when i was a teenager in saigon and dick had established a program called the shoeshine boys project, to care for homeless children who had been orphaned or left alone during the war. he brought them together and sent them on the streets with shoeshine boxes as a way of making a living and finding something they could do and provided them care and a home when they came home at nightfall. over 8 years, that project helped thousands of children in cities all across vietnam. dick attributes the success of that project to close partnerships forged with local communities and the project's management by vietnamese citizens. when dick returned to the united states, he continued to advocate for postwar humanitarian causes and he started a foundation to raise awareness about the effects of agent orange on the vietnamese population. dick remains a trusted friend and tireless advocate to the vietnamese people. as our two countries work together on a new and more engaged future, we should expand our efforts to improve the health and well-being of the vietnamese people. we can learn from dick's experience about the power of partnership and the value of local leadership, and together we can continue to repair the damage--physical, psychological, and political--of the path we share. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from wisconsin. amendment no. 2093 ms. baldwin. mr. president, i rise to speak in support of the student non-discrimination act, which senator franken is offering as an amendment to the every child achieves act. the student non- discrimination act would help protect our students from bullying, harassment, and discrimination. i am a proud cosponsor of this amendment and hopeful the senate will agree to this amendment this week. as we consider the every child achieves act, as we did in committee back in april, and as we have discussed it on the floor over the last week, i have been guided by a core principle: that this law should ensure that every [[page s5002]] child, regardless of his or her background, regardless of his or her family's income, has access to the opportunities provided by a great education, a high-quality education. now, part of providing that opportunity is ensuring that every student is able to come to school and succeed in an environment that is safe, supportive, and free from discrimination. while the every child achieves act helps advance opportunity for students in numerous ways, it falls short in addressing a significant problem limiting the achievement of some of our most vulnerable students. unfortunately, there are still far too many stories of harassment, of bullying, and of discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students at the hands of their peers but also, sadly, sometimes at the hands of their teachers or administrators as well. there remains no federal law that explicitly protects these students and provides them and their families with recourse when they face bullying and harassment that limits their educational opportunities. no student can achieve if he cannot feel safe at school. no student will excel if she spends each day in fear of just being herself. i hear from so many students in my state about the need for us to stand up against bullying. for example, a young woman in madison wrote to me, and i quote from her letter: [a]s a student myself, i hear the words ``gay'', ``faggot, ``queer'' and others get tossed around . . . daily, and i do what i can to deter these words from being used in negative ways by others, but one voice can't make much of a difference. . . . i'm asking you to help raise awareness in schools anyway that you can. i would tell this young woman in madison that her voice speaking out on this matter can make a difference. another young woman from kimberly, wi, contacted me about her friend who committed suicide after suffering bullying. she wrote: he made everyone else come alive and be the better people that they were inside. but he killed himself because he thought he had no way out of the pain, no way to make those kids stop, other than to make sure he was not living anymore. across the country, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender or lgbt youth experience bullying harassment at school more frequently than their non-lgbt peers. according to a national survey by the gay, lesbian & straight education network, in the past year, nearly three- quarters of students were verbally harassed and more than 16 percent were physically assaulted because of their sexual orientation. more than 60 percent of students who reported an incident of harassment said that school staff did nothing in response. it is unsurprising, then, that nearly one-third of students reported missing school at least once in the last month because they did not feel safe. i believe we must fix this immediately. that is why i support including senator franken's student non-discrimination act as an amendment to the every child achieves act currently being debated before the senate. senator franken's amendment would provide real and strong protections for lgbt students in public, elementary, and secondary schools. it would also provide recourse through the department of education and, if necessary, in the courts to help students vindicate their rights. this amendment is closely modeled on existing federal education protections, which have helped ensure that students have remedies when they face unfair treatment based on race, ethnicity, sex, and disability. lgbt students are just as deserving of the opportunity to succeed in the school environment that is supportive and nurturing rather than discriminatory and unwelcoming. if we are truly to ensure through this legislation that every child achieves, we must act to address the bullying, harassment, and discrimination that limits educational opportunities of too many students. i urge my colleagues to support this amendment. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the majority leader. cloture motion mr. mcconnell. mr.

CREC-2015-07-13-pt1-PgS5002,CREC-2015-07-13,114,MORNING BUSINESS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S5002-S5003] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MORNING BUSINESS ______ PENDING NOMINEES TO THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims has been referred to as the ``keeper of the Nation's conscience'' and ``the people's court.'' This court was created by Congress approximately 160 years ago and embodies the constitutional principle that individuals have rights against their government. As President Lincoln has said, ``It is as much the duty of Government to render prompt justice against itself, in favor of citizens, as it is to administer the same between private individuals.'' That is what this court does. It allows citizens to seek prompt justice against our government. The court's jurisdiction is authorized by statute, and it primarily hears monetary claims against the U.S. Government deriving from the Constitution, Federal statutes, executive regulations, and civilian or military contracts. The fact that the Court of Federal Claims is an article I court, as opposed to an article III court, does not render any of the cases that it hears any less significant. For example, the court has presided over such important cases as the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and the World War II internment of Japanese Americans. It also presides over civilian and military pay claims and money claims under the Fifth Amendment's takings clause. The takings clause under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution provides: ``nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.'' As a result of this court's jurisdiction over takings' claims, it considers cases such as the auto bailout suits against General Motors and Chrysler--companies who were required to terminate agreements with franchisees as a condition of receiving Federal bailout money. The court also resolves disputes that critically impact the environment and our economy, such as those involving the taking of wetlands to create solid waste landfills and disputes over water and drainage rights by agricultural landowners. Last week, the chief judge of the court sent a letter informing the Senate that despite the court's shortage of [[Page S5003]] judicial officers, its caseload continues unabated. She wrote that ``[t]he statutory requirements dictating deadlines for certain types of cases unique to our court, including government contract disputes--some of which involve national defense and national security--remain in effect. The dollar amounts in dispute in our currently pending cases, which are often an indication of the complexity of the underlying issues, are in the billions of dollars. At least three different cases on the court's pending docket reflect a demand for damages greater than forty billion dollars.'' This is no ordinary court. The Senate Republicans' insistence on delaying the confirmation of qualified nominees to the Court of Federal Claims harms its ability to resolve issues of national importance in a timely and just manner. Since February 2013, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims has been operating with several vacancies. Only 11 of the 16 seats on the court are occupied by active judges. We could have a court working at full strength if we confirm the five pending on the Senate Executive Calendar. All five of them were all nominated more than a year ago and have twice been voted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote. I have heard no objections to any of the five nominees to this court. There is no good reason to delay filling these vacancies. This is especially the case because the nominees before us are superbly qualified. One of the nominees, Armando Bonilla, would be the first Hispanic judge to hold a seat on the court. He is strongly endorsed by the Hispanic National Bar Association. He has spent his entire career--now spanning over two decades--as an attorney for the Department of Justice. He was hired out of law school in the Department's prestigious Honors Program, and has risen to become the Associate Deputy Attorney General in the Department. Armando Bonilla's story is that of the American dream. The son of a Cuban immigrant and Cuban-American father, Armando Bonilla has told the story of his mother's flight from Havana with his aunt and his grandmother. He has told the story of his ``Ti Mario,'' who eventually disappeared trying to help other exiles. And he has told the story of his father, who dropped out of high school but would subsequently serve the country by joining the Marines and would ultimately take on several jobs to support Armando and his sister. As Mr. Bonilla has beautifully described, his father ``exemplified the most outstanding qualities of the Hispanic culture and Hispanic people: the selfless sacrifice, the steely resolve and unbridled optimism and the genuine pride in an honest day's work--all toward the cause of improving the lives of the next generation.'' Mr. Bonilla should be confirmed without further delay. Another nominee, Jeri Somers, retired with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Air Force. She spent over two decades serving first as a judge advocate general and then as a military judge in the U.S. Air Force and the District of Columbia's Air National Guard. In 2007, she became a board judge with the U.S. Civilian Board of Contract Appeals and currently serves as its vice chair. Armando Bonilla and Jeri Somers are just two of the five nominees that Senate Republicans have been obstructing. These are two individuals that have done right every step of the way in their careers and are willing to serve on this important court. They have dedicated the majority of their careers in service to our Nation. They deserve better than the treatment they are receiving now. During the Bush administration, the Senate confirmed nine judges to the Court of Federal Claims--with the support of every Senate Republican. So far during the Obama administration, only three CFC judges have received confirmation votes. That is nine CFC judges during the Bush administration to only three so far in the Obama administration. Unfortunately, the disparity in treatment of these nominees by Senate Republicans is not surprising. More than half a year into this new Congress, the Republican leadership has scheduled votes to confirm only five district and circuit court judges. This is in stark contrast to the 25 district and circuit court judges confirmed by July 13, 2007, when the shoe was on the other foot and Democrats had regained the Senate majority in the seventh year of the Bush administration. That is 25 district and circuit court judges under a Democratic majority compared to 5 under the Republican majority. That is five times as many judges confirmed under a Democratic majority with a President of the opposite party than today's Senate Republican majority. It is up to the majority leader now to treat President Obama's judicial nominees fairly. I ask that he schedule votes this week on the five Court of Federal Claims nominees pending on the Senate Executive Calendar. I ask unanimous consent that a recent post to The Hill's Congress Blog by Professor Carl Tobias on the need to fill the vacancies on U.S. Court of Federal Claims be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From The Hill, July 9, 2015] Fill the U.S. Court of Federal Claims Vacancies (By Carl Tobias) The United States Court of Federal Claims was the most important federal court that many Americans had never heard of until last month. That is when Judge Thomas Wheeler of this court ruled that Hank Greenberg and AIG shareholders had proved that the federal government exceeded its authority by demanding an eighty percent equity stake in AIG during the great recession but that plaintiffs were not entitled to damages because they suffered no economic loss. More critical than this high profile case is the fact that the court has experienced vacancies in five of its judgeships for more than a year, while the well qualified, consensus nominees whom President Barack Obama first tapped for those openings in 2014 have languished awaiting confirmation. Because the Court of Federal Claims needs its full complement of judges to deliver justice and each nominee is highly qualified and uncontroversial, the Senate must expeditiously provide the nominees floor debates, if warranted, and up or down votes. This tribunal is the court in which citizens seek redress against the federal government for monetary claims. These include claims that the U.S. has taken private property without just compensation under the Fifth Amendment, claims pursued by veterans who seek disability payments for injuries received in combat and claims for compensation filed by persons who allege vaccines injured them. The tribunal's recent caseload has increasingly encompassed complex, high- dollar cases and high profile disputes in fields, such as the 1980s savings and loan crisis and Second World War internment of Japanese Americans by the United States. On April 10, 2014, Obama nominated Judge Nancy Firestone for reappointment and Thomas Halkowski to fifteen year terms, while on May 21, the White House nominated Armando Bonilla, Patricia McCarthy and Jeri Somers. Obama first nominated all five of the candidates more than one year ago, and they received Judiciary Committee hearings nearly a year ago. The panel unanimously reported all five out of committee rather soon after the hearings. Unfortunately, the Senate accorded none of the nominees a final vote before the 114th Congress adjourned. Therefore, the White House renominated the five candidates in early January 2015. The Judiciary Committee in turn unanimously approved the nominees without substantive discussion in February. The five nominees have since languished on the floor over four months awaiting debates and yes or no ballots. In a June 24 Congressional Record statement, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the Judiciary Committee Ranking Member, urged swift votes: ``We have heard no opposition to any of these nominees, yet they have been in limbo for months and months because the Republican Leader has refused to schedule a vote.'' Now that the Senate has returned from its July 4 recess, one of the chamber's first items of business must be debates and votes on the five Court of Federal Claims nominees. The tribunal needs all of the judges whom Congress has authorized to dispense justice for members of the public who seek redress because they claim that the federal government has injured them. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S5002-S5003] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MORNING BUSINESS ______ PENDING NOMINEES TO THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS Mr. LEAHY.

That is what this court does. It allows citizens to seek prompt justice against our government. The court's jurisdiction is authorized by statute, and it primarily hears monetary claims against the U.S. Government deriving from the Constitution, Federal statutes, executive regulations, and civilian or military contracts. The fact that the Court of Federal Claims is an article I court, as opposed to an article III court, does not render any of the cases that it hears any less significant. For example, the court has presided over such important cases as the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and the World War II internment of Japanese Americans. It also presides over civilian and military pay claims and money claims under the Fifth Amendment's takings clause. The takings clause under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution provides: ``nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.'' As a result of this court's jurisdiction over takings' claims, it considers cases such as the auto bailout suits against General Motors and Chrysler--companies who were required to terminate agreements with franchisees as a condition of receiving Federal bailout money. The court also resolves disputes that critically impact the environment and our economy, such as those involving the taking of wetlands to create solid waste landfills and disputes over water and drainage rights by agricultural landowners. Last week, the chief judge of the court sent a letter informing the Senate that despite the court's shortage of [[Page S5003]] judicial officers, its caseload continues unabated. She wrote that ``[t]he statutory requirements dictating deadlines for certain types of cases unique to our court, including government contract disputes--some of which involve national defense and national security--remain in effect. The dollar amounts in dispute in our currently pending cases, which are often an indication of the complexity of the underlying issues, are in the billions of dollars. At least three different cases on the court's pending docket reflect a demand for damages greater than forty billion dollars.'' This is no ordinary court. The Senate Republicans' insistence on delaying the confirmation of qualified nominees to the Court of Federal Claims harms its ability to resolve issues of national importance in a timely and just manner. Since February 2013, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims has been operating with several vacancies. Only 11 of the 16 seats on the court are occupied by active judges. We could have a court working at full strength if we confirm the five pending on the Senate Executive Calendar. All five of them were all nominated more than a year ago and have twice been voted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote. I have heard no objections to any of the five nominees to this court. There is no good reason to delay filling these vacancies. This is especially the case because the nominees before us are superbly qualified. One of the nominees, Armando Bonilla, would be the first Hispanic judge to hold a seat on the court. He is strongly endorsed by the Hispanic National Bar Association. He has spent his entire career--now spanning over two decades--as an attorney for the Department of Justice. He was hired out of law school in the Department's prestigious Honors Program, and has risen to become the Associate Deputy Attorney General in the Department. Armando Bonilla's story is that of the American dream. The son of a Cuban immigrant and Cuban-American father, Armando Bonilla has told the story of his mother's flight from Havana with his aunt and his grandmother. He has told the story of his ``Ti Mario,'' who eventually disappeared trying to help other exiles. And he has told the story of his father, who dropped out of high school but would subsequently serve the country by joining the Marines and would ultimately take on several jobs to support Armando and his sister. As Mr. Bonilla has beautifully described, his father ``exemplified the most outstanding qualities of the Hispanic culture and Hispanic people: the selfless sacrifice, the steely resolve and unbridled optimism and the genuine pride in an honest day's work--all toward the cause of improving the lives of the next generation.'' Mr. Bonilla should be confirmed without further delay. Another nominee, Jeri Somers, retired with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Air Force. She spent over two decades serving first as a judge advocate general and then as a military judge in the U.S. Air Force and the District of Columbia's Air National Guard. In 2007, she became a board judge with the U.S. Civilian Board of Contract Appeals and currently serves as its vice chair. Armando Bonilla and Jeri Somers are just two of the five nominees that Senate Republicans have been obstructing. These are two individuals that have done right every step of the way in their careers and are willing to serve on this important court. They have dedicated the majority of their careers in service to our Nation. They deserve better than the treatment they are receiving now. During the Bush administration, the Senate confirmed nine judges to the Court of Federal Claims--with the support of every Senate Republican. So far during the Obama administration, only three CFC judges have received confirmation votes. That is nine CFC judges during the Bush administration to only three so far in the Obama administration. Unfortunately, the disparity in treatment of these nominees by Senate Republicans is not surprising. More than half a year into this new Congress, the Republican leadership has scheduled votes to confirm only five district and circuit court judges. This is in stark contrast to the 25 district and circuit court judges confirmed by July 13, 2007, when the shoe was on the other foot and Democrats had regained the Senate majority in the seventh year of the Bush administration. That is 25 district and circuit court judges under a Democratic majority compared to 5 under the Republican majority. That is five times as many judges confirmed under a Democratic majority with a President of the opposite party than today's Senate Republican majority. It is up to the majority leader now to treat President Obama's judicial nominees fairly. I ask that he schedule votes this week on the five Court of Federal Claims nominees pending on the Senate Executive Calendar. I ask unanimous consent that a recent post to The Hill's Congress Blog by Professor Carl Tobias on the need to fill the vacancies on U.S. Court of Federal Claims be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From The Hill, July 9, 2015] Fill the U.S. Court of Federal Claims Vacancies (By Carl Tobias) The United States Court of Federal Claims was the most important federal court that many Americans had never heard of until last month. That is when Judge Thomas Wheeler of this court ruled that Hank Greenberg and AIG shareholders had proved that the federal government exceeded its authority by demanding an eighty percent equity stake in AIG during the great recession but that plaintiffs were not entitled to damages because they suffered no economic loss. More critical than this high profile case is the fact that the court has experienced vacancies in five of its judgeships for more than a year, while the well qualified, consensus nominees whom President Barack Obama first tapped for those openings in 2014 have languished awaiting confirmation. Because the Court of Federal Claims needs its full complement of judges to deliver justice and each nominee is highly qualified and uncontroversial, the Senate must expeditiously provide the nominees floor debates, if warranted, and up or down votes. This tribunal is the court in which citizens seek redress against the federal government for monetary claims. These include claims that the U.S. has taken private property without just compensation under the Fifth Amendment, claims pursued by veterans who seek disability payments for injuries received in combat and claims for compensation filed by persons who allege vaccines injured them. The tribunal's recent caseload has increasingly encompassed complex, high- dollar cases and high profile disputes in fields, such as the 1980s savings and loan crisis and Second World War internment of Japanese Americans by the United States. On April 10, 2014, Obama nominated Judge Nancy Firestone for reappointment and Thomas Halkowski to fifteen year terms, while on May 21, the White House nominated Armando Bonilla, Patricia McCarthy and Jeri Somers. Obama first nominated all five of the candidates more than one year ago, and they received Judiciary Committee hearings nearly a year ago. The panel unanimously reported all five out of committee rather soon after the hearings. Unfortunately, the Senate accorded none of the nominees a final vote before the 114th Congress adjourned. Therefore, the White House renominated the five candidates in early January 2015. The Judiciary Committee in turn unanimously approved the nominees without substantive discussion in February. The five nominees have since languished on the floor over four months awaiting debates and yes or no ballots. In a June 24 Congressional Record statement, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the Judiciary Committee Ranking Member, urged swift votes: ``We have heard no opposition to any of these nominees, yet they have been in limbo for months and months because the Republican Leader has refused to schedule a vote.'' Now that the Senate has returned from its July 4 recess, one of the chamber's first items of business must be debates and votes on the five Court of Federal Claims nominees. The tribunal needs all of the judges whom Congress has authorized to dispense justice for members of the public who seek redress because they claim that the federal government has injured them.

SMILLIE Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Col Rhonda Smillie of the U.S. Army Reserve who retired in May 2015 with more than 32 years of service and who, for the past 2 years, has served as a legislative liaison for the chief, Army Reserve. I am grateful for her life of service to the Army Reserve and wish her well as she transitions into retirement. A native of Fort Atkinson, WI, Rhonda was commissioned via the Reserve Officer's Training Corps Program at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, and went on to earn advanced degrees from Lindenwood University in St. Charles, MO, and from the U.S. Army War College in Carlisle, PA. Currently serving as the legislative liaison for the chief, Army Reserve, with responsibility for 19 States, Colonel Smillie travels extensively throughout her territory. From Ohio to Washington, from North Dakota to Missouri, she conducts education and outreach events that ensure community leaders understand the impact of the Army Reserve. Her efforts highlight key aspects of the Army Reserve that otherwise go unnoticed such as providing medical and dental assistance to underserved communities in northern Montana, providing cost effective training via Chinook helicopter simulators in Kansas, and working to ensure returning soldiers receive necessary support via the Yellow Ribbon Program in various States. She has helped to highlight the Public Private Partnership and other programs unique to the Army Reserve. Prior to assignment as a legislative liaison, she served as the deputy director, Military Personnel Management, Department of the Army Headquarters, G-1. On points of law and policy she was trusted to consider the needs of the Army, the Army Reserve, and soldiers and families. She expertly assisted in developing personnel policies to keep pace with an Army engaged in persistent conflict while simultaneously drawing down the force. With more than 20 years of Active Duty in support of the Army Reserve, Colonel Smillie's distinguished career is marked by tremendous accomplishments, impacting across the breadth and depth of the Army. Her distinctive leadership in positions demanding the utmost trust and responsibility, coupled with her exceptional professionalism and selfless service, will have a lasting positive impact on Army personnel readiness. It is only fair and proper to acknowledge the tireless support of her husband, Mr. Douglas Bryan Way, and their son, Truman Douglas Smillie Way, as it enabled her to work tirelessly on her assigned duties. Let us thank them all for their sacrifices and wish them continued success in the future. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S5004] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO COL RHONDA D.

CREC-2015-07-13-pt1-PgS5007,CREC-2015-07-13,114,PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S5007-S5008] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS The following petitions and memorials were laid before the Senate and were referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated: POM-45. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States Congress to take such actions as are necessary to designate Grambling State University as a United States Department of Agriculture 1890 land-grant institution; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. Senate Resolution No. 141 Whereas, a land-grant college or university is a postsecondary education institution that has been designated to receive the benefits of the federal Morrill Acts of 1862 or 1890; and Whereas, there is at least one land-grant institution in every state and territory of the United States, as well as the District of Columbia, and over the years, land-grant status has been associated with several types of federal support; and Whereas, two universities in this state, Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College (LSU) and Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College (SU), are designated as land-grant institutions; LSU received this designation in 1862, and in 1890, what is known as the Second Morrill Act conferred land-grant status to several historically black colleges and universities, commonly referred to as ``1890 land-grant institutions'', and SU is among this group; and Whereas, Grambling State University, located in Grambling, Louisiana, is seeking designation as an 1890 land-grant institution under the banner of the Second Morrill Act; and Whereas, Grambling State University was founded in 1901 by the North Louisiana Colored Agriculture Relief Association; in 1905, it moved to its present location and was renamed the North Louisiana Agricultural and Industrial School; in 1946, it became Grambling College; and in 1949, it earned its first accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools; and Whereas, in 1974, the school began to offer graduate programs in early childhood and elementary education and acquired the name Grambling State University; over the years, several new academic programs have been incorporated and new facilities added to the 384-acre campus; and Whereas, Grambling now offers more than eight hundred courses and forty-seven degree programs in five colleges, including an honors college, two professional schools, a graduate school, and a Division of Continuing Education; and Whereas, Grambling combines the academic strengths of a major university with the benefits of a small college, and its students grow and learn in a serene and positive environment; and Whereas, in addition to being one of the country's top producers of African-American graduates, Grambling is home to the internationally renowned Tiger Marching Band and remains proud of the legacy of the late Eddie Robinson, Sr., a truly legendary football coach; and Whereas, Grambling places an emphasis on the value and importance of each student, which is exemplified by its motto, ``Where Everybody is Somebody''; and Whereas, after more than a decade since its founding, Grambling remains an important influence in the quality of lives and communities of generations of North Louisiana residents; and Whereas, the designation of Ohio's Central State University as an 1890 land-grant institution in the 2014 Farm Bill set a very recent precedent for the addition of a university to the land-grant system; and Whereas, the nation's system of land-grant institutions would be strengthened by the inclusion of Grambling State University; and Whereas, as a historically black university with a strong record of academics, research, and service, Grambling, with its rich history and traditions, would bring a unique perspective to the land-grant system; and Whereas, for one hundred twenty-five years, the 1890 land- grant institutions have played a vital role in ensuring access to higher education and opportunity for underserved communities, and as such an institution, Grambling would have access to increased resources that it could direct to serving such communities and to providing research, extension, and public services in North Louisiana, an area where these services are not currently being provided sufficiently; and Whereas, such designation would be consistent with Grambling's agricultural origins and its mission and history of service to African-American students and the people of Louisiana and would strengthen Grambling's research and teaching in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs and enhance existing programs and facilitate the development of new programs in agricultural business, biotechnology, economics, environment and natural resources, family and consumer science, and engineering technology; and Whereas, Grambling State University has made the same extraordinary contributions to the education of African Americans in the state of Louisiana as other 1890 land-grant universities have made in their respective states; and Whereas, as the only Historically Black College or University (HBCU) in the University of Louisiana System, the role that Grambling plays in the state is critical; and Whereas, a land-grant designation would enhance greatly Grambling's service to the people of Louisiana, and it is appropriate that Congress take all necessary measures to grant such designation to Grambling State University: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate of the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions as are necessary to designate Grambling State University as a United States Department of Agriculture 1890 land-grant institution; and be it further Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate, the clerk of the United States House of Representatives, and to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United States Congress. ____ POM-46. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States Congress to take action against illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing in Louisiana's sovereign waters by passing H.R. 774, the Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing Enforcement Act of 2015; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 66 Whereas, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing is a global problem with serious economic, environmental, and security implications; and Whereas, illegal fishing accounts for economic losses of up to billions of dollars per year nationally and such activity is largely conducted by foreign fleets at the expense of United States fishermen, coastal communities, and the sustainability of global fish stocks; and Whereas, illegal fishing is of particular consequence in Louisiana, where the Gulf Coast waters supply seafood for the citizens of the United States and support the hospitality industry, tourism-related businesses, and the vibrant recreational and commercial fishing industry; and Whereas, not only does illegal fishing result in economic losses to the Louisiana fishing industry and other coastal businesses, but it also is a threat to the sustainability of our fisheries and to the Louisiana Gulf Coast ecosystem; and Whereas, the United States Coast Guard is to be commended for apprehending and investigating foreign vessels engaged in illegal activity along the U.S.-Mexico border, often patrolling the Gulf of Mexico in a cat-and-mouse game specifically with Mexican fishermen who are fishing illegally; and Whereas, illegal fishermen in the Gulf of Mexico compete for local fish stock and disregard state and federal laws on catch limits, or of marine species including marine mammals and sea turtles that are indiscriminately killed by the use of illegal long-line netting, and where some of the illegally caught fish is exported back into the U.S. and flood the market; and Whereas, vessels involved with illegal fishing are also associated with other crimes, including drug trafficking, human trafficking, and illegal immigration, and the incursion by these foreign fishing vessels into U.S. waters constitutes a violation of our sovereignty: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes the Congress of the United States to take action against illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing in our sovereign waters by passing H.R. 774, the Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing Enforcement Act of 2015; and be it further Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana hereby expresses its commitment to the elimination of illegal fishing, to the long-term conservation of Louisiana marine resources, and to the protection of the Louisiana Gulf Coast fishing and coastal communities; and be it further Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United States Congress. ____ POM-47. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of Louisiana commending the United States Congress on the passage of bipartisan legislation to permanently set the payment amounts that Medicare pays for physician services, known as the doc fix; to the Committee on Finance. Senate Resolution No. 109 Whereas, the term ``doc fix'' refers to the formula the federal government uses to pay physicians who treat patients covered by Medicare, who pay less than they would otherwise to see a physician and the federal government makes up the difference and pays the physician an amount determined by Congress; and Whereas, in 1997, Congress cut payments to physicians who treat patients enrolled in [[Page S5008]] Medicare in order to help balance the federal budget; and Whereas, while Congress had considered cutting the dollars to physicians treating Medicare patients, but did not have the collective will to carry it through, being concerned that some physicians might not continue to treat Medicare patients at a reduced rate, and the cut was postponed until a future date; and Whereas, over the last eighteen years Congress has postponed the cut seventeen times and the cut has become a possible twenty percent reduction in payments if the attempt to postpone the cuts failed during this Congress; and Whereas, with the current doc fix extension set to expire on March 31, 2015, Congress may consider the need for structural reforms to Medicare generally, not merely a postponement of the cut for another year; and Whereas, with the unconscionable cut of more than twenty percent looming without the annual doc fix extension in April, Congress agreed to begin broader structural changes to Medicare, ending the doc fix shell game permanently; Whereas, despite the reality that healthcare is expensive and that the annual revisiting of the doc fix formula of paying physicians was, at least, a bad way to govern, a bipartisan solution proved attainable even in a time when merely entertaining an idea from the other side of the aisle is often unthinkable; and Whereas, with the reality that one political party leads both houses of Congress and the other holds the presidency, true bipartisanship is the only path to successfully attacking any of the country's issues, yet that bipartisanship is noticeably absent in the discussion of most of those issues; and Whereas, while partisan differences have been more likely to win the day, the ability to craft a bipartisan doc fix solution requires the leadership of both political parties in both houses to focus on solutions rather than differences, and for that both the leadership and the members of Congress as a whole should be heartily congratulated; and Whereas, in reaching agreement on the end to the doc fix extensions, Congress has begun the daunting task of reforming and restructuring America's entitlement programs, a beginning worthy of note and of acclaim: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate of the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby commend the United States Congress on the passage of bipartisan legislation to permanently set the payment amounts that Medicare pays for physician services, known as the doc fix; and be it further Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States of America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional delegation. ____ POM-48. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States Congress to restore trade relations between the United States and Cuba in order to open the market to Louisiana rice; to the Committee on Finance. Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 68 Whereas, in 2014, Louisiana produced over three billion pounds of rice amounting to fifteen percent of the United States' rice production; and Whereas, the rice industry provides over nine thousand jobs to the Louisiana economy; and Whereas, increased rice exports to Cuba would lead to greater export opportunities for Louisiana farmers and the potential for increased acreage; and Whereas, resumed rice exports to Cuba would also benefit those affiliated with rice production, milling, and exporting; and Whereas, rice farming and milling has a large impact on Louisiana's secondary economy in that for every dollar that Louisiana rice produces, approximately thirty-five cents is added indirectly to the economy through seed and fertilizer sales, farm equipment, crop services, and transportation; and Whereas, resuming the trade of rice with Cuba would be a huge economic gain for Louisiana's port system; and Whereas, prior to the creation of the trade embargo in 1962, the Port of New Orleans handled over sixty-five percent of all traded goods to Cuba; and Whereas, the fifty-plus-year trade embargo between the United States and Cuba remains the longest-standing embargo in modern history; and Whereas, Louisiana is the top state of origination for Cuban-bound exports, representing nearly thirty percent of the export market share; and Whereas, it is time to end an outdated policy that continues to deny valuable business opportunities to Louisiana rice farmers, millers, and allied businesses, such as transportation, storage, and shipping; and Whereas, Cuba imports more than one billion dollars worth of food every year, including approximately five hundred thousand tons of rice; and Whereas, the rice industry in Louisiana is positioned to benefit from the market opportunities that normalized trade with Cuba would provide due to our healthy supply, port infrastructure, and proximity to Cuba; and Whereas, the USA Rice Federation and its affiliate members along with the Louisiana Rice Growers Association, the Louisiana Rice Promotion Board, and the Louisiana Rice Council are in support of restoring trade relations between the United States and Cuba in order to open the market to Louisiana rice: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes the Congress of the United States to restore trade relations between the United States and Cuba in order to open the market to Louisiana rice; and be it further Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate, the clerk of the United States House of Representatives, and to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United States Congress. ____ POM-49. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature of the State of Missouri urging the President of the United States and the United States Congress to repeal the excise tax on medical devices; to the Committee on Finance. Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 29 Whereas, a new 2.3% federal excise tax on the sale of taxable medical devices by manufacturers, producers, and importers of such devices took effect on January 1, 2013; and Whereas, the United States Congress Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the tax will generate $29 billion in revenue in its first ten years; and Whereas, the United States is a net exporter in medical devices, exporting $5.4 billion more than it imports, and accounts for 40% of the global medical technology market; and Whereas, a study completed by the Manhattan Institute found that the medical device tax will almost double the medical device industry's total tax bill and could result in the loss of up to 43,000 jobs in the medical technology industry; and Whereas, the medical device tax will harm the United States' global competitiveness, stunt medical innovation, and restrict the ability of patients to receive the life-saving medical devices and care they need; and Whereas, the medical device tax is imposed on United States sales, rather than profits, of medical device manufacturers, so it will be particularly damaging to innovative start-up companies: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the members of the Missouri Senate, Ninety- eighth General Assembly, First Regular Session, the House of Representatives concurring therein, hereby urge the President of the United States and the Congress of the United States to repeal the excise tax on medical devices; and be it further Resolved, That the Secretary of the Missouri Senate be instructed to prepare properly inscribed copies of this resolution for the President and Secretary of the United States Senate, the Speaker and Clerk of the United States House of Representatives and the members of the Missouri Congressional delegation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S5007-S5008] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS The following petitions and memorials were laid before the Senate and were referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated: POM-45. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States Congress to take such actions as are necessary to designate Grambling State University as a United States Department of Agriculture 1890 land-grant institution; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. Senate Resolution No. 141 Whereas, a land-grant college or university is a postsecondary education institution that has been designated to receive the benefits of the federal Morrill Acts of 1862 or 1890; and Whereas, there is at least one land-grant institution in every state and territory of the United States, as well as the District of Columbia, and over the years, land-grant status has been associated with several types of federal support; and Whereas, two universities in this state, Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College (LSU) and Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College (SU), are designated as land-grant institutions; LSU received this designation in 1862, and in 1890, what is known as the Second Morrill Act conferred land-grant status to several historically black colleges and universities, commonly referred to as ``1890 land-grant institutions'', and SU is among this group; and Whereas, Grambling State University, located in Grambling, Louisiana, is seeking designation as an 1890 land-grant institution under the banner of the Second Morrill Act; and Whereas, Grambling State University was founded in 1901 by the North Louisiana Colored Agriculture Relief Association; in 1905, it moved to its present location and was renamed the North Louisiana Agricultural and Industrial School; in 1946, it became Grambling College; and in 1949, it earned its first accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools; and Whereas, in 1974, the school began to offer graduate programs in early childhood and elementary education and acquired the name Grambling State University; over the years, several new academic programs have been incorporated and new facilities added to the 384-acre campus; and Whereas, Grambling now offers more than eight hundred courses and forty-seven degree programs in five colleges, including an honors college, two professional schools, a graduate school, and a Division of Continuing Education; and Whereas, Grambling combines the academic strengths of a major university with the benefits of a small college, and its students grow and learn in a serene and positive environment; and Whereas, in addition to being one of the country's top producers of African-American graduates, Grambling is home to the internationally renowned Tiger Marching Band and remains proud of the legacy of the late Eddie Robinson, Sr., a truly legendary football coach; and Whereas, Grambling places an emphasis on the value and importance of each student, which is exemplified by its motto, ``Where Everybody is Somebody''; and Whereas, after more than a decade since its founding, Grambling remains an important influence in the quality of lives and communities of generations of North Louisiana residents; and Whereas, the designation of Ohio's Central State University as an 1890 land-grant institution in the 2014 Farm Bill set a very recent precedent for the addition of a university to the land-grant system; and Whereas, the nation's system of land-grant institutions would be strengthened by the inclusion of Grambling State University; and Whereas, as a historically black university with a strong record of academics, research, and service, Grambling, with its rich history and traditions, would bring a unique perspective to the land-grant system; and Whereas, for one hundred twenty-five years, the 1890 land- grant institutions have played a vital role in ensuring access to higher education and opportunity for underserved communities, and as such an institution, Grambling would have access to increased resources that it could direct to serving such communities and to providing research, extension, and public services in North Louisiana, an area where these services are not currently being provided sufficiently; and Whereas, such designation would be consistent with Grambling's agricultural origins and its mission and history of service to African-American students and the people of Louisiana and would strengthen Grambling's research and teaching in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs and enhance existing programs and facilitate the development of new programs in agricultural business, biotechnology, economics, environment and natural resources, family and consumer science, and engineering technology; and Whereas, Grambling State University has made the same extraordinary contributions to the education of African Americans in the state of Louisiana as other 1890 land-grant universities have made in their respective states; and Whereas, as the only Historically Black College or University (HBCU) in the University of Louisiana System, the role that Grambling plays in the state is critical; and Whereas, a land-grant designation would enhance greatly Grambling's service to the people of Louisiana, and it is appropriate that Congress take all necessary measures to grant such designation to Grambling State University: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate of the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions as are necessary to designate Grambling State University as a United States Department of Agriculture 1890 land-grant institution; and be it further Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate, the clerk of the United States House of Representatives, and to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United States Congress. ____ POM-46.

Senate Resolution No. 109 Whereas, the term ``doc fix'' refers to the formula the federal government uses to pay physicians who treat patients covered by Medicare, who pay less than they would otherwise to see a physician and the federal government makes up the difference and pays the physician an amount determined by Congress; and Whereas, in 1997, Congress cut payments to physicians who treat patients enrolled in [[Page S5008]] Medicare in order to help balance the federal budget; and Whereas, while Congress had considered cutting the dollars to physicians treating Medicare patients, but did not have the collective will to carry it through, being concerned that some physicians might not continue to treat Medicare patients at a reduced rate, and the cut was postponed until a future date; and Whereas, over the last eighteen years Congress has postponed the cut seventeen times and the cut has become a possible twenty percent reduction in payments if the attempt to postpone the cuts failed during this Congress; and Whereas, with the current doc fix extension set to expire on March 31, 2015, Congress may consider the need for structural reforms to Medicare generally, not merely a postponement of the cut for another year; and Whereas, with the unconscionable cut of more than twenty percent looming without the annual doc fix extension in April, Congress agreed to begin broader structural changes to Medicare, ending the doc fix shell game permanently; Whereas, despite the reality that healthcare is expensive and that the annual revisiting of the doc fix formula of paying physicians was, at least, a bad way to govern, a bipartisan solution proved attainable even in a time when merely entertaining an idea from the other side of the aisle is often unthinkable; and Whereas, with the reality that one political party leads both houses of Congress and the other holds the presidency, true bipartisanship is the only path to successfully attacking any of the country's issues, yet that bipartisanship is noticeably absent in the discussion of most of those issues; and Whereas, while partisan differences have been more likely to win the day, the ability to craft a bipartisan doc fix solution requires the leadership of both political parties in both houses to focus on solutions rather than differences, and for that both the leadership and the members of Congress as a whole should be heartily congratulated; and Whereas, in reaching agreement on the end to the doc fix extensions, Congress has begun the daunting task of reforming and restructuring America's entitlement programs, a beginning worthy of note and of acclaim: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate of the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby commend the United States Congress on the passage of bipartisan legislation to permanently set the payment amounts that Medicare pays for physician services, known as the doc fix; and be it further Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States of America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional delegation. ____ POM-48. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States Congress to restore trade relations between the United States and Cuba in order to open the market to Louisiana rice; to the Committee on Finance. Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 68 Whereas, in 2014, Louisiana produced over three billion pounds of rice amounting to fifteen percent of the United States' rice production; and Whereas, the rice industry provides over nine thousand jobs to the Louisiana economy; and Whereas, increased rice exports to Cuba would lead to greater export opportunities for Louisiana farmers and the potential for increased acreage; and Whereas, resumed rice exports to Cuba would also benefit those affiliated with rice production, milling, and exporting; and Whereas, rice farming and milling has a large impact on Louisiana's secondary economy in that for every dollar that Louisiana rice produces, approximately thirty-five cents is added indirectly to the economy through seed and fertilizer sales, farm equipment, crop services, and transportation; and Whereas, resuming the trade of rice with Cuba would be a huge economic gain for Louisiana's port system; and Whereas, prior to the creation of the trade embargo in 1962, the Port of New Orleans handled over sixty-five percent of all traded goods to Cuba; and Whereas, the fifty-plus-year trade embargo between the United States and Cuba remains the longest-standing embargo in modern history; and Whereas, Louisiana is the top state of origination for Cuban-bound exports, representing nearly thirty percent of the export market share; and Whereas, it is time to end an outdated policy that continues to deny valuable business opportunities to Louisiana rice farmers, millers, and allied businesses, such as transportation, storage, and shipping; and Whereas, Cuba imports more than one billion dollars worth of food every year, including approximately five hundred thousand tons of rice; and Whereas, the rice industry in Louisiana is positioned to benefit from the market opportunities that normalized trade with Cuba would provide due to our healthy supply, port infrastructure, and proximity to Cuba; and Whereas, the USA Rice Federation and its affiliate members along with the Louisiana Rice Growers Association, the Louisiana Rice Promotion Board, and the Louisiana Rice Council are in support of restoring trade relations between the United States and Cuba in order to open the market to Louisiana rice: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes the Congress of the United States to restore trade relations between the United States and Cuba in order to open the market to Louisiana rice; and be it further Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate, the clerk of the United States House of Representatives, and to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United States Congress. ____ POM-49. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature of the State of Missouri urging the President of the United States and the United States Congress to repeal the excise tax on medical devices; to the Committee on Finance. Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 29 Whereas, a new 2.3% federal excise tax on the sale of taxable medical devices by manufacturers, producers, and importers of such devices took effect on January 1, 2013; and Whereas, the United States Congress Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the tax will generate $29 billion in revenue in its first ten years; and Whereas, the United States is a net exporter in medical devices, exporting $5.4 billion more than it imports, and accounts for 40% of the global medical technology market; and Whereas, a study completed by the Manhattan Institute found that the medical device tax will almost double the medical device industry's total tax bill and could result in the loss of up to 43,000 jobs in the medical technology industry; and Whereas, the medical device tax will harm the United States' global competitiveness, stunt medical innovation, and restrict the ability of patients to receive the life-saving medical devices and care they need; and Whereas, the medical device tax is imposed on United States sales, rather than profits, of medical device manufacturers, so it will be particularly damaging to innovative start-up companies: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the members of the Missouri Senate, Ninety- eighth General Assembly, First Regular Session, the House of Representatives concurring therein, hereby urge the President of the United States and the Congress of the United States to repeal the excise tax on medical devices; and be it further Resolved, That the Secretary of the Missouri Senate be instructed to prepare properly inscribed copies of this resolution for the President and Secretary of the United States Senate, the Speaker and Clerk of the United States House of Representatives and the members of the Missouri Congressional delegation. ____________________",package_114_13.csv,17852,17852,17919,"[congressional record volume 161, number 108 (monday, july 13, 2015)] [senate] [pages s5007-s5008] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] petitions and memorials the following petitions and memorials were laid before the senate and were referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated: pom-45. a resolution adopted by the senate of the state of louisiana memorializing the united states congress to take such actions as are necessary to designate grambling state university as a united states department of agriculture 1890 land-grant institution; to the committee on agriculture, nutrition, and forestry. senate resolution no. 141 whereas, a land-grant college or university is a postsecondary education institution that has been designated to receive the benefits of the federal morrill acts of 1862 or 1890; and whereas, there is at least one land-grant institution in every state and territory of the united states, as well as the district of columbia, and over the years, land-grant status has been associated with several types of federal support; and whereas, two universities in this state, louisiana state university and agricultural and mechanical college (lsu) and southern university and agricultural and mechanical college (su), are designated as land-grant institutions; lsu received this designation in 1862, and in 1890, what is known as the second morrill act conferred land-grant status to several historically black colleges and universities, commonly referred to as ``1890 land-grant institutions'', and su is among this group; and whereas, grambling state university, located in grambling, louisiana, is seeking designation as an 1890 land-grant institution under the banner of the second morrill act; and whereas, grambling state university was founded in 1901 by the north louisiana colored agriculture relief association; in 1905, it moved to its present location and was renamed the north louisiana agricultural and industrial school; in 1946, it became grambling college; and in 1949, it earned its first accreditation by the southern association of colleges and schools; and whereas, in 1974, the school began to offer graduate programs in early childhood and elementary education and acquired the name grambling state university; over the years, several new academic programs have been incorporated and new facilities added to the 384-acre campus; and whereas, grambling now offers more than eight hundred courses and forty-seven degree programs in five colleges, including an honors college, two professional schools, a graduate school, and a division of continuing education; and whereas, grambling combines the academic strengths of a major university with the benefits of a small college, and its students grow and learn in a serene and positive environment; and whereas, in addition to being one of the country's top producers of african-american graduates, grambling is home to the internationally renowned tiger marching band and remains proud of the legacy of the late eddie robinson, sr., a truly legendary football coach; and whereas, grambling places an emphasis on the value and importance of each student, which is exemplified by its motto, ``where everybody is somebody''; and whereas, after more than a decade since its founding, grambling remains an important influence in the quality of lives and communities of generations of north louisiana residents; and whereas, the designation of ohio's central state university as an 1890 land-grant institution in the 2014 farm bill set a very recent precedent for the addition of a university to the land-grant system; and whereas, the nation's system of land-grant institutions would be strengthened by the inclusion of grambling state university; and whereas, as a historically black university with a strong record of academics, research, and service, grambling, with its rich history and traditions, would bring a unique perspective to the land-grant system; and whereas, for one hundred twenty-five years, the 1890 land- grant institutions have played a vital role in ensuring access to higher education and opportunity for underserved communities, and as such an institution, grambling would have access to increased resources that it could direct to serving such communities and to providing research, extension, and public services in north louisiana, an area where these services are not currently being provided sufficiently; and whereas, such designation would be consistent with grambling's agricultural origins and its mission and history of service to african-american students and the people of louisiana and would strengthen grambling's research and teaching in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (stem) programs and enhance existing programs and facilitate the development of new programs in agricultural business, biotechnology, economics, environment and natural resources, family and consumer science, and engineering technology; and whereas, grambling state university has made the same extraordinary contributions to the education of african americans in the state of louisiana as other 1890 land-grant universities have made in their respective states; and whereas, as the only historically black college or university (hbcu) in the university of louisiana system, the role that grambling plays in the state is critical; and whereas, a land-grant designation would enhance greatly grambling's service to the people of louisiana, and it is appropriate that congress take all necessary measures to grant such designation to grambling state university: now, therefore, be it resolved, that the senate of the legislature of louisiana does hereby memorialize the united states congress to take such actions as are necessary to designate grambling state university as a united states department of agriculture 1890 land-grant institution; and be it further resolved, that a copy of this resolution shall be transmitted to the secretary of the united states senate, the clerk of the united states house of representatives, and to each member of the louisiana delegation to the united states congress. ____ pom-46. a concurrent resolution adopted by the legislature of the state of louisiana memorializing the united states congress to take action against illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing in louisiana's sovereign waters by passing h.r. 774, the illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing enforcement act of 2015; to the committee on commerce, science, and transportation. senate concurrent resolution no. 66 whereas, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing is a global problem with serious economic, environmental, and security implications; and whereas, illegal fishing accounts for economic losses of up to billions of dollars per year nationally and such activity is largely conducted by foreign fleets at the expense of united states fishermen, coastal communities, and the sustainability of global fish stocks; and whereas, illegal fishing is of particular consequence in louisiana, where the gulf coast waters supply seafood for the citizens of the united states and support the hospitality industry, tourism-related businesses, and the vibrant recreational and commercial fishing industry; and whereas, not only does illegal fishing result in economic losses to the louisiana fishing industry and other coastal businesses, but it also is a threat to the sustainability of our fisheries and to the louisiana gulf coast ecosystem; and whereas, the united states coast guard is to be commended for apprehending and investigating foreign vessels engaged in illegal activity along the u.s.-mexico border, often patrolling the gulf of mexico in a cat-and-mouse game specifically with mexican fishermen who are fishing illegally; and whereas, illegal fishermen in the gulf of mexico compete for local fish stock and disregard state and federal laws on catch limits, or of marine species including marine mammals and sea turtles that are indiscriminately killed by the use of illegal long-line netting, and where some of the illegally caught fish is exported back into the u.s. and flood the market; and whereas, vessels involved with illegal fishing are also associated with other crimes, including drug trafficking, human trafficking, and illegal immigration, and the incursion by these foreign fishing vessels into u.s. waters constitutes a violation of our sovereignty: now, therefore, be it resolved, that the legislature of louisiana memorializes the congress of the united states to take action against illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing in our sovereign waters by passing h.r. 774, the illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing enforcement act of 2015;

and whereas, over the last eighteen years congress has postponed the cut seventeen times and the cut has become a possible twenty percent reduction in payments if the attempt to postpone the cuts failed during this congress; and whereas, with the current doc fix extension set to expire on march 31, 2015, congress may consider the need for structural reforms to medicare generally, not merely a postponement of the cut for another year; and whereas, with the unconscionable cut of more than twenty percent looming without the annual doc fix extension in april, congress agreed to begin broader structural changes to medicare, ending the doc fix shell game permanently; whereas, despite the reality that healthcare is expensive and that the annual revisiting of the doc fix formula of paying physicians was, at least, a bad way to govern, a bipartisan solution proved attainable even in a time when merely entertaining an idea from the other side of the aisle is often unthinkable; and whereas, with the reality that one political party leads both houses of congress and the other holds the presidency, true bipartisanship is the only path to successfully attacking any of the country's issues, yet that bipartisanship is noticeably absent in the discussion of most of those issues;

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify and permanently extend qualified zone academy bonds, and to treat such bonds as specified tax credit bonds; to the Committee on Finance. Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today I call attention to our Nation's education infrastructure. America's schools are in desperate need of repair. A 2014 report by the National Center for Education Statistics found that the U.S. needs to invest nearly $200 billion in school facilities just to bring them up to date. This echoed the findings of the American Society of Civil Engineers, who in 2013 gave American public school buildings a D-plus rating. Fortunately, there is a way for Congress to help facilitate these necessary improvements. The Qualified Zone Academy Bond (QZAB) program helps schools that serve low-income students pay for building renovations, facility upgrades, equipment purchases, and other expensive projects. QZABs provide tax credits to financial institutions who provide bonds or other debt instruments to qualified schools. These tax credits decrease interest payments for schools that take on debt to renovate their facilities. Since creating QZABs in 1997, Congress has consistently extended the program, even expanding it for a brief period between 2008 and 2010. But the program expired at the end of 2014. It is time Congress enhanced and made permanent this important tax credit. Today I will introduce the Rebuilding America's Schools Act. This bill would extend permanently the QZAB program and increase the allotted funding for the program from $400 million per year to the levels authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act-- $1.4 billion. Lastly, it would allow schools to use QZABs to finance construction of new buildings. Under current law, QZABs can only be used to finance renovations or upgrades to existing school buildings. I hope my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring the Rebuilding America's Schools Act.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify and permanently extend qualified zone academy bonds, and to treat such bonds as specified tax credit bonds; to the Committee on Finance. Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today I call attention to our Nation's education infrastructure. America's schools are in desperate need of repair. A 2014 report by the National Center for Education Statistics found that the U.S. needs to invest nearly $200 billion in school facilities just to bring them up to date. This echoed the findings of the American Society of Civil Engineers, who in 2013 gave American public school buildings a D-plus rating. Fortunately, there is a way for Congress to help facilitate these necessary improvements. The Qualified Zone Academy Bond (QZAB) program helps schools that serve low-income students pay for building renovations, facility upgrades, equipment purchases, and other expensive projects. QZABs provide tax credits to financial institutions who provide bonds or other debt instruments to qualified schools. These tax credits decrease interest payments for schools that take on debt to renovate their facilities. Since creating QZABs in 1997, Congress has consistently extended the program, even expanding it for a brief period between 2008 and 2010. But the program expired at the end of 2014. It is time Congress enhanced and made permanent this important tax credit. Today I will introduce the Rebuilding America's Schools Act. This bill would extend permanently the QZAB program and increase the allotted funding for the program from $400 million per year to the levels authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act-- $1.4 billion. Lastly, it would allow schools to use QZABs to finance construction of new buildings. Under current law, QZABs can only be used to finance renovations or upgrades to existing school buildings. I hope my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring the Rebuilding America's Schools Act.

Res. 222 Whereas the Federation Internationale de Football Association (referred to in this preamble as ``FIFA'') awarded $576,000,000 to the 32 teams that competed in the 2014 Men's World Cup, but only awarded $15,000,000 to the 24 teams that competed in the 2015 Women's World Cup; Whereas FIFA awarded $35,000,000 to the team that won the 2014 Men's World Cup, but only awarded $2,000,000 to the team that won the 2015 Women's World Cup; Whereas FIFA awarded $6,000,000 more in prizes to each team that lost in the first round of the 2014 Men's World Cup than to the team that won the 2015 Women's World Cup; Whereas FIFA awarded $420,000,000 to the 32 teams that competed in the 2010 Men's World Cup, but only awarded $10,000,000 to the 24 teams that competed in the 2011 Women's World Cup; Whereas FIFA awarded $31,000,000 to the team that won the 2010 Men's World Cup, but only awarded $1,000,000 to the team that won the 2011 Women's World Cup; Whereas the 2015 Women's World Cup Final had more than 25,000,000 viewers in the United States, making it more widely viewed than the Major League Baseball World Series or the National Basketball Association Finals; Whereas the 2015 Women's World Cup highlighted the need to eliminate the existing gender pay disparity in prize award structure in athletic competitions that has persisted for decades; Whereas the unfair and unjust prize award allocation system used by FIFA sends a terrible message to women and girls around the world about the value of their contribution to sports; Whereas, in 2007, Wimbledon finally implemented an equal prize payment structure for all athletes, regardless of gender; and Whereas gender should not determine the amount of a prize award that a person or team receives in an athletic competition: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate-- (1) urges the Federation Internationale de Football Association to immediately eliminate gender pay inequity and to treat all athletes with the respect and dignity those athletes deserve; (2) supports an end to the unfair and unjust practice of gender pay inequity in the workplace, including athletic competitions and related prize awards; (3) urges all other local, State, Federal, and international organizations to eliminate gender pay inequity; and (4) instructs the Secretary of the Senate to submit a copy of this resolution to the President of the Federation Internationale de Football Association. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week more than 25 million Americans watched the U.S. women's soccer team win for the third time soccer's most coveted title--the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup. This thrilling victory was the most widely viewed women's soccer game in our Nation's history. Americans are proud of this impressive victory, and we applaud these world-class athletes for their contributions to our Nation's legacy. Anybody walking down the road by our farm house the night of the soccer game--we had our windows open--would have heard Marcelle and I screaming with joy at the victory. But as the celebrations fade, we should all be troubled by the way FIFA discriminates against some of the teams that compete in the World Cup. The U.S. women's team will receive $2 million for winning the Women's World Cup. The 2014 men's World Cup winner was awarded $35 million. In fact, men's teams that lost in the first round of the 2014 men's World Cup were awarded $8 million--four times more than the champion U.S. women's team. The reason for this extreme disparity? Gender. So today, I am introducing a Senate resolution that calls on FIFA to immediately eliminate this discriminatory prize award structure. Opponents of equal prize awards in sports point to revenue as the reason behind this disparity. But revenue should not be and cannot be accepted as a means for discrimination. In fact, they ought to ask this: How many people watched the women's soccer team? Most teams would give anything to have that viewership. The 24 women's teams that took part in FIFA's tournament are role models--not just to women and girls but to men and boys across the globe. The World Cup champions should be rewarded for their performance, for their grit, and for their teamwork, rather than devalued for their gender. Nelson Mandela, a person I met often and admired, once said: ``Sport has the power to change the world.'' Well, sports bring us together in our communities and on the global stage. They remind us what we have in common, they inspire us to dream, and they push beyond every boundary. This weekend, millions of people watched American tennis star Serena Williams win the women's final at Wimbledon, marking her sixth championship at the All England Club. The next day, Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic won the men's final on the very same court. Both of these athletes competed against the very best players in the world, and they were awarded the very same amount of prize money for their impressive victories. This is because Wimbledon chose to be on the right side of history in 2007 by ensuring pay equity for female and male athletes. For years, tennis champions such as Billie Jean King and Venus Williams fought for equal treatment for the future champions of their sport. I hope the story of the American Women's World Cup champions not receiving fair treatment will inspire more people to join the fight for equal prize awards. With the resolution I introduce today, let the Senate be on record in support of fair treatment for all World Cup champions as we urge FIFA to change its policy, just as the All England Club did years ago. The fight for gender equality continues and is a fight worth winning. In 2009, I proudly voted for passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to clarify the statute of limitations for filing an equal-pay lawsuit regarding pay discrimination. And I supported Senator Mikulski's Paycheck Fairness Act, which would ensure that all Americans receive equal pay for equal work. We have had a lot of civil rights fights in our Nation's history. The battle for true equality has persisted for too long. Let's join together. Let's send a powerful message of equality to those who aspire to one day become a champion. Equal pay for equal work should no longer be an ideal, but instead the reality for all. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S5011] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS ______ SENATE RESOLUTION 222--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE FEDERATION INTERNATIONALE DE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION SHOULD IMMEDIATELY ELIMINATE GENDER PAY INEQUITY AND TREAT ALL ATHLETES WITH THE SAME RESPECT AND DIGNITY Mr. LEAHY submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions: S.

Equal pay for equal work should no longer be an ideal, but instead the reality for all. ____________________",package_114_13.csv,6959,6959,7026,"[congressional record volume 161, number 108 (monday, july 13, 2015)] [senate] [page s5011] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] submitted resolutions ______ senate resolution 222--expressing the sense of the senate that the federation internationale de football association should immediately eliminate gender pay inequity and treat all athletes with the same respect and dignity mr. leahy submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the committee on health, education, labor, and pensions: s. res. 222 whereas the federation internationale de football association (referred to in this preamble as ``fifa'') awarded $576,000,000 to the 32 teams that competed in the 2014 men's world cup, but only awarded $15,000,000 to the 24 teams that competed in the 2015 women's world cup; whereas fifa awarded $35,000,000 to the team that won the 2014 men's world cup, but only awarded $2,000,000 to the team that won the 2015 women's world cup; whereas fifa awarded $6,000,000 more in prizes to each team that lost in the first round of the 2014 men's world cup than to the team that won the 2015 women's world cup; whereas fifa awarded $420,000,000 to the 32 teams that competed in the 2010 men's world cup, but only awarded $10,000,000 to the 24 teams that competed in the 2011 women's world cup; whereas fifa awarded $31,000,000 to the team that won the 2010 men's world cup, but only awarded $1,000,000 to the team that won the 2011 women's world cup; whereas the 2015 women's world cup final had more than 25,000,000 viewers in the united states, making it more widely viewed than the major league baseball world series or the national basketball association finals; whereas the 2015 women's world cup highlighted the need to eliminate the existing gender pay disparity in prize award structure in athletic competitions that has persisted for decades; whereas the unfair and unjust prize award allocation system used by fifa sends a terrible message to women and girls around the world about the value of their contribution to sports; whereas, in 2007, wimbledon finally implemented an equal prize payment structure for all athletes, regardless of gender; and whereas gender should not determine the amount of a prize award that a person or team receives in an athletic competition: now, therefore, be it resolved, that the senate-- (1) urges the federation internationale de football association to immediately eliminate gender pay inequity and to treat all athletes with the respect and dignity those athletes deserve; (2) supports an end to the unfair and unjust practice of gender pay inequity in the workplace, including athletic competitions and related prize awards; (3) urges all other local, state, federal, and international organizations to eliminate gender pay inequity; and (4) instructs the secretary of the senate to submit a copy of this resolution to the president of the federation internationale de football association. mr. leahy. mr. president, last week more than 25 million americans watched the u.s. women's soccer team win for the third time soccer's most coveted title--the federation internationale de football association (fifa) world cup. this thrilling victory was the most widely viewed women's soccer game in our nation's history. americans are proud of this impressive victory, and we applaud these world-class athletes for their contributions to our nation's legacy. anybody walking down the road by our farm house the night of the soccer game--we had our windows open--would have heard marcelle and i screaming with joy at the victory. but as the celebrations fade, we should all be troubled by the way fifa discriminates against some of the teams that compete in the world cup. the u.s. women's team will receive $2 million for winning the women's world cup. the 2014 men's world cup winner was awarded $35 million. in fact, men's teams that lost in the first round of the 2014 men's world cup were awarded $8 million--four times more than the champion u.s. women's team. the reason for this extreme disparity? gender. so today, i am introducing a senate resolution that calls on fifa to immediately eliminate this discriminatory prize award structure. opponents of equal prize awards in sports point to revenue as the reason behind this disparity. but revenue should not be and cannot be accepted as a means for discrimination. in fact, they ought to ask this: how many people watched the women's soccer team? most teams would give anything to have that viewership. the 24 women's teams that took part in fifa's tournament are role models--not just to women and girls but to men and boys across the globe. the world cup champions should be rewarded for their performance, for their grit, and for their teamwork, rather than devalued for their gender. nelson mandela, a person i met often and admired, once said: ``sport has the power to change the world.'' well, sports bring us together in our communities and on the global stage. they remind us what we have in common, they inspire us to dream, and they push beyond every boundary. this weekend, millions of people watched american tennis star serena williams win the women's final at wimbledon, marking her sixth championship at the all england club. the next day, serbian tennis star novak djokovic won the men's final on the very same court. both of these athletes competed against the very best players in the world, and they were awarded the very same amount of prize money for their impressive victories. this is because wimbledon chose to be on the right side of history in 2007 by ensuring pay equity for female and male athletes. for years, tennis champions such as billie jean king and venus williams fought for equal treatment for the future champions of their sport. i hope the story of the american women's world cup champions not receiving fair treatment will inspire more people to join the fight for equal prize awards. with the resolution i introduce today, let the senate be on record in support of fair treatment for all world cup champions as we urge fifa to change its policy, just as the all england club did years ago. the fight for gender equality continues and is a fight worth winning. in 2009, i proudly voted for passage of the lilly ledbetter fair pay act, which amended the civil rights act of 1964 to clarify the statute of limitations for filing an equal-pay lawsuit regarding pay discrimination. and i supported senator mikulski's paycheck fairness act, which would ensure that all americans receive equal pay for equal work. we have had a lot of civil rights fights in our nation's history. the battle for true equality has persisted for too long. let's join together. let's send a powerful message of equality to those who aspire to one day become a champion. equal pay for equal work should no longer be an ideal, but instead the reality for all. ____________________",6959

We have a couple of issues that we need to resolve, but there are only a couple, and for a bill this complicated, that is pretty good. So it would be my hope that we could continue on through the process, and the majority leader might even get to the point later in the week where he would be able to vitiate the cloture, and we could finish without a cloture vote. So far, so good. We have considered 58 amendments in committee and adopted 29. We have considered 25 on the floor, adopted 8 by rollcall, 11 by voice, and we have dozens more that have been agreed to by Senator Murray and me and that we would recommend to the Senate that we complete. So it is my hope that Senators will allow us to have a consensus about this bill. As was said by Newsweek magazine last week, this is the Education bill that everybody wants fixed, and we are the ones who are supposed to fix it. So while there are some issues toward the end that are a little more difficult to resolve than others, I hope Senators will agree that people have had a chance to have their say on education issues and that we can go on to the other important issues facing the country. I thank the Republican leader for giving us an opportunity to put this on the floor. I thank the Democratic leader for allowing us to move to the floor without delay.

CREC-2015-07-13-pt1-PgS5019,CREC-2015-07-13,114,FILING CLOTURE,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S5019] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FILING CLOTURE Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is obvious that the Republican leader has certainly changed his view on filing cloture. There was a time on several occasions when the Republican leader bemoaned what he called ``a quick trigger on the cloture motion.'' That is a quote. There was a time--that was in 2012, 2013--when the Republican leader called filing cloture ``heavy-handed behavior.'' Now, keep in mind the backdrop of all of this. For 4 years, the Republicans simply wouldn't let us move to anything. We couldn't offer--they refused to allow bills to come up. We never even got on the bills. We would file a motion to get on a bill; they would object to that. We have a different world now in the 7 months that we have been under the direction of the Republican leader, the senior Senator from Kentucky. We have been working in good faith to try to get things to move along--specifically this bill, the elementary and secondary education bill. There is no sign of a filibuster that I am aware of, at least on our side. There are still a number of major amendments that need to be addressed. Senators Murphy, Booker, Warner, and others have an amendment on accountability for the lowest performing schools. They have worked hard on this. We have Senator Franken, who is very passionate, on an amendment to protect LGBT students from discrimination. Senator Markey has an amendment that provides grants to allow schools to teach climate science. Senator Casey has an amendment to expand and improve early education, particularly for 3- and 4-year- olds. These are important amendments dealing with education. There are others, but these are a few that I mentioned. So to have the Republican leader come to the floor and file cloture when we have just had a few amendments--he can come out and talk about all the votes we have had, but they have been on nothing amendments. They could have been accepted really. We didn't even need votes on them. We have had virtually no serious amendments, and now, all of a sudden, the Republican leader has changed totally, I guess, his philosophy on how to legislate by filing cloture very early. I am very disappointed in this, but it speaks volumes about how this Senate is being run by this Republican majority. It is appropriate to file cloture when the shoe is on the other foot, I guess, except the difference is that we never had a chance to get on the legislation. This is a perfect example of this. We didn't need to have a vote on a motion to get on a bill. We just said: OK, go ahead and move to it. So I am really surprised, quite frankly, but that is what has happened. But it is not the first time I have been surprised about how things have been going on around here the last 6 or 7 months.

Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the Goodlatte amendment. The Goodlatte amendment removes the federal backstops which ensure that states meet their responsibilities under the Clean Water Act to restore the Chesapeake Bay. The Chesapeake Bay is a critical part of Virginia and we are already starting to see the results of successful Bay cleanup efforts. Virginia oysters are booming--last year the harvest was up 25% and passed the 500,000 bushel-mark. That is why Virginia is committed to working with EPA and other Bay states to clean up the Chesapeake. There have been hundreds of millions of dollars invested in this effort and federal backstops play an important role to ensure that all states do their share. But this amendment puts our investments and progress at serious risk. This amendment suggests that it would preserve the rights of the states to write their own water quality plans. But the Commonwealth of Virginia already wrote its own water quality plan and the Total Maximum Daily Load submission was accepted by EPA. So in Virginia, this is simply not a problem. So to me, this amendment looks like an answer in search of a problem. A problem we do not have in Virginia. But what this amendment does do is this. It creates a BIG problem for Virginia because it would allow upstream states off the hook. It would allow upstream states to stop their cleanup with no consequences. In Virginia, we would feel--and see--real consequences. We could see increases in dirty water flowing downstream, reversing all of our hard work. If upstream states stop their cleanups, Virginia would need to double the work and more--and we would still not have a clean Bay. The fact is that this amendment would absolutely undermine the cleanup efforts already underway. It puts at risk future environmental and economic benefits that Virginia would accrue with a cleaner, healthier bay such as more abundant seafood, tourism, recreation, and improved quality of life. As the state at the bottom of the bay watershed, Virginia's success in restoring our part of the Bay is dependent upon what the other states do, or don't do. This amendment would ensure that other states would write the future of Virginia's waters and the future of our Bay. That is why I am working with my colleagues Chris Van Hollen and Bobby Scott to raise awareness of the dangers of this amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote NO. It takes away our clean water future and our clean water investments. This amendment is bad for Virginia and bad for the future health of the Chesapeake Bay. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1041] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016 ______ speech of HON.

TERRI A. SEWELL of alabama in the house of representatives Monday, July 13, 2015 Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 177th Anniversary of Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C. For 177 years Metropolitan A.M.E. Church has stood at the forefront of the fight for social justice and equality. Metropolitan A.M.E. Church, often referred to as the National Cathedral of African Methodism, was formed by the unification of Israel Bethel and Union Bethel. The churches united as a reaction to the dissatisfaction among African-Americans over racial segregation at Ebenezer Methodist Episcopal Church. Their decision to stand together as one body in the face of unwarranted racism and to work for the advancement of the black community was both courageous and heroic. On July 6, 1838, the Baltimore Conference of the African Methodist Episcopal Church officially welcomed Union Bethel to the greater community. In 1872, the name was officially changed to Metropolitan A.M.E. when the Baltimore Conference authorized construction of a new church that would be built in ``close proximity'' to the White House and the United States Capitol. The cornerstone for the new church was laid in 1881, and a stained glass window was dedicated to each contributing Annual Conference that invested in the church's construction. [[Page E1042]] Since its founding, Metropolitan A.M.E. Church has played a pivotal role in seeking justice for African-Americans. From leading anti- slavery efforts and harboring runaway slaves to providing AIDS awareness and registering voters, Metropolitan A.M.E. Church has always been on the forefront of transformative change. Metropolitan A.M.E. Church serves as a sanctuary to all, providing not only a place for worship but also a safe haven. For 177 years, Metropolitan A.M.E. Church has met the needs of the community and has influenced the civic, cultural, and intellectual lives of African- Americans. Their walls hold the memories and wisdom of illustrious guests like Frederick Douglass and Eleanor Roosevelt who addressed the most pressing social issues that plagued our growing nation. Metropolitan A.M.E. Church has hosted numerous historic events including the official pre-Inaugural prayer services for President William Jefferson Clinton in 1993 and 1997--thus becoming the first African-American church to ever serve in such a capacity. Likewise, Metropolitan A.M.E. Church hosted the National Memorial Service for Mrs. Rosa Parks, the mother of the modern American Civil Rights movement. Most recently, Metropolitan A.M.E. Church opened its doors to the community in the aftermath of the June 17, 2015, church shooting at Mother Emanuel in Charleston, South Carolina. Hundreds came to Metropolitan A.M.E. Church to honor the nine victims and to seek comfort in the church's warm embrace. Metropolitan A.M.E. Church follows in the rich tradition and mission of its parent denomination, the historic African Methodist Episcopal Church. The African Methodist Episcopal Church was born in protest of slavery and racial discrimination in 1787, after members of the Free Africa Society were forced off their knees as they prayed at St. George's Methodist Episcopal Church in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was at this moment that the members of the Free African Society realized that when it came to the American Methodist Church, their shackles had not yet been removed. Richard Allen, Absalom Jones, and other free blacks established the African Methodist Episcopal Church as a refuge from racism--a safe place to worship in spite of the opposition they received as members of St. George's Church. Their journey to establish a new church denomination was not easy, but the seeds they planted soon grew. In the weaning days of the Confederacy, the membership of the African Methodist Episcopal Church grew rapidly, as the Union army permitted church members to recruit newly freed slaves. Metropolitan A.M.E. Church rose out of this rich legacy, and became a powerful agent for change in its own right. Metropolitan A.M.E. Church has played a vital role in our history, standing tall as a cornerstone of its community through the test of time. This tradition continues today, and will continue well into the future. On a personal note, I am pleased to serve as the keynote speaker for the 177th Anniversary Service on July 12, 2015. It is a high honor to have the opportunity to celebrate the 177 years of contributions and exemplary service of Metropolitan A.M.E. Church. It is a privilege to stand in the same pulpit as esteemed guests such as Paul Laurence Dunbar, Mary McLeod Bethune, and Dorothy I. Height. As a life member of the historic Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church in Selma, Alabama, I can truly say that it was the support of my church family and the teachings of African Methodist Episcopal Church ministry that helped me grow into the woman I am today. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognition of the 177th Anniversary of Metropolitan A.M.E. Church on this distinguished occasion. May the glory of Metropolitan A.M.E. Church continue to grow and prosper for years to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1041-E1042] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 177TH ANNIVERSARY OF METROPOLITAN AFRICAN METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH ______ HON.

[[page e1042]] since its founding, metropolitan a.m.e. church has played a pivotal role in seeking justice for african-americans. from leading anti- slavery efforts and harboring runaway slaves to providing aids awareness and registering voters, metropolitan a.m.e. church has always been on the forefront of transformative change. metropolitan a.m.e. church serves as a sanctuary to all, providing not only a place for worship but also a safe haven. for 177 years, metropolitan a.m.e. church has met the needs of the community and has influenced the civic, cultural, and intellectual lives of african- americans. their walls hold the memories and wisdom of illustrious guests like frederick douglass and eleanor roosevelt who addressed the most pressing social issues that plagued our growing nation. metropolitan a.m.e. church has hosted numerous historic events including the official pre-inaugural prayer services for president william jefferson clinton in 1993 and 1997--thus becoming the first african-american church to ever serve in such a capacity. likewise, metropolitan a.m.e. church hosted the national memorial service for mrs. rosa parks, the mother of the modern american civil rights movement. most recently, metropolitan a.m.e. church opened its doors to the community in the aftermath of the june 17, 2015, church shooting at mother emanuel in charleston, south carolina. hundreds came to metropolitan a.m.e. church to honor the nine victims and to seek comfort in the church's warm embrace. metropolitan a.m.e. church follows in the rich tradition and mission of its parent denomination, the historic african methodist episcopal church. the african methodist episcopal church was born in protest of slavery and racial discrimination in 1787, after members of the free africa society were forced off their knees as they prayed at st. george's methodist episcopal church in philadelphia, pennsylvania. it was at this moment that the members of the free african society realized that when it came to the american methodist church, their shackles had not yet been removed. richard allen, absalom jones, and other free blacks established the african methodist episcopal church as a refuge from racism--a safe place to worship in spite of the opposition they received as members of st. george's church. their journey to establish a new church denomination was not easy, but the seeds they planted soon grew. in the weaning days of the confederacy, the membership of the african methodist episcopal church grew rapidly, as the union army permitted church members to recruit newly freed slaves. metropolitan a.m.e. church rose out of this rich legacy, and became a powerful agent for change in its own right. metropolitan a.m.e. church has played a vital role in our history, standing tall as a cornerstone of its community through the test of time. this tradition continues today, and will continue well into the future. on a personal note, i am pleased to serve as the keynote speaker for the 177th anniversary service on july 12, 2015. it is a high honor to have the opportunity to celebrate the 177 years of contributions and exemplary service of metropolitan a.m.e. church. it is a privilege to stand in the same pulpit as esteemed guests such as paul laurence dunbar, mary mcleod bethune, and dorothy i. height. as a life member of the historic brown chapel a.m.e. church in selma, alabama, i can truly say that it was the support of my church family and the teachings of african methodist episcopal church ministry that helped me grow into the woman i am today. i ask my colleagues to join me in recognition of the 177th anniversary of metropolitan a.m.e. church on this distinguished occasion. may the glory of metropolitan a.m.e. church continue to grow and prosper for years to come. ____________________",5481
CREC-2015-07-13-pt1-PgE1042,CREC-2015-07-13,114,AFRICA'S DISPLACED PEOPLE,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1042-E1043] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AFRICA'S DISPLACED PEOPLE ______ HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH of new jersey in the house of representatives Monday, July 13, 2015 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, last year, nearly 60 million people were displaced worldwide. In fact, one out of every 122 people on Earth today is either a refugee, internally displaced in their home country or seeking asylum in another country. In sub-Saharan Africa, there are more than 15 million displaced people. Of that total, 3.7 million are refugees and 11.4 million are internally displaced. These disruptions of normal life in Africa are caused by conflicts such as in Somalia, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Burundi, Western Sahara and elsewhere. These disruptions not only affect those who are displaced, but also the people in whose communities these displaced people are relocated. African refugees and internally displaced people face numerous issues--from security in the places in which they seek refuge, to death and mayhem trying to reach places of refuge, to conflict with surrounding populations to warehousing that consigns generations to be born and live in foreign countries. A hearing I held yesterday examined the various issues displaced people face and the U.S. response to these conditions in order to determine the effectiveness of our government's efforts to help and to determine whether course corrections are necessary. The terrible plight of African refugees has been much in the news in recent months because of the death of thousands trying to reach Europe across the Mediterranean Sea and attacks on refugees in South Africa reportedly caused by xenophobia. On the South African case, I sent two members of my staff to southern Africa last month to look into the incidents of violence against refugees in South Africa. What they found was appalling. Despite a very generous set of laws and programs to enable immigration into South Africa, refugees were often refused medical service at hospitals that supposedly offer free medical care to all people. Apparently, no matter what the law in South Africa says, staff who screen patients often simply refuse to allow people they consider foreigners to receive medical care. According to refugees who spoke with my staff, this has meant that refugee women have had to give birth on the floor of hospitals while hospital staff refused to provide services. As for those refugees trying to cross the Mediterranean to seek sanctuary in Europe, more than 1,800 people have died making that trip this year as of early June. On the cover of the April 25th issue of The Economist magazine, the failure of the nations of Europe to devise a workable, humane policy toward those fleeing to their continent was described as ``a moral and political disgrace.'' Many of the refugees trying to cross the Mediterranean are Eritreans, who also have fled persecution and repression at home through the Gulf of Aden and also through the Sinai Peninsula, where they are often at the mercy of ruthless Bedouin groups, who traffic them or hold them for ransom. Eritrea is a closed society, so our knowledge of conditions there comes mostly from refugees, but one has to ask how bad must conditions there be if so many Eritreans are willing to risk their lives and well-being to find refuge almost anywhere else? Unresolved conflicts have forced many refugees to experience protracted stays in foreign countries. For example, refugees have not only had children but also grandchildren in camps in Kenya and Algeria. After more than two decades, the situation in Somalia remains unresolved, and Somali refugees are unable to resume their lives in their homeland. Yet they face an increasingly hostile Kenyan environment in which the government is unwilling to allow Somalis to establish financial independence outside refugee camps. In Algeria, Sahrawis, refugees from the Western Sahara territory under the control of Morocco, have lived in camps in western Algeria since being chased out of the territory by the advance of hundreds of thousands of Moroccans in 1975. The Government of Algeria not only provides a home for the Sahrawis, but also supplies access to free education and health care. Still, income-generating activities by Sahrawis are discouraged to prevent competition with local Algerians. Internally displaced persons also face serious challenges. In Nigeria, for example, more than 1.5 million people from northeastern Nigeria have fled attacks by Boko Haram and resulting Nigerian military activities. However, Nigeria is a patchwork of 36 states whose creation over the years has inflamed ethnic and religious tensions as state majorities became minorities suddenly. The Nigerian IDPs are generally living in communities rather than camps. The longer they remain in their current areas, the greater the chance their presence will inflame new unrest as the ethnic and religious balance in their new areas is again changed abruptly. The United States and the rest of the international community face serious challenges in addressing the displacement of so many people. According to U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres, the ``international response capacities are overstretched by the unprecedented rise in global forced displacement.'' We must carefully consider the U.S. role in meeting the increasing challenge of Africa's displaced people, taking into consideration our moral imperative to help those in need, as well as strategic interests in preventing the kind of neglect that makes terrorist recruitment among displaced people easier than it should be.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the long and distinguished public service career of our friend, Mr. Mike Roos. I had the great honor of working with Mike as colleagues in the California State Assembly along with several other current and former members of this House. I count myself fortunate to call him a good friend. In 1999, Mike founded Mike Roos and Company, a public affairs firm that Mike shaped specializes in government relations, corporate issues management, media relations, and ballot measure campaigns. Prior to establishing Mike Roos and Company, Mike served as President and CEO of the Los Angeles Alliance for Restructuring Now, a coalition of business and civic leaders from the Los Angeles Area dedicated to implementing systemic reform and restructuring within the Los Angeles Unified School District. His significant efforts in this capacity have undoubtedly changed countless lives of children in the Los Angeles area for the better. Mike's distinguished Assembly career began in 1977. He earned the love and respect of both his Democratic and Republican colleagues. His own caucus chose him Majority Floor Leader in his second term, a position he held until his 1987 election as Assembly Speaker Pro Tempore. He had the reputation as a genuine legislator--someone who used the power of lawmaking to make the lives of the People of California better. Perhaps his most well known achievement is the Mello Roos Community Facilities Act of 1982 and the Roberti-Roos Weapons Control Act of 1989. Mike authored the strictest laws to date protecting the confidentiality of HIV patients, as well as the law creating the Alternative Test Sites Program, which established centers where individuals could receive free, anonymous testing for the AIDS antibody. He consistently fought for a better education for all, authoring legislation prohibiting sex discrimination in California's educational institutions. Prior to his election to the State Assembly, Mike served as the Executive Director of the Coro Foundation, a leadership training program for future leaders in public service. Thanks to his substantial experience and insight, he continues to be a valuable consultant to civic and educational organizations, speaking on topics ranging from education reform to the legislative process in California politics. Mr. Speaker, I know I speak for the whole House in thanking Mike for his years of service on behalf of the people of California. I know he looks forward to spending time with his family, including his four daughters Shelby, Melissa, Catherine, and Caroline. I wish him nothing but success and happiness. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1043] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF MIKE ROOS ______ HON.

It was during his time working as a defense contractor with Vitro Services, now known as BAE Systems, that Olin began his career as a Charter Boat Captain, purchasing his first charter boat in 1965. As a result of his dedication and hard work, what began as a small weekend business, Olin Marler Charters would flourish into one of the oldest and most successful charter boat operations in the State of Florida, and over the years, Olin helped thousands of locals and tourists experience the God-given natural beauty of the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. To some, Olin Marler will be remembered as a legendary boat captain; to others, he will be remembered for his great stories and his love of fishing. To his friends and family, however, he will forever be remembered as a loving husband, father, grandfather, and great- grandfather. While fishing and the smiles on his customers' faces brought Olin great happiness, his greatest blessing and love was his family. On behalf of the United States Congress, I am privileged to recognize the life of Clarence Olin Marler. Without question, his contributions to the Northwest Florida economy will be felt for years to come; however, more important was the joy Olin brought to his customers, friends, and family, and the legacy he leaves behind. My wife Vicki and I extend our heartfelt prayers and condolences to his wife, Donna; sons, Greg and Andrew; daughter, Hannah; grandchildren, Caden Lee Olin Marler, Mallisa Marler Scott and Jacob Marler; great- grandchildren; and the entire Marler family. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1044] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF NORTHWEST FLORIDA'S BELOVED CLARENCE OLIN MARLER ______ HON.

TRENT KELLY of mississippi in the house of representatives Monday, July 13, 2015 Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, July 10 is a special day to me. It marks the day of my first floor speech as a member of the United States House of Representatives, and I rise to recognize and celebrate two great men who have been influential in my life. They are John Forrest Kelly, my oldest son, who was born on this date in 1995, and my father, John M. Kelly, who was born on July 9, 1941. I rise in recognition and honor of my son, John Forrest Kelly. John Forrest, or JFK as we commonly refer to him, was born in Tupelo, Mississippi to Sheila Stephens Kelly and me. John Forrest was the first grandchild for both his paternal and maternal lines. JFK is an extremely smart and articulate man. He graduated from Saltillo High School in 2013. During his high school career, he achieved high academic success. He was a well-liked and well-rounded student-athlete. He played one year of football and started for the Saltillo High School Tigers Baseball Team as an outfielder. After high school, he received academic scholarships and is currently a business major at the University of Mississippi; he is a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity. John Forrest is an extremely bright young man, and I am confident of a bright future in whatever career path he chooses. I am extremely proud of him and his two siblings Morgan Grace (age 16) and Jackson Trent (age 9). I rise in remembrance and honor of my father, John M. Kelly. John, commonly referred to as Big John, Papa John, Top, 1SG Kelly, or Papaw, was born on July 9, 1941 in Newton County, Mississippi to Madison Houston Kelly and Ludie Irene Robinson Kelly. The youngest child, his parents were small farmers in Newton County, Mississippi. John excelled in sports, playing basketball, baseball, and football for both Union and Decatur High Schools. He graduated in 1959 from Decatur High School. On June 3, 1961, he married Barbara Carolyn Mott Kelly. Married for 44 years, Big John and Barbara had three children: Lisa Renee Kelly Carley, and two sons, John Trent Kelly and James Kevin Kelly. With Barbara and his daughter Lisa by his side, Big John passed away from lung cancer on February 7, 2005, while both of his sons were deployed to Iraq as members of the 150th Engineer Battalion, 155th Brigade Combat Team. Big John was a loving and caring father and a great provider for his family. John started out on the line in the furniture industry. Through hard work and intelligence, he worked his way up to managing furniture plants. He was a foreman, supervisor, superintendent and held many other leadership positions throughout his life. John always made time for family and community, coaching his sons, daughter and others in Union, Mississippi little league baseball until they went to high school. In 1959, he joined the Mississippi Army National Guard until his retirement in 2001 at the mandatory retirement age of 60. He served with both his sons during his tenure in the National Guard, including mobilizing in 1990 for Desert Shield/Storm in the 134th Combat Engineer Company, 155th Armored Brigade. During Desert Storm, John was a Staff Sergeant and Engineer Squad Leader, I was an Engineer Second Lieutenant and Platoon Leader, and Kevin was a Specialist 4 and Engineer Soldier. John was First Sergeant for three of the four companies of the 150th Combat Engineer Battalion and retired as a Master Sergeant and Operations Sergeant in the 150th Engineer Battalion, 155th Heavy Brigade Combat Team. Big John was always a caring and giving individual and was loved by most people who knew him. He was never too busy to help anyone in need. I have often said during my life if I am half the man my father was I will be a great man. He was a great husband to my wonderful mother, Barbara. He was a great inspiration and role model for me and my siblings and the best father and grandfather a man could ever ask to have. Happy Birthday to my son, John Forrest Kelly, and to my father, John ``Big John'' ``Daddy'' Kelly. I thank and honor them both for being such a great influence in my life. I love them both with all my heart and soul. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to acknowledge and honor two very important men in my life, one with a great past, the other with a promising future. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1044] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BIRTHDAY WISHES ______ HON.

CREC-2015-07-13-pt1-PgE1044-3,CREC-2015-07-13,114,STUDENT SUCCESS ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1044-E1045] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STUDENT SUCCESS ACT ______ speech of HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Wednesday, February 25, 2015 The House in Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 5) to support State and local accountability for public education, protect State and local authority, inform parents of the performance of their children's schools, and for other purposes: Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 5, the ``Student Success Act,'' which would harm the education of our nation's youth. I thank Chairman Kline, Ranking Member Scott, and all the members of the Committee on Education and the Workforce for their work to improve education for our nation's children. Unfortunately, the bill before the House for consideration, should it become law, would harm our most vulnerable children, including those who attend urban and rural schools, and special needs children who need equal access to an excellent education. In my 18th District of Texas, over 30% of students in the Houston Independent School district (HISD) live below the poverty line. H.R. 5 threatens to cut over $17 million from HISD, one of the largest reductions in Title I funding in the state of Texas. I cannot stand by and support legislation that takes funds and resources away from children who are already struggling to meet their own basic needs. This bill allows Title I ``portability'' which would allow states to redirect funds away from high concentrations of poverty and siphon monies to low-poverty schools. This proposal, if enacted, would allow states to redirect funds away from districts with the highest concentrations of poverty, and into [[Page E1045]] more affluent districts with less need for such support. The vast majority of the children affected by ``portability,'' are black or Hispanic. As legislators, as Americans, we have a generational responsibility to enhance the lives of those who will follow us, especially the most vulnerable. H.R. 5 guts education funding, while diverting funds away from high- poverty schools by freezing funding at FY 2015 levels for six years, which represents over $800 million in cuts to these programs compared to pre-sequester funding. Mr. Chair, what does it say about our commitment to our youth that we are willing to cut funding for the future leaders of America? For decades, we threw money at education without making sure our schools were actually improving, or whether we were giving teachers the tools they need, or whether our taxpayer dollars were being used effectively. And our students too often paid the price. The bill as it exists now allows for the establishment of separate, lower standards for students with developmental disabilities. As a result of these standards, opportunities available for students with disabilities later in life would suffer considerably. H.R. 5 converts much of the funding currently directed at English learners, migrant students, or at-risk students into block-grants, which would enable those funds to be spent outside the target populations. Support for these students would also be eroded by suspending requirements that school districts improve the English-speaking ability of such students. It is my concern as H.R. 5 is currently drafted abdicates the historic Federal role in elementary and secondary education of ensuring the educational progress of all of America's students, including students from low-income families, students with disabilities, English learners, and students of color. `No Child Left Behind' needs to be fixed, but Republicans are pushing a bill that would gut education funding, eliminate and weaken protections for disadvantaged students, does not provide a well-rounded education for all students, and does not support educators. The Statement of Administration Policy from the Obama administration agrees on the need for high-quality statewide annual testing as required in H.R. 5, so parents and teachers know how children and schools are doing from year to year and to allow for consistent measurement of school and student performance across the State. However the administration has stated that this bill should do more to reduce redundant and unnecessary testing, such as asking States to limit the amount of time spent on standardized testing and requiring parental notification when testing is consuming too much classroom learning time. In its current state the Obama administration recommends a veto of H.R. 5. It is sobering to me, as the founder and co-chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus and someone who has long advocated on behalf of young people from all backgrounds, to see a bill that would have such a negative impact on the very children who need our help the most. In addition to these sad truths, the bill currently under consideration would strike a devastating blow to our schools' ability to provide the variety of programs that our children deserve. It repeals dedicated funding for programs such as student safety, after and summer school programming, STEM education, education technology, arts education, literacy and block-grants support, forcing high-need districts to choose between funding vital services. It should not be overlooked that one of these programs that is considered expendable is STEM-focused education, an area of importance both nationally and to my constituents in Houston. The Houston region is one of the most important industrial bases in the world and was recently ranked the No. 1 U.S. manufacturing city by Manufacturers' News Inc. Houston is also home to the largest medical complex in the world--the Texas Medical Center--and provides clinical health care, research and education at its 54 institutions. These jobs, and truly the middle class of this decade as a whole, are dependent on workers who get the right STEM education and job training today. Brookings' Metropolitan Policy Program's report ``The Hidden STEM Economy'' reported that in 2011, 26 million jobs or 20 percent of all occupations required knowledge in 1 or more STEM areas. The same report stressed that fully half of all STEM jobs are available to workers without a 4 year degree and these jobs pay on average $53,000 a year, which is 10 percent higher than jobs with similar education requirements. To eliminate federal funding aimed at enhancing STEM education is to cripple an entire generation of America's youth, leaving them without skills that may be essential in securing their own future and the economic prosperity of our nation. Finally, it must be addressed that the defining characteristic of our primary and secondary education system has been to prepare our students for college. H.R. 5 does not contain any provisions that states consult with institutes of higher education in order to ensure that their academic standards are consistent with what will be demanded of those students once they graduate. As a result, many students, even after receiving a high school diploma, will find themselves unprepared to pursue a college degree if they choose to. We must look at the environments in which we are asking these students to succeed and ensure we have the best protections in place to provide safe educational institutions. Amendment #93 of this bill, Jackson Lee Amendment, supports accountability-based programs and activities that are designed to enhance school safety, which may include research-based bullying prevention, cyberbullying prevention, disruption of recruitment activity by groups or individuals involved in violent extremism, and gang prevention programs as well as intervention programs regarding bullying. H.R. 5 eliminates the current requirement that districts take action when their schools are under resourced and unable to meet the needs of all students. Together with the lack of consideration and support for at-risk and low-income youth, this will result in those students being marginalized and denied educational opportunity rather than given the support and resources they so desperately need. I urge all my colleagues to join with me and oppose the passage of H.R. 5. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1044-E1045] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STUDENT SUCCESS ACT ______ speech of HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Wednesday, February 25, 2015 The House in Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 5) to support State and local accountability for public education, protect State and local authority, inform parents of the performance of their children's schools, and for other purposes: Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 5, the ``Student Success Act,'' which would harm the education of our nation's youth. I thank Chairman Kline, Ranking Member Scott, and all the members of the Committee on Education and the Workforce for their work to improve education for our nation's children. Unfortunately, the bill before the House for consideration, should it become law, would harm our most vulnerable children, including those who attend urban and rural schools, and special needs children who need equal access to an excellent education. In my 18th District of Texas, over 30% of students in the Houston Independent School district (HISD) live below the poverty line. H.R. 5 threatens to cut over $17 million from HISD, one of the largest reductions in Title I funding in the state of Texas. I cannot stand by and support legislation that takes funds and resources away from children who are already struggling to meet their own basic needs. This bill allows Title I ``portability'' which would allow states to redirect funds away from high concentrations of poverty and siphon monies to low-poverty schools. This proposal, if enacted, would allow states to redirect funds away from districts with the highest concentrations of poverty, and into [[Page E1045]] more affluent districts with less need for such support. The vast majority of the children affected by ``portability,'' are black or Hispanic. As legislators, as Americans, we have a generational responsibility to enhance the lives of those who will follow us, especially the most vulnerable. H.R. 5 guts education funding, while diverting funds away from high- poverty schools by freezing funding at FY 2015 levels for six years, which represents over $800 million in cuts to these programs compared to pre-sequester funding. Mr. Chair, what does it say about our commitment to our youth that we are willing to cut funding for the future leaders of America? For decades, we threw money at education without making sure our schools were actually improving, or whether we were giving teachers the tools they need, or whether our taxpayer dollars were being used effectively. And our students too often paid the price. The bill as it exists now allows for the establishment of separate, lower standards for students with developmental disabilities. As a result of these standards, opportunities available for students with disabilities later in life would suffer considerably. H.R. 5 converts much of the funding currently directed at English learners, migrant students, or at-risk students into block-grants, which would enable those funds to be spent outside the target populations. Support for these students would also be eroded by suspending requirements that school districts improve the English-speaking ability of such students. It is my concern as H.R. 5 is currently drafted abdicates the historic Federal role in elementary and secondary education of ensuring the educational progress of all of America's students, including students from low-income families, students with disabilities, English learners, and students of color. `No Child Left Behind' needs to be fixed, but Republicans are pushing a bill that would gut education funding, eliminate and weaken protections for disadvantaged students, does not provide a well-rounded education for all students, and does not support educators. The Statement of Administration Policy from the Obama administration agrees on the need for high-quality statewide annual testing as required in H.R. 5, so parents and teachers know how children and schools are doing from year to year and to allow for consistent measurement of school and student performance across the State. However the administration has stated that this bill should do more to reduce redundant and unnecessary testing, such as asking States to limit the amount of time spent on standardized testing and requiring parental notification when testing is consuming too much classroom learning time. In its current state the Obama administration recommends a veto of H.R. 5. It is sobering to me, as the founder and co-chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus and someone who has long advocated on behalf of young people from all backgrounds, to see a bill that would have such a negative impact on the very children who need our help the most. In addition to these sad truths, the bill currently under consideration would strike a devastating blow to our schools' ability to provide the variety of programs that our children deserve. It repeals dedicated funding for programs such as student safety, after and summer school programming, STEM education, education technology, arts education, literacy and block-grants support, forcing high-need districts to choose between funding vital services. It should not be overlooked that one of these programs that is considered expendable is STEM-focused education, an area of importance both nationally and to my constituents in Houston. The Houston region is one of the most important industrial bases in the world and was recently ranked the No. 1 U.S. manufacturing city by Manufacturers' News Inc. Houston is also home to the largest medical complex in the world--the Texas Medical Center--and provides clinical health care, research and education at its 54 institutions. These jobs, and truly the middle class of this decade as a whole, are dependent on workers who get the right STEM education and job training today. Brookings' Metropolitan Policy Program's report ``The Hidden STEM Economy'' reported that in 2011, 26 million jobs or 20 percent of all occupations required knowledge in 1 or more STEM areas.

Mr. Chair, federal funding for biomedical research has been stagnant over the past several years, another victim of unwise and shortsighted sequestration and budget cuts that put deficit reduction before investments that can save lives. With no increase to counter the effects of inflation and increased cost of research, NIH has lost 22 percent of its purchasing power over the last decade. NIH has been forced to cut or deny funding for thousands of promising studies that could hold the key to incredible breakthroughs. We should do everything we can to bring cures to patients as quickly as possible. Far too many people suffer from rare, serious and deadly diseases, and its outrageous cures could be found except for the lack of funding. It's also important we make sure drugs are safe and actually do what they are intended to do. I have concerns with some of the proposed changes to FDA's approval process designed to speed drugs and devices to market. We need to be certain that the proposed changes will not subject patients to a high level of risk. I expect the Senate will review and fix those provisions when they take up the bill. HR. 6 does what Congress has been unable to do because the Republican majority refuses to understand a simple fact: Funding biomedical research, just like investing in our roads and bridges, is an investment, not wasteful spending.

JOSEPH R. PITTS of pennsylvania in the house of representatives Thursday, July 9, 2015 The House in Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 6) to accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of 21st century cures, and for other purposes: Mr. PITTS. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support for H.R. 6, the 21st Century Cures Act which will help advance the discovery, development, and delivery of new treatments and cures for patients and will foster private sector innovation here in the U.S. Arriving here today has been a long journey--full of lots of steps and some twists and turns along the way. I especially want to thank Legislative Counsel for their tireless efforts in helping translate our legislative aims into legislative language. They worked nights and weekends and were consummate professionals throughout the process. Specifically, I want to thank the following: Warren Burke, Ed Grossman, Jessica Shapiro, Michelle Vanek, and Jesse Cross. I also want to thank the health care staff of the Congressional Budget Office for all their help in recent months. In addition to their role in estimating the budgetary effects of numerous policies in the bill, they were instrumental in helping us shape a number of proposals the Committee considered. I specifically want to thank Holly Harvey, Tom Bradley, Chad Chirico, and all their colleagues for their diligence and assistance through the process. And I would be remiss if I did not again thank the outstanding team on Energy and Commerce, and most especially the Health team, led by Chief Health Counsel, Clay Alspach, supported by Josh Trent, Paul Edattel, John Stone, Robert Horne, Carly McWilliams, Michelle Rosenberg, Katie Novaria, Adrianna Simonelli, Traci Vitek and Graham Pittman--without whose expertise, wisdom and counsel, this legislative work would not be possible. H.R. 6 was reported from Energy and Commerce Committee by a vote of 51-0 and advances conservative fiscal and regulatory reforms. Every dollar of advanced appropriations in the bill (which will sunset at the end of FY 2020) is offset with other permanent reforms--including billions of dollars in mandatory entitlement savings in Medicare and Medicaid. But this is no ordinary mandatory spending--like the kind we usually see in entitlement spending such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and Obamacare. This mandatory spending is for five years only and then stops or sunsets. This mandatory spending is fully paid for with mandatory spending cuts elsewhere that will not stop in five years, but are permanent reforms resulting in real savings. By comparison, the Ryan-Murray budget deal for health care savings yielded much less. This innovative hybrid approach allows us to cut mandatory spending (entitlement spending) and use the savings to fund what would otherwise be a discretionary project--but in this case is 5-year dedicated spending on medical research. Congressional Budget Office determined that H.R. 6 will reduce the deficit by $500 million over the first ten years, and at least another $7 billion over the second decade. The funds provided to the National Institutes for Health (NIH) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will be subject to explicit review and reprogramming though the annual appropriations process. Congress can review the dedicated funding and allocate it for specific initiatives. Additionally, all the important policy riders that accompany federal funding through appropriations will be included--such as the Hyde Amendment and the Dickey-Wicker Amendment. This bill also includes a policy that excludes authorized generics from Average Manufacturers' Price. This is a commonsense policy from the President's budget proposal, intended to ensure the appropriate calculation of Medicaid brand name rebates paid by manufacturers. The policy is not intended to effect Medicaid programs' pharmacy reimbursements. Instead, the provision, which many states support, will result in an increase in manufacturer rebates under Medicaid and thus save money for states and the federal government. H.R. 6 will help America to innovate its way out of our entitlement crisis. The regulatory reforms included in H.R. 6 will accelerate the pace of discovery, development and delivery of new treatments and cures, thereby providing significant health care savings to the federal budget that will only grow over time. By modernizing clinical trials, eliminating duplicative administrative requirements, and perhaps most importantly, making FDA less bureaucratic by advancing the voice and needs of patients in the drug and device approval process--H.R. 6 will make lasting, positive changes to the entire ecosystem of Cures. Over 250 patient groups have enthusiastically said ``yes'' and endorsed Cures. I urge all of my colleagues to think of the patients and vote ``AYE'' in support of H.R. 6. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1046] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 21ST CENTURY CURES ACT ______ speech of HON.

LOUISE McINTOSH SLAUGHTER of new york in the house of representatives Thursday, July 9, 2015 Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I am the Ranking Member of the Rules Committee. Rules, as you know, is the process committee. Whether you are a majority or a minority member, you have rights, but they have been trampled on and abused with increasing regularity under this majority, and we have two glaring examples of that just today. Mr. Speaker, this bill is important to all of us, and we all agree on the importance of putting more money into major research in the United States, we are falling behind other countries in finding the cures and the innovation for which we have been known for centuries. This is an important step that we are taking. This is a critically important bill, but process matters. Mr. Speaker, after the Energy and Commerce Committee had voted out this bill unanimously, major changes were made with no committee input at all. They include a reduction of the amount of money that the committee had said would be put into the National Institutes of Health by $1.250 billion, a very substantial sum. They added some policy riders that literally made no sense. Why in the world would you put an abortion rider on a bill for medical research? As far as I know, the NIH and most medical universities doing this research do not perform abortion procedures. It was simply a way, again, to mollify members and make them vote for this bill. Mr. Speaker, despite the importance of this bill, despite the fact that it came out of committee unanimously, despite the fact that so many people have worked on it, and despite the fact that good things were in it, the process was completely changed after it was over by rewriting major portions of it. That doesn't appear anywhere in the rules of the House. Now, let's also think about what happened here last night during the debate on the Interior bill, which was considered under an open rule. After the Ranking Member, Betty McCollum of Minnesota, had yielded back her time, a new amendment was offered at the request of Republican leadership in order to pick up enough votes to ensure final passage. This new amendment sought to undo two already adopted amendments that would restrict the display of the Confederate flags in National Park Service cemeteries. These amendments were initially noncontroversial-- as they should have remained. In fact, they were adopted by voice vote. However, following a revolt by Members of the Republican Conference, Republican leadership offered this new amendment without any warning in order to gain more votes. In the end, the Majority pulled the entire bill in order to avoid taking a vote on their effort to place Confederate flags in U.S. cemeteries. Mr. Speaker, and then this morning the Majority chose to send Leader Pelosi's resolution to committee in order to avoid taking a vote on it. Her resolution would have required the removal of state flags containing the Confederate battle flag from the House wing of the Capitol, unless the flag is flown by an individual Member. Mr. McGovern stated quite precisely that the resolution will die in committee--we will never see that one again. Unfortunately, that's what happens here, but Mr. Speaker, it is time it was stopped. I was born in a border State, in Kentucky. I lived there most of my life. I was educated there. I never saw a Confederate flag in all those years. These battle flags that they are putting up appeared in the South after the civil rights legislation. They were the products of Strom Thurmond and the Dixiecrats. That is when they started to bloom all over. It is a symbol of pure hate or fear. It needs to go. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1046] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 6, 21ST CENTURY CURES ACT ______ speech of HON.

ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Monday, July 13, 2015 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce the Reducing the Effects of the Cyberattack on OPM Victims Emergency Response Act of 2015 (the RECOVER Act), a bill to require the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to provide complimentary and comprehensive identity protection coverage to all individuals whose personally identifiable information was compromised during recent OPM data breaches. Senator Ben Cardin (D- MD) has introduced the companion bill in the Senate. Yesterday, OPM reported that more than 21.5 million current and former federal employees have had their personal information compromised in a second OPM data breach, five times more than the 4.2 million already reported, for a grand total of 25.7 million federal employees and retirees. OPM said that the 21.5 million individuals whose background check records were compromised would receive only three years of credit monitoring and identity theft protection services and $1 million in loss coverage, while the other 4.2 million individuals whose personnel records were compromised would receive 18 months of credit monitoring and $1 million in loss coverage. In light of the scope of OPM's data breach and the limited protection that is proposed, I, along with my House colleagues Chris Van Hollen, Don Beyer, Donna Edwards, C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, Elijah Cummings, Gerald Connolly, and John Delaney introduce a bill that would provide free lifetime identity theft protection coverage that includes identity theft insurance for losses up to $5 million. This protection is particularly necessary since the breach was discovered a year after hackers had already infiltrated OPM's system. OPM's proposed protection would not protect current and former federal workers if hackers simply waited for a period of years before exploiting the stolen identities. However, our bill would give current and former federal employees some peace of mind. The RECOVER Act is necessary to reduce the angst of our dedicated public servants resulting from this entire ordeal. OPM failed to protect our current and former federal employees. It follows that the government must do the right thing to make up for its mistake. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1047] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE RECOVER ACT (REDUCING THE EFFECTS OF THE CYBERATTACK ON OPM VICTIMS EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACT OF 2015) ______ HON.

CREC-2015-07-13-pt1-PgE1047-3,CREC-2015-07-13,114,21ST CENTURY CURES ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1047-E1049] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 21ST CENTURY CURES ACT ______ speech of HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Thursday, July 9, 2015 The House in Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 6) to accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of 21st century cures, and for other purposes: Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 6, the 21st Century Cures Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation that is vital to the future and health of our Nation's citizens and ecosystem. This thoughtful legislation is the culmination of the hard work of my dedicated colleagues who have sought out and engaged in public conversations with patients, innovators, providers, regulators and researchers about how to move advances in science and medicine into new therapies. This outreach has garnered the critical input and support of more than 370 patient and physician groups, state and local organizations, cancer centers, and research and life sciences. I'm proud to be one of the cosponsors of H.R. 6, which represents a new national effort to find treatment and cures for thousands of unknown and rare diseases. Looking to the various policies this legislation aims to address, it is important to highlight the commendable objectives and that will not only accelerate the discovery, development and delivery of new treatments and cures for thousands of serious and rare diseases, but it will also open the doors of innovation and the growth of health care system by enhancing and enriching the medical field for all Americans. The most ambitious action calls for $10 billion in mandatory funding to be delivered over the next five years to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is part of our nation's top ranked educational research institutions in the world. In order to maintain our global competitiveness in the biomedical field, we must invest in the industries that guarantee economic prosperity for our current and future economies. It has been estimated that every $1 of NIH funding generates about $2.21 in local economic growth, and, in 2012, NIH funded research supported an estimated 402,000 jobs all across the U.S. The bill's funding for NIH would provide for an annual 3% increases in the NIH budget, which has been stagnant for the past few years and which desperately needs more funding to capitalize on emerging scientific insights. This increased funding not only aims to continue the sustainability of our economy but it also supports our President's initiative to provide more resources to the biomedical field. The 21st Century Cure Act supports the President's Precision Medicine Initiative, which would advance a new model of participant-centered research to accelerate biomedical discoveries and provide clinicians with new tools and therapies tailored to individual patients' needs. The Obama Administration believes they can build on their progress in improving the drug development and approval process by: incorporating patients' voices into the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decision- making; encouraging the development and qualification of reliable biomarkers to accelerate work on important new therapies; and reducing barriers to initiating medical device trials. In furtherance of this initiative, H.R. 6 allows for the creation of an ``Innovation Fund'' through the National Institute of Health. [[Page E1048]] This ``Innovation Fund'' is a welcome effort because it promotes the maintenance of the best biomedical workforce in the world and help to increase the diversity of the biomedical workforce. In particular, the $2 billion provided for the Innovation Fund, will not only increase the number of the research projects it supports but it also increases the cap for NIH's loan repayment programs. This would include a repayment program for clinical scientists who do research in health disparities and for clinical scientist from disadvantaged backgrounds, from $35,000 per year to $50,000 per year plus a yearly inflation for adjustment. With the support of H.R. 6, underrepresented communities and those with disadvantaged backgrounds from across the country can undoubtedly provide the future researchers and workers of the biomedical workforce. The Journal on STEM Education reported in 2011 that only 8.34% of the STEM doctorates awarded in 2006 were given to underrepresented minorities, despite making up approximately 28% of the U.S. population. Furthermore, GAO noted that while the percentage of underrepresented minorities nationwide increased from 13% to 19% from 1994 to 2003, the total number of STEM doctorates awarded to the same group dropped during this period from 8,335 to 7,310. In response, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) created the Minority Opportunities in Research (MORE) Division and similar academic intervention programs. The MORE programs are comprised of four primary components: research experience, mentoring and advisement, supplemental instruction and workshops, and financial support. In 2007, NIGMS' annual budget was $1.9 billion, of which nearly $126 million was spent on its MORE programs. This amount includes the Minority Biomedical Research Support- Research Initiative for Scientific Enhancement (MBRS-RISE) program, the Minority Access to Research Careers (MARC), Post-baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP), and the Bridges to the Baccalaureate and Bridges to the PhD programs. The amount of funds dedicated to these programs reflects the commitment by the science and research community to the goals of the MORE Division in addressing this problem. Increased funding set forth in H.R. 6 will only strengthen NIH's focus on diversifying the biomedical workforce by requiring NIH to focus on ensuring participation from scientists from underrepresented communities. In addition to addressing the needs of underrepresented communities, H.R. 6 also calls for specific action to increase representation of racial minorities. The 21st Century Cures Act acknowledges that there are disturbing statistics on the low numbers of African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans pursuing academic qualification and participating in scientific research. Under H.R. 6, the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities will necessarily include strategies for increasing representation of minority communities in its strategic plan. I am proud to say that H.R. 6 includes the Jackson Lee Amendment, which makes a good bill even better by ensuring that the national goals of finding and bringing more cures and treatments to patients and strengthening the biomedical innovation ecosystem in the United States is aided by an expanding pool of diverse and talented medical researchers. Specifically, the Jackson Lee Amendment provides: The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall conduct outreach to historically Black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, Native American colleges, and rural colleges to ensure that health professionals from underrepresented populations are aware of research opportunities under this Act. Many racial health disparities stem from lack of access to effective test, treatments and cures for illnesses that have devastating consequences for African American, Hispanic and Native American populations. For example: 1. African-Americans represent 12% of the U.S. population but only 5% of clinical trial participants. 2. Hispanics make up 16% of the population but only 1% of clinical trial participants. 3. Women are under-represented in cardiovascular device trials, which have 67% male participation. The most significant barriers limiting clinical participation are race, age, and sex of participants: 1. Women and minority patients are more difficult to recruit. 2. Women and minority physicians have less experience and are relatively more costly to engage. 3. Minority patients with limited English proficiency can require costly translation services. Physicians are the gateway to the patient. Increasing diversity of those conducting research will have implications on the types of conditions that are researched and the participants in clinical trials that are seeking answers to illnesses like lupus, triple negative breast cancer, and sickle cell disease that can be difficult to detect, treat and cure. Certain medical illnesses have been known to have higher prevalence in certain demographic groups, including type II diabetes, lupus, sickle cell anemia, and Triple Negative Breast Cancer for which African Americans are more than twice as likely to be diagnosed on average. Lupus, triple negative breast cancer and sickle cell disease are of particular concern because they are often difficult to diagnose and disproportionately impact persons of color and especially women. In particular, Lupus is a chronic, complex and prevalent autoimmune disease that affects more than 1.5 million Americans. Yet, Lupus is one of America's least recognized major diseases. More than 90% of lupus sufferers are women, mostly young women between the ages of 15 to 44, and women of color are two to three times more at risk for lupus than Caucasians. Triple negative breast cancer also disproportionately impacts younger women, African American women, Hispanic/Latina women, and women with a ``BRCA 1 genetic mutation, which is prevalent in Jewish women. More than 30% of all breast cancer diagnoses in African American are of the triple negative variety, and African American women are far more susceptible to this dangerous subtype than white or Hispanic women. Additionally, there are about 2 million people that carry the sickle cell trait and with about 100,000 having the disease. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, sickle cell trait is common among African Americans and occurs in about 1 in 12, and sickle cell disease occurs in about 1 out of every 500 African- American births, compared to about 1 out of every 36,000 Hispanic- American births. Treatments for Lupus, triple negative breast cancer and sickle cell disease are not progressing as quickly as desired by patients, researchers, and policy makers. We must support the advancement of legislation that will allow for the remediation and end of health care disparities and the promotion of research parity for diseases such as lupus, triple negative breast cancer, sickle cell disease, and countless other rare and serious diseases. Race and ethnicity have also been shown to affect the effectiveness of and response to certain drugs, such as anti-hypertensive therapies in the treatment of hypertension in African Americans and anti- depressants in Hispanics. Increased diversity in research trials could help researchers find better, more precise ways to fight diseases that disproportionately impact certain populations, and may be important for the safe and effective use of new therapies. As one of the most diverse cities in the country, Houston is the 4th largest city in the United States and the 5th most populated metropolitan area in the nation. Houston is home to the largest medical complex in the world--the Texas Medical Center, which provides clinical health care, research and education at its 54 institutions. The University of Houston, ranked number three out of all other colleges and universities in Texas, is an example of a premier institution that can produce students with advanced STEM degrees who would be able to join a progressing biomedical field. Another important requirement of H.R. 6 is that it would require the National Institutes of Health to publically report the number of children by race and gender who participate in NIH funded clinical trials. This legislation would help ensure that children of all races are adequately represented in clinical trials and that we can determine the safety and effectiveness of drugs on children of all demographic backgrounds. With 10,000 known diseases, 7,000 of which are rare, and treatments for only 500 of them--clear there is much work to do. Medical research saves lives and improves the quality of life for millions of Americans because the government provides a steady and reliable commitment to basic research into cures for debilitating and deadly diseases. Given the array of commendable initiatives, H.R. 6 is a necessary piece of legislation that will accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of promising new treatments and cures for all patients while investing in our nation's ability to maintain the best and most diverse biomedical workforce in the world. Mr. Chair, I call for the support of all of my colleagues in ensuring the passage of the important legislation.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Thursday, July 9, 2015 The House in Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 6) to accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of 21st century cures, and for other purposes: Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 6, the 21st Century Cures Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation that is vital to the future and health of our Nation's citizens and ecosystem. This thoughtful legislation is the culmination of the hard work of my dedicated colleagues who have sought out and engaged in public conversations with patients, innovators, providers, regulators and researchers about how to move advances in science and medicine into new therapies. This outreach has garnered the critical input and support of more than 370 patient and physician groups, state and local organizations, cancer centers, and research and life sciences. I'm proud to be one of the cosponsors of H.R. 6, which represents a new national effort to find treatment and cures for thousands of unknown and rare diseases. Looking to the various policies this legislation aims to address, it is important to highlight the commendable objectives and that will not only accelerate the discovery, development and delivery of new treatments and cures for thousands of serious and rare diseases, but it will also open the doors of innovation and the growth of health care system by enhancing and enriching the medical field for all Americans. The most ambitious action calls for $10 billion in mandatory funding to be delivered over the next five years to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is part of our nation's top ranked educational research institutions in the world. In order to maintain our global competitiveness in the biomedical field, we must invest in the industries that guarantee economic prosperity for our current and future economies. It has been estimated that every $1 of NIH funding generates about $2.21 in local economic growth, and, in 2012, NIH funded research supported an estimated 402,000 jobs all across the U.S. The bill's funding for NIH would provide for an annual 3% increases in the NIH budget, which has been stagnant for the past few years and which desperately needs more funding to capitalize on emerging scientific insights. This increased funding not only aims to continue the sustainability of our economy but it also supports our President's initiative to provide more resources to the biomedical field. The 21st Century Cure Act supports the President's Precision Medicine Initiative, which would advance a new model of participant-centered research to accelerate biomedical discoveries and provide clinicians with new tools and therapies tailored to individual patients' needs. The Obama Administration believes they can build on their progress in improving the drug development and approval process by: incorporating patients' voices into the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) decision- making; encouraging the development and qualification of reliable biomarkers to accelerate work on important new therapies; and reducing barriers to initiating medical device trials. In furtherance of this initiative, H.R. 6 allows for the creation of an ``Innovation Fund'' through the National Institute of Health. [[Page E1048]] This ``Innovation Fund'' is a welcome effort because it promotes the maintenance of the best biomedical workforce in the world and help to increase the diversity of the biomedical workforce.

underrepresented minorities, despite making up approximately 28% of the u.s. population. furthermore, gao noted that while the percentage of underrepresented minorities nationwide increased from 13% to 19% from 1994 to 2003, the total number of stem doctorates awarded to the same group dropped during this period from 8,335 to 7,310. in response, the national institute of general medical sciences (nigms) created the minority opportunities in research (more) division and similar academic intervention programs. the more programs are comprised of four primary components: research experience, mentoring and advisement, supplemental instruction and workshops, and financial support. in 2007, nigms' annual budget was $1.9 billion, of which nearly $126 million was spent on its more programs. this amount includes the minority biomedical research support- research initiative for scientific enhancement (mbrs-rise) program, the minority access to research careers (marc), post-baccalaureate research education program (prep), and the bridges to the baccalaureate and bridges to the phd programs. the amount of funds dedicated to these programs reflects the commitment by the science and research community to the goals of the more division in addressing this problem. increased funding set forth in h.r. 6 will only strengthen nih's focus on diversifying the biomedical workforce by requiring nih to focus on ensuring participation from scientists from underrepresented communities. in addition to addressing the needs of underrepresented communities, h.r. 6 also calls for specific action to increase representation of racial minorities. the 21st century cures act acknowledges that there are disturbing statistics on the low numbers of african americans, hispanics and native americans pursuing academic qualification and participating in scientific research. under h.r. 6, the national institute on minority health and health disparities will necessarily include strategies for increasing representation of minority communities in its strategic plan. i am proud to say that h.r. 6 includes the jackson lee amendment, which makes a good bill even better by ensuring that the national goals of finding and bringing more cures and treatments to patients and strengthening the biomedical innovation ecosystem in the united states is aided by an expanding pool of diverse and talented medical researchers. specifically, the jackson lee amendment provides: the secretary of health and human services shall conduct outreach to historically black colleges and universities, hispanic-serving institutions, native american colleges, and rural colleges to ensure that health professionals from underrepresented populations are aware of research opportunities under this act. many racial health disparities stem from lack of access to effective test, treatments and cures for illnesses that have devastating consequences for african american, hispanic and native american populations. for example: 1. african-americans represent 12% of the u.s. population but only 5% of clinical trial participants. 2. hispanics make up 16% of the population but only 1% of clinical trial participants. 3. women are under-represented in cardiovascular device trials, which have 67% male participation. the most significant barriers limiting clinical participation are race, age, and sex of participants: 1. women and minority patients are more difficult to recruit. 2. women and minority physicians have less experience and are relatively more costly to engage. 3. minority patients with limited english proficiency can require costly translation services. physicians are the gateway to the patient. increasing diversity of those conducting research will have implications on the types of conditions that are researched and the participants in clinical trials that are seeking answers to illnesses like lupus, triple negative breast cancer, and sickle cell disease that can be difficult to detect, treat and cure. certain medical illnesses have been known to have higher prevalence in certain demographic groups, including type ii diabetes, lupus, sickle cell anemia, and triple negative breast cancer for which african americans are more than twice as likely to be diagnosed on average. lupus, triple negative breast cancer and sickle cell disease are of particular concern because they are often difficult to diagnose and disproportionately impact persons of color and especially women. in particular, lupus is a chronic, complex and prevalent autoimmune disease that affects more than 1.5 million americans. yet, lupus is one of america's least recognized major diseases. more than 90% of lupus sufferers are women, mostly young women between the ages of 15 to 44, and women of color are two to three times more at risk for lupus than caucasians. triple negative breast cancer also disproportionately impacts younger women, african american women, hispanic/latina women, and women with a ``brca 1 genetic mutation, which is prevalent in jewish women. more than 30% of all breast cancer diagnoses in african american are of the triple negative variety, and african american women are far more susceptible to this dangerous subtype than white or hispanic women. additionally, there are about 2 million people that carry the sickle cell trait and with about 100,000 having the disease. according to the centers for disease control and prevention, sickle cell trait is common among african americans and occurs in about 1 in 12, and sickle cell disease occurs in about 1 out of every 500 african- american births, compared to about 1 out of every 36,000 hispanic- american births. treatments for lupus, triple negative breast cancer and sickle cell disease are not progressing as quickly as desired by patients, researchers, and policy makers. we must support the advancement of legislation that will allow for the remediation and end of health care disparities and the promotion of research parity for diseases such as lupus, triple negative breast cancer, sickle cell disease, and countless other rare and serious diseases. race and ethnicity have also been shown to affect the effectiveness of and response to certain drugs, such as anti-hypertensive therapies in the treatment of hypertension in african americans and anti- depressants in hispanics. increased diversity in research trials could help researchers find better, more precise ways to fight diseases that disproportionately impact certain populations, and may be important for the safe and effective use of new therapies. as one of the most diverse cities in the country, houston is the 4th largest city in the united states and the 5th most populated metropolitan area in the nation. houston is home to the largest medical complex in the world--the texas medical center, which provides clinical health care, research and education at its 54 institutions. the university of houston, ranked number three out of all other colleges and universities in texas, is an example of a premier institution that can produce students with advanced stem degrees who would be able to join a progressing biomedical field. another important requirement of h.r. 6 is that it would require the national institutes of health to publically report the number of children by race and gender who participate in nih funded clinical trials. this legislation would help ensure that children of all races are adequately represented in clinical trials and that we can determine the safety and effectiveness of drugs on children of all demographic backgrounds. with 10,000 known diseases, 7,000 of which are rare, and treatments for only 500 of them--clear there is much work to do. medical research saves lives and improves the quality of life for millions of americans because the government provides a steady and reliable commitment to basic research into cures for debilitating and deadly diseases. given the array of commendable initiatives, h.r. 6 is a necessary piece of legislation that will accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of promising new treatments and cures for all patients while investing in our nation's ability to maintain the best and most diverse biomedical workforce in the world. mr. chair, i call for the support of all of my colleagues in ensuring the passage of the important legislation.

MARC A. VEASEY of texas in the house of representatives Monday, July 13, 2015 Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a dear friend, Kevin Sutherland, a young man whose always cheerful personality, gentle nature and caring spirit touched all of us who knew him. Kevin was taken from us much, much too soon this past July 4th. Kevin Sutherland was born and grew up in Trumbull, Connecticut, to Theresa and Douglas Sutherland. Kevin first caught the political bug when he joined his father collecting petition signatures door-to-door. The early political exposure proved to have a powerful effect on Kevin. He became involved in local Connecticut politics and quickly embraced the importance and value of personally engaging in public service. At just the age of 15, Kevin further honed his political skills by working in Congressman Jim Himes' 2008 and 2010 congressional campaigns in Bridgeport, Connecticut up until his graduation from Trumbull High School in 2009. Following his passion for political activism, Kevin attended American University in Washington, D.C., the epicenter of political action. At American University, Kevin was active in student government and served as Student Government Secretary for two years. In addition, Kevin discovered his passion and talent for communications and design. He applied his time and talents politically by serving as the Communications Director of the American University College Democrats and also served as the New Media Coordinator for the Kennedy Political Union. After graduating from American University in 2013, Kevin took his passion for politics and began working professionally with the Lone Star Project, a Democratic political research and communications organization. Kevin's hard work and talent for graphic design then led him to New Blue Interactive, where he could apply his political passion and experience to many Democratic candidates and causes. Kevin's love and gift for graphic design and photography filled his spare time as well. Kevin embraced living in Washington, D.C. by capturing the sights and sounds of our beautiful Capital city. When traveling to other places, Kevin would return with the essence of his travels captured visually. He graciously shared his work and, in doing so, not only showcased his talent but let us all share in the joy of his experience. It is a gift he gave without knowing and one that we will always cherish just as we cherish knowing this wonderful young man. In honor and remembrance of Kevin Sutherland, whose warm and kind heart touched many lives, I submit this statement. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1049] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING KEVIN SUTHERLAND ______ HON.

He became involved in local Connecticut politics and quickly embraced the importance and value of personally engaging in public service. At just the age of 15, Kevin further honed his political skills by working in Congressman Jim Himes' 2008 and 2010 congressional campaigns in Bridgeport, Connecticut up until his graduation from Trumbull High School in 2009.

DEVIN NUNES of california in the house of representatives Monday, July 13, 2015 Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Simon Lowes, of California's 11th District, upon the occasion of his retirement from Chevron. After graduating with a Bachelor's Degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Birmingham in England, Simon began his 48-year career at Chevron in 1967 working as a process engineer at the Richmond Chevron Refinery. After subsequently earning a Master's Degree in Finance at the University of Pennsylvania, Simon continued to build an impressive resume, holding over 15 challenging positions over the next four decades in Indonesia, Nigeria, the Ivory Coast, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Among Simon's most noted accomplishments was his leadership in developing Chevron's Angola Partnership Initiative. Following a 27-year civil war that ravaged Angola's economy, Simon helped to design a social investment initiative to rebuild local capacity and stimulate economic recovery. Due in large part to his efforts, in partnership with the U.S. Agency for International Development, Chevron's unprecedented $25 million commitment to this effort helped over 2 million people re-establish food security. Simon was also instrumental in launching the Chevron Aceh Recovery Initiative, which assisted victims of the 2004 tsunami in Indonesia. Through a series of micro-finance programs and the establishment of a polytechnic institute, this program provided job training and livelihoods to thousands of distressed Indonesians. In recent years, Simon has drawn on his extensive overseas experience to help lead Chevron's Corporate Social Responsibility strategy. As a result of this project and his many other endeavors, Simon's colleagues within Chevron and the development community have come to know him as a passionate innovator, a trusted and loyal mentor and, above all, an eternal optimist. Simon leaves Chevron with the respect, admiration and gratitude of those who have had the pleasure of working with him, and the knowledge that he has positively impacted not only Chevron, but thousands of people around the world. I would also like to recognize Simon's devoted wife, Shirley, and their three accomplished children, Aubrey, Chris and Ashley. Together, they built a family-focused life filled with new adventures, embracing each opportunity with curiosity and enthusiasm. We extend our appreciation for a job well done, and wish Simon a well-deserved retirement. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1050] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING SIMON LOWES ______ HON.

On Tuesday, July 14, Representatives of the U.S. Bowling Congress will be in the nation's capital to accept the STRIVE award as part of the National Youth Sports Week activities being hosted by the National Council of Youth Sports (NCYS) along with various fun sports related participation stations and youth sports participants. Each year the NCYS recognizes five finalist organizations that meet the ``kids first'' approach. Nominations are submitted by the public nationwide and each team is accessed [[Page E1051]] on how well they implement best practices and policies that protect kids and promote safety. The five finalist organizations are listed on the NCYS website for voting by the public. The STRIVE Award is then presented to organizations that exhibit heartfelt passion and dedication to helping kids succeed in sports, while maintaining a commitment to safety procedures. The STRIVE award recipient receives a $5,000 donation. Comprised of numerous representatives in the youth sports industry, NCYS was founded in 1979, and its membership represents more than 200 organizations/corporations serving 60,000,000 registered participants in organized youth sports programs. NCYS is the largest known organization in America representing the youth sports industry, and its members include organizations such as, the American Association of Cheerleading Coaches and Administrators (Cheer Safe), American Legion Baseball, American Youth Soccer Organization, Jewish Community Centers Association of North America, YMCA of America, Pop Warner, Special Olympics North America, and U.S. Tennis Association. International Bowling Campus Youth Development is a joint effort of the United States Bowling Congress (USBC) and Bowling Proprietors Association of America (BPAA). It is the largest organization serving youth bowling (145,000 youth bowlers last season) that supports a ladder-based development system designed for the growth of the athlete. Since the inception of the U.S. Bowling Congress' SMART program, more than $6 million scholarships have been awarded nationally to youth bowlers through organized league and tournament competition. They also collaborate with external amateur athletic organizations to protect the amateur status of student-athletes within bowling, as well as other sports. I commend the International Bowling Campus Youth Development and the U.S. Bowling Congress on this wonderful achievement and their work in Arlington and around the country, as well as the National Council of Youth Sports on the work it does as the go-to source for youth sports and safety programs. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1050-E1051] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING THE UNITED STATES BOWLING CONGRESS ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the recipients of the 2015 Prince William County Human Rights Commission Awards. The Prince William Board of County Supervisors (BOCS) implemented the Human Rights Ordinance January 15, 1993, formally establishing the Human Rights Commission. Two years prior, the BOCS formed the Human Rights Study Committee to explore the needs of a community that was growing in population and diversity. An exhaustive effort that included numerous committee meetings and public hearings identified a strong community desire for a human rights ordinance and an agency to enforce it. The Human Rights Ordinance prohibits discriminatory practices based on race, color, sex, national origin, religion, marital status, or disability, as well as in the consideration of employment, housing, public accommodations, education, and credit, in Prince William County. The BOCS approved the ordinance in September 1992 to ensure that ``each citizen is treated fairly, provided equal protection of the law, and equal opportunity to participate in the benefits, rights, and privileges of community life.'' Residents enlist the services of the commission if they feel their rights have been violated in the areas of employment, fair housing, credit, education and public accommodation. In celebration of Universal Human Rights Day, the Human Rights Commission recognizes individuals and organizations that promote the principles of human rights in Prince William County. It is my honor to submit the recipients of the 2015 Prince William County Human Rights Commission Awards: Eleana Boyer Albert Brooks Cynthia Brown Victoria Graham Luke Torian, 2nd Delegate Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in commending the recipients of the 2015 Prince William County Human Rights Commission Awards.

BILL ALTAFFER,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1051] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING MR. BILL ALTAFFER ______ HON. RAUL M. GRIJALVA of arizona in the house of representatives Monday, July 13, 2015 Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, the people of Tucson lost a tremendous presence in our community with the recent passing of Bill Altaffer. An attorney by trade and a humanitarian at heart, Bill was deeply committed to improving the quality of life in Arizona, across the country and around the world. After graduating with honors from Pitzer College and earning his law degree from the University of Arizona, he served as associate general counsel to three Indian nations, assisting their governments in the interpretation of their constitutions and the enactment of environmental protection legislation. Bill's affiliations speak volumes about his commitment to helping others. He was a member of the Muscular Dystrophy Association's (MDA) National Task Force Steering Committee, and a member and past chairman of the Southern Arizona Task Force on Public Awareness. In 1995, he received the MDA's National Personal Achievement Award, and in 2002, received the Tucson Human Relations Commission's Rabbi Albert T. Bilgray Make a Difference Award for his lifelong activism for human rights and social change based on the rule of law. Bill and his wife, Colette, led the groundbreaking effort to enact the Inclusive Home Design Ordinance in Pima County, Arizona. This visitability ordinance requires new single-family houses to meet minimum accessibility standards, thereby promoting the independence of people with disabilities. It remains the most progressive legislation of its type in the country today. It was through this visitability ordinance effort that I first came to know both Bill and Colette. I immediately admired their commitment to their cause, and equally as important, their commitment to each other. The love they shared for each other was an inspiration to anyone who met them. They truly were soul mates, meant to be partners in their lives and in their vision for helping others. Together they spent countless hours educating elected officials and their staffs, home builders, and community members alike about the incredibly positive impact that simple alterations to home designs can have for individuals with disabilities. Their efforts will benefit our community for decades to come. Bill and Colette guided the committee's efforts in creating and passing a visitability ordinance that propelled Pima County to the forefront of ensuring home accessibility for everyone. Their efforts helped many people remain in their homes, and access the homes of friends and family with little significant costs added to the price of a new home. Bill may be gone from our material world, but he will remain in the hearts and minds of anyone who was lucky enough to meet him. His life together with Colette is an inspiration to everyone sharing their lifelong commitment to fighting injustice. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1051] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING MR.

GERALD E. CONNOLLY of virginia in the house of representatives Monday, July 13, 2015 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 25th Pastoral Anniversary of Pastor Charles Arthur Lundy of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Woodbridge, Virginia. Pastor Lundy has had a distinguished pastoral career. His spiritual journey began at the young age of 13, when he was baptized at the Wayland Baptist Church in Baltimore, Maryland, under Reverend W.W. Payne. In February of 1981, Pastor Lundy received the distinction of becoming a deacon. Three years later, he was licensed by Star Bethlehem Missionary Baptist Church in Triangle, Virginia, under the tutelage of Reverend Doctor Frederick S. Jones. Pastor Lundy was ordained a Gospel Minister in August of 1987 and served as director of Christian Education for Star Bethlehem. On June 23, 1990, Pastor Lundy was called to preside over Ebenezer Baptist Church in Occoquan, Virginia. His first sermon was titled, ``Stay in the Ship'' and established ``putting the family back together'' as his pastoral focus. Since 1990, the congregation has grown from 120 to over 800, and the Church is known as a place of comfort and guidance. Dedicated to maintaining a welcoming place to worship, Pastor Lundy continues to lead worship services in the Church's Family Life Center while a new, larger sanctuary is being constructed. The Family Life Center was dedicated in 2000, and Pastor Lundy effectively supervised that project while simultaneously earning a Masters of Divinity from Samuel DeWitt Proctor School of Theology at Virginia Union University, graduating Magna Cum Laude. To accommodate the evolving needs of his congregation, Pastor Lundy maintains a commitment to education; on May 9, 2015, Pastor Lundy received his Doctorate of Ministry Degree. Pastor Lundy retired from the United States Marine Corps, after serving 26 years and rising to the rank of Major. Further showcasing his commitment to service, Pastor Lundy is a past-Parliamentarian for the Northern Virginia Baptist Association. He is the past-Chairman of the Nominating Committee and a former member of the Commission on Evangelism. He served as Assistant Secretary for the Northern Virginia Minister's Conference and as a former member of United Way for the National Capital Area. In 2009, Pastor Lundy was elected as President of the Samuel DeWitt Proctor School of Theology Alumni Association, and this year he received an Honorary Doctorate of Divinity Degree from Richmond Virginia Seminary. He is married to the former Jacquelyn Hinton McWhite. They are the proud parents of five daughters and two sons, and grandparents of nine grandsons and two granddaughters. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Pastor Charles Arthur Lundy on his 25 years of service to Ebenezer Baptist Church. Pastor Lundy remains devoted to the mission and vision of the Church and expanding the ministry's reach into the community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1052] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 25TH PASTORAL ANNIVERSARY OF PASTOR CHARLES ARTHUR LUNDY OF EBENEZER BAPTIST CHURCH IN WOODBRIDGE, VIRGINIA ______ HON.

For sixty years the Optimist Club of Greater Vienna has served its mission, ``to bring out the best in kids'' and lived up to the Optimist International motto by being the ``Friend of Youth'' in our community. This Club has served the youth of the Vienna community in numerous ways, including providing thousands of dollars in scholarships each year to local students through the Carol Waite Brennan Awards, the T.R. Cook Youth of Excellence Awards, the Communication Contest for Deaf and Hard of Hearing students; essay and other oratorical contests, and vocational scholarships. The Club raises tens of thousands of dollars each year in support of pediatric cancer patients and research through the Walk and Family Fun Day for Growing Hope. Recognizing that it is never too early to serve one's community, the Club promotes community service in elementary school students with the Helping Hands Awards. This emphasis on opportunities for youth to serve and lead continues with Octagon and Junior Optimist Clubs at local schools. The annual Charles A. Robinson Respect for Law Awards fosters positive relations between the community and local law enforcement. Annual Christmas tree sales and other fundraisers support youth athletic teams, as well as academic, science and arts clubs at area schools.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, July 13, 2015 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the significance of the Special Olympics which has established strong and lasting competitive bonds worldwide while simultaneously teaching the world that all people, regardless of their personal struggles, possess the same courage and profound joy in the face of athletic competition. The Special Olympics has dedicated itself to empowering individuals with intellectual disabilities to become physically fit, productive, and respected members of society through physical education and sport competition. The origins of this important institution began in the 1950's when Eunice Kennedy Shriver witnessed how children and young adults with intellectual disabilities were being treated by their communities, throughout our country with incredible disrespect. As her vision slowly came to reality, she began to hold special summer camps for young adults with disabilities in her own back-yard. Throughout the 1960's, Eunice Kennedy Shriver continued as the influential voice which assisted in shaping President John F. Kennedy's White House panel on people with intellectual disabilities. Through her unwavering support and avocation for our youth with intellectual disabilities to be no longer viewed as less than a full member of our society with nothing to provide, Eunice Kennedy Shriver created the first Special Olympics that were held on July 20, 1968 in Chicago, Illinois. At the first Special Olympics, thousands of participants with a variety of intellectual disabilities from 26 U.S. states and Canada competed in track and field, swimming and floor hockey. These young Americans came to prove they could compete despite their disability. It is one thing to overcome obstacles to compete in sports recreationally but it takes a genuine drive for excellence to succeed in an arena that was once thought impossible for those with intellectual disabilities. From that first Special Olympics competition in 1968, this organization began to gain the attention of the world as well as expand the sport competitions at the games. On February 5, 1977 the games marked the first International Special Olympics Winter Games, which was held in Steamboat Springs, Colorado. The Special Olympics continued to enhance the original mission of the organization through the creation of programs aimed at providing healthcare services to Special Olympics athletes worldwide. This organization attracted bipartisan support in 2004, when President George W. Bush signed the ``Special Olympics Sport and Empowerment Act.'' That piece of bipartisan legislation gave $15 million every year for five years to Special Olympics programs allowing them to continue their important work. In February of 2012 the National Basketball Association and Special Olympics, held the first annual NBA Cares Unified Sports Basketball game in Houston, Texas, which allowed Special Olympic athletes to compete alongside professional athletes. To think that a small summer day camp for intellectually challenged children and adults could evolve into a world-wide organization, is a testament to the lasting vision of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, its founder, and the commitment of volunteers, such as the 40,000 from Texas, to fulfill her dream.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the significance of the Special Olympics which has established strong and lasting competitive bonds worldwide while simultaneously teaching the world that all people, regardless of their personal struggles, possess the same courage and profound joy in the face of athletic competition. The Special Olympics has dedicated itself to empowering individuals with intellectual disabilities to become physically fit, productive, and respected members of society through physical education and sport competition. The origins of this important institution began in the 1950's when Eunice Kennedy Shriver witnessed how children and young adults with intellectual disabilities were being treated by their communities, throughout our country with incredible disrespect. As her vision slowly came to reality, she began to hold special summer camps for young adults with disabilities in her own back-yard. Throughout the 1960's, Eunice Kennedy Shriver continued as the influential voice which assisted in shaping President John F. Kennedy's White House panel on people with intellectual disabilities. Through her unwavering support and avocation for our youth with intellectual disabilities to be no longer viewed as less than a full member of our society with nothing to provide, Eunice Kennedy Shriver created the first Special Olympics that were held on July 20, 1968 in Chicago, Illinois.

TED POE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, July 13, 2015 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, we are quickly approaching the 100th anniversary of the United States' entrance into World War One; A war in which Texans played a critical role. From the fields of Flanders and trenches of France, to the towns of Germany and bases on the home front, 200,000 Texans proudly served in the Armed Forces during the First World War, between 1917 and 1919; They went to a land they had never been and died for people they did not know. 5,000 Texans gave their lives. Boys who grew up on farms in Texas suddenly became men as they found themselves in the muddy, rainy, and bloody trenches an ocean away. Life in the trenches was hard. Men were constantly bombarded with artillery and machine gun fire. And they often faced the danger of going over the trenches and crossing no man's land, trying to repel the enemy forces attempting the same. In the midst of battle and in the face of the enemy, some men displayed tremendous gallantry and were awarded medals for their actions. Four of the brave souls awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for their actions were from the great State of Texas. Daniel R. Edwards, born in Mooreville, Texas, was a Private First Class in the U.S. Army on July 18, 1918. His citation reads that [[Page E1054]] on that day near Soissons, France ``. . . he crawled alone into an enemy trench for the purpose of capturing or killing enemy soldiers . . . He killed 4 of the men and took the remaining 4 men prisoners.'' While taking them to the rear, an artillery shell shattered one of Edwards' legs. For his actions that day, Pfc. Edwards received the Medal of Honor. David E. Hayden was born in Florence, Texas. He served as a Hospital Apprentice First Class in the U.S. Navy serving with the Marines. On September 15th, 1918, near Thiaucourt, France his brave actions earned him the Medal of Honor. His citation reads, ``During the advance, when [his comrade in arms] was mortally wounded while crossing an open field swept by machinegun fire, Hayden unhesitatingly ran to his assistance and, finding him so severely wounded as to require immediate attention, disregarded his own personal safety to dress the wound under intense machinegun fire, and then carried the wounded man back to a place of safety.'' Samuel M. Sampler was born in Decatur, Texas. On October 8, 1918, near St. Etienne, France, the young U.S. Army Corporal became the third Texan in WWI to earn the Medal of Honor. When his company suffered severe casualties during an advance under machinegun fire, ``Cpl. Sampler detected the position of the enemy machineguns . . . Armed with German handgrenades, which he had picked up, he left the line and rushed forward in the face of heavy fire until he was near the hostile nest, where he grenaded the position. His third grenade landed among the enemy, killing 2, silencing the machineguns, and causing the surrender of 28 Germans, who he sent to the rear as prisoners. As a result of his act the company was immediately enabled to resume the advance.'' These three Texans who earned the Medal of Honor were among the ones who survived the war. A fourth Texan also earned the Medal of Honor during WWI, but gave his life during the actions for which he earned the medal posthumously. David B. Barkley, of Hispanic descent, was born in 1899 in Laredo, Texas. His father was in the U.S. Army and his mother was a Mexican- American native of South Texas. David enlisted in the Army before his 18th birthday. Not long after, he was sent to the frontlines in France. On November 9, 1918, Private Barkley's actions went above and beyond the call of duty. His Medal of Honor citation reads: ``When information was desired as to the enemy's position on the opposite side of the Meuse River, Pvt. Barkley, with another soldier, volunteered without hesitation and swam the river to reconnoiter the exact location. He succeeded in reaching the opposite bank, despite the evident determination of the enemy to prevent a crossing. Having obtained his information, he again entered the water for his return, but before his goal was reached, he was seized with cramps and drowned.'' David Barkley's body was not returned home until 1921. His body was laid in state at the Alamo, ``The Cradle of Texas Freedom,'' making him the second person to ever receive that honor, and then buried in San Antonio National Cemetery. His brave actions were acknowledged at home and abroad. He received medals from France and Italy; an elementary school in San Antonio was named in his honor; and, in 1941, Camp Barkley, a WWII Army installation, was named after him. In 1989, the Army recognized Private Barkley as the first Hispanic Medal of Honor recipient. Private Barkley, and the other Medal of Honor recipients from Texas, proudly served their state and country during the First World War, and they will forever be remembered for their brave actions. 100 years later we still remember the Texas boys of WWI, those that served and returned, those that served and returned with the wounds of war, and those that served and did not return. And that's just the way it is. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1053-E1054] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE TEXANS OF WWI ______ HON.

TED POE of texas in the house of representatives Monday, July 13, 2015 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, we are quickly approaching the 100th anniversary of the United States' entrance into World War One; A war in which Texans played a critical role. From the fields of Flanders and trenches of France, to the towns of Germany and bases on the home front, 200,000 Texans proudly served in the Armed Forces during the First World War, between 1917 and 1919; They went to a land they had never been and died for people they did not know. 5,000 Texans gave their lives. Boys who grew up on farms in Texas suddenly became men as they found themselves in the muddy, rainy, and bloody trenches an ocean away. Life in the trenches was hard. Men were constantly bombarded with artillery and machine gun fire. And they often faced the danger of going over the trenches and crossing no man's land, trying to repel the enemy forces attempting the same. In the midst of battle and in the face of the enemy, some men displayed tremendous gallantry and were awarded medals for their actions. Four of the brave souls awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for their actions were from the great State of Texas. Daniel R. Edwards, born in Mooreville, Texas, was a Private First Class in the U.S. Army on July 18, 1918. His citation reads that [[Page E1054]] on that day near Soissons, France ``. . . he crawled alone into an enemy trench for the purpose of capturing or killing enemy soldiers . . . He killed 4 of the men and took the remaining 4 men prisoners.'' While taking them to the rear, an artillery shell shattered one of Edwards' legs. For his actions that day, Pfc. Edwards received the Medal of Honor. David E. Hayden was born in Florence, Texas. He served as a Hospital Apprentice First Class in the U.S. Navy serving with the Marines. On September 15th, 1918, near Thiaucourt, France his brave actions earned him the Medal of Honor. His citation reads, ``During the advance, when [his comrade in arms] was mortally wounded while crossing an open field swept by machinegun fire, Hayden unhesitatingly ran to his assistance and, finding him so severely wounded as to require immediate attention, disregarded his own personal safety to dress the wound under intense machinegun fire, and then carried the wounded man back to a place of safety.'' Samuel M. Sampler was born in Decatur, Texas. On October 8, 1918, near St. Etienne, France, the young U.S. Army Corporal became the third Texan in WWI to earn the Medal of Honor. When his company suffered severe casualties during an advance under machinegun fire, ``Cpl. Sampler detected the position of the enemy machineguns . . . Armed with German handgrenades, which he had picked up, he left the line and rushed forward in the face of heavy fire until he was near the hostile nest, where he grenaded the position. His third grenade landed among the enemy, killing 2, silencing the machineguns, and causing the surrender of 28 Germans, who he sent to the rear as prisoners. As a result of his act the company was immediately enabled to resume the advance.'' These three Texans who earned the Medal of Honor were among the ones who survived the war. A fourth Texan also earned the Medal of Honor during WWI, but gave his life during the actions for which he earned the medal posthumously. David B. Barkley, of Hispanic descent, was born in 1899 in Laredo, Texas. His father was in the U.S. Army and his mother was a Mexican- American native of South Texas. David enlisted in the Army before his 18th birthday. Not long after, he was sent to the frontlines in France. On November 9, 1918, Private Barkley's actions went above and beyond the call of duty. His Medal of Honor citation reads: ``When information was desired as to the enemy's position on the opposite side of the Meuse River, Pvt. Barkley, with another soldier, volunteered without hesitation and swam the river to reconnoiter the exact location. He succeeded in reaching the opposite bank, despite the evident determination of the enemy to prevent a crossing. Having obtained his information, he again entered the water for his return, but before his goal was reached, he was seized with cramps and drowned.''

ALEAN ANDERTON BROCK ON THE OCCASION OF HER 66TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1055] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO MRS. ALEAN ANDERTON BROCK ON THE OCCASION OF HER 66TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION ______ HON. ALMA S. ADAMS of north carolina in the house of representatives Monday, July 13, 2015 Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to one of North Carolina's most deserving citizens, and a very special constituent, Mrs. Alean Anderton Brock. I applaud Mrs. Brock on several significant fronts, first and foremost as the dedicated and nurturing mother of Charlotte's own Olympian Boxer, Calvin Brock. Equally worthy of mentioning, Mr. Speaker, is Alean Brock's redefinition of courage which she exhibited throughout her battle as a two-time breast cancer survivor. During her former years, Alean attended Elizabeth City State University and was crowned their Homecoming Queens. Alean is compassionate and kind and imparts words of encouragement to everyone whom she meets; as a result, Alean has earned the ``most favorite'' person status among her family and friends who are spread across the United States. Mr. Speaker, all who love and admire Alean Brock for her courage, determination, steadfastness and compassion, thought it would be appropriate to honor and pay tribute on the occasion of her 66th birthday. Over the years, Mrs. Brock has exhibited unwavering courage, determination and has remained steadfast during her bouts with breast cancer. Those persons who are most familiar with Alean Brock will support the claim that cancer never had a fighting chance with her. Cancer was no match because Alean knew the rules of the boxing game; after all, it was her son, Calvin's childhood dream to become the heavyweight boxing champion of the world. The main characters in Calvin's adventurous dream were constant, grounded and made many sacrifices. Those characters included Alean Brock, Calvin's father, Calvance Brock who doubled as Calvin's coach throughout his boxing career, and his precious sister Alexis. Alean Brock fought the cancer like a champion and with all steadfastness continued to encourage Calvin to pursue his dream. Along the way, Calvin achieved the honor as National Golden Gloves Heavyweight Champion in 1998; and in 1999 with Alean standing tall, bruised by her cancer, but never defeated, Calvin won the U.S. Amateur Championship at 201 pounds. Alean, Calvance and Alexis cheered Calvin on to Sydney Australia where he participated as an U.S. Olympics Boxing Team Member during the 2000 Olympics. With strength and determination borrowed from his mom's playbook as she continued her battle with cancer, Calvin went forward to fight his first well-known opponent, Clifford Etienne, one of Mike Tyson's opponents whom Calvin defeated by round 3 TKO on January 21, 2005. Alean reached deep and found the zeal to cheer Calvin on to win the title of IBF World Title Challenger in 2006. Still continuing to throw knock out punches at her cancer, Alean dug down deep to find strength, but never wavered when she learned that Calvin would be forced into early retirement after suffering an injury that caused damage to the retinal in his right eye. Mr. Speaker, it is fitting that on July 18, 2015 family and friends will gather from all across the United States to pay tribute to Alean Brock, including her mother and father, Rebecca and Clinton Anderton, her daughter, Alexis Brock and the apples of her eye, her two grandchildren Jizelle and Brycen along with their parents Calvin and Yolanda Brock. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to rise and join me in paying tribute to Alean Anderton Brock, the picture of unwavering courage, determination and compassion that we all should strive to emulate. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1055] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO MRS.

CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH of new jersey in the house of representatives Monday, July 13, 2015 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to call attention today to the great work and humanitarian achievements accomplished by Patricia Apy, who recently received the American Bar Association's 2015 Grassroots Advocacy Award. A partner at Paras, Apy and Reiss, P.C. in Red Bank, New Jersey, Ms. Apy was selected for this extraordinary honor by the Board of Governors of the 400,000 member ABA--for her ``outstanding support of legal protection and assistance to members of the military.'' In announcing the award, the ABA noted that Ms. Apy is ``recognized as one of the nation's leading experts in family law'' who has [[Page E1056]] ``focused her career on the needs of military families, serving as a teacher, advocate, lecturer, consultant and commentator on the complexities of international family law.'' The ABA also cited the countless pro bono hours, Ms. Apy has dedicated on Capitol Hill and at the New Jersey state legislature. They highlighted her equally effective advocacy on behalf of victims of international parental child abduction. I first met Patricia Apy ``Tricia'' when she was serving as the lead American attorney for David Goldman, a New Jersey resident who fought five years for the return of his son Sean who was abducted by David's ex-wife to Brazil. Tricia delivered expert advice and counsel in David's long, arduous, but ultimately successful case. As the chairman of the subcommittee that oversees human rights, I authored legislation to help bring an end to David and Sean's nightmare and I held--and continue to hold--Congressional hearings to ensure that other Americans are spared this pain. Tricia Apy has provided comprehensive, world-class testimony and analysis on the myriad of problems left behind parents face.

At the ABA award ceremony in her honor--hosted at the U.S. Supreme Court--Patricia Apy paid special tribute to the inspiration she draws from her parents, Joseph and Gloria McHale. Having served our Nation valiantly, decorated WW II hero Joseph McHale died at a young age in a VA hospital leaving Gloria to raise three children including Tricia who was only nine at the time.

Nearly 20 years ago this was the theme of the American Bar Association annual meeting. At the time, we were accused of hyperbole, I don't believe that anyone would accuse us of hyperbole today. I am a member of an association of 400,000 professional advocates, to be distinguished in that number is a remarkable honor, and I am humbled by this recognition. I wish to express my appreciation to the Governmental Affairs Office and the Board of Governors of the ABA. I believe that real advocacy, is evidence of what inspires you, the experiences you share and the opportunities you have had. I am a person of faith, and my faith informs me that nothing happens to us by accident. Which is why I should not have been surprised to find myself the newest liaison to the Standing Committee on Legal Assistance for Military Personnel for exactly one month on September 11, 2001. On that day, I went (as my brother Michael has coined it) from being a ``mere lawyer'' to a ``protector of heroes''. I like that moniker, understanding that it is one I can only aspire to. I am so proud of the work that has been accomplished by the LAMP committee during my tenure on it, and by my colleagues, many of whom are in this room who have shared that laboring oar. The LAMP committee is chaired by General Officers, they are all spectacular lawyers and American heroes. But the three men with whom I worked most closely, the incomparable Gen Earl Anderson, Brig Gen David Hague and my own ``true north'' Rear Adm. John Jenkins, former T-Jag of the Navy, taught me so much more than how to be a great advocate. They taught me about duty and honor, in doing so. My opportunities for public advocacy, whether on behalf of the United States at the Hague, or consulting with or for our warfighters at the Pentagon, or on behalf of disenfranchised and marginalized women at the UN and the White House, or with my hand in the air testifying before the Congress have in large measure been opportunities afforded me because of my affiliation with the ABA. The people with whom I have worked, whether in the military, diplomacy or governance have typically devoted their personal and professional lives to the service of their country, usually in anonymity. I don't know why anyone would do so in this age of cynicism and partisanship. But they do, and we should all be proud and deeply grateful for the continued commitment to justice that ABA has afforded. On the wall of my home hangs the Silver Star, and two Bronze Stars, the second with Oak leaf cluster in lieu of a third Bronze Star. My father died in a VA hospital when I was nine years old. I was raised and educated by the heroic efforts my mother, Gloria McHale, in extraordinarily modest means. It is not lost on me, how very improbable it is to be standing here in the Supreme Court of the United States, as the child of a deceased war veteran. I thank my husband David Apy, my family, my law partners and longtime paralegal, and many colleagues and friends in accepting this national recognition. My experience, my inspiration and my faith serve as the motivation for my advocacy. I have closed each and every one of the over one thousand hours of continuing legal education that I have conducted with and for our military lawyers exactly the same way, never wanting any of them to go into harm's way without knowing for certain and for sure, that on behalf of my family we know that we sleep in peace at night only, due to their service and sacrifice. For that, and for this honor . . . I remain profoundly grateful. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 108 (Monday, July 13, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1055-E1056] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PATRICIA APY: AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION'S 2015 GRASSROOTS ADVOCACY AWARD WINNER ______ HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH of new jersey in the house of representatives Monday, July 13, 2015 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to call attention today to the great work and humanitarian achievements accomplished by Patricia Apy, who recently received the American Bar Association's 2015 Grassroots Advocacy Award. A partner at Paras, Apy and Reiss, P.C. in Red Bank, New Jersey, Ms. Apy was selected for this extraordinary honor by the Board of Governors of the 400,000 member ABA--for her ``outstanding support of legal protection and assistance to members of the military.'' In announcing the award, the ABA noted that Ms. Apy is ``recognized as one of the nation's leading experts in family law'' who has [[Page E1056]] ``focused her career on the needs of military families, serving as a teacher, advocate, lecturer, consultant and commentator on the complexities of international family law.'' The ABA also cited the countless pro bono hours, Ms. Apy has dedicated on Capitol Hill and at the New Jersey state legislature. They highlighted her equally effective advocacy on behalf of victims of international parental child abduction. I first met Patricia Apy ``Tricia'' when she was serving as the lead American attorney for David Goldman, a New Jersey resident who fought five years for the return of his son Sean who was abducted by David's ex-wife to Brazil. Tricia delivered expert advice and counsel in David's long, arduous, but ultimately successful case. As the chairman of the subcommittee that oversees human rights, I authored legislation to help bring an end to David and Sean's nightmare and I held--and continue to hold--Congressional hearings to ensure that other Americans are spared this pain. Tricia Apy has provided comprehensive, world-class testimony and analysis on the myriad of problems left behind parents face. Her insights were key as we drafted, the Sean and David Goldman International Child Abduction and Prevention and Return Act (The Goldman Act--PL 113-150), my law to help prevent international parental child abduction and secure the return of those children who have been abducted and remain separated from their left behind parent.

Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 5, the so- called Student Success Act, which should really be called the Letting Our Students Down Act. Instead of making much needed improvements to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), H.R. 5 would weaken critical federal protections for our most vulnerable--including students of color, students with disabilities, low-income students, English-language learners (ELL), migrant students and LGBT students. It would gut our nation's education funding by foolishly locking in Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 funding levels for the next 6 years--with no exceptions to adjust for inflation. H.R. 5 would also divert critical Title I funds away from the highest poverty schools and districts--undermining our nation's commitment to ensuring that all students--regardless of their zip code or where they were born--should have equal access to high-quality education. This is outrageous and it is wrong. Simply put, H.R. 5 undermines our promise to students that they will have equal access to high-quality education. So let's defeat this egregious bill and work to reauthorize ESEA that will reinvest in our future, help close the achievement gap, and prepare our students for a 21st Century workforce.
