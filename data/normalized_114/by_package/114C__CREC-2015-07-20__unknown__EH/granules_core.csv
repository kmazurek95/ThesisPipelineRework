GARRET GRAVES of louisiana in the house of representatives Tuesday, July 14, 2015 Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, breast cancer is the most common cancer among American women, except for skin cancers. In fact, current statistics show that about 1 in 8 women in the United States will develop invasive breast cancer during their lifetime. It is estimated that in the United States 231,840 women will be diagnosed with and 40,290 women will die of cancer of the breast in 2015. This means that every 13 minutes a woman dies of breast cancer in the United States. Due to early detection, increased awareness and improved approaches to treatment, death rates from breast cancer have decreased since 1989, but it is still the second leading cause of death in women. It is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among nearly every racial and ethnic group, including African American, American Indian, Alaska native, Asian/Pacific Islander and Hispanic/Latina women. African-American women have the highest death rates of all racial and ethnic groups overall and are at least 44 percent more likely to die of breast cancer as compared to other racial and ethnic groups. This is largely due to disease type and lack of adequate care. Approximately $16.5 billion is spent on breast cancer treatment in the United States according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The NCI also estimates that the cost of breast cancer treatment will continue to rise if current trends hold steady. Finding a cure for breast cancer is in the best interest of the American public and is a goal of the United States government. While combined funding for breast cancer research through the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense's Breast Cancer Research Program and the National Cancer Institute approaches one billion dollars, additional private sector support for breast cancer research will help us find a cure even faster. H.R. 2722, the Breast Cancer Awareness Commemorative Coin Act is designed to generate additional funding for breast cancer research at no cost to taxpayers. The bill compels the U.S. Treasury to raise money for breast cancer research through the sale of $5 pink gold coins, and $1 silver commemorative coins in 2018. The additional funding for breast cancer research will aid the efforts currently underway to find a cure for this deadly cancer. This week, it was brought to the attention of this body that the largest non-government funder of breast cancer research and initially selected as one of the recipients of breast cancer research funding pursuant to H.R. 2722, issues grants to Planned Parenthood. This development gave me pause and conflicted with my well-established pro- life convictions. While I commend work on breast cancer research, I am against any direct or indirect federal funding for abortion. I was pleased that we were able to resolve the issue by amending the recipient of funds generated pursuant to the Breast Cancer Awareness Commemorative Coin Act, H.R. 2722 and designating 100% of the funds to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. I supported the amended version of H.R. 2722 and was proud to see this legislation pass through the House. I encourage my colleagues in the Senate take up this bill so that we can move forward with the good and necessary work of pursuing a cure for the most common cancer in women worldwide. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 113 (Monday, July 20, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1083] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BREAST CANCER AWARENESS COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT ______ speech of HON.

I encourage my colleagues in the Senate take up this bill so that we can move forward with the good and necessary work of pursuing a cure for the most common cancer in women worldwide. ____________________",package_114_227.csv,3673,3673,3740,"[congressional record volume 161, number 113 (monday, july 20, 2015)] [extensions of remarks] [page e1083] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] breast cancer awareness commemorative coin act ______ speech of hon. garret graves of louisiana in the house of representatives tuesday, july 14, 2015 mr. graves of louisiana. mr. speaker, breast cancer is the most common cancer among american women, except for skin cancers. in fact, current statistics show that about 1 in 8 women in the united states will develop invasive breast cancer during their lifetime. it is estimated that in the united states 231,840 women will be diagnosed with and 40,290 women will die of cancer of the breast in 2015. this means that every 13 minutes a woman dies of breast cancer in the united states. due to early detection, increased awareness and improved approaches to treatment, death rates from breast cancer have decreased since 1989, but it is still the second leading cause of death in women. it is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among nearly every racial and ethnic group, including african american, american indian, alaska native, asian/pacific islander and hispanic/latina women. african-american women have the highest death rates of all racial and ethnic groups overall and are at least 44 percent more likely to die of breast cancer as compared to other racial and ethnic groups. this is largely due to disease type and lack of adequate care. approximately $16.5 billion is spent on breast cancer treatment in the united states according to the national cancer institute (nci). the nci also estimates that the cost of breast cancer treatment will continue to rise if current trends hold steady. finding a cure for breast cancer is in the best interest of the american public and is a goal of the united states government. while combined funding for breast cancer research through the national institutes of health, the department of defense's breast cancer research program and the national cancer institute approaches one billion dollars, additional private sector support for breast cancer research will help us find a cure even faster. h.r. 2722, the breast cancer awareness commemorative coin act is designed to generate additional funding for breast cancer research at no cost to taxpayers. the bill compels the u.s. treasury to raise money for breast cancer research through the sale of $5 pink gold coins, and $1 silver commemorative coins in 2018. the additional funding for breast cancer research will aid the efforts currently underway to find a cure for this deadly cancer. this week, it was brought to the attention of this body that the largest non-government funder of breast cancer research and initially selected as one of the recipients of breast cancer research funding pursuant to h.r. 2722, issues grants to planned parenthood. this development gave me pause and conflicted with my well-established pro- life convictions. while i commend work on breast cancer research, i am against any direct or indirect federal funding for abortion. i was pleased that we were able to resolve the issue by amending the recipient of funds generated pursuant to the breast cancer awareness commemorative coin act, h.r. 2722 and designating 100% of the funds to the breast cancer research foundation. i supported the amended version of h.r. 2722 and was proud to see this legislation pass through the house. i encourage my colleagues in the senate take up this bill so that we can move forward with the good and necessary work of pursuing a cure for the most common cancer in women worldwide. ____________________",3673

CREC-2015-07-20-pt1-PgE1083-5,CREC-2015-07-20,114,IN RECOGNITION OF THE 54TH MASSACHUSETTS VOLUNTEER INFANTRY REGIMENT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 113 (Monday, July 20, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1083-E1084] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE 54TH MASSACHUSETTS VOLUNTEER INFANTRY REGIMENT ______ HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING of massachusetts in the house of representatives Monday, July 20, 2015 Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Established in 1863 as one of the first military units comprised of entirely African American soldiers to fight in the Civil War for the Union, the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment will further be memorialized with the unveiling of a historic mural in New Bedford, Massachusetts. While the declaration of the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863 provided an avenue for free black men to serve as soldiers, it remained the responsibility of state governors to raise regiments for federal service. Massachusetts Governor John A. Andrews became the first governor in the nation to authorize an all-African American voluntary infantry regiment. In three months' time, the regiment had grown to consist of over 1,000 enlisted volunteers from across the Commonwealth, united under the command of Robert Gould Shaw, a white officer. Included among the regiment's enlistees were none other than Charles and Lewis Douglass--two sons of the well-known writer and abolitionist, Frederick Douglass, as well as the first African American Congressional Medal of Honor recipient and one of New Bedford's most famous sons, Sergeant William H. Carney. It was not long after its formation that the 54th Massachusetts Regiment earned the fighting recognition it had anticipated. Following a joyous parade and honorary celebration in the streets of Boston in May 1863, the regiment headed south to the hostile coast of South Carolina. By July 18, 1863, after several days of fighting on little sleep, food or water, the regiment prepared for an assault on Fort Wagner, which protected the Port of Charleston. Tragically, due to a fatal miscalculation of the number of Confederate troops, the 54th Massachusetts Regiment saw over 280 of its men killed, wounded, or captured during the siege on Fort Wagner, including Colonel Shaw. However, not all was lost. It was during this battle that the severely wounded Sergeant William H. Carney saved the regiment's flag [[Page E1084]] from being captured by Confederate troops. Upon his return to his regiment, he famously shouted, ``The Old Flag never touched the ground!'' For these heroic actions, Sergeant Carney became the first African American soldier awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. The courage, bravery, and dedication demonstrated by the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment over 150 years ago lives on in the pride of our community. Now, thanks to the partnership of the New Bedford Historical Society, University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, Artworks, and the New Bedford National Historical Park, residents of and visitors to the City of New Bedford will further celebrate the memory of Sergeant Carney and the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment with a mural depicting the gallant men of the Regiment in the exact spot where local New Bedford volunteers enlisted throughout the Civil War. Mr. Speaker, it brings me great pleasure to recognize the unveiling of this historic mural and to call attention yet again to the bravery and dedication of the men who served in the 54th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 113 (Monday, July 20, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1083-E1084] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE 54TH MASSACHUSETTS VOLUNTEER INFANTRY REGIMENT ______ HON.

Their bravery has never been more apparent than on the morning of September 11th, 2001 when 343 members of the FDNY sacrificed their lives as they rushed into the World Trade Center.

CREC-2015-07-20-pt1-PgE1084,CREC-2015-07-20,114,MAJOR THREATS TO RULE OF LAW IN RUSSIA,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 113 (Monday, July 20, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1084] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MAJOR THREATS TO RULE OF LAW IN RUSSIA ______ HON. MARCY KAPTUR of ohio in the house of representatives Monday, July 20, 2015 Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss an issue of critical importance--the U.S. relationship with Russia. The U.S. has a complicated bilateral relationship with Russia, which includes a number of vital global issues including ISIL, Syria, Iran's nuclear ambitions and peace in the Ukraine, among others. However, a central aspect in the relationship that must guide all of the issues is the rule of law-- and Russia has shown little respect for this essential principle. As a Member of Congress of Polish descent and who is the co-chair and leader of a number of country caucuses in the Congress, I am well aware of Russia's sometimes unacceptable behavior on the world stage. An important but not widely known rule of law issue, is the $50 billion arbitration brought against Russia by GML on behalf of the shareholders of Yukos Oil, whose company was illegally seized over a decade ago. In July of 2014, a tribunal in The Hague ruled that Russia violated the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT), and awarded Yukos a $50 billion arbitration award. Since last summer, Russia has appealed the ruling, asking that it be set aside and dismissed by the Dutch Courts, a review process that could continue for 10 years. In the decision, an independent arbitral tribunal sitting in The Hague ruled unanimously that the actions of the Russian Federation were politically motivated and constituted expropriation of the majority shareholders' investment in Yukos. The roots of the ECT date back to political initiatives in Europe following the end of the Cold War. The fundamental aim of the ECT is to strengthen the rule of law on energy issues by creating a level playing field of rules to be observed by all governments who are signatories to the Treaty. Mr. Speaker, Russia needs to do much better in respecting rule of law, international institutions and global treaties. The GML case is a bellwether for Russia's behavior, intentions and future actions. It will help demonstrate if Russia will truly be accountable under rule of law and serve as a constructive partner in the global community. I urge my colleagues to learn more by reading the November 15, 2014 article in The Economist entitled, ``The Yukos affair: The chase is on.'' It is a case the U.S. Administration and Congress should follow closely to strongly support and urge adherence to the rule of law. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 113 (Monday, July 20, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1084] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MAJOR THREATS TO RULE OF LAW IN RUSSIA ______ HON.

KIMENYI, SENIOR FELLOW AND FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE AFRICAN GROWTH INITIATIVE AT THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION ______ HON. KAREN BASS of california in the house of representatives Monday, July 20, 2015 Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the late Professor Mwangi S. Kimenyi, senior fellow and former director of the Africa Growth Initiative at the Brookings Institution, who passed away on June 6, 2015. I had the honor of working with Professor Kimenyi over the last several years. I drew on his expertise for one of the ``Africa Policy Breakfasts'' I hosted earlier this year that drew hundreds of people. You just needed to listen to Professor Kimenyi speak for a few minutes to understand that he was one of the foremost scholars and experts in the relationship between the United States and the nations of the African continent. His breadth of knowledge stretched from institutions of higher education as well as the non-profit sector. He drew on his ability to teach from his years of experience as a former professor at the University of Mississippi and the University of Connecticut. He was the founding executive director of the Kenya Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis, a resource person with the African Economic Research Consortium, and a research associate with the Center for the Study of African Economies, University of Oxford. He was rightly recognized for his years of work when he received the Outstanding Research Award from the Global Development Network in 2001 and the Georgescu-Roegen Prize in Economics in 1991. In 1994, Professor Kimenyi was also named by Policy Review among the top 10 young market economists in the United States. The House of Representatives voted to give final Congressional passage to the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Renewing AGOA was only possible because of the work of Professor Kimenyi and the hundreds of Africans like him who committed themselves to ensuring that the United States and the nations on the African continent became true partners that work together to benefit our respective people and economies. I join with so many in sending my condolences to Professor Kimenyi's family, friends, colleagues and everyone who benefited from his years of work and his commitment to the relationship between the United States and the countries on the African continent. Although he has left us, his work will benefit people for generations to come.","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 113 (Monday, July 20, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1084] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO PROFESSOR MWANGI S.
