(Applause, the Members rising.) The SPEAKER. Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you Pope Francis of the Holy See. (Applause, the Members rising.) POPE FRANCIS. Mr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, Honorable Members of Congress, dear friends, I am most grateful for your invitation to address this joint session of Congress in ``the land of the free and the home of the brave.'' I would like to think that the reason for this is that I, too, am a son of this great continent from which we have all received so much and toward which we share a common responsibility. Each son or daughter of a given country has a mission, a personal and social responsibility. Your own responsibility as Members of Congress is to enable this country, by your legislative activity, to grow as a nation. You are the face of its people, their representatives. You are called to defend and preserve the dignity of your fellow citizens in the tireless and demanding pursuit of the common good, for this is the chief aim of all politics. A political society endures when it seeks, as a vocation, to satisfy common needs by stimulating the growth of all its members, especially those in situations of greater vulnerability or risk. Legislative activity is always based on care for the people. To this you have been invited, called, and convened by those who elected you. Yours is a work which makes me reflect in two ways on the figure of Moses. On the one hand, the patriarch and lawgiver of the people of Israel symbolizes the need of peoples to keep alive their sense of unity by means of just legislation. On the other, the figure of Moses leads us directly to God and thus to the transcendent dignity of the human being. Moses provides us with a good synthesis of your work: you are asked to protect, by means of the law, the image and likeness fashioned by God on every human life. Today I would like not only to address you, but, through you, the entire people of the United States. Here, together with their representatives, I would like to take this opportunity to dialogue with the many thousands of men and women who strive each day to do an honest day's work, to bring home their daily bread, to save money, and--one step at a time--to build a better life for their families. These are men and women who are not concerned simply with paying their taxes but, in their own quiet way, sustain the life of society. They generate solidarity by their actions, and they create organizations which offer a helping hand to those most in need. I would also like to enter into a dialogue with the many elderly persons who are a storehouse of wisdom forged by experience and who seek in many ways, especially through volunteer work, to share their stories and their insights. I know that many of them are retired but still active; they keep working to build up this land. I also want to dialogue with all those young people who are working to realize their great and noble aspirations, who are not led astray by facile proposals, and who face difficult situations, often as a result of immaturity on the part of many adults. I wish to dialogue with all of you, and I would like to do so through the historical memory of your people. My visit takes place at a time when men and women of goodwill are marking the anniversaries of several great Americans. The complexities of history and the reality of human weakness notwithstanding, these men and women, for all their many differences and limitations, were able by hard work and self-sacrifice--some at the cost of their lives--to build a better future. They shaped fundamental values which will endure forever in the spirit of the American people. A people with this spirit can live through many crises, tensions, and conflicts while always finding the resources to move forward and to do so with dignity. These men and women offer us a way of seeing and interpreting reality. In honoring their memory, we are inspired, even amid conflicts and in the here and now of each day, to draw upon our deepest cultural reserves. I would like to mention four of these Americans: Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King, Dorothy Day, and Thomas Merton. This year marks the 150th anniversary of the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, the guardian of liberty, who labored tirelessly that ``this Nation, under God, might have a new birth of freedom.'' Building a future of freedom requires love of the common good and cooperation in a spirit of subsidiarity and solidarity. All of us are quite aware of and deeply worried by the disturbing social and political situation of the world today. Our world is increasingly a place of violent conflict, hatred, and brutal atrocities committed even in the name of God and of religion. We know that no religion is immune from forms of individual delusion or ideological extremism. This means that we must be especially attentive to every type of fundamentalism, whether religious or of any other kind. A delicate balance is required to combat violence perpetrated in the name of a religion, an ideology, or an economic system, while also safeguarding religious freedom, intellectual freedom, and individual freedoms. But there is another temptation which we must especially guard against: the simplistic reductionism which sees only good or evil; or, if you will, the righteous and sinners. The contemporary world, with its open wounds which affect so many of our brothers and sisters, demands that we confront every form of polarization which would divide it into these two camps. We know that, in the attempt to be freed of the enemy without, we can be tempted to feed the enemy within. To [[Page H6193]] imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place. That is something which you, as a people, reject. Our response must, instead, be one of hope and healing, of peace and justice. We are asked to summon the courage and the intelligence to resolve today's many geopolitical and economic crises. Even in the developed world, the effects of unjust structures and actions are all too apparent. Our efforts must aim at restoring hope, righting wrongs, maintaining commitments, and thus promoting the well-being of individuals and of peoples. We must move forward together, as one, in a renewed spirit of fraternity and solidarity, cooperating generously for the common good. The challenges facing us today call for a renewal of that spirit of cooperation, which has accomplished so much good throughout the history of the United States. The complexity, the gravity, and the urgency of these challenges demand that we pool our resources and talents and resolve to support one another with respect for our differences and our convictions of conscience. In this land, the various religious denominations have greatly contributed to building and strengthening society. It is important that today, as in the past, the voice of faith continue to be heard, for it is a voice of fraternity and love, which tries to bring out the best in each person and in each society. Such cooperation is a powerful resource in the battle to eliminate new global forms of slavery, born of grave injustices which can be overcome only through new policies and new forms of social consensus. Politics is, instead, an expression of our compelling need to live as one, in order to build as one the greatest common good: that of a community which sacrifices particular interests in order to share, in justice and peace, its goods, its interests, its social life. I do not underestimate the difficulty that this involves, but I encourage you in this effort. Here, too, I think of the march which Martin Luther King led from Selma to Montgomery 50 years ago as part of the campaign to fulfill his ``dream'' of full civil and political rights for African Americans. That dream continues to inspire us all. I am happy that America continues to be, for many, a land of dreams: dreams which lead to action, to participation, to commitment; dreams which awaken what is deepest and truest in the life of the people. In recent centuries, millions of people came to this land to pursue their dream of building a future in freedom. We, the people of this continent, are not fearful of foreigners because most of us were once foreigners. I say this to you as the son of immigrants, knowing that so many of you are also descendants of immigrants. Tragically, the rights of those who were here long before us were not always respected. For those peoples and their nations, from the heart of American democracy, I wish to reaffirm my highest esteem and appreciation. Those first contacts were often turbulent and violent, but we know that it is very difficult to judge the past by the criteria of the present. Nonetheless, when the stranger in our midst appeals to us, we must not repeat the sins and the errors of the past. We must resolve now to live as nobly and as justly as possible, as we educate new generations not to turn their back on our neighbors and everything around us. Building a nation calls us to recognize that we must constantly relate to others, rejecting a mindset of hostility in order to adopt one of reciprocal subsidiarity, in a constant effort to do our best. I am confident that we can do this. Our world is facing a refugee crisis of a magnitude not seen since the Second World War. This presents us with great challenges and many hard decisions. On this continent, too, thousands of persons are led to travel north in search of a better life for themselves and for their loved ones, in search of greater opportunities. Is this not what we want for our own children? We must not be taken aback by their numbers, but rather view them as persons, seeing their faces and listening to their stories, trying to respond as best we can to their situation, to respond in a way which is always humane, just, and fraternal. We need to avoid a common temptation nowadays: to discard whatever proves troublesome. Let us remember the Golden Rule: ``Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.'' This rule points us in a clear direction. Let us treat others with the same passion and compassion with which we want to be treated. Let us seek for others the same possibilities which we seek for ourselves. Let us help others to grow, as we would like to be helped ourselves. In a word, if we want security, let us give security. If we want life, let us give life. If we want opportunities, let us provide opportunities. The yardstick we use for others will be the yardstick which time will use for us. The Golden Rule also reminds us of our responsibility to protect and defend human life at every stage of its development. This conviction has led me, from the beginning of my ministry, to advocate at different levels for the global abolition of the death penalty. I am convinced that this way is the best, since every life is sacred, every human person is endowed with an inalienable dignity, and society can only benefit from the rehabilitation of those convicted of crimes. Recently, my brother bishops here in the United States renewed their call for the abolition of the death penalty. Not only do I support them, but I also offer encouragement to all those who are convinced that a just and necessary punishment must never exclude the dimension of hope and the goal of rehabilitation. In these times when social concerns are so important, I cannot fail to mention the servant of God, Dorothy Day, who founded the Catholic Worker Movement. Her social activism, her passion for justice and for the cause of the oppressed were inspired by the Gospel, her faith, and the example of the saints. How much progress has been made in this area in so many parts of the world. How much has been done in these first years of the third millennium to raise people out of extreme poverty. I know that you share my conviction that much more still needs to be done, and in times of crisis and economic hardship, a spirit of global solidarity must not be lost. At the same time, I would encourage you to keep in mind all those people around us who are trapped in a cycle of poverty. They too need to be given hope. The fight against poverty and hunger must be fought constantly and on many fronts, especially in its causes. I know that many Americans today, as in the past, are working to deal with this problem. It goes without saying that part of this great effort is the creation and distribution of wealth. The right use of natural resources, the proper application of technology, and the harnessing of the spirit of enterprise are essential elements of an economy which seeks to be modern, inclusive, and sustainable. ``Business is a noble vocation, directed to producing wealth and improving the world. It can be a fruitful source of prosperity for the area in which it operates, especially if it sees the creation of jobs as an essential part of its service to the common good.'' This common good also includes the Earth, a central theme of the encyclical which I recently wrote in order to ``enter into dialogue with all people about our common home.'' ``We need a conversation which includes everyone, since the environmental challenge we are undergoing, and its human roots, concern and affect us all.'' In Laudato Si', I call for a courageous and responsible effort to ``redirect our steps'' and to avert the most serious effects of the environmental deterioration caused by human activity. I am convinced that we can make a difference. I am sure and I have no doubt that the United States and this Congress have an important role to play. Now is the time for courageous actions and strategies aimed at implementing a ``culture of care'' and ``an integrated approach to combating poverty, restoring dignity to the excluded, and at the same time protecting nature.'' ``We have the freedom needed to limit and direct technology, to devise intelligent ways of . . . developing and limiting our power,'' and to put technology ``at the service of another type of progress, one which is healthier, more human, more social, more integral.'' In this regard, I am confident [[Page H6194]] that America's outstanding academic and research institutions can make a vital contribution in the years ahead. A century ago, at the beginning of the Great War, which Pope Benedict XV termed a ``pointless slaughter,'' another notable American was born: the Cistercian monk Thomas Merton. He remains a source of spiritual inspiration and a guide for many people. In his autobiography, Merton wrote: ``I came into the world. Free by nature, in the image of God, I was nevertheless the prisoner of my own violence and my own selfishness, in the image of the world into which I was born. That world was the picture of Hell, full of men like myself, loving God, and yet hating him; born to love him, living instead in fear of hopeless self-contradictory hungers.'' Merton was, above all, a man of prayer, a thinker who challenged the certitudes of his time and opened new horizons for souls and for the Church. He was also a man of dialogue, a promoter of peace between peoples and religions. From this perspective of dialogue, I would like to recognize the efforts made in recent months to help overcome historic differences linked to painful episodes of the past. It is my duty to build bridges and to help all men and women, in any way possible, to do the same. When countries which have been at odds resume the path of dialogue--a dialogue which may have been interrupted for the most legitimate of reasons--new opportunities open up for all. This has required, and requires, courage and daring, which is not the same as irresponsibility. A good political leader is one who, with the interests of all in mind, seizes the moment in a spirit of openness and pragmatism. A good political leader always opts to initiate processes rather than possessing spaces. Being at the service of dialogue and peace also means being truly determined to minimize and, in the long term, to end the many armed conflicts throughout our world. Here we have to ask ourselves: Why are deadly weapons being sold to those who plan to inflict untold suffering on individuals and society? Sadly, the answer, as we all know, is simply for money, money that is drenched in blood, often innocent blood. In the face of this shameful and culpable silence, it is our duty to confront the problem and to stop the arms trade. Three sons and one daughter of this land, four individuals and four dreams: Lincoln, liberty; Martin Luther King, liberty in plurality and non-exclusion; Dorothy Day, social justice and the rights of persons; and Thomas Merton, the capacity for dialogue and openness to God. Four representatives of the American people. I will end my visit to your country in Philadelphia, where I will take part in the World Meeting of Families. It is my wish that throughout my visit the family should be a recurrent theme. How essential the family has been to the building of this country, and how worthy it remains for our support and encouragement. Yet I cannot hide my concern for the family, which is threatened, perhaps as never before, from within and without. Fundamental relationships are being called into question, as is the very basis of marriage and the family. I can only reiterate the importance and, above all, the richness and the beauty of family life. In particular, I would like to call attention to those family members who are the most vulnerable: the young. For many of them, a future filled with countless possibilities beckons, yet so many others seem disoriented and aimless, trapped in a hopeless maze of violence, abuse, and despair. Their problems are our problems. We cannot avoid them. We need to face them together, to talk about them, and to seek effective solutions rather than getting bogged down in discussions. At the risk of oversimplifying, we might say that we live in a culture which pressures young people not to start a family, because they lack possibilities for the future. Yet this same culture presents others with so many options that they, too, are dissuaded from starting a family. A nation can be considered great when it defends liberty, as Lincoln did; when it fosters a culture which enables people to ``dream'' of full rights for all brothers and sisters, as Martin Luther King sought to do; when it strives for justice and the cause of the oppressed, as Dorothy Day did by her tireless work; the fruit of a faith, which becomes dialogue and sows peace in the contemplative style of Thomas Merton. In these remarks, I have sought to present some of the richness of your cultural heritage, of the spirit of the American people. It is my desire that this spirit continue to develop and grow, so that as many young people as possible can inherit and dwell in a land which has inspired so many people to dream. God bless America.

Here, together with their representatives, I would like to take this opportunity to dialogue with the many thousands of men and women who strive each day to do an honest day's work, to bring home their daily bread, to save money, and--one step at a time--to build a better life for their families. These are men and women who are not concerned simply with paying their taxes but, in their own quiet way, sustain the life of society. They generate solidarity by their actions, and they create organizations which offer a helping hand to those most in need. I would also like to enter into a dialogue with the many elderly persons who are a storehouse of wisdom forged by experience and who seek in many ways, especially through volunteer work, to share their stories and their insights. I know that many of them are retired but still active; they keep working to build up this land. I also want to dialogue with all those young people who are working to realize their great and noble aspirations, who are not led astray by facile proposals, and who face difficult situations, often as a result of immaturity on the part of many adults. I wish to dialogue with all of you, and I would like to do so through the historical memory of your people. My visit takes place at a time when men and women of goodwill are marking the anniversaries of several great Americans. The complexities of history and the reality of human weakness notwithstanding, these men and women, for all their many differences and limitations, were able by hard work and self-sacrifice--some at the cost of their lives--to build a better future. They shaped fundamental values which will endure forever in the spirit of the American people. A people with this spirit can live through many crises, tensions, and conflicts while always finding the resources to move forward and to do so with dignity. These men and women offer us a way of seeing and interpreting reality. In honoring their memory, we are inspired, even amid conflicts and in the here and now of each day, to draw upon our deepest cultural reserves. I would like to mention four of these Americans: Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King, Dorothy Day, and Thomas Merton. This year marks the 150th anniversary of the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, the guardian of liberty, who labored tirelessly that ``this Nation, under God, might have a new birth of freedom.'' Building a future of freedom requires love of the common good and cooperation in a spirit of subsidiarity and solidarity. All of us are quite aware of and deeply worried by the disturbing social and political situation of the world today. Our world is increasingly a place of violent conflict, hatred, and brutal atrocities committed even in the name of God and of religion. We know that no religion is immune from forms of individual delusion or ideological extremism. This means that we must be especially attentive to every type of fundamentalism, whether religious or of any other kind. A delicate balance is required to combat violence perpetrated in the name of a religion, an ideology, or an economic system, while also safeguarding religious freedom, intellectual freedom, and individual freedoms. But there is another temptation which we must especially guard against: the simplistic reductionism which sees only good or evil; or, if you will, the righteous and sinners. The contemporary world, with its open wounds which affect so many of our brothers and sisters, demands that we confront every form of polarization which would divide it into these two camps. We know that, in the attempt to be freed of the enemy without, we can be tempted to feed the enemy within. To [[Page H6193]] imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place. That is something which you, as a people, reject. Our response must, instead, be one of hope and healing, of peace and justice. We are asked to summon the courage and the intelligence to resolve today's many geopolitical and economic crises. Even in the developed world, the effects of unjust structures and actions are all too apparent. Our efforts must aim at restoring hope, righting wrongs, maintaining commitments, and thus promoting the well-being of individuals and of peoples. We must move forward together, as one, in a renewed spirit of fraternity and solidarity, cooperating generously for the common good. The challenges facing us today call for a renewal of that spirit of cooperation, which has accomplished so much good throughout the history of the United States. The complexity, the gravity, and the urgency of these challenges demand that we pool our resources and talents and resolve to support one another with respect for our differences and our convictions of conscience. In this land, the various religious denominations have greatly contributed to building and strengthening society. It is important that today, as in the past, the voice of faith continue to be heard, for it is a voice of fraternity and love, which tries to bring out the best in each person and in each society. Such cooperation is a powerful resource in the battle to eliminate new global forms of slavery, born of grave injustices which can be overcome only through new policies and new forms of social consensus. Politics is, instead, an expression of our compelling need to live as one, in order to build as one the greatest common good: that of a community which sacrifices particular interests in order to share, in justice and peace, its goods, its interests, its social life. I do not underestimate the difficulty that this involves, but I encourage you in this effort. Here, too, I think of the march which Martin Luther King led from Selma to Montgomery 50 years ago as part of the campaign to fulfill his ``dream'' of full civil and political rights for African Americans. That dream continues to inspire us all. I am happy that America continues to be, for many, a land of dreams: dreams which lead to action, to participation, to commitment; dreams which awaken what is deepest and truest in the life of the people. In recent centuries, millions of people came to this land to pursue their dream of building a future in freedom. We, the people of this continent, are not fearful of foreigners because most of us were once foreigners. I say this to you as the son of immigrants, knowing that so many of you are also descendants of immigrants. Tragically, the rights of those who were here long before us were not always respected. For those peoples and their nations, from the heart of American democracy, I wish to reaffirm my highest esteem and appreciation. Those first contacts were often turbulent and violent, but we know that it is very difficult to judge the past by the criteria of the present. Nonetheless, when the stranger in our midst appeals to us, we must not repeat the sins and the errors of the past. We must resolve now to live as nobly and as justly as possible, as we educate new generations not to turn their back on our neighbors and everything around us. Building a nation calls us to recognize that we must constantly relate to others, rejecting a mindset of hostility in order to adopt one of reciprocal subsidiarity, in a constant effort to do our best. I am confident that we can do this. Our world is facing a refugee crisis of a magnitude not seen since the Second World War. This presents us with great challenges and many hard decisions. On this continent, too, thousands of persons are led to travel north in search of a better life for themselves and for their loved ones, in search of greater opportunities. Is this not what we want for our own children? We must not be taken aback by their numbers, but rather view them as persons, seeing their faces and listening to their stories, trying to respond as best we can to their situation, to respond in a way which is always humane, just, and fraternal. We need to avoid a common temptation nowadays: to discard whatever proves troublesome. Let us remember the Golden Rule: ``Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.'' This rule points us in a clear direction. Let us treat others with the same passion and compassion with which we want to be treated. Let us seek for others the same possibilities which we seek for ourselves. Let us help others to grow, as we would like to be helped ourselves. In a word, if we want security, let us give security. If we want life, let us give life. If we want opportunities, let us provide opportunities. The yardstick we use for others will be the yardstick which time will use for us. The Golden Rule also reminds us of our responsibility to protect and defend human life at every stage of its development. This conviction has led me, from the beginning of my ministry, to advocate at different levels for the global abolition of the death penalty. I am convinced that this way is the best, since every life is sacred, every human person is endowed with an inalienable dignity, and society can only benefit from the rehabilitation of those convicted of crimes. Recently, my brother bishops here in the United States renewed their call for the abolition of the death penalty. Not only do I support them, but I also offer encouragement to all those who are convinced that a just and necessary punishment must never exclude the dimension of hope and the goal of rehabilitation. In these times when social concerns are so important, I cannot fail to mention the servant of God, Dorothy Day, who founded the Catholic Worker Movement. Her social activism, her passion for justice and for the cause of the oppressed were inspired by the Gospel, her faith, and the example of the saints. How much progress has been made in this area in so many parts of the world. How much has been done in these first years of the third millennium to raise people out of extreme poverty. I know that you share my conviction that much more still needs to be done, and in times of crisis and economic hardship, a spirit of global solidarity must not be lost. At the same time, I would encourage you to keep in mind all those people around us who are trapped in a cycle of poverty. They too need to be given hope. The fight against poverty and hunger must be fought constantly and on many fronts, especially in its causes. I know that many Americans today, as in the past, are working to deal with this problem. It goes without saying that part of this great effort is the creation and distribution of wealth. The right use of natural resources, the proper application of technology, and the harnessing of the spirit of enterprise are essential elements of an economy which seeks to be modern, inclusive, and sustainable. ``Business is a noble vocation, directed to producing wealth and improving the world. It can be a fruitful source of prosperity for the area in which it operates, especially if it sees the creation of jobs as an essential part of its service to the common good.'' This common good also includes the Earth, a central theme of the encyclical which I recently wrote in order to ``enter into dialogue with all people about our common home.'' ``We need a conversation which includes everyone, since the environmental challenge we are undergoing, and its human roots, concern and affect us all.'' In Laudato Si', I call for a courageous and responsible effort to ``redirect our steps'' and to avert the most serious effects of the environmental deterioration caused by human activity. I am convinced that we can make a difference. I am sure and I have no doubt that the United States and this Congress have an important role to play. Now is the time for courageous actions and strategies aimed at implementing a ``culture of care'' and ``an integrated approach to combating poverty, restoring dignity to the excluded, and at the same time protecting nature.'' ``We have the freedom needed to limit and direct technology, to devise intelligent ways of . . . developing and limiting our power,'' and to put technology ``at the service of another type of progress, one which is healthier, more human, more social, more integral.'' In this regard, I am confident [[Page H6194]] that America's outstanding academic and research institutions can make a vital contribution in the years ahead. A century ago, at the beginning of the Great War, which Pope Benedict XV termed a ``pointless slaughter,'' another notable American was born: the Cistercian monk Thomas Merton. He remains a source of spiritual inspiration and a guide for many people. In his autobiography, Merton wrote: ``I came into the world. Free by nature, in the image of God, I was nevertheless the prisoner of my own violence and my own selfishness, in the image of the world into which I was born. That world was the picture of Hell, full of men like myself, loving God, and yet hating him; born to love him, living instead in fear of hopeless self-contradictory hungers.'' Merton was, above all, a man of prayer, a thinker who challenged the certitudes of his time and opened new horizons for souls and for the Church. He was also a man of dialogue, a promoter of peace between peoples and religions. From this perspective of dialogue, I would like to recognize the efforts made in recent months to help overcome historic differences linked to painful episodes of the past. It is my duty to build bridges and to help all men and women, in any way possible, to do the same. When countries which have been at odds resume the path of dialogue--a dialogue which may have been interrupted for the most legitimate of reasons--new opportunities open up for all. This has required, and requires, courage and daring, which is not the same as irresponsibility. A good political leader is one who, with the interests of all in mind, seizes the moment in a spirit of openness and pragmatism. A good political leader always opts to initiate processes rather than possessing spaces. Being at the service of dialogue and peace also means being truly determined to minimize and, in the long term, to end the many armed conflicts throughout our world. Here we have to ask ourselves: Why are deadly weapons being sold to those who plan to inflict untold suffering on individuals and society? Sadly, the answer, as we all know, is simply for money, money that is drenched in blood, often innocent blood. In the face of this shameful and culpable silence, it is our duty to confront the problem and to stop the arms trade. Three sons and one daughter of this land, four individuals and four dreams: Lincoln, liberty; Martin Luther King, liberty in plurality and non-exclusion; Dorothy Day, social justice and the rights of persons; and Thomas Merton, the capacity for dialogue and openness to God. Four representatives of the American people. I will end my visit to your country in Philadelphia, where I will take part in the World Meeting of Families. It is my wish that throughout my visit the family should be a recurrent theme. How essential the family has been to the building of this country, and how worthy it remains for our support and encouragement. Yet I cannot hide my concern for the family, which is threatened, perhaps as never before, from within and without. Fundamental relationships are being called into question, as is the very basis of marriage and the family. I can only reiterate the importance and, above all, the richness and the beauty of family life. In particular, I would like to call attention to those family members who are the most vulnerable: the young. For many of them, a future filled with countless possibilities beckons, yet so many others seem disoriented and aimless, trapped in a hopeless maze of violence, abuse, and despair. Their problems are our problems. We cannot avoid them. We need to face them together, to talk about them, and to seek effective solutions rather than getting bogged down in discussions. At the risk of oversimplifying, we might say that we live in a culture which pressures young people not to start a family, because they lack possibilities for the future. Yet this same culture presents others with so many options that they, too, are dissuaded from starting a family. A nation can be considered great when it defends liberty, as Lincoln did; when it fosters a culture which enables people to ``dream'' of full rights for all brothers and sisters, as Martin Luther King sought to do; when it strives for justice and the cause of the oppressed, as Dorothy Day did by her tireless work; the fruit of a faith, which becomes dialogue and sows peace in the contemplative style of Thomas Merton. In these remarks, I have sought to present some of the richness of your cultural heritage, of the spirit of the American people. It is my desire that this spirit continue to develop and grow, so that as many young people as possible can inherit and dwell in a land which has inspired so many people to dream. God bless America. (Applause, the Members rising.)

(Applause, the Members rising.) The SPEAKER. Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you Pope Francis of the Holy See. (Applause, the Members rising.) POPE FRANCIS. Mr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, Honorable Members of Congress, dear friends, I am most grateful for your invitation to address this joint session of Congress in ``the land of the free and the home of the brave.'' I would like to think that the reason for this is that I, too, am a son of this great continent from which we have all received so much and toward which we share a common responsibility. Each son or daughter of a given country has a mission, a personal and social responsibility. Your own responsibility as Members of Congress is to enable this country, by your legislative activity, to grow as a nation. You are the face of its people, their representatives. You are called to defend and preserve the dignity of your fellow citizens in the tireless and demanding pursuit of the common good, for this is the chief aim of all politics. A political society endures when it seeks, as a vocation, to satisfy common needs by stimulating the growth of all its members, especially those in situations of greater vulnerability or risk. Legislative activity is always based on care for the people. To this you have been invited, called, and convened by those who elected you. Yours is a work which makes me reflect in two ways on the figure of Moses. On the one hand, the patriarch and lawgiver of the people of Israel symbolizes the need of peoples to keep alive their sense of unity by means of just legislation. On the other, the figure of Moses leads us directly to God and thus to the transcendent dignity of the human being. Moses provides us with a good synthesis of your work: you are asked to protect, by means of the law, the image and likeness fashioned by God on every human life. Today I would like not only to address you, but, through you, the entire people of the United States. Here, together with their representatives, I would like to take this opportunity to dialogue with the many thousands of men and women who strive each day to do an honest day's work, to bring home their daily bread, to save money, and--one step at a time--to build a better life for their families. These are men and women who are not concerned simply with paying their taxes but, in their own quiet way, sustain the life of society. They generate solidarity by their actions, and they create organizations which offer a helping hand to those most in need. I would also like to enter into a dialogue with the many elderly persons who are a storehouse of wisdom forged by experience and who seek in many ways, especially through volunteer work, to share their stories and their insights. I know that many of them are retired but still active; they keep working to build up this land. I also want to dialogue with all those young people who are working to realize their great and noble aspirations, who are not led astray by facile proposals, and who face difficult situations, often as a result of immaturity on the part of many adults. I wish to dialogue with all of you, and I would like to do so through the historical memory of your people. My visit takes place at a time when men and women of goodwill are marking the anniversaries of several great Americans. The complexities of history and the reality of human weakness notwithstanding, these men and women, for all their many differences and limitations, were able by hard work and self-sacrifice--some at the cost of their lives--to build a better future. They shaped fundamental values which will endure forever in the spirit of the American people. A people with this spirit can live through many crises, tensions, and conflicts while always finding the resources to move forward and to do so with dignity. These men and women offer us a way of seeing and interpreting reality. In honoring their memory, we are inspired, even amid conflicts and in the here and now of each day, to draw upon our deepest cultural reserves. I would like to mention four of these Americans: Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King, Dorothy Day, and Thomas Merton. This year marks the 150th anniversary of the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, the guardian of liberty, who labored tirelessly that ``this Nation, under God, might have a new birth of freedom.'' Building a future of freedom requires love of the common good and cooperation in a spirit of subsidiarity and solidarity. All of us are quite aware of and deeply worried by the disturbing social and political situation of the world today. Our world is increasingly a place of violent conflict, hatred, and brutal atrocities committed even in the name of God and of religion. We know that no religion is immune from forms of individual delusion or ideological extremism. This means that we must be especially attentive to every type of fundamentalism, whether religious or of any other kind. A delicate balance is required to combat violence perpetrated in the name of a religion, an ideology, or an economic system, while also safeguarding religious freedom, intellectual freedom, and individual freedoms.

We know that, in the attempt to be freed of the enemy without, we can be tempted to feed the enemy within. To [[Page H6193]] imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place. That is something which you, as a people, reject. Our response must, instead, be one of hope and healing, of peace and justice. We are asked to summon the courage and the intelligence to resolve today's many geopolitical and economic crises. Even in the developed world, the effects of unjust structures and actions are all too apparent. Our efforts must aim at restoring hope, righting wrongs, maintaining commitments, and thus promoting the well-being of individuals and of peoples. We must move forward together, as one, in a renewed spirit of fraternity and solidarity, cooperating generously for the common good. The challenges facing us today call for a renewal of that spirit of cooperation, which has accomplished so much good throughout the history of the United States. The complexity, the gravity, and the urgency of these challenges demand that we pool our resources and talents and resolve to support one another with respect for our differences and our convictions of conscience. In this land, the various religious denominations have greatly contributed to building and strengthening society. It is important that today, as in the past, the voice of faith continue to be heard, for it is a voice of fraternity and love, which tries to bring out the best in each person and in each society. Such cooperation is a powerful resource in the battle to eliminate new global forms of slavery, born of grave injustices which can be overcome only through new policies and new forms of social consensus. Politics is, instead, an expression of our compelling need to live as one, in order to build as one the greatest common good: that of a community which sacrifices particular interests in order to share, in justice and peace, its goods, its interests, its social life. I do not underestimate the difficulty that this involves, but I encourage you in this effort. Here, too, I think of the march which Martin Luther King led from Selma to Montgomery 50 years ago as part of the campaign to fulfill his ``dream'' of full civil and political rights for African Americans. That dream continues to inspire us all. I am happy that America continues to be, for many, a land of dreams: dreams which lead to action, to participation, to commitment; dreams which awaken what is deepest and truest in the life of the people.

Building a nation calls us to recognize that we must constantly relate to others, rejecting a mindset of hostility in order to adopt one of reciprocal subsidiarity, in a constant effort to do our best. I am confident that we can do this. Our world is facing a refugee crisis of a magnitude not seen since the Second World War. This presents us with great challenges and many hard decisions.

This rule points us in a clear direction. Let us treat others with the same passion and compassion with which we want to be treated. Let us seek for others the same possibilities which we seek for ourselves. Let us help others to grow, as we would like to be helped ourselves. In a word, if we want security, let us give security. If we want life, let us give life. If we want opportunities, let us provide opportunities. The yardstick we use for others will be the yardstick which time will use for us. The Golden Rule also reminds us of our responsibility to protect and defend human life at every stage of its development. This conviction has led me, from the beginning of my ministry, to advocate at different levels for the global abolition of the death penalty. I am convinced that this way is the best, since every life is sacred, every human person is endowed with an inalienable dignity, and society can only benefit from the rehabilitation of those convicted of crimes. Recently, my brother bishops here in the United States renewed their call for the abolition of the death penalty. Not only do I support them, but I also offer encouragement to all those who are convinced that a just and necessary punishment must never exclude the dimension of hope and the goal of rehabilitation.

Her social activism, her passion for justice and for the cause of the oppressed were inspired by the Gospel, her faith, and the example of the saints. How much progress has been made in this area in so many parts of the world. How much has been done in these first years of the third millennium to raise people out of extreme poverty. I know that you share my conviction that much more still needs to be done, and in times of crisis and economic hardship, a spirit of global solidarity must not be lost. At the same time, I would encourage you to keep in mind all those people around us who are trapped in a cycle of poverty. They too need to be given hope. The fight against poverty and hunger must be fought constantly and on many fronts, especially in its causes. I know that many Americans today, as in the past, are working to deal with this problem. It goes without saying that part of this great effort is the creation and distribution of wealth. The right use of natural resources, the proper application of technology, and the harnessing of the spirit of enterprise are essential elements of an economy which seeks to be modern, inclusive, and sustainable. ``Business is a noble vocation, directed to producing wealth and improving the world.

I am convinced that we can make a difference. I am sure and I have no doubt that the United States and this Congress have an important role to play. Now is the time for courageous actions and strategies aimed at implementing a ``culture of care'' and ``an integrated approach to combating poverty, restoring dignity to the excluded, and at the same time protecting nature.'' ``We have the freedom needed to limit and direct technology, to devise intelligent ways of . . . developing and limiting our power,'' and to put technology ``at the service of another type of progress, one which is healthier, more human, more social, more integral.'' In this regard, I am confident [[Page H6194]] that America's outstanding academic and research institutions can make a vital contribution in the years ahead. A century ago, at the beginning of the Great War, which Pope Benedict XV termed a ``pointless slaughter,'' another notable American was born: the Cistercian monk Thomas Merton.

From this perspective of dialogue, I would like to recognize the efforts made in recent months to help overcome historic differences linked to painful episodes of the past. It is my duty to build bridges and to help all men and women, in any way possible, to do the same. When countries which have been at odds resume the path of dialogue--a dialogue which may have been interrupted for the most legitimate of reasons--new opportunities open up for all. This has required, and requires, courage and daring, which is not the same as irresponsibility. A good political leader is one who, with the interests of all in mind, seizes the moment in a spirit of openness and pragmatism. A good political leader always opts to initiate processes rather than possessing spaces. Being at the service of dialogue and peace also means being truly determined to minimize and, in the long term, to end the many armed conflicts throughout our world.

Sadly, the answer, as we all know, is simply for money, money that is drenched in blood, often innocent blood. In the face of this shameful and culpable silence, it is our duty to confront the problem and to stop the arms trade. Three sons and one daughter of this land, four individuals and four dreams: Lincoln, liberty; Martin Luther King, liberty in plurality and non-exclusion; Dorothy Day, social justice and the rights of persons; and Thomas Merton, the capacity for dialogue and openness to God. Four representatives of the American people. I will end my visit to your country in Philadelphia, where I will take part in the World Meeting of Families. It is my wish that throughout my visit the family should be a recurrent theme. How essential the family has been to the building of this country, and how worthy it remains for our support and encouragement. Yet I cannot hide my concern for the family, which is threatened, perhaps as never before, from within and without. Fundamental relationships are being called into question, as is the very basis of marriage and the family. I can only reiterate the importance and, above all, the richness and the beauty of family life. In particular, I would like to call attention to those family members who are the most vulnerable: the young. For many of them, a future filled with countless possibilities beckons, yet so many others seem disoriented and aimless, trapped in a hopeless maze of violence, abuse, and despair. Their problems are our problems. We cannot avoid them. We need to face them together, to talk about them, and to seek effective solutions rather than getting bogged down in discussions. At the risk of oversimplifying, we might say that we live in a culture which pressures young people not to start a family, because they lack possibilities for the future. Yet this same culture presents others with so many options that they, too, are dissuaded from starting a family. A nation can be considered great when it defends liberty, as Lincoln did; when it fosters a culture which enables people to ``dream'' of full rights for all brothers and sisters, as Martin Luther King sought to do; when it strives for justice and the cause of the oppressed, as Dorothy Day did by her tireless work; the fruit of a faith, which becomes dialogue and sows peace in the contemplative style of Thomas Merton. In these remarks, I have sought to present some of the richness of your cultural heritage, of the spirit of the American people. It is my desire that this spirit continue to develop and grow, so that as many young people as possible can inherit and dwell in a land which has inspired so many people to dream. God bless America. (Applause, the Members rising.)

(applause, the members rising.) the speaker. members of congress, i have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you pope francis of the holy see. (applause, the members rising.) pope francis. mr. vice president, mr. speaker, honorable members of congress, dear friends, i am most grateful for your invitation to address this joint session of congress in ``the land of the free and the home of the brave.'' i would like to think that the reason for this is that i, too, am a son of this great continent from which we have all received so much and toward which we share a common responsibility. each son or daughter of a given country has a mission, a personal and social responsibility. your own responsibility as members of congress is to enable this country, by your legislative activity, to grow as a nation. you are the face of its people, their representatives. you are called to defend and preserve the dignity of your fellow citizens in the tireless and demanding pursuit of the common good, for this is the chief aim of all politics. a political society endures when it seeks, as a vocation, to satisfy common needs by stimulating the growth of all its members, especially those in situations of greater vulnerability or risk. legislative activity is always based on care for the people. to this you have been invited, called, and convened by those who elected you. yours is a work which makes me reflect in two ways on the figure of moses. on the one hand, the patriarch and lawgiver of the people of israel symbolizes the need of peoples to keep alive their sense of unity by means of just legislation. on the other, the figure of moses leads us directly to god and thus to the transcendent dignity of the human being. moses provides us with a good synthesis of your work: you are asked to protect, by means of the law, the image and likeness fashioned by god on every human life. today i would like not only to address you, but, through you, the entire people of the united states. here, together with their representatives, i would like to take this opportunity to dialogue with the many thousands of men and women who strive each day to do an honest day's work, to bring home their daily bread, to save money, and--one step at a time--to build a better life for their families. these are men and women who are not concerned simply with paying their taxes but, in their own quiet way, sustain the life of society. they generate solidarity by their actions, and they create organizations which offer a helping hand to those most in need. i would also like to enter into a dialogue with the many elderly persons who are a storehouse of wisdom forged by experience and who seek in many ways, especially through volunteer work, to share their stories and their insights. i know that many of them are retired but still active; they keep working to build up this land. i also want to dialogue with all those young people who are working to realize their great and noble aspirations, who are not led astray by facile proposals, and who face difficult situations, often as a result of immaturity on the part of many adults. i wish to dialogue with all of you, and i would like to do so through the historical memory of your people. my visit takes place at a time when men and women of goodwill are marking the anniversaries of several great americans. the complexities of history and the reality of human weakness notwithstanding, these men and women, for all their many differences and limitations, were able by hard work and self-sacrifice--some at the cost of their lives--to build a better future. they shaped fundamental values which will endure forever in the spirit of the american people. a people with this spirit can live through many crises, tensions, and conflicts while always finding the resources to move forward and to do so with dignity. these men and women offer us a way of seeing and interpreting reality. in honoring their memory, we are inspired, even amid conflicts and in the here and now of each day, to draw upon our deepest cultural reserves. i would like to mention four of these americans: abraham lincoln, martin luther king, dorothy day, and thomas merton. this year marks the 150th anniversary of the assassination of president abraham lincoln, the guardian of liberty, who labored tirelessly that ``this nation, under god, might have a new birth of freedom.'' building a future of freedom requires love of the common good and cooperation in a spirit of subsidiarity and solidarity. all of us are quite aware of and deeply worried by the disturbing social and political situation of the world today. our world is increasingly a place of violent conflict, hatred, and brutal atrocities committed even in the name of god and of religion. we know that no religion is immune from forms of individual delusion or ideological extremism. this means that we must be especially attentive to every type of fundamentalism, whether religious or of any other kind. a delicate balance is required to combat violence perpetrated in the name of a religion, an ideology, or an economic system, while also safeguarding religious freedom, intellectual freedom, and individual freedoms. but there is another temptation which we must especially guard against: the simplistic reductionism which sees only good or evil; or, if you will, the righteous and sinners. the contemporary world, with its open wounds which affect so many of our brothers and sisters, demands that we confront every form of polarization which would divide it into these two camps. we know that, in the attempt to be freed of the enemy without, we can be tempted to feed the enemy within. to [[page h6193]] imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place. that is something which you, as a people, reject. our response must, instead, be one of hope and healing, of peace and justice. we are asked to summon the courage and the intelligence to resolve today's many geopolitical and economic crises. even in the developed world, the effects of unjust structures and actions are all too apparent. our efforts must aim at restoring hope, righting wrongs, maintaining commitments, and thus promoting the well-being of individuals and of peoples. we must move forward together, as one, in a renewed spirit of fraternity and solidarity, cooperating generously for the common good. the challenges facing us today call for a renewal of that spirit of cooperation, which has accomplished so much good throughout the history of the united states. the complexity, the gravity, and the urgency of these challenges demand that we pool our resources and talents and resolve to support one another with respect for our differences and our convictions of conscience. in this land, the various religious denominations have greatly contributed to building and strengthening society. it is important that today, as in the past, the voice of faith continue to be heard, for it is a voice of fraternity and love, which tries to bring out the best in each person and in each society. such cooperation is a powerful resource in the battle to eliminate new global forms of slavery, born of grave injustices which can be overcome only through new policies and new forms of social consensus. politics is, instead, an expression of our compelling need to live as one, in order to build as one the greatest common good: that of a community which sacrifices particular interests in order to share, in justice and peace, its goods, its interests, its social life. i do not underestimate the difficulty that this involves, but i encourage you in this effort. here, too, i think of the march which martin luther king led from selma to montgomery 50 years ago as part of the campaign to fulfill his ``dream'' of full civil and political rights for african americans. that dream continues to inspire us all. i am happy that america continues to be, for many, a land of dreams: dreams which lead to action, to participation, to commitment; dreams which awaken what is deepest and truest in the life of the people. in recent centuries, millions of people came to this land to pursue their dream of building a future in freedom. we, the people of this continent, are not fearful of foreigners because most of us were once foreigners. i say this to you as the son of immigrants, knowing that so many of you are also descendants of immigrants. tragically, the rights of those who were here long before us were not always respected. for those peoples and their nations, from the heart of american democracy, i wish to reaffirm my highest esteem and appreciation. those first contacts were often turbulent and violent, but we know that it is very difficult to judge the past by the criteria of the present. nonetheless, when the stranger in our midst appeals to us, we must not repeat the sins and the errors of the past. we must resolve now to live as nobly and as justly as possible, as we educate new generations not to turn their back on our neighbors and everything around us. building a nation calls us to recognize that we must constantly relate to others, rejecting a mindset of hostility in order to adopt one of reciprocal subsidiarity, in a constant effort to do our best. i am confident that we can do this. our world is facing a refugee crisis of a magnitude not seen since the second world war. this presents us with great challenges and many hard decisions. on this continent, too, thousands of persons are led to travel north in search of a better life for themselves and for their loved ones, in search of greater opportunities. is this not what we want for our own children? we must not be taken aback by their numbers, but rather view them as persons, seeing their faces and listening to their stories, trying to respond as best we can to their situation, to respond in a way which is always humane, just, and fraternal. we need to avoid a common temptation nowadays: to discard whatever proves troublesome. let us remember the golden rule: ``do unto others as you would have them do unto you.'' this rule points us in a clear direction. let us treat others with the same passion and compassion with which we want to be treated. let us seek for others the same possibilities which we seek for ourselves. let us help others to grow, as we would like to be helped ourselves. in a word, if we want security, let us give security. if we want life, let us give life. if we want opportunities, let us provide opportunities. the yardstick we use for others will be the yardstick which time will use for us. the golden rule also reminds us of our responsibility to protect and defend human life at every stage of its development. this conviction has led me, from the beginning of my ministry, to advocate at different levels for the global abolition of the death penalty. i am convinced that this way is the best, since every life is sacred, every human person is endowed with an inalienable dignity, and society can only benefit from the rehabilitation of those convicted of crimes. recently, my brother bishops here in the united states renewed their call for the abolition of the death penalty. not only do i support them, but i also offer encouragement to all those who are convinced that a just and necessary punishment must never exclude the dimension of hope and the goal of rehabilitation. in these times when social concerns are so important, i cannot fail to mention the servant of god, dorothy day, who founded the catholic worker movement. her social activism, her passion for justice and for the cause of the oppressed were inspired by the gospel, her faith, and the example of the saints. how much progress has been made in this area in so many parts of the world. how much has been done in these first years of the third millennium to raise people out of extreme poverty. i know that you share my conviction that much more still needs to be done, and in times of crisis and economic hardship, a spirit of global solidarity must not be lost. at the same time, i would encourage you to keep in mind all those people around us who are trapped in a cycle of poverty. they too need to be given hope. the fight against poverty and hunger must be fought constantly and on many fronts, especially in its causes. i know that many americans today, as in the past, are working to deal with this problem. it goes without saying that part of this great effort is the creation and distribution of wealth. the right use of natural resources, the proper application of technology, and the harnessing of the spirit of enterprise are essential elements of an economy which seeks to be modern, inclusive, and sustainable. ``business is a noble vocation, directed to producing wealth and improving the world. it can be a fruitful source of prosperity for the area in which it operates, especially if it sees the creation of jobs as an essential part of its service to the common good.'' this common good also includes the earth, a central theme of the encyclical which i recently wrote in order to ``enter into dialogue with all people about our common home.'' ``we need a conversation which includes everyone, since the environmental challenge we are undergoing, and its human roots, concern and affect us all.'' in laudato si', i call for a courageous and responsible effort to ``redirect our steps'' and to avert the most serious effects of the environmental deterioration caused by human activity. i am convinced that we can make a difference. i am sure and i have no doubt that the united states and this congress have an important role to play. now is the time for courageous actions and strategies aimed at implementing a ``culture of care'' and ``an integrated approach to combating poverty, restoring dignity to the excluded, and at the same time protecting nature.'' ``we have the freedom needed to limit and direct technology, to devise intelligent ways of . . . developing and limiting our power,'' and to put technology ``at the service of another type of progress, one which is healthier, more human, more social, more integral.'' in this regard, i am confident [[page h6194]] that america's outstanding academic and research institutions can make a vital contribution in the years ahead. a century ago, at the beginning of the great war, which pope benedict xv termed a ``pointless slaughter,'' another notable american was born: the cistercian monk thomas merton. he remains a source of spiritual inspiration and a guide for many people. in his autobiography, merton wrote: ``i came into the world. free by nature, in the image of god, i was nevertheless the prisoner of my own violence and my own selfishness, in the image of the world into which i was born. that world was the picture of hell, full of men like myself, loving god, and yet hating him; born to love him, living instead in fear of hopeless self-contradictory hungers.'' merton was, above all, a man of prayer, a thinker who challenged the certitudes of his time and opened new horizons for souls and for the church. he was also a man of dialogue, a promoter of peace between peoples and religions. from this perspective of dialogue, i would like to recognize the efforts made in recent months to help overcome historic differences linked to painful episodes of the past. it is my duty to build bridges and to help all men and women, in any way possible, to do the same. when countries which have been at odds resume the path of dialogue--a dialogue which may have been interrupted for the most legitimate of reasons--new opportunities open up for all. this has required, and requires, courage and daring, which is not the same as irresponsibility. a good political leader is one who, with the interests of all in mind, seizes the moment in a spirit of openness and pragmatism. a good political leader always opts to initiate processes rather than possessing spaces. being at the service of dialogue and peace also means being truly determined to minimize and, in the long term, to end the many armed conflicts throughout our world. here we have to ask ourselves: why are deadly weapons being sold to those who plan to inflict untold suffering on individuals and society? sadly, the answer, as we all know, is simply for money, money that is drenched in blood, often innocent blood. in the face of this shameful and culpable silence, it is our duty to confront the problem and to stop the arms trade. three sons and one daughter of this land, four individuals and four dreams: lincoln, liberty; martin luther king, liberty in plurality and non-exclusion; dorothy day, social justice and the rights of persons; and thomas merton, the capacity for dialogue and openness to god. four representatives of the american people. i will end my visit to your country in philadelphia, where i will take part in the world meeting of families. it is my wish that throughout my visit the family should be a recurrent theme. how essential the family has been to the building of this country, and how worthy it remains for our support and encouragement. yet i cannot hide my concern for the family, which is threatened, perhaps as never before, from within and without. fundamental relationships are being called into question, as is the very basis of marriage and the family. i can only reiterate the importance and, above all, the richness and the beauty of family life. in particular, i would like to call attention to those family members who are the most vulnerable: the young. for many of them, a future filled with countless possibilities beckons, yet so many others seem disoriented and aimless, trapped in a hopeless maze of violence, abuse, and despair. their problems are our problems. we cannot avoid them. we need to face them together, to talk about them, and to seek effective solutions rather than getting bogged down in discussions. at the risk of oversimplifying, we might say that we live in a culture which pressures young people not to start a family, because they lack possibilities for the future. yet this same culture presents others with so many options that they, too, are dissuaded from

martin luther king sought to do; when it strives for justice and the cause of the oppressed, as dorothy day did by her tireless work; the fruit of a faith, which becomes dialogue and sows peace in the contemplative style of thomas merton. in these remarks, i have sought to present some of the richness of your cultural heritage, of the spirit of the american people. it is my desire that this spirit continue to develop and grow, so that as many young people as possible can inherit and dwell in a land which has inspired so many people to dream. god bless america. (applause, the members rising.) at 10 o'clock and 55 minutes a.m., pope francis of the holy see, accompanied by the speaker and the vice president, retired from the hall of the house of representatives. ____________________",22987

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 434) providing for the concurrence by the House in the Senate amendment to H.R. 719, with an amendment. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: H. Res. 434 Resolved, That upon the adoption of this resolution the bill, H.R. 719, entitled ``TSA Office of Inspection Accountability Act of 2015'', with the Senate amendment thereto, shall be considered to have been taken from the Speaker's table to the end that the Senate amendment thereto be, and the same is hereby, agreed to with the following amendment: In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted by the amendment of the Senate, insert the following: SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``TSA Office of Inspection Accountability Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) Consistent with Federal law and regulations, for law enforcement officers to qualify for premium pay as criminal investigators, the officers must, in general, spend on average at least 50 percent of their time investigating, apprehending, or detaining individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States. (2) According to the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS IG), the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) does not ensure that its cadre of criminal investigators in the Office of Inspection are meeting this requirement, even though they are considered law enforcement officers under TSA policy and receive premium pay. (3) Instead, TSA criminal investigators in the Office of Inspection primarily monitor the results of criminal investigations conducted by other agencies, investigate administrative cases of TSA employee misconduct, and carry out inspections, covert tests, and internal reviews, which the DHS IG asserts could be performed by employees other than criminal investigators at a lower cost. (4) The premium pay and other benefits afforded to TSA criminal investigators in the Office of Inspection who are incorrectly classified as such will cost the taxpayer as much as $17 million over 5 years if TSA fails to make any changes to the number of criminal investigators in the Office of Inspection, according to the DHS IG. (5) This may be a conservative estimate, as it accounts for the cost of Law Enforcement Availability Pay, but not the costs of law enforcement training, statutory early retirement benefits, police vehicles, and weapons. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act: (1) Administration.--The term ``Administration'' means the Transportation Security Administration. (2) Assistant secretary.--The term ``Assistant Secretary'' means the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security (Transportation Security) of the Department of Homeland Security. (3) Inspector general.--The term ``Inspector General'' means the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security. SEC. 4. INSPECTOR GENERAL AUDIT. (a) Audit.--Not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Inspector General shall analyze the data and methods that the Assistant Secretary uses to identify Office of Inspection employees of the Administration who meet the requirements of sections 8331(20), 8401(17), and 5545a of title 5, United States Code, and provide the relevant findings to the Assistant Secretary, including a finding on whether the data and methods are adequate and valid. (b) Prohibition on Hiring.--If the Inspector General finds that such data and methods are inadequate or invalid, the Administration shall not hire any new employee to work in the Office of Inspection of the Administration until-- (1) the Assistant Secretary makes a certification described in section 5 to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate; and (2) the Inspector General submits to such Committees a finding, not later than 30 days after the Assistant Secretary makes such certification, that the Assistant Secretary utilized adequate and valid data and methods to make such certification. SEC. 5. TSA OFFICE OF INSPECTION WORKFORCE CERTIFICATION. (a) Certification to Congress.--The Assistant Secretary shall, by not later than 90 days after the date the Inspector General provides its findings to the Assistant Secretary under section 4(a), document and certify in writing to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate that only those Office of Inspection employees of the Administration who meet the requirements of sections 8331(20), 8401(17), and 5545a of title 5, United States Code, are classified as criminal investigators and are receiving premium pay and other benefits associated with such classification. (b) Employee Reclassification.--The Assistant Secretary shall reclassify criminal investigator positions in the Office of Inspection as noncriminal investigator positions or non-law enforcement positions if the individuals in those positions do not, or are not expected to, spend an average of at least 50 percent of their time performing criminal investigative duties. (c) Projected Cost Savings.-- [[Page H6196]] (1) In general.--The Assistant Secretary shall estimate the total long-term cost savings to the Federal Government resulting from the implementation of subsection (b), and provide such estimate to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate by not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act. (2) Contents.--Such estimate shall identify savings associated with the positions reclassified under subsection (b) and include, among other factors the Assistant Secretary considers appropriate, savings from-- (A) law enforcement training; (B) early retirement benefits; (C) law enforcement availability and other premium pay; and (D) weapons, vehicles, and communications devices. SEC. 6. INVESTIGATION OF FEDERAL AIR MARSHAL SERVICE MISCONDUCT. Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, or as soon as practicable, the Assistant Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate-- (1) materials in the possession or control of the Department of Homeland Security associated with the Office of Inspection's review of instances in which Federal Air Marshal Service officials obtained discounted or free firearms for personal use; (2) information on specific actions that will be taken to prevent Federal Air Marshal Service officials from using their official positions, or exploiting, in any way, the Service's relationships with private vendors to obtain discounted or free firearms for personal use; and (3) information on specific actions that will be taken to prevent the Federal Air Marshal Service from misusing Government resources. SEC. 7. STUDY. Not later than 180 days after the date that the Assistant Secretary submits the certification to Congress under section 5(a), the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate a study-- (1) reviewing the employee requirements, responsibilities, and benefits of criminal investigators in the TSA Office of Inspection with criminal investigators employed at agencies adhering to the Office of Personnel Management employee classification system; and (2) identifying any inconsistencies and costs implications for differences between the varying employee requirements, responsibilities, and benefits. SEC. 8. INDEPENDENT AUDIT OF FEDERAL AIR MARSHAL SERVICE PERSONNEL ISSUES. Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Inspector General shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate a study that-- (1) reviews the Federal Air Marshal Service's existing personnel policies and procedures for identifying misuse of Government resources; and (2) reviews the administration of the Federal Air Marshal Service's existing code of conduct or integrity policies with respect to instances of misconduct. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. General Leave Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 719, the TSA Office of Inspection Accountability Act of 2015. This bipartisan legislation will increase operational efficiency within TSA's Office of Inspection and will translate into cost savings for the American taxpayer, as articulated in a report by the Department of Homeland Security inspector general. I am here today because I have amended this legislation to build on the good work conducted by our colleagues in the Senate and provide increased oversight of the Federal Air Marshal Service in light of ongoing issues of sexual misconduct within the agency. The amended bill requires the DHS inspector general to report to Congress on a review of TSA's existing policies for identifying misuse of government resources within the Federal Air Marshal Service as well as TSA's strategy for addressing instances of misconduct within the Federal Air Marshal Service. This provision has, unfortunately, become necessary, as we have learned of recent egregious examples of both alleged sexual misconduct and misuse of government resources by air marshals. In early September of this year, I was made aware of alleged sexual misconduct by three Federal air marshals in Chicago, Illinois, which came to light through an examination of a government-issued cellular telephone due to a workman's compensation claim investigation. The Federal Air Marshal Service self-reported that the involved employees not only utilized government-issued cellular telephones for unauthorized purposes, but hotel rooms paid for with government funds were used to engage in sexual misconduct. I understand that managing a workforce that operates worldwide is a monumental task. But, as leaders, it is imperative that we maintain discipline in order to accomplish the overall mission of keeping our skies safe. These and other allegations of misconduct have plagued the agency and are devastating to the public trust, employee morale, and the high degree of integrity that must be maintained by Federal law enforcement officers charged with securing aviation and protecting acts of terrorism. Earlier this year my subcommittee held a hearing to examine the Federal Air Marshal Service, and we plan to continue to provide rigorous oversight as TSA works to address these disturbing examples of flagrant abuse of government resources and deplorable behavior. I wish to thank the original sponsor of this legislation, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Sanford), for his leadership on this issue as well as Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member Thompson, and Ranking Member Rice for their support. Also, I would like to thank my colleagues in the Senate, particularly Chairman Thune and Ranking Member Nelson, for their work in contributing to the bill and passing it through that Chamber. I look forward to working with them and working towards final passage of this bill, as amended. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H.R. 719, the TSA Office of Inspection Accountability Act of 2015. In September 2013, the Department of Homeland Security inspector general released a report detailing the Transportation Security Administration's misclassification of certain employees in its Office of Inspection as criminal investigators. Specifically, the inspector general found that the workload of these criminal investigators did not fit the Federal workload requirement to justify their title. Because of this misclassification, these employees received enhanced benefits, such as premium pay, early retirement, and other benefits commensurate with the position, despite the fact that they perform little to no investigative duties. Whereas the workload for a properly classified criminal investigator predominantly involves investigating criminal cases, the inspector general found that the workload for these employees consisted largely of investigating noncriminal cases, carrying out inspections, covert testing, and internal reviews, all tasks that could be performed by employees who do not receive the enhanced benefits. As the ranking member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Oversight and Management Efficiency, I believe that it is important that agencies utilize their resources in a manner that is both effective and efficient. According to the inspector general, the Office of Inspection did not use its resources in a manner that would efficiently conduct internal reviews, inspections, and covert testing. [[Page H6197]] If no changes are made to these positions, the inspector general estimated that it would result in the wasting of as much as $17.5 million over 5 years. H.R. 719 directs TSA to certify that all persons designated as criminal investigators are working on criminal investigations at least 50 percent of their time. This threshold is consistent with the Federal standard for the position and ensures that the TSA is providing enhanced pay and benefits to those who actually perform the duties of a criminal investigator. This measure will not affect those with the proper classification of criminal investigator and will not impede efforts to thwart terror plots and other criminal enterprises that threaten our national security. This legislation also incorporates changes meant to address instances in which Federal Air Marshal Service officials have used their official capacities to obtain benefits from private vendors and to also address recent allegations of misconduct involving the misuse of government resources and solicitation by reviewing existing personnel and code of conduct policies. This legislation is common sense and reflects a commitment to good government. Mr. Speaker, if enacted, H.R. 719 will bring greater accountability to TSA's Office of Inspection. This measure will also ensure that taxpayer dollars are being used efficiently and that past abuses are not repeated. I urge Members to support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 719. {time} 1315 It is critical that we in Congress assert our oversight priorities to ensure that taxpayer dollars and government resources are being used in a responsible manner. We must make certain that our Federal employees, especially those in positions of law enforcement and significant public trust, are not misusing government resources to engage in sexual misconduct and are exhibiting the highest degree of moral fortitude. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H.R. 434. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6195-H6197] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TSA OFFICE OF INSPECTION ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2015 Mr. KATKO.

The Federal Air Marshal Service self-reported that the involved employees not only utilized government-issued cellular telephones for unauthorized purposes, but hotel rooms paid for with government funds were used to engage in sexual misconduct. I understand that managing a workforce that operates worldwide is a monumental task. But, as leaders, it is imperative that we maintain discipline in order to accomplish the overall mission of keeping our skies safe. These and other allegations of misconduct have plagued the agency and are devastating to the public trust, employee morale, and the high degree of integrity that must be maintained by Federal law enforcement officers charged with securing aviation and protecting acts of terrorism. Earlier this year my subcommittee held a hearing to examine the Federal Air Marshal Service, and we plan to continue to provide rigorous oversight as TSA works to address these disturbing examples of flagrant abuse of government resources and deplorable behavior. I wish to thank the original sponsor of this legislation, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Sanford), for his leadership on this issue as well as Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member Thompson, and Ranking Member Rice for their support. Also, I would like to thank my colleagues in the Senate, particularly Chairman Thune and Ranking Member Nelson, for their work in contributing to the bill and passing it through that Chamber. I look forward to working with them and working towards final passage of this bill, as amended. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H.R. 719, the TSA Office of Inspection Accountability Act of 2015. In September 2013, the Department of Homeland Security inspector general released a report detailing the Transportation Security Administration's misclassification of certain employees in its Office of Inspection as criminal investigators. Specifically, the inspector general found that the workload of these criminal investigators did not fit the Federal workload requirement to justify their title. Because of this misclassification, these employees received enhanced benefits, such as premium pay, early retirement, and other benefits commensurate with the position, despite the fact that they perform little to no investigative duties. Whereas the workload for a properly classified criminal investigator predominantly involves investigating criminal cases, the inspector general found that the workload for these employees consisted largely of investigating noncriminal cases, carrying out inspections, covert testing, and internal reviews, all tasks that could be performed by employees who do not receive the enhanced benefits. As the ranking member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Oversight and Management Efficiency, I believe that it is important that agencies utilize their resources in a manner that is both effective and efficient. According to the inspector general, the Office of Inspection did not use its resources in a manner that would efficiently conduct internal reviews, inspections, and covert testing. [[Page H6197]] If no changes are made to these positions, the inspector general estimated that it would result in the wasting of as much as $17.5 million over 5 years. H.R. 719 directs TSA to certify that all persons designated as criminal investigators are working on criminal investigations at least 50 percent of their time. This threshold is consistent with the Federal standard for the position and ensures that the TSA is providing enhanced pay and benefits to those who actually perform the duties of a criminal investigator. This measure will not affect those with the proper classification of criminal investigator and will not impede efforts to thwart terror plots and other criminal enterprises that threaten our national security. This legislation also incorporates changes meant to address instances in which Federal Air Marshal Service officials have used their official capacities to obtain benefits from private vendors and to also address recent allegations of misconduct involving the misuse of government resources and solicitation by reviewing existing personnel and code of conduct policies. This legislation is common sense and reflects a commitment to good government. Mr. Speaker, if enacted, H.R. 719 will bring greater accountability to TSA's Office of Inspection. This measure will also ensure that taxpayer dollars are being used efficiently and that past abuses are not repeated. I urge Members to support this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 719. {time} 1315 It is critical that we in Congress assert our oversight priorities to ensure that taxpayer dollars and government resources are being used in a responsible manner. We must make certain that our Federal employees, especially those in positions of law enforcement and significant public trust, are not misusing government resources to engage in sexual misconduct and are exhibiting the highest degree of moral fortitude. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H.R. 434. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6195-H6197] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TSA OFFICE OF INSPECTION ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2015 Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 434) providing for the concurrence by the House in the Senate amendment to H.R. 719, with an amendment. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: H. Res. 434 Resolved, That upon the adoption of this resolution the bill, H.R. 719, entitled ``TSA Office of Inspection Accountability Act of 2015'', with the Senate amendment thereto, shall be considered to have been taken from the Speaker's table to the end that the Senate amendment thereto be, and the same is hereby, agreed to with the following amendment: In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted by the amendment of the Senate, insert the following: SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``TSA Office of Inspection Accountability Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress makes the following findings: (1) Consistent with Federal law and regulations, for law enforcement officers to qualify for premium pay as criminal investigators, the officers must, in general, spend on average at least 50 percent of their time investigating, apprehending, or detaining individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States. (2) According to the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS IG), the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) does not ensure that its cadre of criminal investigators in the Office of Inspection are meeting this requirement, even though they are considered law enforcement officers under TSA policy and receive premium pay. (3) Instead, TSA criminal investigators in the Office of Inspection primarily monitor the results of criminal investigations conducted by other agencies, investigate administrative cases of TSA employee misconduct, and carry out inspections, covert tests, and internal reviews, which the DHS IG asserts could be performed by employees other than criminal investigators at a lower cost. (4) The premium pay and other benefits afforded to TSA criminal investigators in the Office of Inspection who are incorrectly classified as such will cost the taxpayer as much as $17 million over 5 years if TSA fails to make any changes to the number of criminal investigators in the Office of Inspection, according to the DHS IG. (5) This may be a conservative estimate, as it accounts for the cost of Law Enforcement Availability Pay, but not the costs of law enforcement training, statutory early retirement benefits, police vehicles, and weapons. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act: (1) Administration.--The term ``Administration'' means the Transportation Security Administration. (2) Assistant secretary.--The term ``Assistant Secretary'' means the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security (Transportation Security) of the Department of Homeland Security.

(b) Prohibition on Hiring.--If the Inspector General finds that such data and methods are inadequate or invalid, the Administration shall not hire any new employee to work in the Office of Inspection of the Administration until-- (1) the Assistant Secretary makes a certification described in section 5 to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate; and (2) the Inspector General submits to such Committees a finding, not later than 30 days after the Assistant Secretary makes such certification, that the Assistant Secretary utilized adequate and valid data and methods to make such certification.

(b) Employee Reclassification.--The Assistant Secretary shall reclassify criminal investigator positions in the Office of Inspection as noncriminal investigator positions or non-law enforcement positions if the individuals in those positions do not, or are not expected to, spend an average of at least 50 percent of their time performing criminal investigative duties. (c) Projected Cost Savings.-- [[Page H6196]] (1) In general.--The Assistant Secretary shall estimate the total long-term cost savings to the Federal Government resulting from the implementation of subsection (b), and provide such estimate to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate by not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. General Leave Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 719, the TSA Office of Inspection Accountability Act of 2015. This bipartisan legislation will increase operational efficiency within TSA's Office of Inspection and will translate into cost savings for the American taxpayer, as articulated in a report by the Department of Homeland Security inspector general. I am here today because I have amended this legislation to build on the good work conducted by our colleagues in the Senate and provide increased oversight of the Federal Air Marshal Service in light of ongoing issues of sexual misconduct within the agency. The amended bill requires the DHS inspector general to report to Congress on a review of TSA's existing policies for identifying misuse of government resources within the Federal Air Marshal Service as well as TSA's strategy for addressing instances of misconduct within the Federal Air Marshal Service. This provision has, unfortunately, become necessary, as we have learned of recent egregious examples of both alleged sexual misconduct and misuse of government resources by air marshals.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Ted Lieu) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah. General Leave Mr. CHAFFETZ. I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Arkansas? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3116, the Quarterly Financial Report Reauthorization Act, sponsored by my colleague from the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Congressman Ted Lieu. Mr. Speaker, since 1947, Quarterly Financial Report, often referred to as the QFR program, has collected and published key data on American corporate financial results. It is the primary source of data for GDP estimates and other top-line economic estimates. Ever since its first development, the QFR program has been one of our Nation's most important economic indicators. Quite simply, this survey allows us to measure how large sectors of our economy are doing. Without the QFR, we would lose a seven-decade economic trendline. The QFR's loss would also have significant negative impacts on a wide variety of economic indicators. [[Page H6199]] Authorization for this important program expires next week at the end of the fiscal year. Today we consider a bill introduced by Congressman Ted Lieu that will reauthorize this key program for an additional 15 years. The Oversight and Government Reform Committee approved this bill without objection on July 22. It is a good bill, and I would like to thank Congressman Ted Lieu for his good work on this and his leadership on this issue, and I would urge my colleagues to support and pass this bill. Further, I would also urge my colleagues in the Senate to take quick action on the legislation as well. The QFR program is vital for understanding our economy, and we cannot and should not let it expire. Again, I urge passage of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, I introduced the Quarterly Financial Report Reauthorization Act, a bill that would reauthorize a vital and commonsense program for 15 years. The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform ordered the bill reported by voice vote in July of 2015. I want to thank Chairman Chaffetz and Ranking Member Cummings for working to quickly move this bill forward prior to the program's expiration this year. Since the end of World War II, the QFR has been a closely watched principal economic indicator used to determine our Nation's gross domestic product, the Federal Reserve's Flow of Funds account, and other vital economic estimates. It is conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau based on a sample size of 12,500 companies across a variety of industry sectors, from mining, to manufacturing, to information and professional services. The end result is timely, accurate data on business financial conditions for over one- third of our economy that is widely used by both government and private sector actors. {time} 1330 The program plans to further expand coverage to over 60 percent of our economy, tracking additional sectors and industries, such as health care and real estate. The Department of Commerce has called the reauthorization of this program a top priority, and the U.S. Census Bureau has received letters of validation from both the public and private sectors. The Small Business Administration supports it as do companies such as ProQuest, a Michigan-based global information content and technology company, and companies such as Wells Fargo, whose chief economist wrote in support of this QFR and said: Good decisions require good information. At a time when our country is not that far removed from the wake of the global financial crisis, we need all the tools at our disposal to measure the state of our economy and to chart our progress. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I appreciate the work of Mr. Lieu. This is a good example of our working together on both sides of the aisle. We passed it smoothly out of committee, and I urge its adoption here today. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3116. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed.

A native of Oklahoma, Judge Holloway served in the U.S. Army during World War II. Judge Holloway was nominated by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals by President Johnson in 1968. He served as chief judge from 1984 to 1991 and assumed senior status in 1992 until his death in 2014. During his 45 years on the bench, he authored over 900 opinions and became the longest serving tenth circuit judge. I think it is more than fitting to name this courthouse after him. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. Judge Holloway was well-respected and served for over 45 years as an appellate judge in the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. During his tenure, Judge Holloway wrote more than 900 appellate opinions and continued to serve as a judge until his death in 2014. Judge Holloway received many awards, including the President's Award from the Oklahoma Bar Association and the Humanitarian Award from the National Conference of Christians and Jews, and had a prestigious lecture series named after him. Because of Judge Holloway's long Federal service and his universally revered work ethic, I support naming the U.S. Courthouse located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, as the William J. Holloway, Jr. United States Courthouse. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers and no further comments. I support the legislation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her support, and I urge all of my colleagues to support S. 261. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Crawford) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 261. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed.

Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Arkansas? There was no objection. Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, S. 1707 would designate the Federal building located at 617 Walnut Street in Helena, Arkansas, as the Jacob Trieber Federal Building, United States Post Office, and United States Court House. Judge Trieber, a Prussian immigrant, eventually became the first Jewish Federal judge in our Nation's history. Settling in Helena, Arkansas, Judge Trieber issued rulings to protect against racial discrimination more than six decades before the Supreme Court would. For his unmatched dedication to justice, a lifetime of service, and his many landmark rulings, we seek support in renaming the Federal building in his honor. Appointed to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas by President McKinley in 1900, he served for 27 years and became one of the country's most distinguished jurists and renowned constitutional scholars. Working simultaneously on more than 1,000 cases each year, Judge Trieber issued nationally important rulings on controversies that included antitrust cases, railroad litigation, prohibition cases, and mail fraud. Several of his rulings, especially the ones regarding civil rights and wildlife conservation, still have implications today. Judge Trieber took an early interest in civil rights, especially after seeing how discrimination against Jews consumed his home country of Prussia. After the move to his new home in the United States, Arkansas became very dear to him, but the blatant racism he saw firsthand affected his outlook on life and his work even more than what he had encountered in Prussia. Judge Trieber ``sought to communicate-- through his own life and deeds and his commitment to equal justice-- that racism was detrimental to the people of Arkansas'' and that only until the State's race relations problem was solved could the ``State's great potential be achieved.'' Since Arkansas' judicial system alone could not prevent the commonplace violence and racism, Judge Trieber took it upon himself to fight against injustice through several landmark rulings, two of which dealt with employment discrimination. He also fought against unfair election laws, which he correctly believed were unfair to women and Blacks. Going against conventional thought and even at risk to himself, Judge Trieber ruled against local hate groups, writing that ``the rights to lease lands and to accept employment for hire are fundamental rights, inherent in every free citizen.'' Although he was overruled in 1906 by the Supreme Court, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had finally granted the comprehensive protection against racial discrimination that Judge Trieber had long sought. In 1968, the Supreme Court overturned their original ruling against Judge Trieber's interpretation, saying that his interpretation of the law was at last vindicated. In 1927, Judge Trieber departed this life and was buried in Little Rock at Oakland Cemetery. He would never live to see the changes he fought so hard for, but by renaming the Federal building in the town he loved, we preserve his memory and acknowledge his very early role in the most important civil rights movement our Nation has ever seen. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I agree with my colleague's endorsement of Judge Trieber's legacy as a trailblazer and champion of civil rights for all Americans. Judge Jacob Trieber was a highly respected Federal judge in the Eastern District of Arkansas who served with distinction for 27 years. Judge Trieber [[Page H6198]] was one of the first Federal judges to embrace international treaties as a basis for Federal policy to trump State regulation with respect to pollution control, endangered species preservation, and wetlands conservation. Judge Trieber also famously ruled that a local group of White citizens could not compel a sawmill to fire its Black workers. Judge Trieber's original decision was later cited as a foresighted ruling that had correctly interpreted the 13th Amendment. Because of Judge Trieber's long history of public service and outstanding judicial service, it is appropriate to name the U.S. Federal building in Helena, Arkansas, as the Jacob Trieber Federal Building, United States Post Office, and United States Court House. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I support the bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CRAWFORD.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a member of the Greatest Generation from my district in upstate New York. H.R. 1442 renames the post office in Kingston, New York, after Staff Sergeant Robert Dietz, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his courageous actions during World War II. Sergeant Dietz hailed from Kingston, New York, a proud and historical city in New York's 19th Congressional District. In March of 1945, Sergeant Dietz led his squad on an attack of a heavily fortified German position while protecting a key bridge. Under heavy machine gun fire, Sergeant Dietz advanced forward, clearing enemy obstacles, providing a path for the men of his squad and platoon. This selfless act enabled the success of this attack, but in the process, Sergeant Dietz made the supreme sacrifice and was killed while valiantly leading his men. Last year I had several local veterans' service organizations reach out to me to rename the post office in Kingston for Sergeant Dietz. I thank these organizations, including the Kingston Veterans Association, William Forte, and Dan Joyce, for their leadership and for their support of this bill. I want to thank Chairman Chaffetz, Ranking Member Cummings, and the entire Oversight and Government Reform Committee for passing this bill earlier this year. [[Page H6201]] I also want to thank the entire New York State delegation for its strong support of this bill.

I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 1442, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service as the ``Staff Sergeant Robert H. Dietz Post Office Building.'' A Kingston native, Sergeant Dietz served in the Army's 38th Armored Infantry Battalion, 7th Armored Division, during World War II. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his valor, and this is some of what he did. He was leading a squad as they advanced, and a minefield and two well-defended bridges blocked their path. Despite heavy fire, Sergeant Dietz led his men through the minefield and forged on. In a show of unmatched courage, Sergeant Dietz dodged bullets to independently advance to the first bridge, where he killed the bazooka team that was defending the structure. He continued to advance, killing another bazooka team as well as other German soldiers who fired at him. In his final act of bravery, Sergeant Dietz dove into waist-deep water to disconnect the demolition charges on the second bridge, and he was struck and killed by German sniper fire when he stood to alert his men that their route was then clear. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill in order to honor Sergeant Dietz' valiant actions and to remember a man who truly put his country before himself. I urge the passage of H.R. 1442.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. While this is a Senate bill, there is nobody who has been more passionate and excited and dedicated to getting this done than Mr. Garrett of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett). Mr. GARRETT. I thank the chairman for helping us to usher this legislation through today. I very much appreciate it. Mr. Speaker, today I stand before the House to honor the life and the legacy of one of New Jersey's sons, Staff Sergeant Joseph D'Augustine of Waldwick, New Jersey. Staff Sergeant D'Augustine was killed more than 3 years ago--that was back on March 27, 2012--while conducting combat operations in Afghanistan. In the greatest possible act of self-sacrifice, he gave his life while protecting the lives of men and women in uniform. He was just 29 years old. Today it is fitting that this House will honor him by passing legislation to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service, located at 1 Walter Hammond Place in Waldwick, New Jersey, as the Staff Sergeant Joseph D'Augustine Post Office Building. While nothing will ever heal the loss left by Staff Sergeant D'Augustine to his family, to his friends, and to his community, today's vote will ensure that all of the residents of this town will have a permanent reminder of the ultimate sacrifice made by one of their native sons. To protect our freedom, to protect our liberty, to protect our way of life, a few brave men and women have answered that call of duty. They stand--and have stood--between us here in the United States and those who would do us harm. So I am privileged to come here and stand before this House to honor one of those men today. You see, it was just one day after graduating from Waldwick High School in 2001 that Staff Sergeant D'Augustine enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. He was assigned then to the 8th Engineer Support Battalion, 2nd Marine Logistics Group, 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force. He had served two full tours of duty in Iraq and was just 2 weeks away from completing his second tour of duty in Afghanistan. He worked as something called an explosive ordnance disposal tech, and he was going ahead of his fellow marines, soldiers, sailors, and airmen. He was the one clearing the way for them. Although we will never know the number of lives that he saved, I think his numerous awards speak for his selfless heroism. He was awarded the Bronze Star with Valor, the Purple Heart, the Navy and Marine Commendation Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, the Combat Action Ribbon, the Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Iraq Campaign [[Page H6200]] Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Korean Defense Service Medal, the Humanitarian Service Medal, and the NATO-ISAF Medal. I think all of these speak of his selfless heroism. Even now, after his passing, Staff Sergeant D'Augustine's legacy continues in his community. The Staff Sergeant Joseph D'Augustine Memorial Fund offers a scholarship to one male graduating senior and to one female graduating senior who exemplify the highest standards of citizenship through strong character and dedication to community service. Since October of 2012, the fund has donated more than $94,000 to numerous charities as well as direct donations to veterans in need. The tremendous outpouring of love and support for his family since his death has provided a glimpse into the numbers of lives that he has touched and to the number of lives his love continues to touch. To those who knew him best--his parents, Anthony and Patricia; his three sisters, Nicole, Jennifer, Michele; and his brother-in-law, Len-- he will be remembered as a loving son and brother. To his fellow marines, he will be remembered as a faithful brother in arms. To this Nation, he will be remembered as a patriot who loved this country, who loved the Marine Corps, and who gave his life in defense of freedom. The Marine Corps' motto is Semper Fidelis, always faithful. Staff Sergeant D'Augustine lived this motto, and his legacy embodies it. He was faithful to his country; he was faithful to the mission; he was faithful to the Corps; and he was faithful to his fellow marines. In times such as this, words do fail to provide adequate comfort to his family and to his friends; but it is my hope, as I think it is the hope of us all, to know that the prayers and gratitude of this Nation are with them. I want to thank my colleagues for supporting this legislation. Again, I thank the chairman for moving this legislation, for ensuring that the Staff Sergeant Joseph D'Augustine Post Office becomes an everlasting honor to his legacy and service to our Nation. Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of S. 994, a bill to designate the Staff Sergeant Joseph D'Augustine Post Office. A native of New Jersey, Joseph D'Augustine attended Waldwick High School, where he wrestled and played football. Following his graduation, Joseph joined the Marine Corps, serving two tours of duty as an infantryman in Operation Iraqi Freedom. On March 27, 2012, while serving his second tour in Afghanistan, Joseph was tragically killed while working to diffuse a bomb. Having served on Active Duty myself--and still in the Reserves--I want to honor Joseph for his service and also his family for their sacrifice and their loss. Joseph received a number of awards for his dedicated service, including the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, and the Humanitarian Service Medal. In addition to Joseph's courageous military service, he is remembered for giving back to his hometown through a youth wrestling program that he cofounded with his father. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to honor the years that Staff Sergeant D'Augustine dedicated to this country and the ultimate sacrifice he made on our behalf. I urge the passage of S. 994. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, in closing, you have heard today of the passionate, deep-felt belief of our colleague, Congressman Garrett. It is very appropriate to pass this bill and name this post office after Staff Sergeant Joseph D'Augustine. I didn't know his family, but I hope his family will know today, tomorrow, and forever how grateful this Nation is. People like him step up; they serve; they answer the call of their country. I hope we always remember that and give pause and thanks to those men and women who do sacrifice. So I find it very appropriate that we would name this post office after this young man, Staff Sergeant Joseph D'Augustine. I urge the passage of this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 994. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6199-H6200] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STAFF SERGEANT JOSEPH D'AUGUSTINE POST OFFICE BUILDING Mr. CHAFFETZ.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. While this is a Senate bill, there is nobody who has been more passionate and excited and dedicated to getting this done than Mr. Garrett of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett). Mr. GARRETT. I thank the chairman for helping us to usher this legislation through today. I very much appreciate it. Mr. Speaker, today I stand before the House to honor the life and the legacy of one of New Jersey's sons, Staff Sergeant Joseph D'Augustine of Waldwick, New Jersey. Staff Sergeant D'Augustine was killed more than 3 years ago--that was back on March 27, 2012--while conducting combat operations in Afghanistan. In the greatest possible act of self-sacrifice, he gave his life while protecting the lives of men and women in uniform. He was just 29 years old. Today it is fitting that this House will honor him by passing legislation to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service, located at 1 Walter Hammond Place in Waldwick, New Jersey, as the Staff Sergeant Joseph D'Augustine Post Office Building. While nothing will ever heal the loss left by Staff Sergeant D'Augustine to his family, to his friends, and to his community, today's vote will ensure that all of the residents of this town will have a permanent reminder of the ultimate sacrifice made by one of their native sons. To protect our freedom, to protect our liberty, to protect our way of life, a few brave men and women have answered that call of duty. They stand--and have stood--between us here in the United States and those who would do us harm. So I am privileged to come here and stand before this House to honor one of those men today. You see, it was just one day after graduating from Waldwick High School in 2001 that Staff Sergeant D'Augustine enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. He was assigned then to the 8th Engineer Support Battalion, 2nd Marine Logistics Group, 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force. He had served two full tours of duty in Iraq and was just 2 weeks away from completing his second tour of duty in Afghanistan. He worked as something called an explosive ordnance disposal tech, and he was going ahead of his fellow marines, soldiers, sailors, and airmen. He was the one clearing the way for them. Although we will never know the number of lives that he saved, I think his numerous awards speak for his selfless heroism. He was awarded the Bronze Star with Valor, the Purple Heart, the Navy and Marine Commendation Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, the Combat Action Ribbon, the Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Iraq Campaign [[Page H6200]] Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Korean Defense Service Medal, the Humanitarian Service Medal, and the NATO-ISAF Medal. I think all of these speak of his selfless heroism. Even now, after his passing, Staff Sergeant D'Augustine's legacy continues in his community. The Staff Sergeant Joseph D'Augustine Memorial Fund offers a scholarship to one male graduating senior and to one female graduating senior who exemplify the highest standards of citizenship through strong character and dedication to community service. Since October of 2012, the fund has donated more than $94,000 to numerous charities as well as direct donations to veterans in need. The tremendous outpouring of love and support for his family since his death has provided a glimpse into the numbers of lives that he has touched and to the number of lives his love continues to touch. To those who knew him best--his parents, Anthony and Patricia; his three sisters, Nicole, Jennifer, Michele; and his brother-in-law, Len-- he will be remembered as a loving son and brother. To his fellow marines, he will be remembered as a faithful brother in arms. To this Nation, he will be remembered as a patriot who loved this country, who loved the Marine Corps, and who gave his life in defense of freedom. The Marine Corps' motto is Semper Fidelis, always faithful. Staff Sergeant D'Augustine lived this motto, and his legacy embodies it. He was faithful to his country; he was faithful to the mission; he was faithful to the Corps; and he was faithful to his fellow marines. In times such as this, words do fail to provide adequate comfort to his family and to his friends; but it is my hope, as I think it is the hope of us all, to know that the prayers and gratitude of this Nation are with them. I want to thank my colleagues for supporting this legislation. Again, I thank the chairman for moving this legislation, for ensuring that the Staff Sergeant Joseph D'Augustine Post Office becomes an everlasting honor to his legacy and service to our Nation. Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of S. 994, a bill to designate the Staff Sergeant Joseph D'Augustine Post Office. A native of New Jersey, Joseph D'Augustine attended Waldwick High School, where he wrestled and played football. Following his graduation, Joseph joined the Marine Corps, serving two tours of duty as an infantryman in Operation Iraqi Freedom. On March 27, 2012, while serving his second tour in Afghanistan, Joseph was tragically killed while working to diffuse a bomb. Having served on Active Duty myself--and still in the Reserves--I want to honor Joseph for his service and also his family for their sacrifice and their loss. Joseph received a number of awards for his dedicated service, including the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, and the Humanitarian Service Medal. In addition to Joseph's courageous military service, he is remembered for giving back to his hometown through a youth wrestling program that he cofounded with his father. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to honor the years that Staff Sergeant D'Augustine dedicated to this country and the ultimate sacrifice he made on our behalf. I urge the passage of S. 994. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, in closing, you have heard today of the passionate, deep-felt belief of our colleague, Congressman Garrett. It is very appropriate to pass this bill and name this post office after Staff Sergeant Joseph D'Augustine. I didn't know his family, but I hope his family will know today, tomorrow, and forever how grateful this Nation is. People like him step up; they serve; they answer the call of their country. I hope we always remember that and give pause and thanks to those men and women who do sacrifice. So I find it very appropriate that we would name this post office after this young man, Staff Sergeant Joseph D'Augustine. I urge the passage of this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 994. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6199-H6200] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STAFF SERGEANT JOSEPH D'AUGUSTINE POST OFFICE BUILDING Mr. CHAFFETZ.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 322 introduced by Congresswoman Ann Wagner, which designates the post office located at 16105 Swingley Ridge Road in Chesterfield, Missouri, as the Sgt. Zachary M. Fisher Post Office. I find this very appropriate. This is a young person who went to serve their country, and we honor that person. I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), the Congresswoman who has championed this through the House of Representatives. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor a brave American hero, Sergeant Zachary M. Fisher, from my hometown of Ballwin, Missouri. On July 14, 2010, Missouri's Second District lost a brave young man when United States Army Sergeant Zach Fisher was killed by an IED while serving during Operation Enduring Freedom. Sergeant Fisher was assigned to the 27th Engineer Battalion of the 20th Engineer Brigade based out of Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He was 24 years old when he died at Forward Operating Base Lagman in Afghanistan. Zach graduated in 2004 from Marquette High School in St. Louis, where his history teacher remembered him as a patriotic student with an interest in how the United States developed as a country. Zach met his beautiful and loving wife, Jessica, just before his earlier deployment in Iraq. At the time of his death, they had been married for just 2 years. Sergeant Fisher is survived by his parents, Sue and Jim Jacobs and Bob and Alicia Fisher; and three brothers, Andrew, Clayton, and Alexander; along with two sisters, Emily and Zoe. Zach initially enlisted in the United States Army Reserves. When he told his parents that he wanted to report for Active Duty, they asked him to give them two good reasons why he would choose to put himself in harm's way in the service of his country. His reply said a lot about the character of the man Zach Fisher. He wanted to join the Army because he wanted the discipline that it would provide, and he wanted to be part of something bigger than himself. Although the United States of America can never fully repay the priceless debt we owe to Sergeant Fisher, we can do our part to ensure that his memory lives on. Therefore, it is my honor to sponsor H.R. 322, a bill that names the Chesterfield main post office after such a courageous young man, memorializing a hero who gave up his life in service to the Nation that he loved. All of Zachary's friends would say that Zach was their best friend. He was a dedicated warrior whose commitment to family, friends, and country will be long remembered. I am proud that this legislation will serve as a testament to the dedication and sacrifice of Sergeant Zachary Fisher, standing as a physical reminder of the bravery of one American from Missouri's Second District who chose to serve a cause greater than himself. Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 322, a bill to designate the Sgt. Zachary M. Fisher Post Office. Zachary Fisher was born in Missouri in 1986. A 2004 graduate of Marquette High School, Zachary was known for his passion for American history, patriotism, and academic excellence. To those who knew him, it was no surprise that Zachary decided to serve his country by enlisting in the Army Reserves in 2006. In 2007, he was deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, and later, in December 2009, to Afghanistan. Tragically, on July 14, 2010, Sergeant Fisher and seven of his fellow soldiers were killed in Afghanistan after insurgents attacked their vehicle with an improvised explosive device. For his honorable service, Sergeant Fisher received numerous military awards, including the NATO Medal, Bronze Star, and Purple Heart. Sergeant Fisher is survived by his wife, Jessica, his parents and five siblings. [[Page H6202]] Having myself served in Active Duty and still in the Reserves, I honor Sergeant Fisher's outstanding service and sacrifice to our Nation, and also the sacrifice of his family. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill and remember the brave leadership of Sergeant Zachary Fisher and honor the ultimate sacrifice he made for our Nation. I urge the passage of H.R. 322. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, it is my deep honor to support something that would honor the life, the sacrifice, and the commitment of the patriotism of Sergeant Fisher. I hope his family knows and internalizes how grateful his country is, how men and women across the country thank the young people who step up and serve their Nation. So we recognize Army Sergeant Zachary M. Fisher, and I urge the passage of this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 322. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered.

I rise today in support of H.R. 322 introduced by Congresswoman Ann Wagner, which designates the post office located at 16105 Swingley Ridge Road in Chesterfield, Missouri, as the Sgt. Zachary M. Fisher Post Office. I find this very appropriate. This is a young person who went to serve their country, and we honor that person. I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), the Congresswoman who has championed this through the House of Representatives. Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor a brave American hero, Sergeant Zachary M. Fisher, from my hometown of Ballwin, Missouri. On July 14, 2010, Missouri's Second District lost a brave young man when United States Army Sergeant Zach Fisher was killed by an IED while serving during Operation Enduring Freedom. Sergeant Fisher was assigned to the 27th Engineer Battalion of the 20th Engineer Brigade based out of Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He was 24 years old when he died at Forward Operating Base Lagman in Afghanistan. Zach graduated in 2004 from Marquette High School in St. Louis, where his history teacher remembered him as a patriotic student with an interest in how the United States developed as a country. Zach met his beautiful and loving wife, Jessica, just before his earlier deployment in Iraq. At the time of his death, they had been married for just 2 years. Sergeant Fisher is survived by his parents, Sue and Jim Jacobs and Bob and Alicia Fisher; and three brothers, Andrew, Clayton, and Alexander; along with two sisters, Emily and Zoe. Zach initially enlisted in the United States Army Reserves. When he told his parents that he wanted to report for Active Duty, they asked him to give them two good reasons why he would choose to put himself in harm's way in the service of his country. His reply said a lot about the character of the man Zach Fisher. He wanted to join the Army because he wanted the discipline that it would provide, and he wanted to be part of something bigger than himself. Although the United States of America can never fully repay the priceless debt we owe to Sergeant Fisher, we can do our part to ensure that his memory lives on. Therefore, it is my honor to sponsor H.R. 322, a bill that names the Chesterfield main post office after such a courageous young man, memorializing a hero who gave up his life in service to the Nation that he loved. All of Zachary's friends would say that Zach was their best friend. He was a dedicated warrior whose commitment to family, friends, and country will be long remembered. I am proud that this legislation will serve as a testament to the dedication and sacrifice of Sergeant Zachary Fisher, standing as a physical reminder of the bravery of one American from Missouri's Second District who chose to serve a cause greater than himself. Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 322, a bill to designate the Sgt. Zachary M. Fisher Post Office. Zachary Fisher was born in Missouri in 1986. A 2004 graduate of Marquette High School, Zachary was known for his passion for American history, patriotism, and academic excellence. To those who knew him, it was no surprise that Zachary decided to serve his country by enlisting in the Army Reserves in 2006. In 2007, he was deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, and later, in December 2009, to Afghanistan. Tragically, on July 14, 2010, Sergeant Fisher and seven of his fellow soldiers were killed in Afghanistan after insurgents attacked their vehicle with an improvised explosive device. For his honorable service, Sergeant Fisher received numerous military awards, including the NATO Medal, Bronze Star, and Purple Heart. Sergeant Fisher is survived by his wife, Jessica, his parents and five siblings. [[Page H6202]] Having myself served in Active Duty and still in the Reserves, I honor Sergeant Fisher's outstanding service and sacrifice to our Nation, and also the sacrifice of his family. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill and remember the brave leadership of Sergeant Zachary Fisher and honor the ultimate sacrifice he made for our Nation. I urge the passage of H.R. 322. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, it is my deep honor to support something that would honor the life, the sacrifice, and the commitment of the patriotism of Sergeant Fisher. I hope his family knows and internalizes how grateful his country is, how men and women across the country thank the young people who step up and serve their Nation. So we recognize Army Sergeant Zachary M. Fisher, and I urge the passage of this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 322. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6201-H6202] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SGT.

We are here today to honor Lieutenant Daniel P. Riordan with a post office naming in St. Louis, Missouri. This has been brought to our attention by Congresswoman Ann Wagner. I appreciate her championing this through the Congress. She is in the best position to give the background and the reasoning for the naming of this post office. I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner). Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman very, very much for his indulgence in these three post office namings. I thank the ranking member, also. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor of a brave young man from Missouri's Second Congressional District. On June 23, 2007, Missouri's Second Congressional District lost a true American hero when United States Army First Lieutenant Daniel Riordan made the ultimate sacrifice for his country while serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to reflect on the life of this young patriot. Daniel Patrick Riordan was born to Rick and Jeanine Riordan on February 17, 1983. He had a twin brother, Nick, and an older sister, Suzanne. After graduating from Vianney High School in Kirkwood, Missouri, Dan attended Southeast Missouri State, where he was in the Air Force's ROTC program. After graduation, Dan decided to follow his father into the military and joined the U.S. Army, quickly becoming known as Lieutenant Dan. Lieutenant Dan became a tank commander, and in 2006 he was deployed to Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. As a member of Demon Company in the 1st Cavalry Division, Dan served with courage and determination. Despite frequently being outnumbered in enemy territory, Dan was always out on point, leading his platoon into battle. Dan took his leadership responsibilities literally. As he put it: How can I order my men forward if I am not willing to go first? To those who knew Dan, his devotion to his country through service and sacrifice came as no surprise. He was both a fierce and dedicated warrior in the service of our country and a caring and loving gentleman who felt a duty to help those in need. From a very young age, Dan showed sensitivity beyond his years. At the age of 5 or 6, while attending a funeral, Dan's mom found him sitting with an elderly woman. When she asked him why he was sitting with her, he said she looked sad and lonely. It was this kind of compassion that drew him to the United States military: his desire to serve, help, and protect those in need. While at home on leave from Operation Iraqi Freedom, Dan consistently reassured his family that our country's military efforts were truly bringing empowerment and freedom to the people of Iraq. He believed in a cause greater than himself, that of freedom, democracy, and the dignity of all people. While in the Army, Dan wrote his mother a letter in case he didn't return. One thing that he said was: Don't mourn for me, Mom. Celebrate my life. Today we celebrate First Lieutenant Daniel P. Riordan's life by designating the Sappington Branch Post Office in St. Louis, Missouri, as the Lieutenant Daniel P. Riordan Post Office. The United States of America owes Dan a priceless debt that we will never be able to fully repay, but we can do our part to ensure that his memory lives on. Therefore, it is my honor to sponsor H.R. 324, a bill that names the Sappington Branch Post Office after such a courageous young man, immortalizing a hero who gave up his life in the service to the Nation that he loved. This legislation will serve as a testament to the dedication and sacrifice of First Lieutenant Daniel Riordan, standing as a physical reminder of the bravery of one American from Missouri's Second Congressional District. Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 324, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service in St. Louis, Missouri, as Lieutenant Daniel Riordan Post Office. Daniel Riordan was born in Fort Worth, Texas, and then later at the age of 5 moved to St. Louis, Missouri. There he attended the high school of St. John Vianney. While attending college at Southeast Missouri State University, Daniel worked for the Department of Public Safety and the Jackson Sheriff's Department. In pursuit of his childhood dream of becoming a fighter pilot, Daniel also joined the university's Air Force ROTC program. Upon graduation, Daniel was commissioned in the U.S. Army, beginning his career in the infantry at Fort Benning, Georgia. By 2006, he had become a tank commander of the Blue Platoon. In October of that year, his unit deployed for a 15-month tour to Iraq. Lieutenant Riordan survived many attacks from explosive devices with only minor wounds, and he was proud of his unit's brave actions on behalf of the Iraqi citizens. Sadly, in June of 2007, a massive IED explosion instantly took the lives of Lieutenant Riordan and four others in his unit. He was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 324 to remember the brave leadership of [[Page H6204]] Lieutenant Daniel Riordan and to honor the sacrifices he made for the love of our Nation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I urge the passage of H.R. 324. Lieutenant Riordan served with great courage and sacrifice for his Nation. I hope his family, friends, and colleagues, those around him will look to him for inspiration, somebody who steps up and answers the call of their country. I only hope and pray that his family knows how much we all care across the country for people like Lieutenant Riordan. I appreciate the help on both sides of the aisle to get this passed. I really appreciate Congresswoman Wagner, who brought this to everybody's attention and really pushed to get it done. I hope we find it in our hearts to pass this appropriate bill today. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 324. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6203-H6204] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] LT.

While attending college at Southeast Missouri State University, Daniel worked for the Department of Public Safety and the Jackson Sheriff's Department. In pursuit of his childhood dream of becoming a fighter pilot, Daniel also joined the university's Air Force ROTC program. Upon graduation, Daniel was commissioned in the U.S. Army, beginning his career in the infantry at Fort Benning, Georgia. By 2006, he had become a tank commander of the Blue Platoon. In October of that year, his unit deployed for a 15-month tour to Iraq. Lieutenant Riordan survived many attacks from explosive devices with only minor wounds, and he was proud of his unit's brave actions on behalf of the Iraqi citizens. Sadly, in June of 2007, a massive IED explosion instantly took the lives of Lieutenant Riordan and four others in his unit. He was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 324 to remember the brave leadership of [[Page H6204]] Lieutenant Daniel Riordan and to honor the sacrifices he made for the love of our Nation. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I urge the passage of H.R. 324. Lieutenant Riordan served with great courage and sacrifice for his Nation. I hope his family, friends, and colleagues, those around him will look to him for inspiration, somebody who steps up and answers the call of their country. I only hope and pray that his family knows how much we all care across the country for people like Lieutenant Riordan. I appreciate the help on both sides of the aisle to get this passed. I really appreciate Congresswoman Wagner, who brought this to everybody's attention and really pushed to get it done. I hope we find it in our hearts to pass this appropriate bill today. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 324. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6203-H6204] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] LT.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. We are here today to honor Lieutenant Daniel P. Riordan with a post office naming in St. Louis, Missouri. This has been brought to our attention by Congresswoman Ann Wagner. I appreciate her championing this through the Congress. She is in the best position to give the background and the reasoning for the naming of this post office. I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner). Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman very, very much for his indulgence in these three post office namings. I thank the ranking member, also. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor of a brave young man from Missouri's Second Congressional District. On June 23, 2007, Missouri's Second Congressional District lost a true American hero when United States Army First Lieutenant Daniel Riordan made the ultimate sacrifice for his country while serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to reflect on the life of this young patriot. Daniel Patrick Riordan was born to Rick and Jeanine Riordan on February 17, 1983. He had a twin brother, Nick, and an older sister, Suzanne. After graduating from Vianney High School in Kirkwood, Missouri, Dan attended Southeast Missouri State, where he was in the Air Force's ROTC program. After graduation, Dan decided to follow his father into the military and joined the U.S. Army, quickly becoming known as Lieutenant Dan. Lieutenant Dan became a tank commander, and in 2006 he was deployed to Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. As a member of Demon Company in the 1st Cavalry Division, Dan served with courage and determination. Despite frequently being outnumbered in enemy territory, Dan was always out on point, leading his platoon into battle. Dan took his leadership responsibilities literally. As he put it: How can I order my men forward if I am not willing to go first? To those who knew Dan, his devotion to his country through service and sacrifice came as no surprise. He was both a fierce and dedicated warrior in the service of our country and a caring and loving gentleman who felt a duty to help those in need. From a very young age, Dan showed sensitivity beyond his years. At the age of 5 or 6, while attending a funeral, Dan's mom found him sitting with an elderly woman. When she asked him why he was sitting with her, he said she looked sad and lonely. It was this kind of compassion that drew him to the United States military: his desire to serve, help, and protect those in need. While at home on leave from Operation Iraqi Freedom, Dan consistently reassured his family that our country's military efforts were truly bringing empowerment and freedom to the people of Iraq. He believed in a cause greater than himself, that of freedom, democracy, and the dignity of all people. While in the Army, Dan wrote his mother a letter in case he didn't return. One thing that he said was: Don't mourn for me, Mom. Celebrate my life. Today we celebrate First Lieutenant Daniel P. Riordan's life by designating the Sappington Branch Post Office in St. Louis, Missouri, as the Lieutenant Daniel P. Riordan Post Office. The United States of America owes Dan a priceless debt that we will never be able to fully repay, but we can do our part to ensure that his memory lives on. Therefore, it is my honor to sponsor H.R. 324, a bill that names the Sappington Branch Post Office after such a courageous young man, immortalizing a hero who gave up his life in the service to the Nation that he loved. This legislation will serve as a testament to the dedication and sacrifice of First Lieutenant Daniel Riordan, standing as a physical reminder of the bravery of one American from Missouri's Second Congressional District. Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner). Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor of an American hero. On March 16, 2006, Missouri's Second Congressional District lost a brave young soldier when United States Army Sergeant Amanda N. Pinson was killed in a mortar attack while serving during Operation Iraqi Freedom. I would like to take a moment to reflect on the life of this courageous young woman. Army Sergeant Amanda Pinson was a signals intelligence analyst assigned to the 101st Military Intelligence Detachment of the 101st Airborne Division, based in Fort Campbell, Kentucky. The Screaming Eagles are personal to me. My oldest son, Raymond, is presently serving as a captain in the 101st Airborne. Growing up in Lemay, Missouri, Amanda enlisted in the Army after graduating from Hancock Place High School, where she won several scholarships and was on the basketball and softball teams. Amanda was always concerned with helping others. In high school, she started her own group called the Hancock Environmental Leadership Program, and she enlisted all of her friends to join her in making a difference. Amanda and her group of dedicated volunteers planted trees at local parks and volunteered with local seniors. The group also planted and maintained flowers at the entrance of Jefferson Barracks Park. The park where she used to plant flowers is adjoined to Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery, where Amanda was laid to rest. A pink willow tree was also planted in her honor at her alma mater, Hancock High School, in 2006. Amanda clearly had the respect and the admiration of her fellow soldiers. She was described as a ``model soldier'' and ``a breath of fresh air'' by Lieutenant Colonel Lucinda Lane, who spoke at her service. Following her death, Sergeant Pinson was awarded a Bronze Star, a Good Conduct Medal, a Global War on Terrorism Medal, and a Purple Heart. Her impact on the people privileged to know her is evidenced by the several memorials that honor her life. In 2006, the U.S. Army honored Amanda by dedicating the building where she worked in Tikrit, Iraq, naming it Pinson Hall. Amanda is survived by her mother, Chris; her father, Tony; and her younger brother, Bryan. The Sgt. Amanda M. Pinson Post Office will join the other memorials in her honor as a testament to the bravery, valor, and kindness of this American hero who made the ultimate sacrifice for her country. It is my honor to sponsor H.R. 323, a bill that names the Affton Branch, Grasso Plaza Post Office after such a courageous young woman, immortalizing a hero who gave up her life in service to the Nation that she loved. May it bring comfort to her family and their friends and give witness to Sergeant Pinson's bravery and sacrifice. To quote the face that adorns so many tributes and memorials to Amanda: ``If love could have saved you, you would have lived forever.'' So today on behalf of a grateful nation, I say: Thank you, Amanda. You are indeed loved. {time} 1400 Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 323, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service in St. Louis, Missouri, as the Sergeant Amanda N. Pinson Post Office. As has been stated, she was a native of St. Louis, Missouri, and attended the high school there. Not only was Amanda one of the top students in her class, she enjoyed the opportunity to participate in sports and excelled in them, all while earning numerous academic scholarships. She enlisted in the military, and she served her country. She was assigned to the 101st Military Intelligence Detachment out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky, where she served as a signals intelligence analyst. It has been stated that, while she was deployed to Iraq in 2006, Sergeant Pinson was tragically killed by a mortar round on March 16. She was the first female signals intelligence analyst to ever be killed in combat. Sergeant Pinson was honored by having the Army's new cryptology center named in her honor and her memory. Additionally, Sergeant Pinson's parents accepted a Bronze Star, a Good Conduct Medal, a Global War on Terrorism Medal and a Purple Heart for their daughter's commendable military service. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to remember Sergeant Amanda Pinson's unselfish dedication to bettering the lives of those around her [[Page H6203]] and for her ultimate sacrifice she so bravely made. I urge the passage of H.R. 323. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of this bill. It is appropriate that the United States Congress honor Sergeant Pinson. I hope that her family will always know how much this Nation is grateful for this young woman's service and sacrifice to her country. She was only 21 years old--21 years old. She answered the call, stepped up, served her Nation. While her life was taken, I think the inspiration and dedication that she gave her Nation should always be remembered. I thank Congresswoman Ann Wagner for bringing this to the attention of the Congress and championing it through. I urge the passage of H.R. 323. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 323, which is introduced and championed by Congresswoman Ann Wagner, which designates this post office in St. Louis, Missouri, as the Sgt. Amanda N. Pinson Post Office. We love people like this who step up and serve their Nation and to be able to recognize this person, their family, and their community. We are so grateful to be able to remember the great sacrifices that they have made. The person who is in the best position to discuss this is Congresswoman Ann Wagner. I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner). Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor of an American hero. On March 16, 2006, Missouri's Second Congressional District lost a brave young soldier when United States Army Sergeant Amanda N. Pinson was killed in a mortar attack while serving during Operation Iraqi Freedom. I would like to take a moment to reflect on the life of this courageous young woman. Army Sergeant Amanda Pinson was a signals intelligence analyst assigned to the 101st Military Intelligence Detachment of the 101st Airborne Division, based in Fort Campbell, Kentucky. The Screaming Eagles are personal to me. My oldest son, Raymond, is presently serving as a captain in the 101st Airborne. Growing up in Lemay, Missouri, Amanda enlisted in the Army after graduating from Hancock Place High School, where she won several scholarships and was on the basketball and softball teams. Amanda was always concerned with helping others. In high school, she started her own group called the Hancock Environmental Leadership Program, and she enlisted all of her friends to join her in making a difference. Amanda and her group of dedicated volunteers planted trees at local parks and volunteered with local seniors. The group also planted and maintained flowers at the entrance of Jefferson Barracks Park. The park where she used to plant flowers is adjoined to Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery, where Amanda was laid to rest. A pink willow tree was also planted in her honor at her alma mater, Hancock High School, in 2006. Amanda clearly had the respect and the admiration of her fellow soldiers. She was described as a ``model soldier'' and ``a breath of fresh air'' by Lieutenant Colonel Lucinda Lane, who spoke at her service. Following her death, Sergeant Pinson was awarded a Bronze Star, a Good Conduct Medal, a Global War on Terrorism Medal, and a Purple Heart. Her impact on the people privileged to know her is evidenced by the several memorials that honor her life. In 2006, the U.S. Army honored Amanda by dedicating the building where she worked in Tikrit, Iraq, naming it Pinson Hall. Amanda is survived by her mother, Chris; her father, Tony; and her younger brother, Bryan. The Sgt. Amanda M. Pinson Post Office will join the other memorials in her honor as a testament to the bravery, valor, and kindness of this American hero who made the ultimate sacrifice for her country. It is my honor to sponsor H.R. 323, a bill that names the Affton Branch, Grasso Plaza Post Office after such a courageous young woman, immortalizing a hero who gave up her life in service to the Nation that she loved. May it bring comfort to her family and their friends and give witness to Sergeant Pinson's bravery and sacrifice. To quote the face that adorns so many tributes and memorials to Amanda: ``If love could have saved you, you would have lived forever.'' So today on behalf of a grateful nation, I say: Thank you, Amanda. You are indeed loved. {time} 1400 Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 323, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service in St. Louis, Missouri, as the Sergeant Amanda N. Pinson Post Office. As has been stated, she was a native of St. Louis, Missouri, and attended the high school there. Not only was Amanda one of the top students in her class, she enjoyed the opportunity to participate in sports and excelled in them, all while earning numerous academic scholarships. She enlisted in the military, and she served her country. She was assigned to the 101st Military Intelligence Detachment out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky, where she served as a signals intelligence analyst. It has been stated that, while she was deployed to Iraq in 2006, Sergeant Pinson was tragically killed by a mortar round on March 16. She was the first female signals intelligence analyst to ever be killed in combat. Sergeant Pinson was honored by having the Army's new cryptology center named in her honor and her memory. Additionally, Sergeant Pinson's parents accepted a Bronze Star, a Good Conduct Medal, a Global War on Terrorism Medal and a Purple Heart for their daughter's commendable military service. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to remember Sergeant Amanda Pinson's unselfish dedication to bettering the lives of those around her [[Page H6203]] and for her ultimate sacrifice she so bravely made. I urge the passage of H.R. 323. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of this bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 558, introduced by Mr. Chabot. It is a very appropriate bill, recognizing someone in the community. I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot). Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman from Utah for yielding. I rise today to speak on behalf of H.R. 558, which names the post office in Springboro, Ohio, after Richard Chenault. Mr. Chenault was born in Xenia, Ohio, on December 26, 1925. He was married to his wife, Phyllis, for 63 years. They have four children, four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. He was a lifelong resident of Springboro and Clearcreek Township before passing away in November 2010. Throughout his life, Richard Chenault dedicated himself to serving his community and his Nation. A World War II veteran, Mr. Chenault served in the United States Army's First Cavalry Division from 1944 to 1946, including a year in occupied Japan. Upon returning to Ohio after the war, he sought a career in which he could continue to serve, this time in his local community. He found that opportunity with the U.S. Postal Service, where he was one of the first letter carriers for the Springboro Post Office. He served his community as an employee of the post office for 22 years. But Richard Chenault's dedication to his community and his neighbors didn't stop there. He was a member of the Clearcreek Township Volunteer Fire Department for 45 years, and he served as chief of the department for 23 of those years. Additionally, he was a part-time police officer during the fifties, sixties, and early 1970s, and was a charter member of the Springboro Lions Club, which was founded in 1953. He didn't miss a meeting for 57 years. Somehow he even found time to frequently mow lawns, shovel snow, and check on his elderly neighbors. Not surprisingly, Mr. Chenault was adored and revered by the Springboro community. When he passed, his obituary in the Dayton Daily News was headlined, ``Springboro Icon Dies,'' and he had one of the largest funerals in Springboro history. Since his passing, members of the community have sought the best way to honor a man who did so much for so many. Fittingly, the community has rallied to remember him by naming their local post office the Richard Chenault Post Office, as it was the post office that allowed Mr. Chenault to do what he loved best: serve his neighbors. I ask for your support in honoring this extraordinary public servant by supporting this bill. Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 558, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service in Springboro, Ohio, as the Richard ``Dick'' Chenault Post Office Building. We have heard the amazing career and service of Mr. Chenault. It includes service to his country in many ways. Serving during World War II, he returned back to his community and continued to serve. He was well-known as a friendly face in Springboro. He became the first letter carrier when the postal delivery started in 1965, and he continued to do so until his retirement in 1988. I want to take the time to note that postal service employment is a form of service to our country and to our citizens. That is included in his resume of service, and it is deserving of recognition. He served in the volunteer fire department as their chief. He served as a deputy policeman. He also was involved in community groups, such as being a charter member of the Lions Club. He had an unwavering commitment to service in his community. One thing that is notable is that Mr. Chenault had perfect attendance at the Lions Club for 57 years. Mr. Chenault is survived by his family, but also by the community that he served. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to recognize Dick Chenault's devotion to public service and the impact that he made on his community and those fortunate enough to know him. I would also note that this is an example of an individual who, at every level he was given an opportunity to serve, he did. It is with such honor that we should give him, his family, and those who knew him this recognition by naming the post office after him. I urge passage of the bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. From what I know about Mr. Chenault, he was a great American. I am proud that Congressman Steve Chabot brought this up and moved this bill, because he did everything as an American. He served his country. He served his community. He served his family. He was a volunteer firefighter, fire chief, part-time police officer, and a charter member and president of the Lions Club. For more than 50 years, he had a perfect attendance at the Lions Club. My goodness. He was somebody who gave back to his community and somebody who I would hope young people will learn more about when they see the designation of this post office. We thank his family. We thank him for his service to his country, his family, and his community. [[Page H6205]] I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 558, introduced by Mr. Chabot. It is a very appropriate bill, recognizing someone in the community. I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot). Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman from Utah for yielding. I rise today to speak on behalf of H.R. 558, which names the post office in Springboro, Ohio, after Richard Chenault. Mr. Chenault was born in Xenia, Ohio, on December 26, 1925. He was married to his wife, Phyllis, for 63 years. They have four children, four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. He was a lifelong resident of Springboro and Clearcreek Township before passing away in November 2010. Throughout his life, Richard Chenault dedicated himself to serving his community and his Nation. A World War II veteran, Mr. Chenault served in the United States Army's First Cavalry Division from 1944 to 1946, including a year in occupied Japan. Upon returning to Ohio after the war, he sought a career in which he could continue to serve, this time in his local community. He found that opportunity with the U.S. Postal Service, where he was one of the first letter carriers for the Springboro Post Office. He served his community as an employee of the post office for 22 years. But Richard Chenault's dedication to his community and his neighbors didn't stop there. He was a member of the Clearcreek Township Volunteer Fire Department for 45 years, and he served as chief of the department for 23 of those years. Additionally, he was a part-time police officer during the fifties, sixties, and early 1970s, and was a charter member of the Springboro Lions Club, which was founded in 1953. He didn't miss a meeting for 57 years. Somehow he even found time to frequently mow lawns, shovel snow, and check on his elderly neighbors. Not surprisingly, Mr. Chenault was adored and revered by the Springboro community. When he passed, his obituary in the Dayton Daily News was headlined, ``Springboro Icon Dies,'' and he had one of the largest funerals in Springboro history. Since his passing, members of the community have sought the best way to honor a man who did so much for so many. Fittingly, the community has rallied to remember him by naming their local post office the Richard Chenault Post Office, as it was the post office that allowed Mr. Chenault to do what he loved best: serve his neighbors. I ask for your support in honoring this extraordinary public servant by supporting this bill. Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 558, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service in Springboro, Ohio, as the Richard ``Dick'' Chenault Post Office Building. We have heard the amazing career and service of Mr. Chenault. It includes service to his country in many ways. Serving during World War II, he returned back to his community and continued to serve. He was well-known as a friendly face in Springboro. He became the first letter carrier when the postal delivery started in 1965, and he continued to do so until his retirement in 1988. I want to take the time to note that postal service employment is a form of service to our country and to our citizens. That is included in his resume of service, and it is deserving of recognition. He served in the volunteer fire department as their chief. He served as a deputy policeman. He also was involved in community groups, such as being a charter member of the Lions Club. He had an unwavering commitment to service in his community. One thing that is notable is that Mr. Chenault had perfect attendance at the Lions Club for 57 years. Mr. Chenault is survived by his family, but also by the community that he served. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to recognize Dick Chenault's devotion to public service and the impact that he made on his community and those fortunate enough to know him. I would also note that this is an example of an individual who, at every level he was given an opportunity to serve, he did. It is with such honor that we should give him, his family, and those who knew him this recognition by naming the post office after him. I urge passage of the bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. From what I know about Mr. Chenault, he was a great American. I am proud that Congressman Steve Chabot brought this up and moved this bill, because he did everything as an American. He served his country. He served his community. He served his family. He was a volunteer firefighter, fire chief, part-time police officer, and a charter member and president of the Lions Club. For more than 50 years, he had a perfect attendance at the Lions Club. My goodness. He was somebody who gave back to his community and somebody who I would hope young people will learn more about when they see the designation of this post office. We thank his family. We thank him for his service to his country, his family, and his community. [[Page H6205]] I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 558. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_55.csv,7334,7334,7408,"[congressional record volume 161, number 138 (thursday, september 24, 2015)] [house] [pages h6204-h6205] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] richard ``dick'' chenault post office building mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 558) to designate the facility of the united states postal service located at 55 south pioneer boulevard in springboro, ohio, as the richard ``dick'' chenault post office building. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 558 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. richard ``dick'' chenault post office building.

PIERSON MEMORIAL POST OFFICE BUILDING Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1884) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 206 West Commercial Street in East Rochester, New York, as the ``Officer Daryl R. Pierson Memorial Post Office Building''. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 1884 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. OFFICER DARYL R.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. We are preparing and supporting the designation of a post office for a great American. This is brought to our attention and introduced by Congresswoman Louise Slaughter. It is probably most appropriate that she be the one to tell us more about this person's background, this person's life, and why we should name this post office after him. It is a great American story. I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter). Ms. SLAUGHTER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I come before the House today to honor a great young man whom the Rochester, New York, community continues to mourn and seeks to memorialize. On September 3 of last year, Rochester Police Officer Daryl R. Pierson was killed in the line of duty. His job with the Rochester Police Department's tactical unit was important to all of us. He was recognized for working to remove illegal guns from the streets. While securing our neighborhoods and ensuring that our children were safe, Officer Pierson paid the ultimate price at the young age of 32. He was the first Rochester Police Department officer killed by gunfire in the line of duty since 1959, and our community will not forget him. He left behind a wife, Amy Pierson--a young widow now--and two young children, Christian and Charity. It brings me great sadness to know that he will not be able to see them grow up and that they will only know him now from memory. Officer Pierson's death traumatized the entire community, which came together in mourning. Over a thousand police officers and citizens of our area attended his funeral at the War Memorial Building. But he served far more than what he did in the police department. He served as a member of the National Guard. He was also an Army veteran of the war in Afghanistan. After all that, he came home to try to make his community safer. He died trying to do that. He was a devoted police officer who did his best every single day of his life. The bill before us would rename the United States Post Office in his hometown community of East Rochester, New York, after him. It would be a wonderful tribute to his service. The most important thing is that every citizen of East Rochester and anyone else who uses that post office will never go into that door without remembering Daryl Pierson and who he was and what he did. I think Daryl's mother summed it up better than anyone could. She said: ``Daryl lived as a hero; he didn't have to die to be a hero.'' Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 1884, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located in East Rochester, New York, as the Officer Daryl R. Pierson Memorial Post Office Building. A native of East Rochester, New York, Daryl Pierson graduated from East Rochester High School and attended Monroe Community College. He served our country in Afghanistan before he began his service in the Rochester Police Force. It is said his calming demeanor and ability to deal with chaotic situations made him a perfect fit for the department's tactical unit. As a member of that unit, Officer Pierson received numerous awards, including the 2013 Good Conduct Award, and 11 letters of recognition from the police chief. In addition to his service in Afghanistan and his service as a police officer, he continued to serve as a member of the National Guard. It was a sad night on September 3 when Officer Pierson was shot and killed in the line of duty while pursuing a suspect after a traffic stop. He leaves behind a family and a community and country that he served. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to remember Officer Pierson and honor his years of dedicated public service and his ultimate sacrifice in order to protect his community. I urge the passage of H.R. 1884. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, this is a great American. He was serving his country. He served his community. As Congresswoman Slaughter brought up, this was a well-supported person within the community. My heart goes out to his wife, Amy, and their two children, Christian and Charity. They are very young children, but I hope that they remember their father served this country nobly in the United States Army in Afghanistan and in the Army National Guard, putting his life on the line so that other young families could be safe and protected. I hope that his legacy continues on and that, truly, this post office naming will serve as a reminder to all those in the community and our country that these great people step up, serve their country, serve their community, and they are loved by families and they do tough, difficult things that, quite frankly, a lot of other Americans wouldn't do. We honor him this day. We encourage the passage of Congresswoman Slaughter's bill, H.R. 1884. I yield back the balance of my time. {time} 1430 The SPEAKER pro tempore.

He was serving his country. He served his community. As Congresswoman Slaughter brought up, this was a well-supported person within the community. My heart goes out to his wife, Amy, and their two children, Christian and Charity. They are very young children, but I hope that they remember their father served this country nobly in the United States Army in Afghanistan and in the Army National Guard, putting his life on the line so that other young families could be safe and protected. I hope that his legacy continues on and that, truly, this post office naming will serve as a reminder to all those in the community and our country that these great people step up, serve their country, serve their community, and they are loved by families and they do tough, difficult things that, quite frankly, a lot of other Americans wouldn't do. We honor him this day. We encourage the passage of Congresswoman Slaughter's bill, H.R. 1884. I yield back the balance of my time. {time} 1430 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1884. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed.

(a) designation.--the facility of the united states postal service located at 206 west commercial street in east rochester, new york, shall be known and designated as the ``officer daryl r. pierson memorial post office building''. (b) references.--any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the united states to the facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ``officer daryl r. pierson memorial post office building''. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from utah (mr. chaffetz) and the gentlewoman from michigan (mrs. lawrence) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from utah. general leave mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from utah? there was no objection. mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. we are preparing and supporting the designation of a post office for a great american. this is brought to our attention and introduced by congresswoman louise slaughter. it is probably most appropriate that she be the one to tell us more about this person's background, this person's life, and why we should name this post office after him. it is a great american story. i yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from new york (ms. slaughter). ms. slaughter. i thank the gentleman for yielding. mr. speaker, i come before the house today to honor a great young man whom the rochester, new york, community continues to mourn and seeks to memorialize. on september 3 of last year, rochester police officer daryl r. pierson was killed in the line of duty. his job with the rochester police department's tactical unit was important to all of us. he was recognized for working to remove illegal guns from the streets. while securing our neighborhoods and ensuring that our children were safe, officer pierson paid the ultimate price at the young age of 32. he was the first rochester police department officer killed by gunfire in the line of duty since 1959, and our community will not forget him. he left behind a wife, amy pierson--a young widow now--and two young children, christian and charity. it brings me great sadness to know that he will not be able to see them grow up and that they will only know him now from memory. officer pierson's death traumatized the entire community, which came together in mourning. over a thousand police officers and citizens of our area attended his funeral at the war memorial building. but he served far more than what he did in the police department. he served as a member of the national guard. he was also an army veteran of the war in afghanistan. after all that, he came home to try to make his community safer. he died trying to do that. he was a devoted police officer who did his best every single day of his life. the bill before us would rename the united states post office in his hometown community of east rochester, new york, after him. it would be a wonderful tribute to his service. the most important thing is that every citizen of east rochester and anyone else who uses that post office will never go into that door without remembering daryl pierson and who he was and what he did. i think daryl's mother summed it up better than anyone could. she said: ``daryl lived as a hero; he didn't have to die to be a hero.'' mrs. lawrence. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of h.r. 1884, a bill to designate the facility of the united states postal service located in east rochester, new york, as the officer daryl r. pierson memorial post office building. a native of east rochester, new york, daryl pierson graduated from east rochester high school and attended monroe community college. he served our country in afghanistan before he began his service in the rochester police force. it is said his calming demeanor and ability to deal with chaotic situations made him a perfect fit for the department's tactical unit. as a member of that unit, officer pierson received numerous awards, including the 2013 good conduct award, and 11 letters of recognition from the police chief. in addition to his service in afghanistan and his service as a police officer, he continued to serve as a member of the national guard. it was a sad night on september 3 when officer pierson was shot and killed in the line of duty while pursuing a suspect after a traffic stop. he leaves behind a family and a community and country that he served. mr. speaker, we should pass this bill to remember officer pierson and honor his years of dedicated public service and his ultimate sacrifice in order to protect his community. i urge the passage of h.r. 1884. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. chaffetz. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. mr. speaker, this is a great american. he was serving his country. he served his community. as congresswoman slaughter brought up, this was a well-supported person within the community. my heart goes out to his wife, amy, and their two children, christian and charity. they are very young children, but i hope that they remember their father served this country nobly in the united states army in afghanistan and in the army national guard, putting his life on the line so that other young families could be safe and protected. i hope that his legacy continues on and that, truly, this post office naming will serve as a reminder to all those in the community and our country that these great people step up, serve their country, serve their community, and they are loved by families and they do tough, difficult things that, quite frankly, a lot of other americans wouldn't do. we honor him this day. we encourage the passage of congresswoman slaughter's bill, h.r. 1884. i yield back the balance of my time. {time} 1430 the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from utah (mr. chaffetz) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 1884. the question was taken;

I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Utah? There was no objection. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support today of H.R. 3059. Congressman Steve Russell, who has served this country in a very noble way, has brought this to our attention, introduced this bill, and shepherded it through the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. We would be honored, I think, all of us, to name this post office after such a great American. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell) to tell us more about this amazing person. Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, this measure is to memorialize the service of Bob Kalsu by designating the post office in Del City, Oklahoma, to carry his name. Bob was born as James Robert Kalsu and attended Del City High School in Del City, Oklahoma, my alma mater and my hometown. At 6'3"" and 235 pounds, he was an All-American offensive tackle in 1967, playing for the University of Oklahoma as they won the Big Eight Conference Title. The Buffalo Bills of New York selected him in the eighth round of the 1968 college draft, but he quickly proved himself by earning the team's Rookie of the Year award in his first American football league season as guard. It would also be his final season of professional football. Bob had made an ROTC commitment, earning a commission in the field artillery in college. In late 1969, he was called to duty in the Republic of Vietnam. He was told that, as a pro football player, arrangements could be made where he wouldn't have to serve, but Bob would have none of it. He said: I gave my word to my country. Just because I play professional football doesn't make me any better of a man or any different of a man then the men already serving our country. I'm going to live up to that commitment and the word I gave. Bob deployed to the 101st Airborne Division, leaving behind his beloved wife, Jan, who was pregnant, and a 10-month-old daughter named Jill. On July 21, 1970, only 8 months into his tour of duty, First Lieutenant Bob Kalsu was killed in action at Fire Support Base Ripcord on an isolated jungle mountaintop near the Ashau Valley, Thua Thien, South Vietnam. He was awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart. Bob was survived by his wife, Jan, his daughter, Jill, and son, James Robert Kalsu, Jr., born 2 days after he was killed in action. Bob Kalsu was the only active professional football player killed in the Vietnam War. He has been further memorialized as the namesake of FOB or Camp Kalsu in Iraq, a base where thousands of Americans served from 2003 to 2011. As long as we have breath we will remember him. This act allows others who live after us to do so as well. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the service of this fallen American hero. Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 3059, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service in Del City, Oklahoma, as the James Robert Kalsu Post Office Building. We have heard about this amazing individual who was blessed with such amazing athletic skills, who was selected to play football at the University of Oklahoma and received All-American honors in 1967, leading his team to a 10-1 record and an Orange Bowl win. The following year, after being drafted into the NFL, the Buffalo Bills, and starting in 9 of his 14 appearances, he was again recognized as Rookie of the Year. It was more than his efforts on the football field that made Robert or Bob Kalsu a standout. He always put others first and chose to lead by example. He joined the ROTC at the University of Oklahoma and took to heart the pledge he made to serve his country in the Army. While many athletes elected to serve in the Reserves, he insisted that he was no better than anyone else and choose to serve on Active Duty. We know that, after 8 months of being stationed in Lawton, Oklahoma, Lieutenant Bob Kalsu received orders to go to Vietnam, and less than 1 year later, in 1970, he was killed by enemy fire. It is significant to note he is the only active NFL player to give his life in Vietnam and one of only a handful of professional athletes to serve in Active Duty, Lieutenant Kalsu is survived by a family and, amazingly, a son, who was born just 2 days after his tragic death. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to honor this individual, Lieutenant Bob Kalsu, and recognize the last full measure of devotion he made on behalf of our great country. I urge the passage of H.R. 3059. Mr. Speaker, I just want to say, as this is our last post office naming that we have on the floor tonight, that so many of us go to postal facilities across the country. I was a postal employee for 30 years, and I know the service that is given in a Postal Service. But the ability to name a building in a community where so many of us go, I would like Americans to pause and recognize the names that are given to these facilities. Do take the time to learn about these individuals. This is done so that their service will never be forgotten and that, as we go about our day, it is one of the things that we can do to give tribute to make sure that their service is not forgotten and to give some comfort to the families who lost someone in service to our country. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank Congressman Steve Russell for highlighting this person and his life because he truly was an All- American in every sense of the word. He serves as an inspiration to a lot of people, and I do hope that his loved ones will remember him fondly for the great sacrifice that he gave and commitment that he gave to his country, as did millions of other Americans. It is appropriate that we recognize them. And, as was said, I do hope that, as Americans, when we go into these post offices, we recognize people like Mr. Kalsu, who put everything on the line to serve and sacrifice for their country to give us the freedoms that we have here today, that we don't take them for granted, that there are men and women who serve who step up and answer the call of their county. And certainly Mr. Kalsu did that. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3059. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from utah (mr. chaffetz) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 3059. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

CREC-2015-09-24-pt1-PgH6207-2,CREC-2015-09-24,114,RESPONSIBLY AND PROFESSIONALLY INVIGORATING DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2015,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6207-H6213] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RESPONSIBLY AND PROFESSIONALLY INVIGORATING DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2015 General Leave Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 348. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 420 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 348. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. {time} 1514 In the Committee of the Whole Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 348) to provide for improved coordination of agency actions in the preparation and adoption of environmental documents for permitting determinations, and for other purposes, with Mr. Duncan of Tennessee in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. {time} 1515 Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. America's voters sent the 114th Congress to Washington to help turn around this Nation's struggling economy. For more than 6\1/2\ long years, America's families and workers have been waiting for the Obama administration to join with Congress to pass measures that will adequately restore jobs and growth to our land. The job clearly has not been finished. Throughout the Obama administration, America's growth rate has been historically anemic. The truest measure of unemployment--the rate that includes both discouraged workers and those who cannot find a full-time job--remains over 10 percent. Our labor force participation rate remains mired among historic lows. Median real household income, meanwhile, is 5 percent lower than in June 2009, when the recession officially ended. Median incomes are supposed to rise during economic recoveries, not fall. The Obama administration has managed to buck the historical trend. However, the President at least pays lip service to the need to unleash construction projects. If one thinks back [[Page H6208]] to the start of the Obama administration, one can remember President Obama's plan to solve the Great Recession with the nearly $1 trillion stimulus bill. The stimulus was supposed to work, according to the President, because America had shovel-ready projects from which new, good-paying jobs would be created once the stimulus was enacted and the money was doled out. While many, including myself, disagreed with the fundamental premise of the stimulus bill, the President blamed his stimulus bill's failure on the lack of shovel-ready projects. As he put it, ``Shovel-ready was not as shovel-ready as we expected.'' Mr. Chairman, that is the problem that today's legislation--the RAPID Act--is intended to solve. This legislation fulfills post-stimulus bill calls of leaders in Congress, the White House, the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, and the private sector to streamline the review of Federal construction permit applications. It contains well-thought-out, balanced reforms that provide for more efficient and effective decision-making. Stated succinctly, the RAPID Act gives lead Federal agencies more responsibility to conduct and conclude efficient interagency reviews of permit requests, demands that any entity challenging a final permitting decision in court first have presented the substance of its claims during the agency review process, and requires that lawsuits challenging permitting decisions be filed within 6 months of the decisions, not 6 years, as the law currently allows. These are simple, but powerful, reforms that will allow good projects to move forward more quickly, delivering high-quality jobs and improvements to Americans' daily lives. Prior iterations of the RAPID Act passed the House three times during the 112th and 113th Congresses, each time with bipartisan support. Once enacted, this legislation will help to create millions of high- paying jobs and make government decision-making more efficient and effective. Importantly, it will also continue to ensure that the impacts of new projects on the environment can be considered responsibly before permitting decisions are made. I thank Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law Subcommittee Chairman Marino of Pennsylvania for introducing this legislation. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for the RAPID Act. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. My colleagues, I rise in rather strong opposition to the measure before us, H.R. 348, the Responsibly and Professionally Invigorating Development Act of 2015, or its nickname, the RAPID Act. H.R. 348 has a number of flaws. I won't try to go into each and every one of them. Most critically, this measure would jeopardize public safety and health by prioritizing project approval over meaningful analysis that is currently required under the National Environmental Policy Act. By giving the proponents of construction projects greater control over the environmental approval process, this bill is the equivalent of giving Wall Street the authority to write its own regulations for financial responsibility. The bill accomplishes this result in several respects. To begin with, under the guise of streamlining the approval process, H.R. 348 forecloses potentially critical input from Federal, State, and local agencies, as well as from members of the public, to comment on environmentally sensitive construction projects that are federally funded or that require Federal approval. The bill also imposes hard and fast deadlines that may be unrealistic under certain circumstances. Moreover, if an agency fails to meet these unrealistic deadlines, the bill simply declares that a project must be deemed approved regardless of whether the agency has thoroughly assessed the task. This is an embarrassment, my friends. As a result, H.R. 348 could allow projects that put public health and safety at risk to be approved before the safety review is completed. This failing of the bill, along with some others, explains why the administration and the President's Council on Environmental Quality, along with more than 40 respected environmental groups, vigorously oppose this legislation before us today. These organizations include Public Citizen, the League of Conservation Voters, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club, and The Wilderness Society. Likewise, the administration has appropriately issued a veto threat. Stating that the bill will increase litigation, regulatory delays, and potentially force agencies to approve a project if the review and analysis cannot be completed before the proposed arbitrary deadlines, the administration warns that, if H.R. 348 ever became law, it would lead to more confusion and delay, limit public participation in the permitting process, and, ultimately, hamper economic growth. Another concern, among many, that I have with this measure is that it is a flawed solution in search of an imaginary problem, and that is not just my opinion. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, for instance, states that highway construction project delays based on environmental requirements stem not from the National Environmental Policy Act, but from laws other than the National Environmental Policy Act. In fact, the Congressional Research Service found that the primary source of approval delays for these projects are more often tied to local or State and project-specific factors, primarily local or State agency priorities, project funding levels, local opposition to a project, project complexity, or late changes in project scope. Undoubtedly, the so-called RAPID Act will make the process less clear and less protective of public health and safety. My final major concern with this bill is that, rather than streamlining the environmental review process, which we need to do, it will sow utter confusion. H.R. 348 does this by creating a separate, but only partly parallel, environmental review process for construction projects, which will cause confusion, delay, and litigation. As I have noted, the changes to the National Environmental Policy Act's review process, as contemplated by the measure before us today, apply only to certain construction projects. The National Environmental Policy Act, on the other hand, applies to a broad panoply of Federal actions, including fishing, hunting, and grazing permits, land management plans, Base Realignment and Closure activities, and treaties. As a result of the bill, there could potentially be two different environmental review processes for the same project. For instance, the bill's requirements would apply to the construction of a nuclear reactor, but not to its decommissioning or to the transportation and storage of its spent fuel. Rather than improving the environmental review process, the measure before us will complicate it and generate more litigation. More importantly, this bill is yet another effort by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to undermine regulatory protections. As with all of the other regulatory bills, this measure is a thinly disguised effort to hobble the ability of Federal agencies to do the work the Congress requires that it does. For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to strenuously oppose this seriously flawed bill. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino), the chief sponsor of this legislation and the chairman of the Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law Subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. MARINO. I thank the chairman. Mr. Chairman, once again, my good friends on the other side think we need more government, more EPA overreach, more regulation, to continue the $19 trillion of debt that we have and to continue the flawed job opportunities of this administration's over the past 6 years. Once again, today we consider the RAPID Act. As the gentleman from Virginia stated, during the 112th and [[Page H6209]] 113th Congresses, the House passed this bill on three separate occasions in a bipartisan fashion. Once again, we are considering a number of important regulatory reforms that present the potential for immediately impactful economic growth across our Nation. Our Federal permitting process is undeniably broken. Duplicative environmental reviews have clogged decision-making for years. Although recent studies have shown that, on average, an environmental impact study will take 3 to 4 years, the permitting process for many projects takes years more or, sadly, even decades. Even more disappointing are indications that average environmental review times are increasing by over a month per year. Furthermore, final decision-making has been driven by political whims rather than by the merits of any particular project that would be borne through economic growth and job creation. Political pressure should never impede projects of worth that would get Americans back to work. One recent study found that 7 years of delay on the Keystone pipeline have kept us from realizing nearly $175 billion in potential economic activity. At a time when true economic recovery lags and more Americans become disheartened and leave the workforce, such delays are unacceptable. The RAPID Act reforms remove government obstructions from the equation by implementing hard deadlines for environmental review, and they shorten the window for judicial review. It doesn't take review away. It shortens it to a reasonable period of time. We cannot delay while our infrastructure--from highways and bridges to transmission lines and waterways--crumbles around us in America's counties, towns, and cities. I look forward to working with our colleagues in the Senate to bring this bill to the President's desk, and I hope that we can get this country working again. Federal agencies and departments and employees have to be held accountable just like we are in private industry. They cannot sit back and let these permits and these issues stack up on their desks while they play games on their computers. I have hope that we can get this bill through and the country working again. Please support the RAPID Act. {time} 1530 Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chair, I yield 8 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson), the ranking subcommittee member. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 348, the Responsibly and Professionally Invigorating Development Act, or the RAPID Act. But if I had my druthers, I would change it to the ``Responsibly and Professionally Invigorating Diversion Act,'' or RAPID Act. I would say that it is a diversion because we have got important work to do in this Chamber, Mr. Chair. Everybody knows that we are approaching the end of the fiscal year. It will be here in 6 short days. During this whole month of September--we are at September 24 today-- we have had a total of 8 legislative days during this month, knowing that we are coming up to the end of the fiscal year and we need to pass a spending bill to keep the government open and operating. We have been knowing this. We spent 6 weeks in August, from July to September, a total of about 6 weeks at home lounging while the Nation's business in Washington, D.C., went undone. We have spent a total of 8 legislative days out of the 24 days in September doing everything other than addressing the looming issue, which is the coming, or impending, government shutdown. Now, we are here today. We just took one vote. This is the first legislative day of this week. We have got one business day left. The first legislative day, after hearing from the Pope, we have just had our last vote for the day. It was our one and only vote for the day, and it was to rename a post office. We are coming up on the government shutdown, and what are we dealing with? Instead of dealing with the Nation's finances, we are dealing with this RAPID Act, which, as I said, is a diversion from the real duty that we need to be taking care of today. H.R. 348, the RAPID Act, is a misguided attempt to sow widespread confusion and delay in the review and permitting process under the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. For over 40 years, the approval process for projects under NEPA has saved time, money, and protected the environment, which the Pope spoke of our need to protect today. In fact, since NEPA was enacted, the U.S. economy has not contracted. It has actually tripled in size from just over $5 trillion to more than $16 trillion. Among other things, NEPA requires agencies to prepare a detailed environmental review for proposals relating to ``major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.'' NEPA's purpose is to provide a framework for wide-ranging input from all affected interests when a Federal agency conducts an environmental review of a proposed project. H.R. 348, the so-called RAPID Act, upends this review process in three ways: First, H.R. 348 carves out a separate environmental review process for construction projects. Currently, NEPA applies to a broad range of Federal projects, including hunting permits, land management plans, military base realignment and closure activities, and treaties. In contrast, H.R. 348 only applies to a subset of these Federal projects, creating more regulatory complexity in the permitting system, not less. Second, section (c) of the RAPID Act allows any project sponsor to prepare an environmental document in lieu of such analysis by the lead agency. It is not difficult to imagine the shortcomings of allowing corporations, which seek to maximize shareholder value, to sit in the driver's seat on environmental policy. In fact, that is why we have such environmental degradation today. During a legislative hearing on H.R. 348, Amit Narang, a regulatory policy advocate for Public Citizen, compared section (c) to ``asking big banks to determine the costs and benefits of new Wall Street reform rules, or big energy companies to determine the costs and benefits of new climate change or air pollution measures.'' The inherent conflict of interest built into this section reveals the bill's clear design to allow project sponsors to manipulate the NEPA permit approval process to the greatest extent possible. It is clear that not only does this Republican bill task the fox with guarding the henhouse, it would also have him install the chicken wire as well. Finally, under section (i) of H.R. 348, if an agency fails to meet the unrealistic deadlines mandated by H.R. 348, the bill would automatically green-light a Federal construction project, regardless of whether or not the agency has thoroughly reviewed the project's risks. Even if I were to set aside these concerns, it is difficult for me to look past the complete lack of empirical data supporting the premise of the RAPID Act, which is that agency compliance with NEPA is the cause of delays in approving permits. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service reported in 2012 that project approval delays based on environmental requirements are not caused by NEPA, but ``are more often tied to local/State and project- specific factors, primarily local/State agency priorities, project funding levels, local opposition to a project, project complexity, or late changes in project scope.'' Similarly, Dinah Bear, who served as the general counsel for the White House Council on Environmental Quality which oversees NEPA's implementation, for over 20 years under both Republican and Democratic administrations, testified in the 112th Congress that most delays in the environmental review process are not the result of NEPA, but due to other factors entirely unrelated to NEPA. In other words, the RAPID Act does nothing to address the lack of adequate funds allocated to Federal construction projects or State- based barriers to the timely completion of construction projects, which are two of the most common delays and have nothing to do with regulatory permits under NEPA. So, therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose this misguided legislation. [[Page H6210]] Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), a member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Goodlatte, Mr. Marino, and Mr. Smith for working on this important bill and bringing it to the House floor. Speeding up the regulatory process in the United States is an important issue in keeping America competitive. The methodical, slow, snail-paced decision or lack of decision process of the EPA to make a decision on whether or not to approve a project is absurd. The RAPID Act addresses the problem of extensive requirements and growing delays in Federal permitting and approvals for construction projects stemming from multiple agencies, excessive requirements, and unnecessary lawsuits. According to an April 2014 report issued by the GAO, the average preparation time for the required environmental impact statement finalized in 2012 was over 4\1/2\ years. Now, the environmental impact statement is just the first requirement in getting a permit. Four-and-a-half years--World War II took less time than it takes the EPA to make a decision on whether or not to approve a project. They just continue to study and study and study. Mr. Chair, it is about time for the EPA to pick a horse and ride it, make a decision about these projects. I am not going to talk in theory. I am going to talk about an actual project down in my congressional district. The Sabine-Neches Waterway, most Americans have never heard of it. The Sabine-Neches waterway is what some of us call ``the other Texas international border.'' It is the waterway between Louisiana and Texas. We have been wanting, since 1997, to deepen that 40-foot waterway to 48 feet. That is just 8 feet. We just want to make it a little deeper so ships can come in and off-load their cargo and off-load their fuel. What they are doing now, they can't come in with a full load of fuel on those tankers. They have to off-load it, sometimes 20 percent, in the Gulf of Mexico and then bring in the rest. That costs money. We just want 8 feet. So in 1997, my predecessors asked the EPA for an environmental impact statement and finally got that impact statement. It took 20 years to get an impact statement. I have had 11 grandkids since I have been in Congress, and that impact statement has been pending all that time. We just want 8 feet. Is it okay? The EPA finally made a decision, but yet we still haven't started moving dirt. The original project was about $600 million. Now, it is about $1.3 billion, and we still don't have that extra 8 feet. Why? Because the bureaucrats can't make a decision. Delay, delay, delay. That is the name of the EPA: Delay, Delay, Delay. All this bill does, it says to this bureaucracy, study the information, reach a conclusion, and approve the project if it ought to be approved so America can be competitive worldwide. But, no, the other side says: Well, we need more studies; we need more information. Mr. Chair, if Teddy Roosevelt would have had to deal with the EPA in building the Panama Canal, it would have never been built because of all the regulatory requirements--some unnecessary, in my opinion. So let's approve the RAPID Act. Let's get America working again. The Sabine-Neches Waterway has numerous refineries on it. It is the energy hub of the United States. We just want 8 feet, Mr. Chair. That is all we want. Pick a horse and ride it. The EPA needs to get their act together. And that is just the way it is. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Ted Lieu). Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Chair, I rise to oppose H.R. 348, also known as the RAPID Act. This bill will rapidly cause environmental degradation. Under this bill, if it became law, you could have projects that harm the environment that are deemed approved, even if the review process was not yet completed. That is crazy. Keep in mind, we have had over 60 straight months of job creation under the Obama administration. Those are the facts. This bill is written in such a way that it will cause confusion. It will cause increased delays and limit public involvement in this important process. It is also unscientific. There is a provision in this bill that says we cannot count the social cost of carbon. Now, I believe in a free market, and I believe that that has made America strong, but we can't have government artificially come in and say we are going to say things are costs and things are not costs when it is not scientifically based. We know that carbon has done a lot to increase climate change and caused global warming. That is why I, along with Representatives Peters, Polis, and Lowenthal, have introduced an amendment to put that language back in. We can't just say stop talking and ignore carbon. Keep in mind, just a few hours ago, Pope Francis came in to a joint session of Congress and told us to really revert and look at what we have done in terms of causing environmental degradation. {time} 1545 Now, just a few hours later, we are back to attacking the environment. This is not right. I urge that we not support the RAPID Act. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to myself to say to the gentleman from California that we may have 60 straight months of increased job creation, but the average American worker is making 5 percent less than they were before those 60 months began. The reason is that we are overregulating our economy. If we are really going to create jobs, we have got to have the infrastructure to do it. We have got to have the projects like were just described by Congressman Poe of Texas. Just 8 more feet of depth would bring a lot more jobs to east Texas and to Louisiana by being able to bring that product further up inland. These kind of projects require careful environmental assessment, but it doesn't require assessment that takes 20 years to take place. It should take place in a much more limited period of time. This bill helps to encourage focusing the mind on what needs to get done. That includes taking careful consideration of the environment, but it doesn't include delay, delay, delay. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Hardy), a member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Committee on Natural Resources, both of which understand the importance of these projects. Mr. HARDY. Mr. Chairman, before I had the privilege of being elected to the 114th Congress, I spent more than four decades in the construction industry. After growing up as a fifth-generation son of a farmer and rancher, I set out to learn the trades and acquire the skills that would one day allow me to support myself and my family. Over the course of those four decades in construction, I learned what it takes to start and run a successful business and how to create quality, good-paying jobs. I also learned the satisfaction of seeing the fruits of our labor in the roads, bridges, and dams we built and how they define the communities we serve. Mr. Chairman, small construction businesses like the one I used to own are struggling all across America from Federal bureaucracy that is rife with delays, duplication, and uncertainty. I can speak from firsthand experience about construction projects that have ground to a halt as resources are redirected to navigate the onerous NEPA process. On projects like the ones I used to manage, NEPA delays meant idled equipment, mass layoffs, and millions of dollars going towards compliance. These are sunk costs on the macro level and will continue to hold our economy back. We need to get smart about environment protection and to ensure that we do it in ways that allow businesses to thrive. H.R. 348, the RAPID Act, will go a long way toward achieving that goal. Mr. Chairman, at a time when our Nation's infrastructure is crumbling [[Page H6211]] and far too many are in search of quality employment, we have the responsibility to give manufacturers, construction workers, and other engines of economic growth the certainty they desperately need to create high-paying jobs. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the RAPID Act. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson), a distinguished member of our committee. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, my friend, Chairman Goodlatte, bemoaned the fact that, over the last 64 straight months of job growth under the Obama administration, wages have remained stagnant. That is true except for the wages of the top 10 percent, and specifically the top 1 percent, which have gone through the roof despite what he calls overregulation. We continue to have the problem of income disparity that Pope Francis mentioned today. It is unrelated to this issue of regulations which are there to protect people. They, in fact, protect people and they protect our environment. We have had a speaker today come in and talk about a dredging project that was delayed because of NEPA, but, actually, the truth of the matter is that that project was delayed due to lack of funding. Funding for the project was only authorized last year. While the Republicans in Congress sit around and talk about how much the regulatory agencies study and study and study, what we do in Congress is simply ignore the funding needs for infrastructure in this country, which is what that dredging project was all about. I have got a project down in Georgia, the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project, which was estimated to cost $652 million to complete. But prior to the passage of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act last year, the Federal Government had only provided $1.28 million--$1.28 million--less than 1 percent. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. LaMalfa). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, let's take it back to the year 2011 with the Ryan Budget Control Act, which imposed sequestration on the Federal Government, cutting both defense and nondefense spending 10 percent across the board. We can't have it both ways. If we are not going to fund, we have to admit that that is the reason these projects are not getting done. Don't blame it on NEPA. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Members of the committee, do not be misled by the title of this bill. Rather than effectuating real reforms to the process by which Federal agencies undertake environmental impact reviews, as required by the National Environmental Policy Act, this measure before us will actually result in making the process less responsible, less professional, and less accountable. These kinds of attempts are not new to this session of Congress. Accordingly, I urge that my colleagues carefully consider the discussion on this measure and oppose H.R. 348.

Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members and activists, we are writing to urge you to oppose H.R. 348 the misleadingly named ``Responsibly and Professionally Invigorating Development Act of 2015.'' Instead of improving the permitting process, the bill will severely undermine the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and, consequently, the quality and integrity of federal agency decisions. The National Environmental Policy Act plays a critical role in ensuring that projects are carried out in a transparent, collaborative, and responsible manner. NEPA simply requires federal agencies to assess the environmental, economic, and public health impacts of proposals, solicit the input of all affected stakeholders, and disclose their findings publicly before undertaking projects that may significantly affect the environment. Critically, NEPA recognizes that the public-- which includes industry, citizens, local and state governments, and business owners--can make important contributions by providing unique expertise. NEPA also gives a voice to the most impacted and underrepresented, especially to the most vulnerable communities who usually have to bear the most burden of where federal projects are proposed in the first place. However, H.R. 348 strikes at these core purposes of NEPA by systematically prioritizing speed of decisions and project approval over the public interest. Studies on the causes of delay in the permitting process reveal that the primary cause of delay is not the NEPA process. Rather, as multiple studies by the Government Accountability Office and the Congressional Research Service have pointed out, the principal causes of delay in permitting rest outside the NEPA process entirely and are attributable to other factors such as lack of funding, project complexity, and local opposition to the project. The RAPID Act ignores the true causes of delay, and instead, focuses on institutionalizing dangerous ``reforms'' that restrict public input, limit review of the environmental and economic impacts of projects, and that create more, not less, bureaucracy. Provisions in the RAPID Act, such as the following, will create more delays in permitting, result in less flexibility in the process, and tilt the entire permitting process towards shareholder interest, not the public interest. For example, the bill: Places Arbitrary Limitations on Environmental Reviews-- Section 560(i) of the bill threatens to undermine NEPA's goal of informed decision-making and the agency's role of acting in the public interest. It sets arbitrary deadlines on environmental reviews of permits, licenses, or other applications--regardless of the possible economic, health, or environmental impacts. Consequently, it puts communities at risk by promoting rushed and faulty decisions. Limits Consideration of Alternatives--Section 560(g) strikes at what CEQ regulations describe as ``the heart of the NEPA process'' by restricting the range of reasonable alternatives to be considered by an agency. Creates Serious Conflicts of Interests--Section 560(c) blurs the distinct roles of private entities and agencies in agency decisions by allowing private project sponsors with stakes in the decision to prepare environmental review documents which creates inherent conflicts of interest and thus jeopardizes the integrity of the decision-making process. Leading to Unanticipated Delays--The bill forces stakeholders into court preemptively simply to preserve their right to judicial review. The bill also limits the public's judicial access to challenge and address faulty environmental reviews which in turn is likely to increase the controversy and the amount of litigation derived from the permitting process which in turn could add to project delays. Denies the Impacts of Climate Change--Section 560(k) of the bill prohibits any considerations of the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), which the EPA and other federal agencies use to estimate the economic damages associated with specific projects and their related carbon dioxide emissions. The tool is critical for the public to understand the true benefits and costs of a project. Ignoring climate change puts critical infrastructure, tax payer dollars, and local communities at risk. Provisions such as these and many more in the RAPID Act will only serve to increase delay and confusion around the environmental review process. We believe compromising the quality of environmental review and limiting the role of the public is the wrong approach. Far from being broken, the National Environmental Policy Act has proven its worth as an invaluable tool. It ensures that the public, developers, and agencies have a reliable template for consistent and fair proposal assessment for major projects that may impact federal resources. The RAPID Act contradicts and jeopardizes decades of experience gained from enacting this critical environmental law. Further, it tips the balance away from informed decisions and public oversight, jeopardizing the public's ability to participate in how public resources will be managed. Please oppose this unnecessary and overreaching piece of legislation and vote ``no'' on the RAPID Act. [[Page H6212]] Although no amendment would remedy the problems with the underlying bill, we make the following vote recommendations on amendments offered to the RAPID Act. Vote no on Goodlatte (R-VA) #1--This amendment would prompt ill-informed decisions by limiting the role of cooperating agencies in the environmental review process. It would also severely limit the public's ability to use the courts their rights by requiring eventual plaintiffs to participate in drastically shortened comment periods and administrative proceedings that, in many cases, agencies do not provide. Vote yes on Peters (D-CA) #2--This amendment ensures that the true impacts of climate change are considered by allowing agencies to consider the social costs of carbon when conducting environmental reviews. Agencies should be free to incorporate the social cost of carbon into the agency decision making process, which will result in better informed and responsible decisions that safely invest taxpayer dollars by taking into account climate change, the fundamental environmental issue of our time. Vote yes on Jackson Lee (D-TX) #3--This amendment will undo one of the more pernicious provisions in the H.R. 348 which, in cases where an agency fails to meet arbitrary deadlines prescribed by the bill, projects are simply deemed approved regardless of their economic, health, or environmental impacts. The bill, without this amendment, puts communities at risk by green-lighting projects without fully considering environmental impacts or the opinions of those who will be impacted the most. Vote yes on Jackson Lee (D-TX) #4--This amendment maintains national security by undoing hasty shortcuts in the permitting process and rightly ensuring a full review for projects that could be potential targets for terrorist attacks. This amendment wisely ensures that shortcutting critical federal review of projects does not apply those projects that most need informed decisions because of the tremendous impacts they may have on our national security. Vote yes on Johnson (D-GA) #5--This amendment rightly ensures that nothing in the bill will limit input of affected stakeholders, local governments, private property owners, or business owners. Vote yes on Dingell (D-MI) #6--This amendment would prevent project approvals under the arbitrary timelines set forth in the bill if the project under consideration would limit access to or opportunities for hunting or fishing or would impact threatened or endangered species. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, wildlife related recreation contributes more than $140 billion dollars to the U.S. economy and supports thousands of jobs connected to fishing, hunting, and the observance of wildlife. Vote yes on Gallego (D-AZ) #8--This amendment preserves meaningful input by local governments and tribal officials on projects affecting their communities by allowing them to request extensions of the arbitrary deadlines in the bill. Vote yes on Grijalva (D-AZ) #9--The shortcutting of meaningful public input and review of a project's impacts under the RAPID Act could potentially lead to disproportionate impacts on low-income communities and communities of color. This amendment ensures such impacts are carefully addressed during the review of project alternatives. Vote yes on Lowenthal (D-CA) #10--The truncated review procedures under the RAPID Act would potentially apply to construction projects of enormous size, scope, and complexity. Climate change poses severe threats to the health, safety, and economies of local communities through the increased risks of floods, fire and severe weather. This amendment ensures federal agencies consider these impacts and construct projects that are resilient to the impacts of climate change. Vote no on Gosar (R-AZ) #11--This amendment would broaden one of the most damaging provisions of the bill which prevents Federal agencies from considering the true costs of climate change, putting communities and tax-payer dollars at risk. Whatever the outcome of these amendments, we urge a no vote on final passage.

Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, first, to the gentleman from Georgia, let me just say that the Water Resources Development Act, which passed this House, has in it the same streamlining provisions of the permitting processes for the projects that it would fund that are based on the ideas in this bill. Why? Because we know that, just because we come up with the funds for something, those funds can be churned and churned and churned year after year after year in the permitting process and never ever get to a permit so the underlying construction can take place in Texas or Savannah, Georgia, or Virginia, or all of the other places where infrastructure projects are needed. Part of the enormous cost of it is the enormous process that we go through and the length of that process and the review and review and review that never gets to a decision. During the debate over this bill this term and last, we have heard several false alarms from my friends on the other side of the aisle. For example, we have heard that the bill does not allow enough time for environmental reviews to be completed. But, with all due respect, the bill, when necessary, allows as much time for the completion of an environmental impact statement as it took our Nation to win World War II. Surely that is time enough. We have heard that the bill will generate more litigation because there may be litigation over what its new terms mean, but that argument can be made against any reform legislation. If it were a valid and sufficient reason to defeat legislation, we would never pass another reform bill. Furthermore, the bill for the first time requires litigants to present their claims to permit agencies before they sue in court and to file lawsuits no later than 180 days after the agency's final decisions. That will reduce litigation, not increase it. We have also heard that the White House has threatened to veto the bill. Mr. Chairman, that is what is truly alarming. This legislation fulfills the calls of the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness to streamline the review of Federal permit applications. We are doing that in this legislation. It creates shovel-ready projects, which even President Obama claims would create jobs. In fact, it would generate millions of high-paying, good jobs for our Nation's workers and families, who so desperately need them. It would raise the standard of living of Americans. The White House should not be issuing threats to veto the legislation. The White House should be running to lend its support to this bill. [[Page H6213]] Ignore the false alarms and embrace the commonsense reforms in this bill. Pass the RAPID Act, call the President's bluff, give the Nation shovel-ready projects. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Hardy), having assumed the chair, Mr. LaMalfa, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 348) to provide for improved coordination of agency actions in the preparation and adoption of environmental documents for permitting determinations, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6207-H6213] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RESPONSIBLY AND PROFESSIONALLY INVIGORATING DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2015 General Leave Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 348. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 420 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 348. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. {time} 1514 In the Committee of the Whole Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 348) to provide for improved coordination of agency actions in the preparation and adoption of environmental documents for permitting determinations, and for other purposes, with Mr. Duncan of Tennessee in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. {time} 1515 Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. America's voters sent the 114th Congress to Washington to help turn around this Nation's struggling economy. For more than 6\1/2\ long years, America's families and workers have been waiting for the Obama administration to join with Congress to pass measures that will adequately restore jobs and growth to our land. The job clearly has not been finished. Throughout the Obama administration, America's growth rate has been historically anemic. The truest measure of unemployment--the rate that includes both discouraged workers and those who cannot find a full-time job--remains over 10 percent. Our labor force participation rate remains mired among historic lows. Median real household income, meanwhile, is 5 percent lower than in June 2009, when the recession officially ended. Median incomes are supposed to rise during economic recoveries, not fall. The Obama administration has managed to buck the historical trend. However, the President at least pays lip service to the need to unleash construction projects. If one thinks back [[Page H6208]] to the start of the Obama administration, one can remember President Obama's plan to solve the Great Recession with the nearly $1 trillion stimulus bill. The stimulus was supposed to work, according to the President, because America had shovel-ready projects from which new, good-paying jobs would be created once the stimulus was enacted and the money was doled out. While many, including myself, disagreed with the fundamental premise of the stimulus bill, the President blamed his stimulus bill's failure on the lack of shovel-ready projects. As he put it, ``Shovel-ready was not as shovel-ready as we expected.'' Mr. Chairman, that is the problem that today's legislation--the RAPID Act--is intended to solve. This legislation fulfills post-stimulus bill calls of leaders in Congress, the White House, the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, and the private sector to streamline the review of Federal construction permit applications. It contains well-thought-out, balanced reforms that provide for more efficient and effective decision-making. Stated succinctly, the RAPID Act gives lead Federal agencies more responsibility to conduct and conclude efficient interagency reviews of permit requests, demands that any entity challenging a final permitting decision in court first have presented the substance of its claims during the agency review process, and requires that lawsuits challenging permitting decisions be filed within 6 months of the decisions, not 6 years, as the law currently allows. These are simple, but powerful, reforms that will allow good projects to move forward more quickly, delivering high-quality jobs and improvements to Americans' daily lives. Prior iterations of the RAPID Act passed the House three times during the 112th and 113th Congresses, each time with bipartisan support. Once enacted, this legislation will help to create millions of high- paying jobs and make government decision-making more efficient and effective. Importantly, it will also continue to ensure that the impacts of new projects on the environment can be considered responsibly before permitting decisions are made. I thank Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law Subcommittee Chairman Marino of Pennsylvania for introducing this legislation. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for the RAPID Act. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. My colleagues, I rise in rather strong opposition to the measure before us, H.R. 348, the Responsibly and Professionally Invigorating Development Act of 2015, or its nickname, the RAPID Act. H.R. 348 has a number of flaws. I won't try to go into each and every one of them. Most critically, this measure would jeopardize public safety and health by prioritizing project approval over meaningful analysis that is currently required under the National Environmental Policy Act. By giving the proponents of construction projects greater control over the environmental approval process, this bill is the equivalent of giving Wall Street the authority to write its own regulations for financial responsibility. The bill accomplishes this result in several respects. To begin with, under the guise of streamlining the approval process, H.R. 348 forecloses potentially critical input from Federal, State, and local agencies, as well as from members of the public, to comment on environmentally sensitive construction projects that are federally funded or that require Federal approval. The bill also imposes hard and fast deadlines that may be unrealistic under certain circumstances. Moreover, if an agency fails to meet these unrealistic deadlines, the bill simply declares that a project must be deemed approved regardless of whether the agency has thoroughly assessed the task. This is an embarrassment, my friends. As a result, H.R. 348 could allow projects that put public health and safety at risk to be approved before the safety review is completed. This failing of the bill, along with some others, explains why the administration and the President's Council on Environmental Quality, along with more than 40 respected environmental groups, vigorously oppose this legislation before us today. These organizations include Public Citizen, the League of Conservation Voters, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club, and The Wilderness Society. Likewise, the administration has appropriately issued a veto threat. Stating that the bill will increase litigation, regulatory delays, and potentially force agencies to approve a project if the review and analysis cannot be completed before the proposed arbitrary deadlines, the administration warns that, if H.R. 348 ever became law, it would lead to more confusion and delay, limit public participation in the permitting process, and, ultimately, hamper economic growth. Another concern, among many, that I have with this measure is that it is a flawed solution in search of an imaginary problem, and that is not just my opinion. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, for instance, states that highway construction project delays based on environmental requirements stem not from the National Environmental Policy Act, but from laws other than the National Environmental Policy Act. In fact, the Congressional Research Service found that the primary source of approval delays for these projects are more often tied to local or State and project-specific factors, primarily local or State agency priorities, project funding levels, local opposition to a project, project complexity, or late changes in project scope. Undoubtedly, the so-called RAPID Act will make the process less clear and less protective of public health and safety. My final major concern with this bill is that, rather than streamlining the environmental review process, which we need to do, it will sow utter confusion. H.R. 348 does this by creating a separate, but only partly parallel, environmental review process for construction projects, which will cause confusion, delay, and litigation. As I have noted, the changes to the National Environmental Policy Act's review process, as contemplated by the measure before us today, apply only to certain construction projects. The National Environmental Policy Act, on the other hand, applies to a broad panoply of Federal actions, including fishing, hunting, and grazing permits, land management plans, Base Realignment and Closure activities, and treaties. As a result of the bill, there could potentially be two different environmental review processes for the same project. For instance, the bill's requirements would apply to the construction of a nuclear reactor, but not to its decommissioning or to the transportation and storage of its spent fuel. Rather than improving the environmental review process, the measure before us will complicate it and generate more litigation. More importantly, this bill is yet another effort by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to undermine regulatory protections. As with all of the other regulatory bills, this measure is a thinly disguised effort to hobble the ability of Federal agencies to do the work the Congress requires that it does. For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to strenuously oppose this seriously flawed bill. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino), the chief sponsor of this legislation and the chairman of the Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law Subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. MARINO. I thank the chairman. Mr. Chairman, once again, my good friends on the other side think we need more government, more EPA overreach, more regulation, to continue the $19 trillion of debt that we have and to continue the flawed job opportunities of this administration's over the past 6 years. Once again, today we consider the RAPID Act. As the gentleman from Virginia stated, during the 112th and [[Page H6209]] 113th Congresses, the House passed this bill on three separate occasions in a bipartisan fashion. Once again, we are considering a number of important regulatory reforms that present the potential for immediately impactful economic growth across our Nation. Our Federal permitting process is undeniably broken. Duplicative environmental reviews have clogged decision-making for years. Although recent studies have shown that, on average, an environmental impact study will take 3 to 4 years, the permitting process for many projects takes years more or, sadly, even decades. Even more disappointing are indications that average environmental review times are increasing by over a month per year. Furthermore, final decision-making has been driven by political whims rather than by the merits of any particular project that would be borne through economic growth and job creation. Political pressure should never impede projects of worth that would get Americans back to work. One recent study found that 7 years of delay on the Keystone pipeline have kept us from realizing nearly $175 billion in potential economic activity. At a time when true economic recovery lags and more Americans become disheartened and leave the workforce, such delays are unacceptable. The RAPID Act reforms remove government obstructions from the equation by implementing hard deadlines for environmental review, and they shorten the window for judicial review. It doesn't take review away. It shortens it to a reasonable period of time. We cannot delay while our infrastructure--from highways and bridges to transmission lines and waterways--crumbles around us in America's counties, towns, and cities. I look forward to working with our colleagues in the Senate to bring this bill to the President's desk, and I hope that we can get this country working again. Federal agencies and departments and employees have to be held accountable just like we are in private industry. They cannot sit back and let these permits and these issues stack up on their desks while they play games on their computers. I have hope that we can get this bill through and the country working again. Please support the RAPID Act. {time} 1530 Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chair, I yield 8 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson), the ranking subcommittee member. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 348, the Responsibly and Professionally Invigorating Development Act, or the RAPID Act. But if I had my druthers, I would change it to the ``Responsibly and Professionally Invigorating Diversion Act,'' or RAPID Act. I would say that it is a diversion because we have got important work to do in this Chamber, Mr. Chair. Everybody knows that we are approaching the end of the fiscal year. It will be here in 6 short days. During this whole month of September--we are at September 24 today-- we have had a total of 8 legislative days during this month, knowing that we are coming up to the end of the fiscal year and we need to pass a spending bill to keep the government open and operating. We have been knowing this. We spent 6 weeks in August, from July to September, a total of about 6 weeks at home lounging while the Nation's business in Washington, D.C., went undone. We have spent a total of 8 legislative days out of the 24 days in September doing everything other than addressing the looming issue, which is the coming, or impending, government shutdown. Now, we are here today. We just took one vote. This is the first legislative day of this week. We have got one business day left. The first legislative day, after hearing from the Pope, we have just had our last vote for the day. It was our one and only vote for the day, and it was to rename a post office. We are coming up on the government shutdown, and what are we dealing with? Instead of dealing with the Nation's finances, we are dealing with this RAPID Act, which, as I said, is a diversion from the real duty that we need to be taking care of today. H.R. 348, the RAPID Act, is a misguided attempt to sow widespread confusion and delay in the review and permitting process under the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. For over 40 years, the approval process for projects under NEPA has saved time, money, and protected the environment, which the Pope spoke of our need to protect today. In fact, since NEPA was enacted, the U.S. economy has not contracted. It has actually tripled in size from just over $5 trillion to more than $16 trillion. Among other things, NEPA requires agencies to prepare a detailed environmental review for proposals relating to ``major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.'' NEPA's purpose is to provide a framework for wide-ranging input from all affected interests when a Federal agency conducts an environmental review of a proposed project. H.R. 348, the so-called RAPID Act, upends this review process in three ways: First, H.R. 348 carves out a separate environmental review process for construction projects. Currently, NEPA applies to a broad range of Federal projects, including hunting permits, land management plans, military base realignment and closure activities, and treaties. In contrast, H.R. 348 only applies to a subset of these Federal projects, creating more regulatory complexity in the permitting system, not less. Second, section (c) of the RAPID Act allows any project sponsor to prepare an environmental document in lieu of such analysis by the lead agency. It is not difficult to imagine the shortcomings of allowing corporations, which seek to maximize shareholder value, to sit in the driver's seat on environmental policy. In fact, that is why we have such environmental degradation today. During a legislative hearing on H.R. 348, Amit Narang, a regulatory policy advocate for Public Citizen, compared section (c) to ``asking big banks to determine the costs and benefits of new Wall Street reform rules, or big energy companies to determine the costs and benefits of new climate change or air pollution measures.'' The inherent conflict of interest built into this section reveals the bill's clear design to allow project sponsors to manipulate the NEPA permit approval process to the greatest extent possible. It is clear that not only does this Republican bill task the fox with guarding the henhouse, it would also have him install the chicken wire as well. Finally, under section (i) of H.R. 348, if an agency fails to meet the unrealistic deadlines mandated by H.R. 348, the bill would automatically green-light a Federal construction project, regardless of whether or not the agency has thoroughly reviewed the project's risks. Even if I were to set aside these concerns, it is difficult for me to look past the complete lack of empirical data supporting the premise of the RAPID Act, which is that agency compliance with NEPA is the cause of delays in approving permits. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service reported in 2012 that project approval delays based on environmental requirements are not caused by NEPA, but ``are more often tied to local/State and project- specific factors, primarily local/State agency priorities, project funding levels, local opposition to a project, project complexity, or late changes in project scope.'' Similarly, Dinah Bear, who served as the general counsel for the White House Council on Environmental Quality which oversees NEPA's implementation, for over 20 years under both Republican and Democratic administrations, testified in the 112th Congress that most delays in the environmental review process are not the result of NEPA, but due to other factors entirely unrelated to NEPA. In other words, the RAPID Act does nothing to address the lack of adequate funds allocated to Federal construction projects or State- based barriers to the timely completion of construction projects, which are two of the most common delays and have nothing to do with regulatory permits under NEPA. So, therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose this misguided legislation. [[Page H6210]] Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), a member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Goodlatte, Mr. Marino, and Mr. Smith for working on this important bill and bringing it to the House floor. Speeding up the regulatory process in the United States is an important issue in keeping America competitive. The methodical, slow, snail-paced decision or lack of decision process of the EPA to make a decision on whether or not to approve a project is absurd. The RAPID Act addresses the problem of extensive requirements and growing delays in Federal permitting and approvals for construction projects stemming from multiple agencies, excessive requirements, and unnecessary lawsuits. According to an April 2014 report issued by the GAO, the average preparation time for the required environmental impact statement finalized in 2012 was over 4\1/2\ years. Now, the environmental impact statement is just the first requirement in getting a permit. Four-and-a-half years--World War II took less time than it takes the EPA to make a decision on whether or not to approve a project. They just continue to study and study and study. Mr. Chair, it is about time for the EPA to pick a horse and ride it, make a decision about these projects. I am not going to talk in theory. I am going to talk about an actual project down in my congressional district. The Sabine-Neches Waterway, most Americans have never heard of it. The Sabine-Neches waterway is what some of us call ``the other Texas international border.'' It is the waterway between Louisiana and Texas. We have been wanting, since 1997, to deepen that 40-foot waterway to 48 feet. That is just 8 feet. We just want to make it a little deeper so ships can come in and off-load their cargo and off-load their fuel. What they are doing now, they can't come in with a full load of fuel on those tankers. They have to off-load it, sometimes 20 percent, in the Gulf of Mexico and then bring in the rest. That costs money. We just want 8 feet. So in 1997, my predecessors asked the EPA for an environmental impact statement and finally got that impact statement. It took 20 years to get an impact statement. I have had 11 grandkids since I have been in Congress, and that impact statement has been pending all that time. We just want 8 feet. Is it okay? The EPA finally made a decision, but yet we still haven't started moving dirt. The original project was about $600 million. Now, it is about $1.3 billion, and we still don't have that extra 8 feet. Why? Because the bureaucrats can't make a decision. Delay, delay, delay. That is the name of the EPA: Delay, Delay, Delay. All this bill does, it says to this bureaucracy, study the information, reach a conclusion, and approve the project if it ought to be approved so America can be competitive worldwide. But, no, the other side says: Well, we need more studies; we need more information. Mr. Chair, if Teddy Roosevelt would have had to deal with the EPA in building the Panama Canal, it would have never been built because of all the regulatory requirements--some unnecessary, in my opinion. So let's approve the RAPID Act. Let's get America working again. The Sabine-Neches Waterway has numerous refineries on it. It is the energy hub of the United States. We just want 8 feet, Mr. Chair. That is all we want. Pick a horse and ride it. The EPA needs to get their act together. And that is just the way it is. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Ted Lieu). Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Chair, I rise to oppose H.R. 348, also known as the RAPID Act. This bill will rapidly cause environmental degradation. Under this bill, if it became law, you could have projects that harm the environment that are deemed approved, even if the review process was not yet completed. That is crazy. Keep in mind, we have had over 60 straight months of job creation under the Obama administration. Those are the facts. This bill is written in such a way that it will cause confusion. It will cause increased delays and limit public involvement in this important process. It is also unscientific. There is a provision in this bill that says we cannot count the social cost of carbon. Now, I believe in a free market, and I believe that that has made America strong, but we can't have government artificially come in and say we are going to say things are costs and things are not costs when it is not scientifically based. We know that carbon has done a lot to increase climate change and caused global warming. That is why I, along with Representatives Peters, Polis, and Lowenthal, have introduced an amendment to put that language back in. We can't just say stop talking and ignore carbon. Keep in mind, just a few hours ago, Pope Francis came in to a joint session of Congress and told us to really revert and look at what we have done in terms of causing environmental degradation. {time} 1545 Now, just a few hours later, we are back to attacking the environment. This is not right. I urge that we not support the RAPID Act. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to myself to say to the gentleman from California that we may have 60 straight months of increased job creation, but the average American worker is making 5 percent less than they were before those 60 months began. The reason is that we are overregulating our economy. If we are really going to create jobs, we have got to have the infrastructure to do it. We have got to have the projects like were just described by Congressman Poe of Texas. Just 8 more feet of depth would bring a lot more jobs to east Texas and to Louisiana by being able to bring that product further up inland. These kind of projects require careful environmental assessment, but it doesn't require assessment that takes 20 years to take place. It should take place in a much more limited period of time. This bill helps to encourage focusing the mind on what needs to get done. That includes taking careful consideration of the environment, but it doesn't include delay, delay, delay. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Hardy), a member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Committee on Natural Resources, both of which understand the importance of these projects. Mr. HARDY. Mr. Chairman, before I had the privilege of being elected to the 114th Congress, I spent more than four decades in the construction industry. After growing up as a fifth-generation son of a farmer and rancher, I set out to learn the trades and acquire the skills that would one day allow me to support myself and my family. Over the course of those four decades in construction, I learned what it takes to start and run a successful business and how to create quality, good-paying jobs. I also learned the satisfaction of seeing the fruits of our labor in the roads, bridges, and dams we built and how they define the communities we serve. Mr. Chairman, small construction businesses like the one I used to own are struggling all across America from Federal bureaucracy that is rife with delays, duplication, and uncertainty. I can speak from firsthand experience about construction projects that have ground to a halt as resources are redirected to navigate the onerous NEPA process. On projects like the ones I used to manage, NEPA delays meant idled equipment, mass layoffs, and millions of dollars going towards compliance. These are sunk costs on the macro level and will continue to hold our economy back. We need to get smart about environment protection and to ensure that we do it in ways that allow businesses to thrive. H.R. 348, the RAPID Act, will go a long way toward achieving that goal. Mr. Chairman, at a time when our Nation's infrastructure is crumbling [[Page H6211]] and far too many are in search of quality employment, we have the responsibility to give manufacturers, construction workers, and other engines of economic growth the certainty they desperately need to create high-paying jobs. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the RAPID Act. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson), a distinguished member of our committee. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, my friend, Chairman Goodlatte, bemoaned the fact that, over the last 64 straight months of job growth under the Obama administration, wages have remained stagnant. That is true except for the wages of the top 10 percent, and specifically the top 1 percent, which have gone through the roof despite what he calls overregulation. We continue to have the problem of income disparity that Pope Francis mentioned today. It is unrelated to this issue of regulations which are there to protect people. They, in fact, protect people and they protect our environment. We have had a speaker today come in and talk about a dredging project that was delayed because of NEPA, but, actually, the truth of the matter is that that project was delayed due to lack of funding. Funding for the project was only authorized last year. While the Republicans in Congress sit around and talk about how much the regulatory agencies study and study and study, what we do in Congress is simply ignore the funding needs for infrastructure in this country, which is what that dredging project was all about. I have got a project down in Georgia, the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project, which was estimated to cost $652 million to complete. But prior to the passage of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act last year, the Federal Government had only provided $1.28 million--$1.28 million--less than 1 percent. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. LaMalfa). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, let's take it back to the year 2011 with the Ryan Budget Control Act, which imposed sequestration on the Federal Government, cutting both defense and nondefense spending 10 percent across the board. We can't have it both ways. If we are not going to fund, we have to admit that that is the reason these projects are not getting done. Don't blame it on NEPA. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Members of the committee, do not be misled by the title of this bill. Rather than effectuating real reforms to the process by which Federal agencies undertake environmental impact reviews, as required by the National Environmental Policy Act, this measure before us will actually result in making the process less responsible, less professional, and less accountable. These kinds of attempts are not new to this session of Congress. Accordingly, I urge that my colleagues carefully consider the discussion on this measure and oppose H.R. 348.

Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members and activists, we are writing to urge you to oppose H.R. 348 the misleadingly named ``Responsibly and Professionally Invigorating Development Act of 2015.'' Instead of improving the permitting process, the bill will severely undermine the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and, consequently, the quality and integrity of federal agency decisions. The National Environmental Policy Act plays a critical role in ensuring that projects are carried out in a transparent, collaborative, and responsible manner. NEPA simply requires federal agencies to assess the environmental, economic, and public health impacts of proposals, solicit the input of all affected stakeholders, and disclose their findings publicly before undertaking projects that may significantly affect the environment. Critically, NEPA recognizes that the public-- which includes industry, citizens, local and state governments, and business owners--can make important contributions by providing unique expertise. NEPA also gives a voice to the most impacted and underrepresented, especially to the most vulnerable communities who usually have to bear the most burden of where federal projects are proposed in the first place. However, H.R. 348 strikes at these core purposes of NEPA by systematically prioritizing speed of decisions and project approval over the public interest. Studies on the causes of delay in the permitting process reveal that the primary cause of delay is not the NEPA process. Rather, as multiple studies by the Government Accountability Office and the Congressional Research Service have pointed out, the principal causes of delay in permitting rest outside the NEPA process entirely and are attributable to other factors such as lack of funding, project complexity, and local opposition to the project. The RAPID Act ignores the true causes of delay, and instead, focuses on institutionalizing dangerous ``reforms'' that restrict public input, limit review of the environmental and economic impacts of projects, and that create more, not less, bureaucracy. Provisions in the RAPID Act, such as the following, will create more delays in permitting, result in less flexibility in the process, and tilt the entire permitting process towards shareholder interest, not the public interest. For example, the bill: Places Arbitrary Limitations on Environmental Reviews-- Section 560(i) of the bill threatens to undermine NEPA's goal of informed decision-making and the agency's role of acting in the public interest. It sets arbitrary deadlines on environmental reviews of permits, licenses, or other applications--regardless of the possible economic, health, or environmental impacts. Consequently, it puts communities at risk by promoting rushed and faulty decisions. Limits Consideration of Alternatives--Section 560(g) strikes at what CEQ regulations describe as ``the heart of the NEPA process'' by restricting the range of reasonable alternatives to be considered by an agency. Creates Serious Conflicts of Interests--Section 560(c) blurs the distinct roles of private entities and agencies in agency decisions by allowing private project sponsors with stakes in the decision to prepare environmental review documents which creates inherent conflicts of interest and thus jeopardizes the integrity of the decision-making process. Leading to Unanticipated Delays--The bill forces stakeholders into court preemptively simply to preserve their right to judicial review. The bill also limits the public's judicial access to challenge and address faulty environmental reviews which in turn is likely to increase the controversy and the amount of litigation derived from the permitting process which in turn could add to project delays. Denies the Impacts of Climate Change--Section 560(k) of the bill prohibits any considerations of the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), which the EPA and other federal agencies use to estimate the economic damages associated with specific projects and their related carbon dioxide emissions. The tool is critical for the public to understand the true benefits and costs of a project. Ignoring climate change puts critical infrastructure, tax payer dollars, and local communities at risk. Provisions such as these and many more in the RAPID Act will only serve to increase delay and confusion around the environmental review process. We believe compromising the quality of environmental review and limiting the role of the public is the wrong approach. Far from being broken, the National Environmental Policy Act has proven its worth as an invaluable tool. It ensures that the public, developers, and agencies have a reliable template for consistent and fair proposal assessment for major projects that may impact federal resources. The RAPID Act contradicts and jeopardizes decades of experience gained from enacting this critical environmental law. Further, it tips the balance away from informed decisions and public oversight, jeopardizing the public's ability to participate in how public resources will be managed. Please oppose this unnecessary and overreaching piece of legislation and vote ``no'' on the RAPID Act. [[Page H6212]] Although no amendment would remedy the problems with the underlying bill, we make the following vote recommendations on amendments offered to the RAPID Act. Vote no on Goodlatte (R-VA) #1--This amendment would prompt ill-informed decisions by limiting the role of cooperating agencies in the environmental review process. It would also severely limit the public's ability to use the courts their rights by requiring eventual plaintiffs to participate in drastically shortened comment periods and administrative proceedings that, in many cases, agencies do not provide. Vote yes on Peters (D-CA) #2--This amendment ensures that the true impacts of climate change are considered by allowing agencies to consider the social costs of carbon when conducting environmental reviews. Agencies should be free to incorporate the social cost of carbon into the agency decision making process, which will result in better informed and responsible decisions that safely invest taxpayer dollars by taking into account climate change, the fundamental environmental issue of our time. Vote yes on Jackson Lee (D-TX) #3--This amendment will undo one of the more pernicious provisions in the H.R. 348 which, in cases where an agency fails to meet arbitrary deadlines prescribed by the bill, projects are simply deemed approved regardless of their economic, health, or environmental impacts. The bill, without this amendment, puts communities at risk by green-lighting projects without fully considering environmental impacts or the opinions of those who will be impacted the most. Vote yes on Jackson Lee (D-TX) #4--This amendment maintains national security by undoing hasty shortcuts in the permitting process and rightly ensuring a full review for projects that could be potential targets for terrorist attacks. This amendment wisely ensures that shortcutting critical federal review of projects does not apply those projects that most need informed decisions because of the tremendous impacts they may have on our national security. Vote yes on Johnson (D-GA) #5--This amendment rightly ensures that nothing in the bill will limit input of affected stakeholders, local governments, private property owners, or business owners. Vote yes on Dingell (D-MI) #6--This amendment would prevent project approvals under the arbitrary timelines set forth in the bill if the project under consideration would limit access to or opportunities for hunting or fishing or would impact threatened or endangered species. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, wildlife related recreation contributes more than $140 billion dollars to the U.S. economy and supports thousands of jobs connected to fishing, hunting, and the observance of wildlife. Vote yes on Gallego (D-AZ) #8--This amendment preserves meaningful input by local governments and tribal officials on projects affecting their communities by allowing them to request extensions of the arbitrary deadlines in the bill. Vote yes on Grijalva (D-AZ) #9--The shortcutting of meaningful public input and review of a project's impacts under the RAPID Act could potentially lead to disproportionate impacts on low-income communities and communities of color. This amendment ensures such impacts are carefully addressed during the review of project alternatives. Vote yes on Lowenthal (D-CA) #10--The truncated review procedures under the RAPID Act would potentially apply to construction projects of enormous size, scope, and complexity. Climate change poses severe threats to the health, safety, and economies of local communities through the increased risks of floods, fire and severe weather. This amendment ensures federal agencies consider these impacts and construct projects that are resilient to the impacts of climate change. Vote no on Gosar (R-AZ) #11--This amendment would broaden one of the most damaging provisions of the bill which prevents Federal agencies from considering the true costs of climate change, putting communities and tax-payer dollars at risk. Whatever the outcome of these amendments, we urge a no vote on final passage.

Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, first, to the gentleman from Georgia, let me just say that the Water Resources Development Act, which passed this House, has in it the same streamlining provisions of the permitting processes for the projects that it would fund that are based on the ideas in this bill. Why? Because we know that, just because we come up with the funds for something, those funds can be churned and churned and churned year after year after year in the permitting process and never ever get to a permit so the underlying construction can take place in Texas or Savannah, Georgia, or Virginia, or all of the other places where infrastructure projects are needed. Part of the enormous cost of it is the enormous process that we go through and the length of that process and the review and review and review that never gets to a decision. During the debate over this bill this term and last, we have heard several false alarms from my friends on the other side of the aisle. For example, we have heard that the bill does not allow enough time for environmental reviews to be completed. But, with all due respect, the bill, when necessary, allows as much time for the completion of an environmental impact statement as it took our Nation to win World War II. Surely that is time enough. We have heard that the bill will generate more litigation because there may be litigation over what its new terms mean, but that argument can be made against any reform legislation. If it were a valid and sufficient reason to defeat legislation, we would never pass another reform bill. Furthermore, the bill for the first time requires litigants to present their claims to permit agencies before they sue in court and to file lawsuits no later than 180 days after the agency's final decisions. That will reduce litigation, not increase it. We have also heard that the White House has threatened to veto the bill. Mr. Chairman, that is what is truly alarming. This legislation fulfills the calls of the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness to streamline the review of Federal permit applications. We are doing that in this legislation. It creates shovel-ready projects, which even President Obama claims would create jobs. In fact, it would generate millions of high-paying, good jobs for our Nation's workers and families, who so desperately need them. It would raise the standard of living of Americans. The White House should not be issuing threats to veto the legislation. The White House should be running to lend its support to this bill. [[Page H6213]] Ignore the false alarms and embrace the commonsense reforms in this bill. Pass the RAPID Act, call the President's bluff, give the Nation shovel-ready projects. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Hardy), having assumed the chair, Mr. LaMalfa, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 348) to provide for improved coordination of agency actions in the preparation and adoption of environmental documents for permitting determinations, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6207-H6213] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RESPONSIBLY AND PROFESSIONALLY INVIGORATING DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2015 General Leave Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 348. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Virginia? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 420 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 348. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. {time} 1514 In the Committee of the Whole Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 348) to provide for improved coordination of agency actions in the preparation and adoption of environmental documents for permitting determinations, and for other purposes, with Mr. Duncan of Tennessee in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia. {time} 1515 Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. America's voters sent the 114th Congress to Washington to help turn around this Nation's struggling economy. For more than 6\1/2\ long years, America's families and workers have been waiting for the Obama administration to join with Congress to pass measures that will adequately restore jobs and growth to our land. The job clearly has not been finished. Throughout the Obama administration, America's growth rate has been historically anemic. The truest measure of unemployment--the rate that includes both discouraged workers and those who cannot find a full-time job--remains over 10 percent. Our labor force participation rate remains mired among historic lows. Median real household income, meanwhile, is 5 percent lower than in June 2009, when the recession officially ended. Median incomes are supposed to rise during economic recoveries, not fall. The Obama administration has managed to buck the historical trend. However, the President at least pays lip service to the need to unleash construction projects. If one thinks back [[Page H6208]] to the start of the Obama administration, one can remember President Obama's plan to solve the Great Recession with the nearly $1 trillion stimulus bill. The stimulus was supposed to work, according to the President, because America had shovel-ready projects from which new, good-paying jobs would be created once the stimulus was enacted and the money was doled out. While many, including myself, disagreed with the fundamental premise of the stimulus bill, the President blamed his stimulus bill's failure on the lack of shovel-ready projects. As he put it, ``Shovel-ready was not as shovel-ready as we expected.'' Mr. Chairman, that is the problem that today's legislation--the RAPID Act--is intended to solve. This legislation fulfills post-stimulus bill calls of leaders in Congress, the White House, the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, and the private sector to streamline the review of Federal construction permit applications. It contains well-thought-out, balanced reforms that provide for more efficient and effective decision-making. Stated succinctly, the RAPID Act gives lead Federal agencies more responsibility to conduct and conclude efficient interagency reviews of permit requests, demands that any entity challenging a final permitting decision in court first have presented the substance of its claims during the agency review process, and requires that lawsuits challenging permitting decisions be filed within 6 months of the decisions, not 6 years, as the law currently allows. These are simple, but powerful, reforms that will allow good projects to move forward more quickly, delivering high-quality jobs and improvements to Americans' daily lives. Prior iterations of the RAPID Act passed the House three times during the 112th and 113th Congresses, each time with bipartisan support. Once enacted, this legislation will help to create millions of high- paying jobs and make government decision-making more efficient and effective. Importantly, it will also continue to ensure that the impacts of new projects on the environment can be considered responsibly before permitting decisions are made. I thank Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law Subcommittee Chairman Marino of Pennsylvania for introducing this legislation. I urge all of my colleagues to vote for the RAPID Act. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. My colleagues, I rise in rather strong opposition to the measure before us, H.R. 348, the Responsibly and Professionally Invigorating Development Act of 2015, or its nickname, the RAPID Act. H.R. 348 has a number of flaws. I won't try to go into each and every one of them. Most critically, this measure would jeopardize public safety and health by prioritizing project approval over meaningful analysis that is currently required under the National Environmental Policy Act. By giving the proponents of construction projects greater control over the environmental approval process, this bill is the equivalent of giving Wall Street the authority to write its own regulations for financial responsibility. The bill accomplishes this result in several respects. To begin with, under the guise of streamlining the approval process, H.R. 348 forecloses potentially critical input from Federal, State, and local agencies, as well as from members of the public, to comment on environmentally sensitive construction projects that are federally funded or that require Federal approval. The bill also imposes hard and fast deadlines that may be unrealistic under certain circumstances. Moreover, if an agency fails to meet these unrealistic deadlines, the bill simply declares that a project must be deemed approved regardless of whether the agency has thoroughly assessed the task. This is an embarrassment, my friends. As a result, H.R. 348 could allow projects that put public health and safety at risk to be approved before the safety review is completed. This failing of the bill, along with some others, explains why the administration and the President's Council on Environmental Quality, along with more than 40 respected environmental groups, vigorously oppose this legislation before us today. These organizations include Public Citizen, the League of Conservation Voters, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club, and The Wilderness Society. Likewise, the administration has appropriately issued a veto threat. Stating that the bill will increase litigation, regulatory delays, and potentially force agencies to approve a project if the review and analysis cannot be completed before the proposed arbitrary deadlines, the administration warns that, if H.R. 348 ever became law, it would lead to more confusion and delay, limit public participation in the permitting process, and, ultimately, hamper economic growth. Another concern, among many, that I have with this measure is that it is a flawed solution in search of an imaginary problem, and that is not just my opinion. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, for instance, states that highway construction project delays based on environmental requirements stem not from the National Environmental Policy Act, but from laws other than the National Environmental Policy Act. In fact, the Congressional Research Service found that the primary source of approval delays for these projects are more often tied to local or State and project-specific factors, primarily local or State agency priorities, project funding levels, local opposition to a project, project complexity, or late changes in project scope. Undoubtedly, the so-called RAPID Act will make the process less clear and less protective of public health and safety. My final major concern with this bill is that, rather than streamlining the environmental review process, which we need to do, it will sow utter confusion. H.R. 348 does this by creating a separate, but only partly parallel, environmental review process for construction projects, which will cause confusion, delay, and litigation. As I have noted, the changes to the National Environmental Policy Act's review process, as contemplated by the measure before us today, apply only to certain construction projects. The National Environmental Policy Act, on the other hand, applies to a broad panoply of Federal actions, including fishing, hunting, and grazing permits, land management plans, Base Realignment and Closure activities, and treaties. As a result of the bill, there could potentially be two different environmental review processes for the same project. For instance, the bill's requirements would apply to the construction of a nuclear reactor, but not to its decommissioning or to the transportation and storage of its spent fuel. Rather than improving the environmental review process, the measure before us will complicate it and generate more litigation. More importantly, this bill is yet another effort by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to undermine regulatory protections. As with all of the other regulatory bills, this measure is a thinly disguised effort to hobble the ability of Federal agencies to do the work the Congress requires that it does. For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to strenuously oppose this seriously flawed bill. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino), the chief sponsor of this legislation and the chairman of the Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law Subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary. Mr. MARINO. I thank the chairman. Mr. Chairman, once again, my good friends on the other side think we need more government, more EPA overreach, more regulation, to continue the $19 trillion of debt that we have and to continue the flawed job opportunities of this administration's over the past 6 years. Once again, today we consider the RAPID Act. As the gentleman from Virginia stated, during the 112th and [[Page H6209]] 113th Congresses, the House passed this bill on three separate occasions in a bipartisan fashion. Once again, we are considering a number of important regulatory reforms that present the potential for immediately impactful economic growth across our Nation. Our Federal permitting process is undeniably broken. Duplicative environmental reviews have clogged decision-making for years. Although recent studies have shown that, on average, an environmental impact study will take 3 to 4 years, the permitting process for many projects takes years more or, sadly, even decades. Even more disappointing are indications that average environmental review times are increasing by over a month per year. Furthermore, final decision-making has been driven by political whims rather than by the merits of any particular project that would be borne through economic growth and job creation. Political pressure should never impede projects of worth that would get Americans back to work. One recent study found that 7 years of delay on the Keystone pipeline have kept us from realizing nearly $175 billion in potential economic activity. At a time when true economic recovery lags and more Americans become disheartened and leave the workforce, such delays are unacceptable. The RAPID Act reforms remove government obstructions from the equation by implementing hard deadlines for environmental review, and they shorten the window for judicial review. It doesn't take review away. It shortens it to a reasonable period of time. We cannot delay while our infrastructure--from highways and bridges to transmission lines and waterways--crumbles around us in America's counties, towns, and cities. I look forward to working with our colleagues in the Senate to bring this bill to the President's desk, and I hope that we can get this country working again. Federal agencies and departments and employees have to be held accountable just like we are in private industry. They cannot sit back and let these permits and these issues stack up on their desks while they play games on their computers. I have hope that we can get this bill through and the country working again. Please support the RAPID Act. {time} 1530 Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chair, I yield 8 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson), the ranking subcommittee member. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 348, the Responsibly and Professionally Invigorating Development Act, or the RAPID Act. But if I had my druthers, I would change it to the ``Responsibly and Professionally Invigorating Diversion Act,'' or RAPID Act. I would say that it is a diversion because we have got important work to do in this Chamber, Mr. Chair. Everybody knows that we are approaching the end of the fiscal year. It will be here in 6 short days. During this whole month of September--we are at September 24 today-- we have had a total of 8 legislative days during this month, knowing that we are coming up to the end of the fiscal year and we need to pass a spending bill to keep the government open and operating. We have been knowing this. We spent 6 weeks in August, from July to September, a total of about 6 weeks at home lounging while the Nation's business in Washington, D.C., went undone. We have spent a total of 8 legislative days out of the 24 days in September doing everything other than addressing the looming issue, which is the coming, or impending, government shutdown. Now, we are here today. We just took one vote. This is the first legislative day of this week. We have got one business day left. The first legislative day, after hearing from the Pope, we have just had our last vote for the day. It was our one and only vote for the day, and it was to rename a post office. We are coming up on the government shutdown, and what are we dealing with? Instead of dealing with the Nation's finances, we are dealing with this RAPID Act, which, as I said, is a diversion from the real duty that we need to be taking care of today. H.R. 348, the RAPID Act, is a misguided attempt to sow widespread confusion and delay in the review and permitting process under the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. For over 40 years, the approval process for projects under NEPA has saved time, money, and protected the environment, which the Pope spoke of our need to protect today. In fact, since NEPA was enacted, the U.S. economy has not contracted. It has actually tripled in size from just over $5 trillion to more than $16 trillion. Among other things, NEPA requires agencies to prepare a detailed environmental review for proposals relating to ``major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.'' NEPA's purpose is to provide a framework for wide-ranging input from all affected interests when a Federal agency conducts an environmental review of a proposed project. H.R. 348, the so-called RAPID Act, upends this review process in three ways: First, H.R. 348 carves out a separate environmental review process for construction projects. Currently, NEPA applies to a broad range of Federal projects, including hunting permits, land management plans, military base realignment and closure activities, and treaties. In contrast, H.R. 348 only applies to a subset of these Federal projects, creating more regulatory complexity in the permitting system, not less. Second, section (c) of the RAPID Act allows any project sponsor to prepare an environmental document in lieu of such analysis by the lead agency. It is not difficult to imagine the shortcomings of allowing corporations, which seek to maximize shareholder value, to sit in the driver's seat on environmental policy. In fact, that is why we have such environmental degradation today. During a legislative hearing on H.R. 348, Amit Narang, a regulatory policy advocate for Public Citizen, compared section (c) to ``asking big banks to determine the costs and benefits of new Wall Street reform rules, or big energy companies to determine the costs and benefits of new climate change or air pollution measures.'' The inherent conflict of interest built into this section reveals the bill's clear design to allow project sponsors to manipulate the NEPA permit approval process to the greatest extent possible. It is clear that not only does this Republican bill task the fox with guarding the henhouse, it would also have him install the chicken wire as well. Finally, under section (i) of H.R. 348, if an agency fails to meet the unrealistic deadlines mandated by H.R. 348, the bill would automatically green-light a Federal construction project, regardless of whether or not the agency has thoroughly reviewed the project's risks. Even if I were to set aside these concerns, it is difficult for me to look past the complete lack of empirical data supporting the premise of the RAPID Act, which is that agency compliance with NEPA is the cause of delays in approving permits. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service reported in 2012 that project approval delays based on environmental requirements are not caused by NEPA, but ``are more often tied to local/State and project- specific factors, primarily local/State agency priorities, project funding levels, local opposition to a project, project complexity, or late changes in project scope.'' Similarly, Dinah Bear, who served as the general counsel for the White House Council on Environmental Quality which oversees NEPA's implementation, for over 20 years under both Republican and Democratic administrations, testified in the 112th Congress that most delays in the environmental review process are not the result of NEPA, but due to other factors entirely unrelated to NEPA. In other words, the RAPID Act does nothing to address the lack of adequate funds allocated to Federal construction projects or State- based barriers to the timely completion of construction projects, which are two of the most common delays and have nothing to do with regulatory permits under NEPA. So, therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose this misguided legislation. [[Page H6210]] Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), a member of the Judiciary Committee. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Goodlatte, Mr. Marino, and Mr. Smith for working on this important bill and bringing it to the House floor. Speeding up the regulatory process in the United States is an important issue in keeping America competitive. The methodical, slow, snail-paced decision or lack of decision process of the EPA to make a decision on whether or not to approve a project is absurd. The RAPID Act addresses the problem of extensive requirements and growing delays in Federal permitting and approvals for construction projects stemming from multiple agencies, excessive requirements, and unnecessary lawsuits. According to an April 2014 report issued by the GAO, the average preparation time for the required environmental impact statement finalized in 2012 was over 4\1/2\ years. Now, the environmental impact statement is just the first requirement in getting a permit. Four-and-a-half years--World War II took less time than it takes the EPA to make a decision on whether or not to approve a project. They just continue to study and study and study. Mr. Chair, it is about time for the EPA to pick a horse and ride it, make a decision about these projects. I am not going to talk in theory. I am going to talk about an actual project down in my congressional district. The Sabine-Neches Waterway, most Americans have never heard of it. The Sabine-Neches waterway is what some of us call ``the other Texas international border.'' It is the waterway between Louisiana and Texas. We have been wanting, since 1997, to deepen that 40-foot waterway to 48 feet. That is just 8 feet. We just want to make it a little deeper so ships can come in and off-load their cargo and off-load their fuel. What they are doing now, they can't come in with a full load of fuel on those tankers. They have to off-load it, sometimes 20 percent, in the Gulf of Mexico and then bring in the rest. That costs money. We just want 8 feet. So in 1997, my predecessors asked the EPA for an environmental impact statement and finally got that impact statement. It took 20 years to get an impact statement. I have had 11 grandkids since I have been in Congress, and that impact statement has been pending all that time. We just want 8 feet. Is it okay? The EPA finally made a decision, but yet we still haven't started moving dirt. The original project was about $600 million. Now, it is about $1.3 billion, and we still don't have that extra 8 feet. Why? Because the bureaucrats can't make a decision. Delay, delay, delay. That is the name of the EPA: Delay, Delay, Delay. All this bill does, it says to this bureaucracy, study the information, reach a conclusion, and approve the project if it ought to be approved so America can be competitive worldwide. But, no, the other side says: Well, we need more studies; we need more information. Mr. Chair, if Teddy Roosevelt would have had to deal with the EPA in building the Panama Canal, it would have never been built because of all the regulatory requirements--some unnecessary, in my opinion. So let's approve the RAPID Act. Let's get America working again. The Sabine-Neches Waterway has numerous refineries on it. It is the energy hub of the United States. We just want 8 feet, Mr. Chair. That is all we want. Pick a horse and ride it. The EPA needs to get their act together. And that is just the way it is. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Ted Lieu). Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Chair, I rise to oppose H.R. 348, also known as the RAPID Act. This bill will rapidly cause environmental degradation. Under this bill, if it became law, you could have projects that harm the environment that are deemed approved, even if the review process was not yet completed. That is crazy. Keep in mind, we have had over 60 straight months of job creation under the Obama administration. Those are the facts. This bill is written in such a way that it will cause confusion. It will cause increased delays and limit public involvement in this important process. It is also unscientific. There is a provision in this bill that says we cannot count the social cost of carbon. Now, I believe in a free market, and I believe that that has made America strong, but we can't have government artificially come in and say we are going to say things are costs and things are not costs when it is not scientifically based. We know that carbon has done a lot to increase climate change and caused global warming. That is why I, along with Representatives Peters, Polis, and Lowenthal, have introduced an amendment to put that language back in. We can't just say stop talking and ignore carbon. Keep in mind, just a few hours ago, Pope Francis came in to a joint session of Congress and told us to really revert and look at what we have done in terms of causing environmental degradation. {time} 1545 Now, just a few hours later, we are back to attacking the environment. This is not right. I urge that we not support the RAPID Act. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to myself to say to the gentleman from California that we may have 60 straight months of increased job creation, but the average American worker is making 5 percent less than they were before those 60 months began. The reason is that we are overregulating our economy. If we are really going to create jobs, we have got to have the infrastructure to do it. We have got to have the projects like were just described by Congressman Poe of Texas. Just 8 more feet of depth would bring a lot more jobs to east Texas and to Louisiana by being able to bring that product further up inland. These kind of projects require careful environmental assessment, but it doesn't require assessment that takes 20 years to take place. It should take place in a much more limited period of time. This bill helps to encourage focusing the mind on what needs to get done. That includes taking careful consideration of the environment, but it doesn't include delay, delay, delay. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Hardy), a member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Committee on Natural Resources, both of which understand the importance of these projects. Mr. HARDY. Mr. Chairman, before I had the privilege of being elected to the 114th Congress, I spent more than four decades in the construction industry. After growing up as a fifth-generation son of a farmer and rancher, I set out to learn the trades and acquire the skills that would one day allow me to support myself and my family. Over the course of those four decades in construction, I learned what it takes to start and run a successful business and how to create quality, good-paying jobs. I also learned the satisfaction of seeing the fruits of our labor in the roads, bridges, and dams we built and how they define the communities we serve. Mr. Chairman, small construction businesses like the one I used to own are struggling all across America from Federal bureaucracy that is rife with delays, duplication, and uncertainty. I can speak from firsthand experience about construction projects that have ground to a halt as resources are redirected to navigate the onerous NEPA process. On projects like the ones I used to manage, NEPA delays meant idled equipment, mass layoffs, and millions of dollars going towards compliance. These are sunk costs on the macro level and will continue to hold our economy back. We need to get smart about environment protection and to ensure that we do it in ways that allow businesses to thrive. H.R. 348, the RAPID Act, will go a long way toward achieving that goal. Mr. Chairman, at a time when our Nation's infrastructure is crumbling [[Page H6211]] and far too many are in search of quality employment, we have the responsibility to give manufacturers, construction workers, and other engines of economic growth the certainty they desperately need to create high-paying jobs. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the RAPID Act. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson), a distinguished member of our committee. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, my friend, Chairman Goodlatte, bemoaned the fact that, over the last 64 straight months of job growth under the Obama administration, wages have remained stagnant. That is true except for the wages of the top 10 percent, and specifically the top 1 percent, which have gone through the roof despite what he calls overregulation. We continue to have the problem of income disparity that Pope Francis mentioned today. It is unrelated to this issue of regulations which are there to protect people. They, in fact, protect people and they protect our environment. We have had a speaker today come in and talk about a dredging project that was delayed because of NEPA, but, actually, the truth of the matter is that that project was delayed due to lack of funding. Funding for the project was only authorized last year. While the Republicans in Congress sit around and talk about how much the regulatory agencies study and study and study, what we do in Congress is simply ignore the funding needs for infrastructure in this country, which is what that dredging project was all about. I have got a project down in Georgia, the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project, which was estimated to cost $652 million to complete. But prior to the passage of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act last year, the Federal Government had only provided $1.28 million--$1.28 million--less than 1 percent. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. LaMalfa). The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, let's take it back to the year 2011 with the Ryan Budget Control Act, which imposed sequestration on the Federal Government, cutting both defense and nondefense spending 10 percent across the board. We can't have it both ways. If we are not going to fund, we have to admit that that is the reason these projects are not getting done. Don't blame it on NEPA. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Members of the committee, do not be misled by the title of this bill. Rather than effectuating real reforms to the process by which Federal agencies undertake environmental impact reviews, as required by the National Environmental Policy Act, this measure before us will actually result in making the process less responsible, less professional, and less accountable. These kinds of attempts are not new to this session of Congress. Accordingly, I urge that my colleagues carefully consider the discussion on this measure and oppose H.R. 348.

Union of Concerned Scientists, Western Environmental Law Center, The Wilderness Society. ____ September 17, 2015. Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members and activists, we are writing to urge you to oppose H.R. 348 the misleadingly named ``Responsibly and Professionally Invigorating Development Act of 2015.'' Instead of improving the permitting process, the bill will severely undermine the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and, consequently, the quality and integrity of federal agency decisions. The National Environmental Policy Act plays a critical role in ensuring that projects are carried out in a transparent, collaborative, and responsible manner. NEPA simply requires federal agencies to assess the environmental, economic, and public health impacts of proposals, solicit the input of all affected stakeholders, and disclose their findings publicly before undertaking projects that may significantly affect the environment. Critically, NEPA recognizes that the public-- which includes industry, citizens, local and state governments, and business owners--can make important contributions by providing unique expertise. NEPA also gives a voice to the most impacted and underrepresented, especially to the most vulnerable communities who usually have to bear the most burden of where federal projects are proposed in the first place. However, H.R. 348 strikes at these core purposes of NEPA by systematically prioritizing speed of decisions and project approval over the public interest. Studies on the causes of delay in the permitting process reveal that the primary cause of delay is not the NEPA process. Rather, as multiple studies by the Government Accountability Office and the Congressional Research Service have pointed out, the principal causes of delay in permitting rest outside the NEPA process entirely and are attributable to other factors such as lack of funding, project complexity, and local opposition to the project. The RAPID Act ignores the true causes of delay, and instead, focuses on institutionalizing dangerous ``reforms'' that restrict public input, limit review of the environmental and economic impacts of projects, and that create more, not less, bureaucracy. Provisions in the RAPID Act, such as the following, will create more delays in permitting, result in less flexibility in the process, and tilt the entire permitting process towards shareholder interest, not the public interest. For example, the bill: Places Arbitrary Limitations on Environmental Reviews-- Section 560(i) of the bill threatens to undermine NEPA's goal of informed decision-making and the agency's role of acting in the public interest. It sets arbitrary deadlines on environmental reviews of permits, licenses, or other applications--regardless of the possible economic, health, or environmental impacts. Consequently, it puts communities at risk by promoting rushed and faulty decisions. Limits Consideration of Alternatives--Section 560(g) strikes at what CEQ regulations describe as ``the heart of the NEPA process'' by restricting the range of reasonable alternatives to be considered by an agency. Creates Serious Conflicts of Interests--Section 560(c) blurs the distinct roles of private entities and agencies in agency decisions by allowing private project sponsors with stakes in the decision to prepare environmental review documents which creates inherent conflicts of interest and thus jeopardizes the integrity of the decision-making process. Leading to Unanticipated Delays--The bill forces stakeholders into court preemptively simply to preserve their right to judicial review. The bill also limits the public's judicial access to challenge and address faulty environmental reviews which in turn is likely to increase the controversy and the amount of litigation derived from the permitting process which in turn could add to project delays. Denies the Impacts of Climate Change--Section 560(k) of the bill prohibits any considerations of the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), which the EPA and other federal agencies use to estimate the economic damages associated with specific projects and their related carbon dioxide emissions. The tool is critical for the public to understand the true benefits and costs of a project. Ignoring climate change puts critical infrastructure, tax payer dollars, and local communities at risk. Provisions such as these and many more in the RAPID Act will only serve to increase delay and confusion around the environmental review process. We believe compromising the quality of environmental review and limiting the role of the public is the wrong approach. Far from being broken, the National Environmental Policy Act has proven its worth as an invaluable tool. It ensures that the public, developers, and agencies have a reliable template for consistent and fair proposal assessment for major projects that may impact federal resources. The RAPID Act contradicts and jeopardizes decades of experience gained from enacting this critical environmental law. Further, it tips the balance away from informed decisions and public oversight, jeopardizing the public's ability to participate in how public resources will be managed. Please oppose this unnecessary and overreaching piece of legislation and vote ``no'' on the RAPID Act. [[Page H6212]] Although no amendment would remedy the problems with the underlying bill, we make the following vote recommendations on amendments offered to the RAPID Act. Vote no on Goodlatte (R-VA) #1--This amendment would prompt ill-informed decisions by limiting the role of cooperating agencies in the environmental review process. It would also severely limit the public's ability to use the courts their rights by requiring eventual plaintiffs to participate in drastically shortened comment periods and administrative proceedings that, in many cases, agencies do not provide. Vote yes on Peters (D-CA) #2--This amendment ensures that the true impacts of climate change are considered by allowing agencies to consider the social costs of carbon when conducting environmental reviews. Agencies should be free to incorporate the social cost of carbon into the agency decision making process, which will result in better informed and responsible decisions that safely invest taxpayer dollars by taking into account climate change, the fundamental environmental issue of our time. Vote yes on Jackson Lee (D-TX) #3--This amendment will undo one of the more pernicious provisions in the H.R. 348 which, in cases where an agency fails to meet arbitrary deadlines prescribed by the bill, projects are simply deemed approved regardless of their economic, health, or environmental impacts. The bill, without this amendment, puts communities at risk by green-lighting projects without fully considering environmental impacts or the opinions of those who will be impacted the most. Vote yes on Jackson Lee (D-TX) #4--This amendment maintains national security by undoing hasty shortcuts in the permitting process and rightly ensuring a full review for projects that could be potential targets for terrorist attacks. This amendment wisely ensures that shortcutting critical federal review of projects does not apply those projects that most need informed decisions because of the tremendous impacts they may have on our national security. Vote yes on Johnson (D-GA) #5--This amendment rightly ensures that nothing in the bill will limit input of affected stakeholders, local governments, private property owners, or business owners. Vote yes on Dingell (D-MI) #6--This amendment would prevent project approvals under the arbitrary timelines set forth in the bill if the project under consideration would limit access to or opportunities for hunting or fishing or would impact threatened or endangered species. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, wildlife related recreation contributes more than $140 billion dollars to the U.S. economy and supports thousands of jobs connected to fishing, hunting, and the observance of wildlife. Vote yes on Gallego (D-AZ) #8--This amendment preserves meaningful input by local governments and tribal officials on projects affecting their communities by allowing them to request extensions of the arbitrary deadlines in the bill. Vote yes on Grijalva (D-AZ) #9--The shortcutting of meaningful public input and review of a project's impacts under the RAPID Act could potentially lead to disproportionate impacts on low-income communities and communities of color. This amendment ensures such impacts are carefully addressed during the review of project alternatives. Vote yes on Lowenthal (D-CA) #10--The truncated review procedures under the RAPID Act would potentially apply to construction projects of enormous size, scope, and complexity. Climate change poses severe threats to the health, safety, and economies of local communities through the increased risks of floods, fire and severe weather. This amendment ensures federal agencies consider these impacts and construct projects that are resilient to the impacts of climate change. Vote no on Gosar (R-AZ) #11--This amendment would broaden one of the most damaging provisions of the bill which prevents Federal agencies from considering the true costs of climate change, putting communities and tax-payer dollars at risk. Whatever the outcome of these amendments, we urge a no vote on final passage.

Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, first, to the gentleman from Georgia, let me just say that the Water Resources Development Act, which passed this House, has in it the same streamlining provisions of the permitting processes for the projects that it would fund that are based on the ideas in this bill. Why? Because we know that, just because we come up with the funds for something, those funds can be churned and churned and churned year after year after year in the permitting process and never ever get to a permit so the underlying construction can take place in Texas or Savannah, Georgia, or Virginia, or all of the other places where infrastructure projects are needed. Part of the enormous cost of it is the enormous process that we go through and the length of that process and the review and review and review that never gets to a decision. During the debate over this bill this term and last, we have heard several false alarms from my friends on the other side of the aisle. For example, we have heard that the bill does not allow enough time for environmental reviews to be completed. But, with all due respect, the bill, when necessary, allows as much time for the completion of an environmental impact statement as it took our Nation to win World War II. Surely that is time enough. We have heard that the bill will generate more litigation because there may be litigation over what its new terms mean, but that argument can be made against any reform legislation. If it were a valid and sufficient reason to defeat legislation, we would never pass another reform bill. Furthermore, the bill for the first time requires litigants to present their claims to permit agencies before they sue in court and to file lawsuits no later than 180 days after the agency's final decisions. That will reduce litigation, not increase it. We have also heard that the White House has threatened to veto the bill. Mr. Chairman, that is what is truly alarming. This legislation fulfills the calls of the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness to streamline the review of Federal permit applications. We are doing that in this legislation. It creates shovel-ready projects, which even President Obama claims would create jobs. In fact, it would generate millions of high-paying, good jobs for our Nation's workers and families, who so desperately need them. It would raise the standard of living of Americans. The White House should not be issuing threats to veto the legislation. The White House should be running to lend its support to this bill. [[Page H6213]] Ignore the false alarms and embrace the commonsense reforms in this bill. Pass the RAPID Act, call the President's bluff, give the Nation shovel-ready projects. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Hardy), having assumed the chair, Mr. LaMalfa, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 348) to provide for improved coordination of agency actions in the preparation and adoption of environmental documents for permitting determinations, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon. ____________________",package_114_55.csv,46671,46671,46745,"[congressional record volume 161, number 138 (thursday, september

time as i may consume. america's voters sent the 114th congress to washington to help turn around this nation's struggling economy. for more than 6\1/2\ long years, america's families and workers have been waiting for the obama administration to join with congress to pass measures that will adequately restore jobs and growth to our land. the job clearly has not been finished. throughout the obama administration, america's growth rate has been historically anemic. the truest measure of unemployment--the rate that includes both discouraged workers and those who cannot find a full-time job--remains over 10 percent. our labor force participation rate remains mired among historic lows. median real household income, meanwhile, is 5 percent lower than in june 2009, when the recession officially ended. median incomes are supposed to rise during economic recoveries, not fall. the obama administration has managed to buck the historical trend. however, the president at least pays lip service to the need to unleash construction projects. if one thinks back [[page h6208]] to the start of the obama administration, one can remember president obama's plan to solve the great recession with the nearly $1 trillion stimulus bill. the stimulus was supposed to work, according to the president, because america had shovel-ready projects from which new, good-paying jobs would be created once the stimulus was enacted and the money was doled out. while many, including myself, disagreed with the fundamental premise of the stimulus bill, the president blamed his stimulus bill's failure on the lack of shovel-ready projects. as he put it, ``shovel-ready was not as shovel-ready as we expected.'' mr. chairman, that is the problem that today's legislation--the rapid act--is intended to solve. this legislation fulfills post-stimulus bill calls of leaders in congress, the white house, the president's council on jobs and competitiveness, and the private sector to streamline the review of federal construction permit applications. it contains well-thought-out, balanced reforms that provide for more efficient and effective decision-making. stated succinctly, the rapid act gives lead federal agencies more responsibility to conduct and conclude efficient interagency reviews of permit requests, demands that any entity challenging a final permitting decision in court first have presented the substance of its claims during the agency review process, and requires that lawsuits challenging permitting decisions be filed within 6 months of the decisions, not 6 years, as the law currently allows. these are simple, but powerful, reforms that will allow good projects to move forward more quickly, delivering high-quality jobs and improvements to americans' daily lives. prior iterations of the rapid act passed the house three times during the 112th and 113th congresses, each time with bipartisan support. once enacted, this legislation will help to create millions of high- paying jobs and make government decision-making more efficient and effective. importantly, it will also continue to ensure that the impacts of new projects on the environment can be considered responsibly before permitting decisions are made. i thank regulatory reform, commercial and antitrust law subcommittee chairman marino of pennsylvania for introducing this legislation. i urge all of my colleagues to vote for the rapid act. mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. conyers. mr. chairman, i yield myself such time as i may consume. my colleagues, i rise in rather strong opposition to the measure before us, h.r. 348, the responsibly and professionally invigorating development act of 2015, or its nickname, the rapid act. h.r. 348 has a number of flaws. i won't try to go into each and every one of them. most critically, this measure would jeopardize public safety and health by prioritizing project approval over meaningful analysis that is currently required under the national environmental policy act. by giving the proponents of construction projects greater control over the environmental approval process, this bill is the equivalent of giving wall street the authority to write its own regulations for financial responsibility. the bill accomplishes this result in several respects. to begin with, under the guise of streamlining the approval process, h.r. 348 forecloses potentially critical input from federal, state, and local agencies, as well as from members of the public, to comment on environmentally sensitive construction projects that are federally funded or that require federal approval. the bill also imposes hard and fast deadlines that may be unrealistic under certain circumstances. moreover, if an agency fails to meet these unrealistic deadlines, the bill simply declares that a project must be deemed approved regardless of whether the agency has thoroughly assessed the task. this is an embarrassment, my friends. as a result, h.r. 348 could allow projects that put public health and safety at risk to be approved before the safety review is completed. this failing of the bill, along with some others, explains why the administration and the president's council on environmental quality, along with more than 40 respected environmental groups, vigorously oppose this legislation before us today. these organizations include public citizen, the league of conservation voters, the natural resources defense council, the sierra club, and the wilderness society. likewise, the administration has appropriately issued a veto threat. stating that the bill will increase litigation, regulatory delays, and potentially force agencies to approve a project if the review and analysis cannot be completed before the proposed arbitrary deadlines, the administration warns that, if h.r. 348 ever became law, it would lead to more confusion and delay, limit public participation in the permitting process, and, ultimately, hamper economic growth. another concern, among many, that i have with this measure is that it is a flawed solution in search of an imaginary problem, and that is not just my opinion. the nonpartisan congressional research service, for instance, states that highway construction project delays based on environmental requirements stem not from the national environmental policy act, but from laws other than the national environmental policy act. in fact, the congressional research service found that the primary source of approval delays for these projects are more often tied to local or state and project-specific factors, primarily local or state agency priorities, project funding levels, local opposition to a project, project complexity, or late changes in project scope. undoubtedly, the so-called rapid act will make the process less clear and less protective of public health and safety. my final major concern with this bill is that, rather than streamlining the environmental review process, which we need to do, it will sow utter confusion. h.r. 348 does this by creating a separate, but only partly parallel, environmental review process for construction projects, which will cause confusion, delay, and litigation. as i have noted, the changes to the national environmental policy act's review process, as contemplated by the measure before us today, apply only to certain construction projects. the national environmental policy act, on the other hand, applies to a broad panoply of federal actions, including fishing, hunting, and grazing permits, land management plans, base realignment and closure activities, and treaties. as a result of the bill, there could potentially be two different environmental review processes for the same project. for instance, the bill's requirements would apply to the construction of a nuclear reactor, but not to its decommissioning or to the transportation and storage of its spent fuel. rather than improving the environmental review process, the measure before us will complicate it and generate more litigation. more importantly, this bill is yet another effort by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to undermine regulatory protections. as with all of the other regulatory bills, this measure is a thinly disguised effort to hobble the ability of federal agencies to do the work the congress requires that it does. for those reasons, i urge my colleagues to strenuously oppose this seriously flawed bill. mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. goodlatte. mr. chairman, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. marino), the chief sponsor of this legislation and the chairman of the regulatory reform, commercial and antitrust law subcommittee of the committee on the judiciary. mr. marino. i thank the chairman. mr. chairman, once again, my good friends on the other side think we need more government, more epa overreach, more regulation, to continue the $19 trillion of debt that we have and to continue the flawed job opportunities of this administration's over the past 6 years. once again, today we consider the rapid act. as the gentleman from virginia stated, during the 112th and [[page h6209]] 113th congresses, the house passed this bill on three separate occasions in a bipartisan fashion. once again, we are considering a number of important regulatory reforms that present the potential for immediately impactful economic growth across our nation. our federal permitting process is undeniably broken. duplicative environmental reviews have clogged decision-making for years. although recent studies have shown that, on average, an environmental impact study will take 3 to 4 years, the permitting process for many projects takes years more or, sadly, even decades. even more disappointing are indications that average environmental review times are increasing by over a month per year. furthermore, final decision-making has been driven by political whims rather than by the merits of any particular project that would be borne through economic growth and job creation. political pressure should never impede projects of worth that would get americans back to work. one recent study found that 7 years of delay on the keystone pipeline have kept us from realizing nearly $175 billion in potential economic activity. at a time when true economic recovery lags and more americans become disheartened and leave the workforce, such delays are unacceptable. the rapid act reforms remove government obstructions from the equation by implementing hard deadlines for environmental review, and they shorten the window for judicial review. it doesn't take review away. it shortens it to a reasonable period of time. we cannot delay while our infrastructure--from highways and bridges to transmission lines and waterways--crumbles around us in america's counties, towns, and cities. i look forward to working with our colleagues in the senate to bring this bill to the president's desk, and i hope that we can get this country working again. federal agencies and departments and employees have to be held accountable just like we are in private industry. they cannot sit back and let these permits and these issues stack up on their desks while they play games on their computers. i have hope that we can get this bill through and the country working again. please support the rapid act. {time} 1530 mr. conyers. mr. chair, i yield 8 minutes to the gentleman from georgia (mr. johnson), the ranking subcommittee member. mr. johnson of georgia. mr. chair, i rise in strong opposition to h.r. 348, the responsibly and professionally invigorating development act, or the rapid act. but if i had my druthers, i would change it to the ``responsibly and professionally invigorating diversion act,'' or rapid act. i would say that it is a diversion because we have got important work to do in this chamber, mr. chair. everybody knows that we are approaching the end of the fiscal year. it will be here in 6 short days. during this whole month of september--we are at september 24 today-- we have had a total of 8 legislative days during this month, knowing that we are coming up to the end of the fiscal year and we need to pass a spending bill to keep the government open and operating. we have been knowing this. we spent 6 weeks in august, from july to september, a total of about 6 weeks at home lounging while the nation's business in washington, d.c., went undone. we have spent a total of 8 legislative days out of the 24 days in september doing everything other than addressing the looming issue, which is the coming, or impending, government shutdown. now, we are here today. we just took one vote. this is the first legislative day of this week. we have got one business day left. the first legislative day, after hearing from the pope, we have just had our last vote for the day. it was our one and only vote for the day, and it was to rename a post office. we are coming up on the government shutdown, and what are we dealing with? instead of dealing with the nation's finances, we are dealing with this rapid act, which, as i said, is a diversion from the real duty that we need to be taking care of today. h.r. 348, the rapid act, is a misguided attempt to sow widespread confusion and delay in the review and permitting process under the national environmental policy act, or nepa. for over 40 years, the approval process for projects under nepa has saved time, money, and protected the environment, which the pope spoke of our need to protect today. in fact, since nepa was enacted, the u.s. economy has not contracted. it has actually tripled in size from just over $5 trillion to more than $16 trillion. among other things, nepa requires agencies to prepare a detailed environmental review for proposals relating to ``major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.'' nepa's purpose is to provide a framework for wide-ranging input from all affected interests when a federal agency conducts an environmental review of a proposed project. h.r. 348, the so-called rapid act, upends this review process in three ways: first, h.r. 348 carves out a separate environmental review process for construction projects. currently, nepa applies to a broad range of federal projects, including hunting permits, land management plans, military base realignment and closure activities, and treaties. in contrast, h.r. 348 only applies to a subset of these federal projects, creating more regulatory complexity in the permitting system, not less. second, section (c) of the rapid act allows any project sponsor to prepare an environmental document in lieu of such analysis by the lead agency. it is not difficult to imagine the shortcomings of allowing corporations, which seek to maximize shareholder value, to sit in the driver's seat on environmental policy. in fact, that is why we have such environmental degradation today. during a legislative hearing on h.r. 348, amit narang, a regulatory policy advocate for public citizen, compared section (c) to ``asking big banks to determine the costs and benefits of new wall street reform rules, or big energy companies to determine the costs and benefits of new climate change or air pollution measures.'' the inherent conflict of interest built into this section reveals the bill's clear design to allow project sponsors to manipulate the nepa permit approval process to the greatest extent possible. it is clear that not only does this republican bill task the fox with guarding the henhouse, it would also have him install the chicken wire as well. finally, under section (i) of h.r. 348, if an agency fails to meet the unrealistic deadlines mandated by h.r. 348, the bill would automatically green-light a federal construction project, regardless of whether or not the agency has thoroughly reviewed the project's risks. even if i were to set aside these concerns, it is difficult for me to look past the complete lack of empirical data supporting the premise of the rapid act, which is that agency compliance with nepa is the cause of delays in approving permits. the nonpartisan congressional research service reported in 2012 that project approval delays based on environmental requirements are not caused by nepa, but ``are more often tied to local/state and project- specific factors, primarily local/state agency priorities, project funding levels, local opposition to a project, project complexity, or late changes in project scope.'' similarly, dinah bear, who served as the general counsel for the white house council on environmental quality which oversees nepa's implementation, for over 20 years under both republican and democratic administrations, testified in the 112th congress that most delays in the environmental review process are not the result of nepa, but due to other factors entirely unrelated to nepa. in other words, the rapid act does nothing to address the lack of adequate funds allocated to federal construction projects or state- based barriers to the timely completion of construction projects, which are two of the most common delays and have nothing to do with regulatory permits under nepa. so, therefore, i urge my colleagues to oppose this misguided legislation. [[page h6210]] mr. goodlatte. mr. chairman, i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from texas (mr. poe), a member of the judiciary committee. mr. poe of texas. mr. chair, i thank chairman goodlatte, mr. marino, and mr. smith for working on this important bill and bringing it to the house floor. speeding up the regulatory process in the united states is an important issue in keeping america competitive. the methodical, slow, snail-paced decision or lack of decision process of the epa to make a decision on whether or not to approve a project is absurd. the rapid act addresses the problem of extensive requirements and growing delays in federal permitting and approvals for construction projects stemming from multiple agencies, excessive requirements, and unnecessary lawsuits. according to an april 2014 report issued by the gao, the average preparation time for the required environmental impact statement finalized in 2012 was over 4\1/2\ years. now, the environmental impact statement is just the first requirement in getting a permit. four-and-a-half years--world war ii took less time than it takes the epa to make a decision on whether or not to approve a project. they just continue to study and study and study. mr. chair, it is about time for the epa to pick a horse and ride it, make a decision about these projects. i am not going to talk in theory. i am going to talk about an actual project down in my congressional district. the sabine-neches waterway, most americans have never heard of it. the sabine-neches waterway is what some of us call ``the other texas international border.'' it is the waterway between louisiana and texas. we have been wanting, since 1997, to deepen that 40-foot waterway to 48 feet. that is just 8 feet. we just want to make it a little deeper so ships can come in and off-load their cargo and off-load their fuel. what they are doing now, they can't come in with a full load of fuel on those tankers. they have to off-load it, sometimes 20 percent, in the gulf of mexico and then bring in the rest. that costs money. we just want 8 feet. so in 1997, my predecessors asked the epa for an environmental impact statement and finally got that impact statement. it took 20 years to get an impact statement. i have had 11 grandkids since i have been in congress, and that impact statement has been pending all that time. we just want 8 feet. is it okay? the epa finally made a decision, but yet we still haven't started moving dirt. the original project was about $600 million. now, it is about $1.3 billion, and we still don't have that extra 8 feet. why? because the bureaucrats can't make a decision. delay, delay, delay. that is the name of the epa: delay, delay, delay. all this bill does, it says to this bureaucracy, study the information, reach a conclusion, and approve the project if it ought to be approved so america can be competitive worldwide. but, no, the other side says: well, we need more studies; we need more information. mr. chair, if teddy roosevelt would have had to deal with the epa in building the panama canal, it would have never been built because of all the regulatory requirements--some unnecessary, in my opinion. so let's approve the rapid act. let's get america working again. the sabine-neches waterway has numerous refineries on it. it is the energy hub of the united states. we just want 8 feet, mr. chair. that is all we want. pick a horse and ride it. the epa needs to get their act together. and that is just the way it is. mr. conyers. mr. chair, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from california (mr. ted lieu). mr. ted lieu of california. mr. chair, i rise to oppose h.r. 348, also known as the rapid act. this bill will rapidly cause environmental degradation. under this bill, if it became law, you could have projects that harm the environment that are deemed approved, even if the review process was not yet completed. that is crazy. keep in mind, we have had over 60 straight months of job creation under the obama administration. those are the facts. this bill is written in such a way that it will cause confusion. it will cause increased delays and limit public involvement in this important process. it is also unscientific. there is a provision in this bill that says we cannot count the social cost of carbon. now, i believe in a free market, and i believe that that has made america strong, but we can't have government artificially come in and say we are going to say things are costs and things are not costs when it is not scientifically based. we know that carbon has done a lot to increase climate change and caused global warming. that is why i, along with representatives peters, polis, and lowenthal, have introduced an amendment to put that language back in. we can't just say stop talking and ignore carbon. keep in mind, just a few hours ago, pope francis came in to a joint session of congress and told us to really revert and look at what we have done in terms of causing environmental degradation. {time} 1545 now, just a few hours later, we are back to attacking the environment. this is not right. i urge that we not support the rapid act. mr. goodlatte. mr. chairman, i yield 1 minute to myself to say to the gentleman from california that we may have 60 straight months of increased job creation, but the average american worker is making 5 percent less than they were before those 60 months began. the reason is that we are overregulating our economy. if we are really going to create jobs, we have got to have the infrastructure to do it. we have got to have the projects like were just described by congressman poe of texas. just 8 more feet of depth would bring a lot more jobs to east texas and to louisiana by being able to bring that product further up inland. these kind of projects require careful environmental assessment, but it doesn't require assessment that takes 20 years to take place. it should take place in a much more limited period of time. this bill helps to encourage focusing the mind on what needs to get done. that includes taking careful consideration of the environment, but it doesn't include delay, delay, delay. mr. chairman, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from nevada (mr. hardy), a member of the committee on transportation and infrastructure and the committee on natural resources, both of which understand the importance of these projects. mr. hardy. mr. chairman, before i had the privilege of being elected to the 114th congress, i spent more than four decades in the construction industry. after growing up as a fifth-generation son of a farmer and rancher, i set out to learn the trades and acquire the skills that would one day allow me to support myself and my family. over the course of those four decades in construction, i learned what it takes to start and run a successful business and how to create quality, good-paying jobs. i also learned the satisfaction of seeing the fruits of our labor in the roads, bridges, and dams we built and how they define the communities we serve. mr. chairman, small construction businesses like the one i used to own are struggling all across america from federal bureaucracy that is rife with delays, duplication, and uncertainty. i can speak from firsthand experience about construction projects that have ground to a halt as resources are redirected to navigate the onerous nepa process. on projects like the ones i used to manage, nepa delays meant idled equipment, mass layoffs, and millions of dollars going towards compliance. these are sunk costs on the macro level and will continue to hold our economy back. we need to get smart about environment protection and to ensure that we do it in ways that allow businesses to thrive. h.r. 348, the rapid act, will go a long way toward achieving that goal. mr. chairman, at a time when our nation's infrastructure is crumbling [[page h6211]] and far too many are in search of quality employment, we have the responsibility to give manufacturers, construction workers, and other engines of economic growth the certainty they desperately need to create high-paying jobs. i urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rapid act. mr. conyers. mr. chairman, i yield an additional 2 minutes to the gentleman from georgia (mr. johnson), a distinguished member of our committee. mr. johnson of georgia. mr. chairman, my friend, chairman goodlatte, bemoaned the fact that, over the last 64 straight months of job growth under the obama administration, wages have remained stagnant. that is true except for the wages of the top 10 percent, and specifically the top 1 percent, which have gone through the roof despite what he calls overregulation. we continue to have the problem of income disparity that pope francis mentioned today. it is unrelated to this issue of regulations which are there to protect people. they, in fact, protect people and they protect our environment. we have had a speaker today come in and talk about a dredging project that was delayed because of nepa, but, actually, the truth of the matter is that that project was delayed due to lack of funding. funding for the project was only authorized last year. while the republicans in congress sit around and talk about how much the regulatory agencies study and study and study, what we do in congress is simply ignore the funding needs for infrastructure in this country, which is what that dredging project was all about. i have got a project down in georgia, the savannah harbor expansion project, which was estimated to cost $652 million to complete. but prior to the passage of the water resources reform and development act last year, the federal government had only provided $1.28 million--$1.28 million--less than 1 percent. the acting chair (mr. lamalfa). the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. conyers. mr. chairman, i yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman. mr. johnson of georgia. mr. chairman, let's take it back to the year 2011 with the ryan budget control act, which imposed sequestration on the federal government, cutting both defense and nondefense spending 10 percent across the board. we can't have it both ways. if we are not going to fund, we have to admit that that is the reason these projects are not getting done. don't blame it on nepa. mr. goodlatte. mr. chairman, i am prepared to close. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. conyers. mr. chairman, i yield myself the balance of my time. members of the committee, do not be misled by the title of this bill. rather than effectuating real reforms to the process by which federal agencies undertake environmental impact reviews, as required by the national environmental policy act, this measure before us will actually result in making the process less responsible, less professional, and less accountable. these kinds of attempts are not new to this session of congress. accordingly, i urge that my colleagues carefully consider the discussion on this measure and oppose h.r. 348. organizations that oppose h.r. 348, the rapid act alaska wilderness league, american rivers, center for

misleadingly named ``responsibly and professionally invigorating development act of 2015.'' instead of improving the permitting process, the bill will severely undermine the national environmental policy act (nepa) and, consequently, the quality and integrity of federal agency decisions. the national environmental policy act plays a critical role in ensuring that projects are carried out in a transparent, collaborative, and responsible manner. nepa simply requires federal agencies to assess the environmental, economic, and public health impacts of proposals, solicit the input of all affected stakeholders, and disclose their findings publicly before undertaking projects that may significantly affect the environment. critically, nepa recognizes that the public-- which includes industry, citizens, local and state governments, and business owners--can make important contributions by providing unique expertise. nepa also gives a voice to the most impacted and underrepresented, especially to the most vulnerable communities who usually have to bear the most burden of where federal projects are proposed in the first place. however, h.r. 348 strikes at these core purposes of nepa by systematically prioritizing speed of decisions and project approval over the public interest. studies on the causes of delay in the permitting process reveal that the primary cause of delay is not the nepa process. rather, as multiple studies by the government accountability office and the congressional research service have pointed out, the principal causes of delay in permitting rest outside the nepa process entirely and are attributable to other factors such as lack of funding, project complexity, and local opposition to the project. the rapid act ignores the true causes of delay, and instead, focuses on institutionalizing dangerous ``reforms'' that restrict public input, limit review of the environmental and economic impacts of projects, and that create more, not less, bureaucracy. provisions in the rapid act, such as the following, will create more delays in permitting, result in less flexibility in the process, and tilt the entire permitting process towards shareholder interest, not the public interest. for example, the bill: places arbitrary limitations on environmental reviews-- section 560(i) of the bill threatens to undermine nepa's goal of informed decision-making and the agency's role of acting in the public interest. it sets arbitrary deadlines on environmental reviews of permits, licenses, or other applications--regardless of the possible economic, health, or environmental impacts. consequently, it puts communities at risk by promoting rushed and faulty decisions. limits consideration of alternatives--section 560(g) strikes at what ceq regulations describe as ``the heart of the nepa process'' by restricting the range of reasonable alternatives to be considered by an agency. creates serious conflicts of interests--section 560(c) blurs the distinct roles of private entities and agencies in agency decisions by allowing private project sponsors with stakes in the decision to prepare environmental review documents which creates inherent conflicts of interest and thus jeopardizes the integrity of the decision-making process. leading to unanticipated delays--the bill forces stakeholders into court preemptively simply to preserve their right to judicial review. the bill also limits the public's judicial access to challenge and address faulty environmental reviews which in turn is likely to increase the controversy and the amount of litigation derived from the permitting process which in turn could add to project delays. denies the impacts of climate change--section 560(k) of the bill prohibits any considerations of the social cost of carbon (scc), which the epa and other federal agencies use to estimate the economic damages associated with specific projects and their related carbon dioxide emissions. the tool is critical for the public to understand the true benefits and costs of a project. ignoring climate change puts critical infrastructure, tax payer dollars, and local communities at risk. provisions such as these and many more in the rapid act will only serve to increase delay and confusion around the environmental review process. we believe compromising the quality of environmental review and limiting the role of the public is the wrong approach. far from being broken, the national environmental policy act has proven its worth as an invaluable tool. it ensures that the public, developers, and agencies have a reliable template for consistent and fair proposal assessment for major projects that may impact federal resources. the rapid act contradicts and jeopardizes decades of experience gained from enacting this critical environmental law. further, it tips the balance away from informed decisions and public oversight, jeopardizing the public's ability to participate in how public resources will be managed. please oppose this unnecessary and overreaching piece of legislation and vote ``no'' on the rapid act. [[page h6212]] although no amendment would remedy the problems with the underlying bill, we make the following vote recommendations on amendments offered to the rapid act. vote no on goodlatte (r-va) #1--this amendment would prompt ill-informed decisions by limiting the role of cooperating agencies in the environmental review process. it would also severely limit the public's ability to use the courts their rights by requiring eventual plaintiffs to participate in drastically shortened comment periods and administrative proceedings that, in many cases, agencies do not provide. vote yes on peters (d-ca) #2--this amendment ensures that the true impacts of climate change are considered by allowing agencies to consider the social costs of carbon when conducting environmental reviews. agencies should be free to incorporate the social cost of carbon into the agency decision making process, which will result in better informed and responsible decisions that safely invest taxpayer dollars by taking into account climate change, the fundamental environmental issue of our time. vote yes on jackson lee (d-tx) #3--this amendment will undo one of the more pernicious provisions in the h.r. 348 which, in cases where an agency fails to meet arbitrary deadlines prescribed by the bill, projects are simply deemed approved regardless of their economic, health, or environmental impacts. the bill, without this amendment, puts communities at risk by green-lighting projects without fully considering environmental impacts or the opinions of those who will be impacted the most. vote yes on jackson lee (d-tx) #4--this amendment maintains national security by undoing hasty shortcuts in the permitting process and rightly ensuring a full review for projects that could be potential targets for terrorist attacks. this amendment wisely ensures that shortcutting critical federal review of projects does not apply those projects that most need informed decisions because of the tremendous impacts they may have on our national security. vote yes on johnson (d-ga) #5--this amendment rightly ensures that nothing in the bill will limit input of affected stakeholders, local governments, private property owners, or business owners. vote yes on dingell (d-mi) #6--this amendment would prevent project approvals under the arbitrary timelines set forth in the bill if the project under consideration would limit access to or opportunities for hunting or fishing or would impact threatened or endangered species. according to the u.s. fish and wildlife service, wildlife related recreation contributes more than $140 billion dollars to the u.s. economy and supports thousands of jobs connected to fishing, hunting, and the observance of wildlife. vote yes on gallego (d-az) #8--this amendment preserves meaningful input by local governments and tribal officials on projects affecting their communities by allowing them to request extensions of the arbitrary deadlines in the bill. vote yes on grijalva (d-az) #9--the shortcutting of meaningful public input and review of a project's impacts under the rapid act could potentially lead to disproportionate impacts on low-income communities and communities of color. this amendment ensures such impacts are carefully addressed during the review of project alternatives. vote yes on lowenthal (d-ca) #10--the truncated review procedures under the rapid act would potentially apply to construction projects of enormous size, scope, and complexity. climate change poses severe threats to the health, safety, and economies of local communities through the increased risks of floods, fire and severe weather. this amendment ensures federal agencies consider these impacts and construct projects that are resilient to the impacts of climate change. vote no on gosar (r-az) #11--this amendment would broaden one of the most damaging provisions of the bill which prevents federal agencies from considering the true costs of climate change, putting communities and tax-payer dollars at risk. whatever the outcome of these amendments, we urge a no vote on final passage. sincerely, leah donahey, senior campaign director, alaska wilderness league;

[[page h6213]] ignore the false alarms and embrace the commonsense reforms in this bill. pass the rapid act, call the president's bluff, give the nation shovel-ready projects. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. the acting chair. all time for general debate has expired. mr. goodlatte. mr. chairman, i move that the committee do now rise. the motion was agreed to. accordingly, the committee rose; and the speaker pro tempore (mr. hardy), having assumed the chair, mr. lamalfa, acting chair of the committee of the whole house on the state of the union, reported that that committee, having had under consideration the bill (h.r. 348) to provide for improved coordination of agency actions in the preparation and adoption of environmental documents for permitting determinations, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon. ____________________",46671

Today I want to pay special tribute to the hard-working American farmers, millers, merchants, suppliers, and the consumers who make rice not only such a wholesome food, but an important part of our economy. Rice farming in America actually predates our Nation's founding, beginning some 300 years ago in the Deep South. Today, America's rice industry creates 125,000 good-paying jobs and contributes an estimated $34 billion to our Nation's economy. America's rice farmers have also a longstanding commitment to protect and preserve natural resources. Today, U.S. rice farmers produce more rice, using less land, energy, and water, using cutting-edge technology in land-leveling, in yield, and in technology for using less chemicals. The process is much more efficient than it was 20 years ago, while providing critical waterfowl habitat for hundreds of species. I know personally because I have leveled many of these fields myself. America's rice farmers continue to serve as leaders in the farming community by producing a healthy, conservation-friendly rice crop that generates jobs and economic opportunity. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing September as National Rice Month. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [House] [Page H6213] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SEPTEMBER IS NATIONAL RICE MONTH (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is truly an honor to serve here in the United States Congress, but we sully that honor when we waste the American people's time with misplaced priorities and manufactured crises. Mr. Speaker, Congress has one fundamental responsibility: funding the Federal Government. But unfortunately, Republicans in Congress insist on undermining these responsibilities at virtually every turn. Mr. Speaker, Republicans already insist on maintaining reckless sequester funding that chokes services for working and middle class Americans, seniors, veterans, and children. Instead of passing Republican budgets that meet the ever-changing needs of our Nation, Republicans choose to kick the can down the road through continuing resolutions that waste precious time and shortchange the American people. But if sequestration and continuing resolutions weren't already bad enough, now we are facing a complete Federal shutdown because Republicans insist on holding Federal funds for women's health care hostage. Congress has just 4 legislative days remaining to pass a funding bill. Mr. Speaker, the American people are fed up with this brinksmanship. It is time for us to run the country like adults. Let's remember why this is happening: Republicans have pledged to shut down the entire Federal Government because of objections to abortion services by Planned Parenthood. Never mind that not a single cent of Federal money funds abortions by Planned Parenthood. Never mind that Planned Parenthood provides health care and education to more than 2.6 million Americans--both men and women--each year. Never mind that 97 percent of Planned Parenthood's health services are unrelated to abortions. Republicans would rather ignore these truths and instead rely on a series of distorted videos secretly filmed by discredited and shady antiabortion activists. So instead of using this time to talk about creating jobs, building infrastructure, reducing college debt, and reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act, I am forced to stand here on the House floor to remind the American people about the dangers we face with yet another Republican shutdown. Here are a few ways that this shutdown would harm the American people: A shutdown would close more than 400 national parks and monuments. It would increase backlogs for veterans' pensions, compensation, and disability claims. It would delay tax refunds and Federal home loan applications; prohibit the National Institutes of Health from accepting new patients; shut down E-Verify screening for businesses to limit hiring undocumented workers; shutter Head Start programs for low-income families and children; and close Federal courts. The impact of a 2015 shutdown is hard to quantify, but we don't have to look too far back to estimate the potential impact. In 2013, Republicans shut the government down for 16 days in a failed attempt to defund the Affordable Care Act. That shutdown furloughed 850,000 Federal workers for a total of 6.6 million days. The 2013 shutdown cost $2 billion in lost productivity. Standard & Poor's estimated that the shutdown cost the U.S. economy $24 billion and stalled the creation of more than 100,000 private sector jobs, and $4.4 billion in tax returns were delayed. Small businesses and private lenders had to delay loans due to lack of access to Federal Social Security number and income verification tools. Knowing what we know, Mr. Speaker, it is inconceivable that we could walk into this type of catastrophe by choice. That must be why the Speaker of the House, in 2013, called that shutdown a ``very predictable disaster.'' Mr. Speaker, I would much rather be predicting solutions than disasters. That is why I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Congressional Progressive Caucus to stave off this irresponsible and dangerous shutdown. Again, this is the one thing our constituents sent us to Washington for: to fund the government. This is our job. I implore my anti-women's health colleagues to set aside their partisan bickering and work with us to keep this government open. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [House] [Page H6213] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1600 CONGRESSIONAL PROGRESSIVE CAUCUS: FEDERAL SHUTDOWN The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Benishek) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. General Leave Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the topic of preventing veteran suicide. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize September as Suicide Prevention Month. I want to thank my colleague, Kyrsten Sinema, for joining me and putting together this Special Order hour. For the next hour, we will discuss an issue that is very important to me and should be unacceptable in a nation of our resources: veteran suicide. A veteran in this country commits suicide every 65 minutes. That is 22 lives extinguished every day. As the father of a veteran, a doctor who worked at a VA hospital in northern Michigan, and the chairman of the Health Subcommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I know that the challenges of military life do not end once our servicemembers retire from Active Duty. The mental wounds of war may be invisible, but they are no less real to the young men and women suffering from them. Facing high unemployment rates, the stigma of post-traumatic stress disorder, and a loss of military fellowship, returning veterans often face a crisis of confidence at the very moment they should feel nothing but relief and rest. Congress did make a real impact early this year when we passed the Clay Hunt SAV Act, which is helping the VA put the very best mental healthcare professionals to work for our veterans and creating peer support groups to help catch those transitioning servicemembers who may otherwise fall through the cracks. However, so much more needs to be done. I am grateful to my colleagues for standing with me today for our most vulnerable veterans and their families. I look forward to hearing what they have to say and to working with them to end veteran suicide. I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Abraham). Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Dr. Benishek, for having this. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues to raise awareness of veteran suicide prevention. Let me underscore the word ``prevention''-- prevention because veteran suicide is a public health tragedy. As a doctor, I know it is a preventable tragedy. For far too long, PTSD has been stigmatized, and it is time to remove that stigma. Twenty-two percent of Americans who commit suicide are veterans. That statistic is unacceptable to me, and it should be unacceptable to the American people. Our Nation's heroes should come home to readily available mental health care. They should not have to wait days, weeks, or even months to receive treatment. Veterans should not have to wait at all. The Clay Hunt SAV Act, which was signed into law earlier this year, was an excellent first step in giving veterans options, but there is more work to be done. As a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and a veteran myself, I will continue to fight for a more streamlined system to treat our veterans suffering from PTSD and continue to work to reform the VA system to be a system that puts the veteran first, not the bureaucrat. Mr. BENISHEK. I yield to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. Sinema). Ms. SINEMA. Thank you, Congressman Benishek, for joining me today as a cohost of tonight's Special Order. September is Suicide Prevention Month, a time for our Nation to raise awareness about the persistent scourge of suicide. Tens of thousands of Americans each year purposefully die by their own actions. They are our neighbors and our friends, our sons and our daughters; and too often, they are the men and women who have served our country honorably in the United States military. An estimated 22 veterans lose their lives to suicide every single day in our country. That is one life lost every 65 minutes. Typically, time in the House Chamber is split. Republicans have 1 hour and Democrats have another hour, but Congressman Benishek and I believe that this issue is too important to be overshadowed by partisan politics. That is why we have joined together today, with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, to show our commitment to solving this problem together and to finding real solutions for our country's veterans. This is the third year we have assembled in this Chamber to raise awareness and to send a clear message that the epidemic of veteran suicide must end. We have so much work left to do. So today, we demonstrate our ongoing support for the individuals, organizations, and agencies devoted to preventing the epidemic of veteran suicide. Today, we challenge the VA, the Department of Defense, and our fellow lawmakers to do more. We are failing in our obligation to do right by those who have served so honorably. Finally, we send a message to military families who have experienced this tragedy in their own families: Your family's loss is not forgotten. We work for the memory of your loved ones. We will not rest until every veteran in this country has access to the care that he or she needs. {time} 1615 I have often shared the story of a young veteran in my district, Sergeant Daniel Somers. Sergeant Somers was an Army veteran of two tours in Iraq. Diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury and suffering from post- traumatic stress disorder, Sergeant Somers took his own life after struggling with the VA bureaucracy and not getting the help he needed in time. Together with the Somers family, we worked to develop the Classified Veterans Access to Care Act to ensure that all veterans, including those who served with classified experiences, can get immediate access to the mental health care that they need in the appropriate care setting. I recently testified before the House Veterans Affairs Committee on the need for this important legislation, and I am grateful for the committee's support for this legislation. I am grateful for my cosponsor, Congressman Dan Benishek. I will continue working with the committee to ensure that no veteran feels trapped, like Sergeant Somers did, and that all of our veterans have access to appropriate mental health care. My State, Arizona, is ground zero for the VA's failure to take care of our veterans. It has been over a year since we learned about the veterans at the Phoenix VA Hospital who were kept on secret waiting lists, forced to wait months, even years, before seeing a doctor, unable to access the care they needed. These revelations were shocking and sickening. Arizona veterans died while waiting for care. That is absolutely unacceptable and, frankly, it is un-American. So in Arizona, we took immediate action when we learned from brave whistleblowers about this tragedy. Not waiting for the Phoenix VA to fix their problems, we came together as a community to make sure that Arizona veterans get the access to the care they needed. Mr. Speaker, since last summer, we have held six veterans clinic, helping nearly 1,000 veterans and military families get access to the benefits they have earned. Our team helps veterans in getting access to benefits, to housing, to job placement, to education. We established a Veterans Mental Health Working Group for community [[Page H6215]] providers, veterans service organizations, and the local VA, to bring them all together to work to improve access to services. Our group meets bimonthly and has made important progress. These are some examples of the good that can come when people set aside partisanship and put veterans first. That is what is needed from all of us in this Chamber and the agencies we work with: to put aside partisanship and solve the problem we face to end the scourge of veteran suicide in this country. Mr. BENISHEK. I thank the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. Sinema). I really appreciate your comments and your concern for this significant problem. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to outline something that I have become aware of in my time here in office. While this problem is very monumental, there are many small things that the VA can do right now to make a difference. One of these changes can be made by the VA immediately. I would like to read a letter I received recently from an American Legion representative in my district that illustrates the problem better than I could. Dear Dr. Benishek: Here is the situation. Recently I encountered a suicidal veteran from the Sault area who had severe PTSD, 100 percent VA disabled. He called me on a Wednesday hysterical and said that he was contemplating suicide. He was traveling around with his wife in the car at the time. I thought this was a very dangerous situation. After several back-and-forth conversations with him, I found out he was not taking any medicines and had not seen his VA psychiatrist in a long time because, as he put it, the psychiatrist was not helping him and it seemed that he didn't really care. He insisted that he stay at Wilwin, the American Legion veterans facility, but I told him we needed his psychiatrist's okay. As a veteran myself, I thought I should try to help him the best that I could. So I called the VA Suicide Hotline to get answers on how I should handle the situation. Here's the problem. I called the Iron Mountain VA. The call started out saying, if you are having a medical or mental health emergency, please hang up and dial 911. If you are having thoughts of hurting yourself and want to talk to a mental health professional, please hang up and dial 1-800-273-8255. If you are thinking of committing suicide, you are already frustrated to the point that you would be glad to talk to anyone, even if it is someone at the VA. Can you imagine a veteran in this position even having a paper and pencil in hand to write the number down? If he is unable to get the correct number the first time, he must redial the VA, go through the whole spiel again and, hopefully, write the number on a paper the second or third time before he can try dialing. Once dialed, the voice comes on the phone and says, if you are a veteran push 1 and so on. When I called the hotline after I pushed 1, listened to music for several minutes before a voice came on the phone, she told me that she was not a veteran, nor did she know much about PTSD veterans. What I needed was advice on how to handle the veteran I was working with, which she did give me. How many veterans have committed suicide because of the VA's red tape? Here's a solution. When the VA is called and the veteran is contemplating suicide or hurting himself, you should be able to push 1 to get a direct line to the suicide hotline. It should automatically register that the call is coming through the VA system and, yes, it is a veteran calling. This constituent was able to get the veteran he referred to the help that he needed, but he raised an incredibly good point that I brought up repeatedly with the VA. The VA told me it would take 6 months to change from an 800 number to simply dial 1. This is unacceptable. I call on the VA again today to make this change immediately. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from Nebraska (Mr. Ashford). Mr. ASHFORD. I thank the gentleman for the time. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss a subject many of our veterans and their families understandably find great difficulty in discussing. Veteran suicide, as we have already heard, is a major problem in our country. We have all heard the numbers. An estimated 22 veterans commit suicide every day. That is one life every hour. Please keep in mind those horrific numbers have names, the names of men and women who put themselves in harm's way in order to keep each and every one of us safe. Earlier this year we passed the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention of American Veterans Act. It addresses the need for more mental healthcare experts inside the VA along with expanding the time available to veterans to seek mental health care through the VA. The new law also calls for an evaluation of all VA mental health care and suicide prevention practices to determine what is working and make recommendations on what is not. This is a major step in the right direction, but we must continue to do more. I am proud to say, Mr. Speaker, that, in Omaha, we are currently working with the Department of Veterans Affairs to create a center of excellence, a national model for veterans' care that will include top- flight mental health care and other services so much needed by our veterans in our community. That treatment would cover post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety and problems relating to other people. The debt we owe the men and women who serve this country is a debt that can never be repaid. But we must continue to ensure that we keep our promises to our veterans and support their very unique healthcare issues. Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello). Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan for hosting this Special Order to raise awareness for an issue that impacts constituents in all of our congressional districts. We can all agree that, as Members of Congress, we need to prioritize our veterans. We also need to raise awareness about the invisible wounds many of them face. I am speaking about post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, depression, which can and often does lead to thoughts of suicide. Mr. Speaker, we also need to make sure that the loved ones of these veterans have the support they need so that they may best help those who are suffering from these invisible wounds. I have been here 9 months. The House has taken some very positive steps to help veterans since I have been here and improving suicide prevention programs. It has been said by several Members already here on the floor today, the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act, a commonsense bill that is going to increase access to mental health by creating a peer support and community outreach pilot program. It is going to boost accountability with mental health care by requiring an annual evaluation of VA mental health and suicide prevention programs. It is proof that, when we put party politics aside around here, we can get good things done. We should all be proud of that. I would like to direct Members' attention to H.R. 2915, the Female Veteran Suicide Prevention Act, which has been just passed out of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. It is time to bring this bill to the floor. It will direct the VA to identify mental healthcare prevention programs and metrics that are effective in treating female veterans as part of the evaluative process required by the Clay Hunt Act, and it would require the VA to accommodate a veteran's obligation to not properly disclose classified information. Mr. Speaker, suicide prevention programs are key to maintaining continual engagement with veterans and communities, as well as to raise awareness and to help intervene, when necessary. I would also add, let's keep in mind the Economic Opportunity Subcommittee on Veterans' Affairs, which I serve on, with many other hardworking Members who are working in a consensus-oriented fashion. We need to make sure that the Transition Assistance Program is working for our veterans. We need to make sure that, from a veterans' hiring preference program, that that is working. We need to make sure that we are utilizing the best that the private sector has to offer for workforce development training for veterans returning to civilian life. We know that there is an unfair stigma associated with those who may need to seek assistance with mental health. Part of the value of why we are here today is to raise awareness and help reduce that stigma and say that we understand that there are challenges for veterans returning to civilian life and we are here to help. [[Page H6216]] We want to raise awareness. We want to make sure that the programs that we have in place are working. We are going to continue to do that. I applaud those who helped organize this Special Order here today, and I am honored to participate in it. Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from Illinois (Mrs. Bustos). Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. Sinema) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Benishek) for convening this important discussion this afternoon. As I am sure we agree, we need to continue shining a light on the epidemic of veteran suicide so we can push to improve the resources available to the brave men and women who have served our Nation. Mr. Speaker, I come from a region of Illinois called the Quad Cities. For more than two decades, my seat was held by one of the strongest advocates for veterans who has ever worked in these Chambers. I am talking about the late and the great Congressman Lane Evans. Congressman Evans was a veteran of the Marine Corps who served this body from 1983 all the way to 2007. I was proud to call him my friend. As a veteran, he understood the challenges that many of our returning heroes confront after they come home. Congressman Evans was a tireless advocate for expanding resources to our veterans and providing the mental health services that many of them need to make a successful transition back to civilian life. Today, after more than a decade of war, this generation of veterans faces a new set of challenges. We have an obligation to those who have served our Nation. As my friend, the gentlewoman from Arizona highlighted earlier in her remarks that an estimated 22 veterans commit suicide every single day. That is nearly one every hour. And we all know the statistics driving this epidemic. Military suicides are at their highest rate in 10 years. Mr. Speaker, veterans make up 20 percent of our suicides, despite making up only 10 percent of our population. Thirty percent of veterans have considered suicide. 37 percent of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans have been diagnosed with PTSD. And of the approximately 22 veterans who take their lives every day, roughly five actually get care through the VA health system. {time} 1630 It is easy to get lost in all those statistics. They are numbers. But behind each and every one of those is a real human being, a veteran with a real story that we must tell. We have a duty to help them. We all know how hard the Department of Veterans Affairs is working to keep up with this ongoing and persistent challenge, but we have to do more. That is why I proudly supported the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act, which was signed into law earlier this year. Once this legislation is fully implemented, it will take critical steps toward curbing the epidemic of veteran suicide by improving the VA resources and increasing oversight of programs designed to help our veterans get the care that they deserve. This is an important step toward stemming the ongoing crisis of veteran suicide, but it is not enough. This is why I have called on the Appropriations Committee to increase funding for veteran suicide prevention programs and outreach services. I hope all of you will join me in demanding more action for our veterans. If Congressman Evans were alive today, he would not rest until all of our veterans get the care and the support they have earned for protecting our Nation, and neither should we. Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte). Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an epidemic that is plaguing our servicemembers and our veterans, and that epidemic is suicide. Each day it is estimated, on average, 22 veterans commit suicide in the United States. That is more than double the rate for the civilian population, and it is an extremely tragic statistic. Earlier this year, the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act was signed into law to help combat this very serious problem. I applaud this step forward, but our work is far from over. We must continue to ensure that those veterans who are suffering know that they are not alone; they have family, friends, and resources readily available to help them heal and move forward. These men and women have given so much to this great Nation. It is our duty to walk with them during and after their service. I remain committed to providing the highest quality medical care and resources for these brave men and women who were wounded in the course of defending our freedom. I look forward to working with my colleagues to improve timely access to mental healthcare services to ensure our veterans in crisis receive the help that they need. I thank Mr. Benishek and Ms. Sinema for organizing this Special Order hour. Mr. BENISHEK. I yield to my colleague from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell). Mrs. DINGELL. I thank my friend from Michigan for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank my friends Congressman Benishek, Congresswoman Sinema, and Congresswoman Bustos for their leadership and for hosting this Special Order this evening on an issue that we all care very deeply about: the high rate of suicide among our veteran population. September is Suicide Prevention Month, and it is important that we draw attention to this critical issue. The facts are stark. My other colleagues have already mentioned them. A veteran commits suicide every 65 minutes. That means that 22 veterans a day are dying. Today we honor those that we have lost already and the families who have suffered so much and are left behind. These veterans were true American heroes who served their country and came home tormented. We can never forget the sacrifices that they have made. It is great, on this evening, to see my colleagues from both sides of the aisle here to talk about this issue, because it is my sincere hope that we can come together and rededicate ourselves to doing what is right for our veterans and making sure that we are dedicating sufficient resources to veterans' care. On Sunday night, in Michigan, I will gather with the family and friends of those veterans who have committed suicide in Michigan. They have built a cross for each of those lives to try to raise awareness in our community. In addition, at a meeting that I hold with my mayors, where normally we are talking about infrastructure or roads, two-thirds of that meeting was spent talking about veterans and the emotional issues we are dealing with in our communities as we see these veterans struggling. The mayors and I have started a task force to address these issues. We have started a veterans' court that has been following the model of other places, trying to raise awareness so that in the community, we see when someone is struggling and are able to put out a helping hand. My next-door neighbor's young son, when tormented, needed help; and when he called, he couldn't get it. We all have got to come together. These brave young men and women have served our country. When they came home from World War II and Korea, we celebrated them. We thanked them for their service. We formed a community around them. These young men and women are fighting for us. They are fighting for freedom. They are fighting for world security. We have an obligation to help them when they come home, to help get them the resources that they need. They have memories that haunt them. They have memories that torment them. This Suicide Prevention Month, we have to take the stigma away from mental illness. We have to recognize that young people need help sometimes, and we have to be there for them. Tonight I thank my colleagues for organizing this Special Order so that we remind people that those who have served us sometimes need that helping hand. If we can prevent it, we must, any young person from taking their [[Page H6217]] life because of the service that they gave this country. Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, nearly 10 million Americans have serious mental illness, and millions go without proper treatment or care because our Nation's mental health system is broken not only for our veterans, but for our nonveterans as well. My next speaker is Dr. Tim Murphy from Pennsylvania, the author of the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act, H.R. 2646. This will overhaul our Nation's mental healthcare system, adding grants for more psychiatrists, authorizing intervention programs, and fixing current nationwide shortages of crisis mental health beds. I yield to my colleague from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murphy). Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman for organizing this very important Special Order. Mr. Speaker, I will tell the stories of three servicemembers that I have known in my time in the Navy, in my work at Walter Reed Hospital: One is of a soldier who tried to kill himself. He put a gun to his head, pulled the trigger. The gun fired, but it didn't kill him. It left him partially blind and with a significant head injury. He struggles through life. He continues to live, but the things that caused him to do that have not left. The second is of a marine that I knew, the son of a friend, who died recently. I went to his funeral and saw him lying there, looking so peaceful. The third, a soldier, I was called upon by the family to go visit him because he had been in his room for months. He covered the windows with camouflage. Bottles and bottles of medication littered his room, holes were punched in the walls, and he felt abandoned. There was nothing more we could do for the soldier who had killed himself; there were some things we could do for the soldier who harmed himself; but there was a lot we could do for the soldier who hid himself. When soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen look down the road to suicide, there are multiple reasons. Very often it is because they have faced those unspeakable horrors of war. Perhaps they have had multiple deployments, strain within the family, the lost social relationships, divorce, job complications, which whittled and chipped away at their strength. Perhaps they lost that sense of belonging that they had with their platoon or their company, that friendship with those who faced battles with them that somehow helped prop them back up. In many cases, it is dealing with the traumatic brain injury, of the multiple blasts, explosions, the primary, secondary, or tertiary wounds that they had which affected their brain functioning and leaves them with symptoms oftentimes of psychological disorders. Sometimes that psychological disorder is that path to depression, that feeling of hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness that comes with clinical depression, when the person sometimes says: There is no treatment that can help me; I might as well give up. First let me say to veterans, Mr. Speaker, that there is treatment that can help. There is reason to hope. It is important that veterans seek out a therapist; and if that therapist doesn't seem like a good mix, seek another one. If that one doesn't seem like a good mix, seek another one. Keep going until you find the right person. It is important veterans understand their life is worth living. Yes, you are suffering in the moment, but you can't stop pursuing treatment. Don't seek the permanent solution to the temporary problem. There is always another way out besides suicide. Now, we make this more complicated for veterans, as we do with the rest of the community of people who are suffering from mental illness, by we simply don't have enough professionals out there to help. We have family members who don't see the signs of isolation and anger and drinking and drug abuse and irritability. But just because there is a healthcare provider out there, the family should not ever feel that they can't talk to that person. The healthcare provider, even without permission of the soldier, can listen; and it is important that family members contact someone even when that soldier says, ``I don't want to talk to anybody,'' because, very often, that is the disease speaking, that is the brain illness speaking. That is the part of the illness that says ``I either want to give up'' or ``I don't recognize I have a problem.'' Loved ones can call for help, but we need other things taking place here as well. We have to have families who can help that person get out of a crisis. We have to help the family understand they need to remove the means of a suicide--if it is a firearm, if it is weapons, if is drugs. But what we need to do and what my bill (H.R. 2646), the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act, does is it changes the dynamics of what our country is doing, that has abusive policies and antifamily policies which actually prevent people from getting help. What we have to do is make sure we have more access to treatment. We need more psychiatrists and psychologists--it is as plain as that--by the thousands and tens of thousands. We do not have enough. So even when someone tries to seek help, it is difficult. We need more psychiatric hospital beds for those moments when a person needs a respite, someplace to go away from the crisis of everyday life. We don't have enough. We had 550,000 psychiatric hospital beds in the 1950s. We have less than 40,000 now. Part of that is because we have Medicaid rules out there and other rules that say, you know, we don't want hospital beds anymore. Look, I don't want to see people go back to the old asylums, but sometimes a person with that sense of helplessness and worthlessness needs a place to go to recover, to get better. We also have a VA system which has said: You are not going to continue some of these drugs. Your drug isn't on our formulary list. You are not going to take it anymore. I have other legislation in which says that, if a Department of Defense doctor prescribes a person medication and it is working, the VA should automatically, without question, carry that medication and provide ease of access for it. One of the reasons we even have the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans bill is because he couldn't get the medication that worked. It is our fault. We have met the enemy, and he is us, as one character famously said. The General Accounting Office also tells us we have a disorganized system, 112 Federal agencies--112--that are supposed to deal with mental illness. The GAO tells us they don't keep track of data. There is not accountability. They don't meet. Many of these agencies haven't even gotten together since 2009 to coordinate services. Twenty homeless programs, programs scattered throughout the Federal Government--we make it the most difficult for those who have the most difficulty. Sometimes what we do, though, is we reauthorize programs that work. But make no mistake, it is not enough. Anyone who thinks that Congress has been adequately addressing the needs of the mentally ill, the seriously mentally ill veterans, is naive. We are disillusioning ourselves into thinking that, because we did something, we did the right thing. So let me speak honestly: Congress' lack of comprehensive action and its snail pace in dealing with this shares the blame. We are not passive in this. We are active and codependent in this crisis that is inflicted upon Americans. When we are in this Chamber and we hear another tragic story of someone who has perhaps killed many people in the community and then killed themselves or they did suicide by cop, we have a moment of silence--and so we should--as we grieve over the loss of innocent life. But that moment of silence should not be accompanied with silent behavior. What we need are moments of action, and strong action at that. Not only do we have the soldier suicides, we had 41,000 suicides in this country in this last year; 43,000 drug overdose deaths; homicides by those with serious mental illness; people with mental illness who are the victims of crime and homicide. {time} 1645 Then we have that slow-motion death of the homeless and the seriously mentally ill who, themselves, have come to so many other chronic illnesses that--do you know what? They are not even a statistic. We don't count them. [[Page H6218]] If people want to help, if Members want to do something, here is an action plan: become cosponsors of the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act, H.R. 2646. Don't sit idly by. Don't say, ``Some other Member can do this; let it be someone else's problem.'' It is not. It is ours. As a nation, wouldn't we do better to act instead of grieve, to turn a blind eye and to hope that someone else takes care of it, or, worse yet, to be caught up in the politics, the partisan politics and the games that plague this Chamber that says: ``I am not going to let this party have a win or this party have a win''? In the meantime, people are dying, and we sit idly by. Mr. Speaker, suicide is a plague on our Nation, on our veterans. It is a plague on, as was said in Samuel 16, the last, the least, and the lonely. We must change this system that makes it difficult for those who have the most difficulty. We must remove abusive Federal policies that say that you can't see two doctors in the same day; you can't have more than 16 hospital beds; that say it is okay to have Federal programs and grants going out there for absurd concepts like making collages, making masks; telling people to get off their medication; a Web site to help people in Boston, when it is cold, deal with the anxiety of snow; a $425,000 Web site for 3-year-olds with sing-along songs; and a $22,000 painting which sits in the Office of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to give them awareness. The only thing I am aware of, Mr. Speaker, is that it is a waste of money--a waste of taxpayers' money--and a waste of lives. If this Congress gets its act together and admits it, and if our leadership says that we can run lots of bills--and we can run lots of bills real quick--and we can suspend the bills and bring bills to the floor in a moment's notice, I have had this bill sitting around 3 years. We revise it and revise it again. We have the support of multiple organizations across the country, whether they represent parents or consumers or professionals, and another day goes by; and every few seconds another person commits suicide or has a drug overdose death, and we go home at night and sleep snugly in our beds. It doesn't have to be this way if we have more providers and if we have a Federal Government in Congress that says that we must be guided by wisdom, compassion, and faith, that says we will not wait anymore and that we will take the collective voice of every Member of Congress to do that. A few hours ago, we had the Holy Father, Pope Francis, speak in this very Chamber. His words still echo in this community. But he called us to do things together, to be motivated by love, to be engaged in a dialogue and conversation, and that is a conversation we must be having about mental illness as well, to say that we can no longer put this off. I hope Members, if they really are concerned about veteran suicide-- as I believe we are--if they are really concerned about the problems of serious mental illness--as I know we are--if Members are tired of moments of silence in those times when we come together for a few minutes of compassion, we recognize that is not enough--and I know we are--then I hope every Member, every Democrat and Republican, talks to their leadership, talks to their committee members, talks to each other and says, ``Move this bill. Make something happen.'' By the way, Mr. Speaker, let me close with this. The story I told you has a good ending. The soldier that I visited in his home with the windows covered with camouflage, with medications scattered throughout the house, and with holes punched in the wall because of his anger, we did get him help. He got stabilized. He took those barriers off the windows. He let the bright light of the world shine in again, and he engaged with people again. He has hope again. That is a story that comes because people stepped forward and helped him. The people at hospitals and military hospitals can do that. Let's make sure that the others like him whom we have not discovered yet, who are still hiding in their rooms, we get to them before their lives are taken. This is what we should be doing as a nation. Failing to do this means we are culpable as this tragedy continues. Mr. BENISHEK. I would like to thank my colleague for his passion on this issue. I would now like to yield to my colleague from California (Mr. Peters). Mr. PETERS. I want to thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to thank Congresswoman Sinema and Congressman Benishek for their leadership on this issue, which is also of prime interest to me, this epidemic of suicide in our veteran community. Mr. Speaker, San Diego has the third largest population of veterans in the country, more than 235,000. One of the most important jobs we have here in Congress is to honor their service by keeping our promises to them. September is Suicide Prevention Month, a time to focus on ending the scourge of veteran suicide that has hurt families and communities across the country. Combating suicide takes the full spectrum of services, including deployment, education, drug and alcohol abuse treatment, and ending the stigma around mental health. In San Diego, I am pleased to say, the nonprofit sector has really stepped up. We have been at the forefront of finding innovative ways to approach veteran suicide by providing services and developing cohesion in the local veteran community that came together after the Vietnam war to increase collaboration among government, private groups, and community partners. San Diego is the home of, in my district, 0800, which is an organization doing innovative work to assist easing the transition between Active Duty and civilian life. It is a community-based nonprofit that takes the existing service structure, works with the servicemembers before they leave the military to get them set, and provides the case management after they return to the civilian world to ensure that the benefits and services that veterans have earned are provided to them. Another organization, the Three Wise Men Foundation, founded by combat veteran Nathan Fletcher, utilizes community engagement and workout trainings to help veterans who were in combat and have struggled to reintegrate after coming home. There is a powerful article by Dave Phillips that The New York Times highlighted this weekend about how many veterans are turning to each other to survive. To quote that article: ``Feeling abandoned, members of the battalion have turned to a survival strategy they learned at war: depending on one another.'' We have all heard the devastating statistics of veteran suicides in the country, but thus far, the response has failed to properly address the dire situation, and we have a responsibility here in Congress to do much more than we have. The statistics don't tell the heart-wrenching stories that so many of us have heard from parents, spouses, and the loved ones of the veteran who has taken his or her own life. One such couple that Congresswoman Sinema and I know, and I have been honored to work with, is Dr. Howard and Jean Somers, who, after losing their son, Daniel, to suicide, have become tireless advocates to fix and reform the broken healthcare system at the Department of Veterans Affairs. We know that bipartisan reforms to the VA can make a difference. The Clay Hunt Act showed us that and garnered a new generation of mental health and suicide prevention services at the VA, and the Veterans Choice Act will bring accountability to a system wrought with oversight and leadership challenges, allowing for faster service closer to the veteran in need. But fixing an inefficient VA requires more than just increased funding. It requires real changes to get veterans care in new and flexible ways. We need to allow the VA to better use innovative technologies, like wireless medicine, that allow veterans access to care from the comfort of their homes, which can save lives and decrease costs to taxpayers. We need to break the stigma around mental health, particularly post- traumatic stress. The service-connected injury needs to be treated with the same gravity and respect as the physical injury that so many of our valiant warfighters have battled. So thank you again, Congresswoman Sinema and Congressman Benishek, for your consistent advocacy on reforming the VA and on ending the tragedy of veteran suicide. We have much more [[Page H6219]] work to do, and I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to work with you on it. Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Abraham). The gentleman has 8 minutes remaining. Mr. BENISHEK. I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho). Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to thank my colleagues, Representatives Sinema and Dr. Benishek, for their leadership in arranging such a Special Order on such an important topic and for the invitation to speak this afternoon on suicide prevention awareness. September is Suicide Prevention Awareness Month. It is so important that we have an open and honest dialogue about the issue of suicide. The more we talk about it, we increase people's awareness, and they are there to help the people in need. There are alternatives, and they do not have to suffer in silence. From comedian Robin Williams, to bullied young kids, to the brave men and women from our Nation's military returning from the battlefield, suicide does not discriminate. Emotional pain and despair can set in and take root in the minds and bodies of all ages across all demographics. Often, the signs of suicide go undetected, which leave those left behind asking: Why did this happen, and what could I have done to prevent this tragedy? Today a disproportionate amount of our Nation's veterans are falling victim to suicide. After all they have given to this country, it is tragic and unacceptable that our Nation's veterans often suffer in silence until it is too late for those around them to help. By shining a light on veteran suicide and all suicides, we as a nation can start to understand the urgency with which we need to solve and prevent this epidemic that our veterans, their families, and their friends struggle with. Not recognizing the signs early enough all too often leads to a loss of life. This is an important thing that we as a nation need to come together and have a strong support system in place so that those in need will reach out and not be stigmatized. Again, I want to thank our colleagues. Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright). Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to thank, particularly, Representatives Sinema and Benishek for bringing up this Special Order hour. For my own part, I speak for the northeastern part of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is home to nearly 1 million veterans. These are brave men and women who serve this Nation, a Nation that has, regrettably, not always served them. Many of the veterans suffer from mental illness. A study, as you all know, has been released that found that 22 veterans commit suicide every day. This is unacceptable. As someone who deeply cares about veterans' issues, I was proud to introduce legislation in the last Congress that would fast-track the hiring of psychiatrists who have completed a residency at a VA facility, and I was gratified that the President has incorporated many of those ideas in his policy. Initially, in this Congress, I plan to reintroduce the Veterans Mental Health Accessibility Act, an important piece of legislation that aims to provide for our brave servicemen and -women when they return from combat with both easily visible and difficult-to-detect wounds. While the physical wounds are evident immediately, the mental health ones may take longer to manifest themselves. Here is the problem: as many as 30 percent of Operation Iraqi and Enduring Freedom veterans face the possible diagnosis of a mental health disorder. But after 5 postservice years, if a condition is not diagnosed, veterans would go to the back of the line. They have missed their statute of limitations in 5 years and then experience an average wait time to receive benefits of more than 1 year. This could mean the difference between life and death. Unfortunately, mental health disorders are harder to diagnose, may take much longer to manifest, and many veterans might delay seeking treatment. We are putting it on them to self-diagnose and report within that 5-year span. We should not hold mental health disorders to the same timeline as a broken leg. The Veterans Mental Health Accessibility Act would ensure that no veteran would be denied mental health treatment no matter when combat-related mental health disorders first appear. I believe we owe a great debt to those warfighters who serve our country through military service, including those who stood ready at a moment's notice to fight for our freedom. Mr. Speaker, as long as I am a Member of Congress, I will be working to increase knowledge on this subject, to correct the shortcomings of the VA system, and to ensure that the men and women of our Armed Forces who bravely serve this country receive all the benefits to which they are entitled. Mr. BENISHEK. Nice comments, Mr. Cartwright. I appreciate it. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski), my colleague on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. Mrs. WALORSKI. Thank you, Mr. Benishek. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the distinguished gentleman from Michigan and the distinguished gentlewoman from Arizona for yielding. In honor of Suicide Prevention Month, I rise today to increase awareness about some of our bravest and most at risk: our veterans. Many of our Nation's troops, both past and present, face struggles many of us can never imagine. Every day 22 veterans take their own lives. I have experienced this same tragedy in my own district. In 2013, a constituent in my district, a former marine who served in Vietnam, began experiencing severe pain over his entire body. After visiting four VA clinics and facilities, doctors could not diagnose his condition and instead prescribed morphine for ongoing and oftentimes excruciating pain. To help manage his undiagnosed condition, doctors recommended he enter a nursing home. Unfortunately, he discovered he did not meet the eligibility requirements. Later that day, his wife was told that she had 1 hour to pick him up or they, the VA, would send him home in a cab without clothes since he did not have any at the hospital to wear. Two days later, just a week before Christmas, the pain proved too great for him to bear and he took his own life. His story details the urgency our Nation's heroes deserve. Instead of ending in heartbreak, veterans and their families need to know their lives count, which is why we must improve veterans' access to physical and mental health care. Together, we can change this system to prevent tragedies like this from ever happening again. {time} 1700 Mr. BENISHEK. Thank you very much, Mrs. Walorski. I really appreciate your comments. I think Dr. Murphy brought up a good point when he was speaking. We just recently in this House passed the 21st Century Cures Act, H.R. 6. That has been endorsed by a wide variety of professional and medical organizations, such as the American Association for Cancer Research and The Cure Alliance. We passed this bill by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 344-77. This is a piece of legislation that is going to change the way we do research at the NIH, that is going to change health care for all Americans. There is no reason that we shouldn't be able to pass a mental health care bill similar to that with a wide bipartisan effort. Today Ms. Sinema and I are leading a bipartisan group of Members of Congress to make mental health care an issue on which to move forward, and it has really been a great way to get this started. I yield to Ms. Sinema if she would like to add a few more thoughts in that regard. Ms. SINEMA. Thank you very much, Congressman Benishek. I know we will be continuing this in the next Special Order so as to allow more of our colleagues to speak, and I am really looking forward to that time. Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. [[Page H6220]] ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6214-H6220] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PREVENTING VETERAN SUICIDE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Benishek) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. General Leave Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the topic of preventing veteran suicide. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize September as Suicide Prevention Month. I want to thank my colleague, Kyrsten Sinema, for joining me and putting together this Special Order hour. For the next hour, we will discuss an issue that is very important to me and should be unacceptable in a nation of our resources: veteran suicide. A veteran in this country commits suicide every 65 minutes. That is 22 lives extinguished every day. As the father of a veteran, a doctor who worked at a VA hospital in northern Michigan, and the chairman of the Health Subcommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I know that the challenges of military life do not end once our servicemembers retire from Active Duty. The mental wounds of war may be invisible, but they are no less real to the young men and women suffering from them. Facing high unemployment rates, the stigma of post-traumatic stress disorder, and a loss of military fellowship, returning veterans often face a crisis of confidence at the very moment they should feel nothing but relief and rest. Congress did make a real impact early this year when we passed the Clay Hunt SAV Act, which is helping the VA put the very best mental healthcare professionals to work for our veterans and creating peer support groups to help catch those transitioning servicemembers who may otherwise fall through the cracks. However, so much more needs to be done. I am grateful to my colleagues for standing with me today for our most vulnerable veterans and their families. I look forward to hearing what they have to say and to working with them to end veteran suicide. I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Abraham). Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Dr. Benishek, for having this. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues to raise awareness of veteran suicide prevention. Let me underscore the word ``prevention''-- prevention because veteran suicide is a public health tragedy. As a doctor, I know it is a preventable tragedy. For far too long, PTSD has been stigmatized, and it is time to remove that stigma. Twenty-two percent of Americans who commit suicide are veterans. That statistic is unacceptable to me, and it should be unacceptable to the American people. Our Nation's heroes should come home to readily available mental health care. They should not have to wait days, weeks, or even months to receive treatment. Veterans should not have to wait at all. The Clay Hunt SAV Act, which was signed into law earlier this year, was an excellent first step in giving veterans options, but there is more work to be done. As a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and a veteran myself, I will continue to fight for a more streamlined system to treat our veterans suffering from PTSD and continue to work to reform the VA system to be a system that puts the veteran first, not the bureaucrat. Mr. BENISHEK. I yield to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. Sinema). Ms. SINEMA. Thank you, Congressman Benishek, for joining me today as a cohost of tonight's Special Order. September is Suicide Prevention Month, a time for our Nation to raise awareness about the persistent scourge of suicide. Tens of thousands of Americans each year purposefully die by their own actions. They are our neighbors and our friends, our sons and our daughters; and too often, they are the men and women who have served our country honorably in the United States military. An estimated 22 veterans lose their lives to suicide every single day in our country. That is one life lost every 65 minutes. Typically, time in the House Chamber is split. Republicans have 1 hour and Democrats have another hour, but Congressman Benishek and I believe that this issue is too important to be overshadowed by partisan politics. That is why we have joined together today, with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, to show our commitment to solving this problem together and to finding real solutions for our country's veterans. This is the third year we have assembled in this Chamber to raise awareness and to send a clear message that the epidemic of veteran suicide must end. We have so much work left to do. So today, we demonstrate our ongoing support for the individuals, organizations, and agencies devoted to preventing the epidemic of veteran suicide. Today, we challenge the VA, the Department of Defense, and our fellow lawmakers to do more. We are failing in our obligation to do right by those who have served so honorably. Finally, we send a message to military families who have experienced this tragedy in their own families: Your family's loss is not forgotten. We work for the memory of your loved ones. We will not rest until every veteran in this country has access to the care that he or she needs. {time} 1615 I have often shared the story of a young veteran in my district, Sergeant Daniel Somers. Sergeant Somers was an Army veteran of two tours in Iraq. Diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury and suffering from post- traumatic stress disorder, Sergeant Somers took his own life after struggling with the VA bureaucracy and not getting the help he needed in time. Together with the Somers family, we worked to develop the Classified Veterans Access to Care Act to ensure that all veterans, including those who served with classified experiences, can get immediate access to the mental health care that they need in the appropriate care setting. I recently testified before the House Veterans Affairs Committee on the need for this important legislation, and I am grateful for the committee's support for this legislation. I am grateful for my cosponsor, Congressman Dan Benishek. I will continue working with the committee to ensure that no veteran feels trapped, like Sergeant Somers did, and that all of our veterans have access to appropriate mental health care. My State, Arizona, is ground zero for the VA's failure to take care of our veterans. It has been over a year since we learned about the veterans at the Phoenix VA Hospital who were kept on secret waiting lists, forced to wait months, even years, before seeing a doctor, unable to access the care they needed. These revelations were shocking and sickening. Arizona veterans died while waiting for care. That is absolutely unacceptable and, frankly, it is un-American. So in Arizona, we took immediate action when we learned from brave whistleblowers about this tragedy. Not waiting for the Phoenix VA to fix their problems, we came together as a community to make sure that Arizona veterans get the access to the care they needed. Mr. Speaker, since last summer, we have held six veterans clinic, helping nearly 1,000 veterans and military families get access to the benefits they have earned. Our team helps veterans in getting access to benefits, to housing, to job placement, to education. We established a Veterans Mental Health Working Group for community [[Page H6215]] providers, veterans service organizations, and the local VA, to bring them all together to work to improve access to services. Our group meets bimonthly and has made important progress. These are some examples of the good that can come when people set aside partisanship and put veterans first. That is what is needed from all of us in this Chamber and the agencies we work with: to put aside partisanship and solve the problem we face to end the scourge of veteran suicide in this country. Mr. BENISHEK. I thank the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. Sinema). I really appreciate your comments and your concern for this significant problem. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to outline something that I have become aware of in my time here in office. While this problem is very monumental, there are many small things that the VA can do right now to make a difference. One of these changes can be made by the VA immediately. I would like to read a letter I received recently from an American Legion representative in my district that illustrates the problem better than I could. Dear Dr. Benishek: Here is the situation. Recently I encountered a suicidal veteran from the Sault area who had severe PTSD, 100 percent VA disabled. He called me on a Wednesday hysterical and said that he was contemplating suicide. He was traveling around with his wife in the car at the time. I thought this was a very dangerous situation. After several back-and-forth conversations with him, I found out he was not taking any medicines and had not seen his VA psychiatrist in a long time because, as he put it, the psychiatrist was not helping him and it seemed that he didn't really care. He insisted that he stay at Wilwin, the American Legion veterans facility, but I told him we needed his psychiatrist's okay. As a veteran myself, I thought I should try to help him the best that I could. So I called the VA Suicide Hotline to get answers on how I should handle the situation. Here's the problem. I called the Iron Mountain VA. The call started out saying, if you are having a medical or mental health emergency, please hang up and dial 911. If you are having thoughts of hurting yourself and want to talk to a mental health professional, please hang up and dial 1-800-273-8255. If you are thinking of committing suicide, you are already frustrated to the point that you would be glad to talk to anyone, even if it is someone at the VA. Can you imagine a veteran in this position even having a paper and pencil in hand to write the number down? If he is unable to get the correct number the first time, he must redial the VA, go through the whole spiel again and, hopefully, write the number on a paper the second or third time before he can try dialing. Once dialed, the voice comes on the phone and says, if you are a veteran push 1 and so on. When I called the hotline after I pushed 1, listened to music for several minutes before a voice came on the phone, she told me that she was not a veteran, nor did she know much about PTSD veterans. What I needed was advice on how to handle the veteran I was working with, which she did give me. How many veterans have committed suicide because of the VA's red tape? Here's a solution. When the VA is called and the veteran is contemplating suicide or hurting himself, you should be able to push 1 to get a direct line to the suicide hotline. It should automatically register that the call is coming through the VA system and, yes, it is a veteran calling. This constituent was able to get the veteran he referred to the help that he needed, but he raised an incredibly good point that I brought up repeatedly with the VA. The VA told me it would take 6 months to change from an 800 number to simply dial 1. This is unacceptable. I call on the VA again today to make this change immediately. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from Nebraska (Mr. Ashford). Mr. ASHFORD. I thank the gentleman for the time. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss a subject many of our veterans and their families understandably find great difficulty in discussing. Veteran suicide, as we have already heard, is a major problem in our country. We have all heard the numbers. An estimated 22 veterans commit suicide every day. That is one life every hour. Please keep in mind those horrific numbers have names, the names of men and women who put themselves in harm's way in order to keep each and every one of us safe. Earlier this year we passed the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention of American Veterans Act. It addresses the need for more mental healthcare experts inside the VA along with expanding the time available to veterans to seek mental health care through the VA. The new law also calls for an evaluation of all VA mental health care and suicide prevention practices to determine what is working and make recommendations on what is not. This is a major step in the right direction, but we must continue to do more. I am proud to say, Mr. Speaker, that, in Omaha, we are currently working with the Department of Veterans Affairs to create a center of excellence, a national model for veterans' care that will include top- flight mental health care and other services so much needed by our veterans in our community. That treatment would cover post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety and problems relating to other people. The debt we owe the men and women who serve this country is a debt that can never be repaid. But we must continue to ensure that we keep our promises to our veterans and support their very unique healthcare issues. Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello). Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan for hosting this Special Order to raise awareness for an issue that impacts constituents in all of our congressional districts. We can all agree that, as Members of Congress, we need to prioritize our veterans. We also need to raise awareness about the invisible wounds many of them face. I am speaking about post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, depression, which can and often does lead to thoughts of suicide. Mr. Speaker, we also need to make sure that the loved ones of these veterans have the support they need so that they may best help those who are suffering from these invisible wounds. I have been here 9 months. The House has taken some very positive steps to help veterans since I have been here and improving suicide prevention programs. It has been said by several Members already here on the floor today, the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act, a commonsense bill that is going to increase access to mental health by creating a peer support and community outreach pilot program. It is going to boost accountability with mental health care by requiring an annual evaluation of VA mental health and suicide prevention programs. It is proof that, when we put party politics aside around here, we can get good things done. We should all be proud of that. I would like to direct Members' attention to H.R. 2915, the Female Veteran Suicide Prevention Act, which has been just passed out of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. It is time to bring this bill to the floor. It will direct the VA to identify mental healthcare prevention programs and metrics that are effective in treating female veterans as part of the evaluative process required by the Clay Hunt Act, and it would require the VA to accommodate a veteran's obligation to not properly disclose classified information. Mr. Speaker, suicide prevention programs are key to maintaining continual engagement with veterans and communities, as well as to raise awareness and to help intervene, when necessary. I would also add, let's keep in mind the Economic Opportunity Subcommittee on Veterans' Affairs, which I serve on, with many other hardworking Members who are working in a consensus-oriented fashion. We need to make sure that the Transition Assistance Program is working for our veterans. We need to make sure that, from a veterans' hiring preference program, that that is working. We need to make sure that we are utilizing the best that the private sector has to offer for workforce development training for veterans returning to civilian life. We know that there is an unfair stigma associated with those who may need to seek assistance with mental health. Part of the value of why we are here today is to raise awareness and help reduce that stigma and say that we understand that there are challenges for veterans returning to civilian life and we are here to help. [[Page H6216]] We want to raise awareness. We want to make sure that the programs that we have in place are working. We are going to continue to do that. I applaud those who helped organize this Special Order here today, and I am honored to participate in it. Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from Illinois (Mrs. Bustos). Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. Sinema) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Benishek) for convening this important discussion this afternoon. As I am sure we agree, we need to continue shining a light on the epidemic of veteran suicide so we can push to improve the resources available to the brave men and women who have served our Nation. Mr. Speaker, I come from a region of Illinois called the Quad Cities. For more than two decades, my seat was held by one of the strongest advocates for veterans who has ever worked in these Chambers. I am talking about the late and the great Congressman Lane Evans. Congressman Evans was a veteran of the Marine Corps who served this body from 1983 all the way to 2007. I was proud to call him my friend. As a veteran, he understood the challenges that many of our returning heroes confront after they come home. Congressman Evans was a tireless advocate for expanding resources to our veterans and providing the mental health services that many of them need to make a successful transition back to civilian life. Today, after more than a decade of war, this generation of veterans faces a new set of challenges. We have an obligation to those who have served our Nation. As my friend, the gentlewoman from Arizona highlighted earlier in her remarks that an estimated 22 veterans commit suicide every single day. That is nearly one every hour. And we all know the statistics driving this epidemic. Military suicides are at their highest rate in 10 years. Mr. Speaker, veterans make up 20 percent of our suicides, despite making up only 10 percent of our population. Thirty percent of veterans have considered suicide. 37 percent of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans have been diagnosed with PTSD. And of the approximately 22 veterans who take their lives every day, roughly five actually get care through the VA health system. {time} 1630 It is easy to get lost in all those statistics. They are numbers. But behind each and every one of those is a real human being, a veteran with a real story that we must tell. We have a duty to help them. We all know how hard the Department of Veterans Affairs is working to keep up with this ongoing and persistent challenge, but we have to do more. That is why I proudly supported the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act, which was signed into law earlier this year. Once this legislation is fully implemented, it will take critical steps toward curbing the epidemic of veteran suicide by improving the VA resources and increasing oversight of programs designed to help our veterans get the care that they deserve. This is an important step toward stemming the ongoing crisis of veteran suicide, but it is not enough. This is why I have called on the Appropriations Committee to increase funding for veteran suicide prevention programs and outreach services. I hope all of you will join me in demanding more action for our veterans. If Congressman Evans were alive today, he would not rest until all of our veterans get the care and the support they have earned for protecting our Nation, and neither should we. Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte). Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an epidemic that is plaguing our servicemembers and our veterans, and that epidemic is suicide. Each day it is estimated, on average, 22 veterans commit suicide in the United States. That is more than double the rate for the civilian population, and it is an extremely tragic statistic. Earlier this year, the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act was signed into law to help combat this very serious problem. I applaud this step forward, but our work is far from over. We must continue to ensure that those veterans who are suffering know that they are not alone; they have family, friends, and resources readily available to help them heal and move forward. These men and women have given so much to this great Nation. It is our duty to walk with them during and after their service. I remain committed to providing the highest quality medical care and resources for these brave men and women who were wounded in the course of defending our freedom. I look forward to working with my colleagues to improve timely access to mental healthcare services to ensure our veterans in crisis receive the help that they need. I thank Mr. Benishek and Ms. Sinema for organizing this Special Order hour. Mr. BENISHEK. I yield to my colleague from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell). Mrs. DINGELL. I thank my friend from Michigan for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank my friends Congressman Benishek, Congresswoman Sinema, and Congresswoman Bustos for their leadership and for hosting this Special Order this evening on an issue that we all care very deeply about: the high rate of suicide among our veteran population. September is Suicide Prevention Month, and it is important that we draw attention to this critical issue. The facts are stark. My other colleagues have already mentioned them. A veteran commits suicide every 65 minutes. That means that 22 veterans a day are dying. Today we honor those that we have lost already and the families who have suffered so much and are left behind. These veterans were true American heroes who served their country and came home tormented. We can never forget the sacrifices that they have made. It is great, on this evening, to see my colleagues from both sides of the aisle here to talk about this issue, because it is my sincere hope that we can come together and rededicate ourselves to doing what is right for our veterans and making sure that we are dedicating sufficient resources to veterans' care. On Sunday night, in Michigan, I will gather with the family and friends of those veterans who have committed suicide in Michigan. They have built a cross for each of those lives to try to raise awareness in our community. In addition, at a meeting that I hold with my mayors, where normally we are talking about infrastructure or roads, two-thirds of that meeting was spent talking about veterans and the emotional issues we are dealing with in our communities as we see these veterans struggling. The mayors and I have started a task force to address these issues. We have started a veterans' court that has been following the model of other places, trying to raise awareness so that in the community, we see when someone is struggling and are able to put out a helping hand. My next-door neighbor's young son, when tormented, needed help; and when he called, he couldn't get it. We all have got to come together. These brave young men and women have served our country. When they came home from World War II and Korea, we celebrated them. We thanked them for their service. We formed a community around them. These young men and women are fighting for us. They are fighting for freedom. They are fighting for world security. We have an obligation to help them when they come home, to help get them the resources that they need. They have memories that haunt them. They have memories that torment them. This Suicide Prevention Month, we have to take the stigma away from mental illness. We have to recognize that young people need help sometimes, and we have to be there for them. Tonight I thank my colleagues for organizing this Special Order so that we remind people that those who have served us sometimes need that helping hand. If we can prevent it, we must, any young person from taking their [[Page H6217]] life because of the service that they gave this country. Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, nearly 10 million Americans have serious mental illness, and millions go without proper treatment or care because our Nation's mental health system is broken not only for our veterans, but for our nonveterans as well. My next speaker is Dr. Tim Murphy from Pennsylvania, the author of the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act, H.R. 2646. This will overhaul our Nation's mental healthcare system, adding grants for more psychiatrists, authorizing intervention programs, and fixing current nationwide shortages of crisis mental health beds. I yield to my colleague from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murphy). Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman for organizing this very important Special Order. Mr. Speaker, I will tell the stories of three servicemembers that I have known in my time in the Navy, in my work at Walter Reed Hospital: One is of a soldier who tried to kill himself. He put a gun to his head, pulled the trigger. The gun fired, but it didn't kill him. It left him partially blind and with a significant head injury. He struggles through life. He continues to live, but the things that caused him to do that have not left. The second is of a marine that I knew, the son of a friend, who died recently. I went to his funeral and saw him lying there, looking so peaceful. The third, a soldier, I was called upon by the family to go visit him because he had been in his room for months. He covered the windows with camouflage. Bottles and bottles of medication littered his room, holes were punched in the walls, and he felt abandoned. There was nothing more we could do for the soldier who had killed himself; there were some things we could do for the soldier who harmed himself; but there was a lot we could do for the soldier who hid himself. When soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen look down the road to suicide, there are multiple reasons. Very often it is because they have faced those unspeakable horrors of war. Perhaps they have had multiple deployments, strain within the family, the lost social relationships, divorce, job complications, which whittled and chipped away at their strength. Perhaps they lost that sense of belonging that they had with their platoon or their company, that friendship with those who faced battles with them that somehow helped prop them back up. In many cases, it is dealing with the traumatic brain injury, of the multiple blasts, explosions, the primary, secondary, or tertiary wounds that they had which affected their brain functioning and leaves them with symptoms oftentimes of psychological disorders. Sometimes that psychological disorder is that path to depression, that feeling of hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness that comes with clinical depression, when the person sometimes says: There is no treatment that can help me; I might as well give up. First let me say to veterans, Mr. Speaker, that there is treatment that can help. There is reason to hope. It is important that veterans seek out a therapist; and if that therapist doesn't seem like a good mix, seek another one. If that one doesn't seem like a good mix, seek another one. Keep going until you find the right person. It is important veterans understand their life is worth living. Yes, you are suffering in the moment, but you can't stop pursuing treatment. Don't seek the permanent solution to the temporary problem. There is always another way out besides suicide. Now, we make this more complicated for veterans, as we do with the rest of the community of people who are suffering from mental illness, by we simply don't have enough professionals out there to help. We have family members who don't see the signs of isolation and anger and drinking and drug abuse and irritability. But just because there is a healthcare provider out there, the family should not ever feel that they can't talk to that person. The healthcare provider, even without permission of the soldier, can listen; and it is important that family members contact someone even when that soldier says, ``I don't want to talk to anybody,'' because, very often, that is the disease speaking, that is the brain illness speaking. That is the part of the illness that says ``I either want to give up'' or ``I don't recognize I have a problem.'' Loved ones can call for help, but we need other things taking place here as well. We have to have families who can help that person get out of a crisis. We have to help the family understand they need to remove the means of a suicide--if it is a firearm, if it is weapons, if is drugs. But what we need to do and what my bill (H.R. 2646), the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act, does is it changes the dynamics of what our country is doing, that has abusive policies and antifamily policies which actually prevent people from getting help. What we have to do is make sure we have more access to treatment. We need more psychiatrists and psychologists--it is as plain as that--by the thousands and tens of thousands. We do not have enough. So even when someone tries to seek help, it is difficult. We need more psychiatric hospital beds for those moments when a person needs a respite, someplace to go away from the crisis of everyday life. We don't have enough. We had 550,000 psychiatric hospital beds in the 1950s. We have less than 40,000 now. Part of that is because we have Medicaid rules out there and other rules that say, you know, we don't want hospital beds anymore. Look, I don't want to see people go back to the old asylums, but sometimes a person with that sense of helplessness and worthlessness needs a place to go to recover, to get better. We also have a VA system which has said: You are not going to continue some of these drugs. Your drug isn't on our formulary list. You are not going to take it anymore. I have other legislation in which says that, if a Department of Defense doctor prescribes a person medication and it is working, the VA should automatically, without question, carry that medication and provide ease of access for it. One of the reasons we even have the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans bill is because he couldn't get the medication that worked. It is our fault. We have met the enemy, and he is us, as one character famously said. The General Accounting Office also tells us we have a disorganized system, 112 Federal agencies--112--that are supposed to deal with mental illness. The GAO tells us they don't keep track of data. There is not accountability. They don't meet. Many of these agencies haven't even gotten together since 2009 to coordinate services. Twenty homeless programs, programs scattered throughout the Federal Government--we make it the most difficult for those who have the most difficulty. Sometimes what we do, though, is we reauthorize programs that work. But make no mistake, it is not enough. Anyone who thinks that Congress has been adequately addressing the needs of the mentally ill, the seriously mentally ill veterans, is naive. We are disillusioning ourselves into thinking that, because we did something, we did the right thing. So let me speak honestly: Congress' lack of comprehensive action and its snail pace in dealing with this shares the blame. We are not passive in this. We are active and codependent in this crisis that is inflicted upon Americans. When we are in this Chamber and we hear another tragic story of someone who has perhaps killed many people in the community and then killed themselves or they did suicide by cop, we have a moment of silence--and so we should--as we grieve over the loss of innocent life. But that moment of silence should not be accompanied with silent behavior. What we need are moments of action, and strong action at that. Not only do we have the soldier suicides, we had 41,000 suicides in this country in this last year; 43,000 drug overdose deaths; homicides by those with serious mental illness; people with mental illness who are the victims of crime and homicide. {time} 1645 Then we have that slow-motion death of the homeless and the seriously mentally ill who, themselves, have come to so many other chronic illnesses that--do you know what? They are not even a statistic. We don't count them. [[Page H6218]] If people want to help, if Members want to do something, here is an action plan: become cosponsors of the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act, H.R. 2646. Don't sit idly by. Don't say, ``Some other Member can do this; let it be someone else's problem.'' It is not. It is ours. As a nation, wouldn't we do better to act instead of grieve, to turn a blind eye and to hope that someone else takes care of it, or, worse yet, to be caught up in the politics, the partisan politics and the games that plague this Chamber that says: ``I am not going to let this party have a win or this party have a win''? In the meantime, people are dying, and we sit idly by. Mr. Speaker, suicide is a plague on our Nation, on our veterans. It is a plague on, as was said in Samuel 16, the last, the least, and the lonely. We must change this system that makes it difficult for those who have the most difficulty. We must remove abusive Federal policies that say that you can't see two doctors in the same day; you can't have more than 16 hospital beds; that say it is okay to have Federal programs and grants going out there for absurd concepts like making collages, making masks; telling people to get off their medication; a Web site to help people in Boston, when it is cold, deal with the anxiety of snow; a $425,000 Web site for 3-year-olds with sing-along songs; and a $22,000 painting which sits in the Office of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to give them awareness. The only thing I am aware of, Mr. Speaker, is that it is a waste of money--a waste of taxpayers' money--and a waste of lives. If this Congress gets its act together and admits it, and if our leadership says that we can run lots of bills--and we can run lots of bills real quick--and we can suspend the bills and bring bills to the floor in a moment's notice, I have had this bill sitting around 3 years. We revise it and revise it again. We have the support of multiple organizations across the country, whether they represent parents or consumers or professionals, and another day goes by; and every few seconds another person commits suicide or has a drug overdose death, and we go home at night and sleep snugly in our beds. It doesn't have to be this way if we have more providers and if we have a Federal Government in Congress that says that we must be guided by wisdom, compassion, and faith, that says we will not wait anymore and that we will take the collective voice of every Member of Congress to do that. A few hours ago, we had the Holy Father, Pope Francis, speak in this very Chamber. His words still echo in this community. But he called us to do things together, to be motivated by love, to be engaged in a dialogue and conversation, and that is a conversation we must be having about mental illness as well, to say that we can no longer put this off. I hope Members, if they really are concerned about veteran suicide-- as I believe we are--if they are really concerned about the problems of serious mental illness--as I know we are--if Members are tired of moments of silence in those times when we come together for a few minutes of compassion, we recognize that is not enough--and I know we are--then I hope every Member, every Democrat and Republican, talks to their leadership, talks to their committee members, talks to each other and says, ``Move this bill. Make something happen.'' By the way, Mr. Speaker, let me close with this. The story I told you has a good ending. The soldier that I visited in his home with the windows covered with camouflage, with medications scattered throughout the house, and with holes punched in the wall because of his anger, we did get him help. He got stabilized. He took those barriers off the windows. He let the bright light of the world shine in again, and he engaged with people again. He has hope again. That is a story that comes because people stepped forward and helped him. The people at hospitals and military hospitals can do that. Let's make sure that the others like him whom we have not discovered yet, who are still hiding in their rooms, we get to them before their lives are taken. This is what we should be doing as a nation. Failing to do this means we are culpable as this tragedy continues. Mr. BENISHEK. I would like to thank my colleague for his passion on this issue. I would now like to yield to my colleague from California (Mr. Peters). Mr. PETERS. I want to thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to thank Congresswoman Sinema and Congressman Benishek for their leadership on this issue, which is also of prime interest to me, this epidemic of suicide in our veteran community. Mr. Speaker, San Diego has the third largest population of veterans in the country, more than 235,000. One of the most important jobs we have here in Congress is to honor their service by keeping our promises to them. September is Suicide Prevention Month, a time to focus on ending the scourge of veteran suicide that has hurt families and communities across the country. Combating suicide takes the full spectrum of services, including deployment, education, drug and alcohol abuse treatment, and ending the stigma around mental health. In San Diego, I am pleased to say, the nonprofit sector has really stepped up. We have been at the forefront of finding innovative ways to approach veteran suicide by providing services and developing cohesion in the local veteran community that came together after the Vietnam war to increase collaboration among government, private groups, and community partners. San Diego is the home of, in my district, 0800, which is an organization doing innovative work to assist easing the transition between Active Duty and civilian life. It is a community-based nonprofit that takes the existing service structure, works with the servicemembers before they leave the military to get them set, and provides the case management after they return to the civilian world to ensure that the benefits and services that veterans have earned are provided to them. Another organization, the Three Wise Men Foundation, founded by combat veteran Nathan Fletcher, utilizes community engagement and workout trainings to help veterans who were in combat and have struggled to reintegrate after coming home. There is a powerful article by Dave Phillips that The New York Times highlighted this weekend about how many veterans are turning to each other to survive. To quote that article: ``Feeling abandoned, members of the battalion have turned to a survival strategy they learned at war: depending on one another.'' We have all heard the devastating statistics of veteran suicides in the country, but thus far, the response has failed to properly address the dire situation, and we have a responsibility here in Congress to do much more than we have. The statistics don't tell the heart-wrenching stories that so many of us have heard from parents, spouses, and the loved ones of the veteran who has taken his or her own life. One such couple that Congresswoman Sinema and I know, and I have been honored to work with, is Dr. Howard and Jean Somers, who, after losing their son, Daniel, to suicide, have become tireless advocates to fix and reform the broken healthcare system at the Department of Veterans Affairs. We know that bipartisan reforms to the VA can make a difference. The Clay Hunt Act showed us that and garnered a new generation of mental health and suicide prevention services at the VA, and the Veterans Choice Act will bring accountability to a system wrought with oversight and leadership challenges, allowing for faster service closer to the veteran in need. But fixing an inefficient VA requires more than just increased funding. It requires real changes to get veterans care in new and flexible ways. We need to allow the VA to better use innovative technologies, like wireless medicine, that allow veterans access to care from the comfort of their homes, which can save lives and decrease costs to taxpayers. We need to break the stigma around mental health, particularly post- traumatic stress. The service-connected injury needs to be treated with the same gravity and respect as the physical injury that so many of our valiant warfighters have battled. So thank you again, Congresswoman Sinema and Congressman Benishek, for your consistent advocacy on reforming the VA and on ending the tragedy of veteran suicide. We have much more [[Page H6219]] work to do, and I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to work with you on it. Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Abraham). The gentleman has 8 minutes remaining. Mr. BENISHEK. I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho). Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to thank my colleagues, Representatives Sinema and Dr. Benishek, for their leadership in arranging such a Special Order on such an important topic and for the invitation to speak this afternoon on suicide prevention awareness. September is Suicide Prevention Awareness Month. It is so important that we have an open and honest dialogue about the issue of suicide. The more we talk about it, we increase people's awareness, and they are there to help the people in need. There are alternatives, and they do not have to suffer in silence. From comedian Robin Williams, to bullied young kids, to the brave men and women from our Nation's military returning from the battlefield, suicide does not discriminate. Emotional pain and despair can set in and take root in the minds and bodies of all ages across all demographics. Often, the signs of suicide go undetected, which leave those left behind asking: Why did this happen, and what could I have done to prevent this tragedy? Today a disproportionate amount of our Nation's veterans are falling victim to suicide. After all they have given to this country, it is tragic and unacceptable that our Nation's veterans often suffer in silence until it is too late for those around them to help. By shining a light on veteran suicide and all suicides, we as a nation can start to understand the urgency with which we need to solve and prevent this epidemic that our veterans, their families, and their friends struggle with. Not recognizing the signs early enough all too often leads to a loss of life. This is an important thing that we as a nation need to come together and have a strong support system in place so that those in need will reach out and not be stigmatized. Again, I want to thank our colleagues. Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright). Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to thank, particularly, Representatives Sinema and Benishek for bringing up this Special Order hour. For my own part, I speak for the northeastern part of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is home to nearly 1 million veterans. These are brave men and women who serve this Nation, a Nation that has, regrettably, not always served them. Many of the veterans suffer from mental illness. A study, as you all know, has been released that found that 22 veterans commit suicide every day. This is unacceptable. As someone who deeply cares about veterans' issues, I was proud to introduce legislation in the last Congress that would fast-track the hiring of psychiatrists who have completed a residency at a VA facility, and I was gratified that the President has incorporated many of those ideas in his policy. Initially, in this Congress, I plan to reintroduce the Veterans Mental Health Accessibility Act, an important piece of legislation that aims to provide for our brave servicemen and -women when they return from combat with both easily visible and difficult-to-detect wounds. While the physical wounds are evident immediately, the mental health ones may take longer to manifest themselves. Here is the problem: as many as 30 percent of Operation Iraqi and Enduring Freedom veterans face the possible diagnosis of a mental health disorder. But after 5 postservice years, if a condition is not diagnosed, veterans would go to the back of the line. They have missed their statute of limitations in 5 years and then experience an average wait time to receive benefits of more than 1 year. This could mean the difference between life and death. Unfortunately, mental health disorders are harder to diagnose, may take much longer to manifest, and many veterans might delay seeking treatment. We are putting it on them to self-diagnose and report within that 5-year span. We should not hold mental health disorders to the same timeline as a broken leg. The Veterans Mental Health Accessibility Act would ensure that no veteran would be denied mental health treatment no matter when combat-related mental health disorders first appear. I believe we owe a great debt to those warfighters who serve our country through military service, including those who stood ready at a moment's notice to fight for our freedom. Mr. Speaker, as long as I am a Member of Congress, I will be working to increase knowledge on this subject, to correct the shortcomings of the VA system, and to ensure that the men and women of our Armed Forces who bravely serve this country receive all the benefits to which they are entitled. Mr. BENISHEK. Nice comments, Mr. Cartwright. I appreciate it. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski), my colleague on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. Mrs. WALORSKI. Thank you, Mr. Benishek. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the distinguished gentleman from Michigan and the distinguished gentlewoman from Arizona for yielding. In honor of Suicide Prevention Month, I rise today to increase awareness about some of our bravest and most at risk: our veterans. Many of our Nation's troops, both past and present, face struggles many of us can never imagine. Every day 22 veterans take their own lives. I have experienced this same tragedy in my own district. In 2013, a constituent in my district, a former marine who served in Vietnam, began experiencing severe pain over his entire body. After visiting four VA clinics and facilities, doctors could not diagnose his condition and instead prescribed morphine for ongoing and oftentimes excruciating pain. To help manage his undiagnosed condition, doctors recommended he enter a nursing home. Unfortunately, he discovered he did not meet the eligibility requirements. Later that day, his wife was told that she had 1 hour to pick him up or they, the VA, would send him home in a cab without clothes since he did not have any at the hospital to wear. Two days later, just a week before Christmas, the pain proved too great for him to bear and he took his own life. His story details the urgency our Nation's heroes deserve. Instead of ending in heartbreak, veterans and their families need to know their lives count, which is why we must improve veterans' access to physical and mental health care. Together, we can change this system to prevent tragedies like this from ever happening again. {time} 1700 Mr. BENISHEK. Thank you very much, Mrs. Walorski. I really appreciate your comments. I think Dr. Murphy brought up a good point when he was speaking. We just recently in this House passed the 21st Century Cures Act, H.R. 6. That has been endorsed by a wide variety of professional and medical organizations, such as the American Association for Cancer Research and The Cure Alliance. We passed this bill by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 344-77. This is a piece of legislation that is going to change the way we do research at the NIH, that is going to change health care for all Americans. There is no reason that we shouldn't be able to pass a mental health care bill similar to that with a wide bipartisan effort. Today Ms. Sinema and I are leading a bipartisan group of Members of Congress to make mental health care an issue on which to move forward, and it has really been a great way to get this started. I yield to Ms. Sinema if she would like to add a few more thoughts in that regard. Ms. SINEMA. Thank you very much, Congressman Benishek. I know we will be continuing this in the next Special Order so as to allow more of our colleagues to speak, and I am really looking forward to that time. Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. [[Page H6220]] ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6214-H6220] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PREVENTING VETERAN SUICIDE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Benishek) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. General Leave Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the topic of preventing veteran suicide. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize September as Suicide Prevention Month. I want to thank my colleague, Kyrsten Sinema, for joining me and putting together this Special Order hour. For the next hour, we will discuss an issue that is very important to me and should be unacceptable in a nation of our resources: veteran suicide. A veteran in this country commits suicide every 65 minutes. That is 22 lives extinguished every day. As the father of a veteran, a doctor who worked at a VA hospital in northern Michigan, and the chairman of the Health Subcommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I know that the challenges of military life do not end once our servicemembers retire from Active Duty. The mental wounds of war may be invisible, but they are no less real to the young men and women suffering from them. Facing high unemployment rates, the stigma of post-traumatic stress disorder, and a loss of military fellowship, returning veterans often face a crisis of confidence at the very moment they should feel nothing but relief and rest. Congress did make a real impact early this year when we passed the Clay Hunt SAV Act, which is helping the VA put the very best mental healthcare professionals to work for our veterans and creating peer support groups to help catch those transitioning servicemembers who may otherwise fall through the cracks. However, so much more needs to be done. I am grateful to my colleagues for standing with me today for our most vulnerable veterans and their families. I look forward to hearing what they have to say and to working with them to end veteran suicide. I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Abraham). Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Dr. Benishek, for having this. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues to raise awareness of veteran suicide prevention. Let me underscore the word ``prevention''-- prevention because veteran suicide is a public health tragedy. As a doctor, I know it is a preventable tragedy. For far too long, PTSD has been stigmatized, and it is time to remove that stigma. Twenty-two percent of Americans who commit suicide are veterans. That statistic is unacceptable to me, and it should be unacceptable to the American people. Our Nation's heroes should come home to readily available mental health care. They should not have to wait days, weeks, or even months to receive treatment. Veterans should not have to wait at all. The Clay Hunt SAV Act, which was signed into law earlier this year, was an excellent first step in giving veterans options, but there is more work to be done. As a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and a veteran myself, I will continue to fight for a more streamlined system to treat our veterans suffering from PTSD and continue to work to reform the VA system to be a system that puts the veteran first, not the bureaucrat. Mr. BENISHEK. I yield to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. Sinema). Ms. SINEMA. Thank you, Congressman Benishek, for joining me today as a cohost of tonight's Special Order. September is Suicide Prevention Month, a time for our Nation to raise awareness about the persistent scourge of suicide. Tens of thousands of Americans each year purposefully die by their own actions. They are our neighbors and our friends, our sons and our daughters; and too often, they are the men and women who have served our country honorably in the United States military. An estimated 22 veterans lose their lives to suicide every single day in our country. That is one life lost every 65 minutes. Typically, time in the House Chamber is split. Republicans have 1 hour and Democrats have another hour, but Congressman Benishek and I believe that this issue is too important to be overshadowed by partisan politics. That is why we have joined together today, with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, to show our commitment to solving this problem together and to finding real solutions for our country's veterans. This is the third year we have assembled in this Chamber to raise awareness and to send a clear message that the epidemic of veteran suicide must end. We have so much work left to do. So today, we demonstrate our ongoing support for the individuals, organizations, and agencies devoted to preventing the epidemic of veteran suicide. Today, we challenge the VA, the Department of Defense, and our fellow lawmakers to do more. We are failing in our obligation to do right by those who have served so honorably. Finally, we send a message to military families who have experienced this tragedy in their own families: Your family's loss is not forgotten. We work for the memory of your loved ones. We will not rest until every veteran in this country has access to the care that he or she needs. {time} 1615 I have often shared the story of a young veteran in my district, Sergeant Daniel Somers. Sergeant Somers was an Army veteran of two tours in Iraq. Diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury and suffering from post- traumatic stress disorder, Sergeant Somers took his own life after struggling with the VA bureaucracy and not getting the help he needed in time. Together with the Somers family, we worked to develop the Classified Veterans Access to Care Act to ensure that all veterans, including those who served with classified experiences, can get immediate access to the mental health care that they need in the appropriate care setting. I recently testified before the House Veterans Affairs Committee on the need for this important legislation, and I am grateful for the committee's support for this legislation. I am grateful for my cosponsor, Congressman Dan Benishek. I will continue working with the committee to ensure that no veteran feels trapped, like Sergeant Somers did, and that all of our veterans have access to appropriate mental health care. My State, Arizona, is ground zero for the VA's failure to take care of our veterans. It has been over a year since we learned about the veterans at the Phoenix VA Hospital who were kept on secret waiting lists, forced to wait months, even years, before seeing a doctor, unable to access the care they needed. These revelations were shocking and sickening. Arizona veterans died while waiting for care. That is absolutely unacceptable and, frankly, it is un-American. So in Arizona, we took immediate action when we learned from brave whistleblowers about this tragedy. Not waiting for the Phoenix VA to fix their problems, we came together as a community to make sure that Arizona veterans get the access to the care they needed. Mr. Speaker, since last summer, we have held six veterans clinic, helping nearly 1,000 veterans and military families get access to the benefits they have earned. Our team helps veterans in getting access to benefits, to housing, to job placement, to education. We established a Veterans Mental Health Working Group for community [[Page H6215]] providers, veterans service organizations, and the local VA, to bring them all together to work to improve access to services. Our group meets bimonthly and has made important progress. These are some examples of the good that can come when people set aside partisanship and put veterans first. That is what is needed from all of us in this Chamber and the agencies we work with: to put aside partisanship and solve the problem we face to end the scourge of veteran suicide in this country. Mr. BENISHEK. I thank the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. Sinema). I really appreciate your comments and your concern for this significant problem. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to outline something that I have become aware of in my time here in office. While this problem is very monumental, there are many small things that the VA can do right now to make a difference. One of these changes can be made by the VA immediately. I would like to read a letter I received recently from an American Legion representative in my district that illustrates the problem better than I could. Dear Dr. Benishek: Here is the situation. Recently I encountered a suicidal veteran from the Sault area who had severe PTSD, 100 percent VA disabled. He called me on a Wednesday hysterical and said that he was contemplating suicide. He was traveling around with his wife in the car at the time. I thought this was a very dangerous situation. After several back-and-forth conversations with him, I found out he was not taking any medicines and had not seen his VA psychiatrist in a long time because, as he put it, the psychiatrist was not helping him and it seemed that he didn't really care. He insisted that he stay at Wilwin, the American Legion veterans facility, but I told him we needed his psychiatrist's okay. As a veteran myself, I thought I should try to help him the best that I could. So I called the VA Suicide Hotline to get answers on how I should handle the situation. Here's the problem. I called the Iron Mountain VA. The call started out saying, if you are having a medical or mental health emergency, please hang up and dial 911. If you are having thoughts of hurting yourself and want to talk to a mental health professional, please hang up and dial 1-800-273-8255. If you are thinking of committing suicide, you are already frustrated to the point that you would be glad to talk to anyone, even if it is someone at the VA. Can you imagine a veteran in this position even having a paper and pencil in hand to write the number down? If he is unable to get the correct number the first time, he must redial the VA, go through the whole spiel again and, hopefully, write the number on a paper the second or third time before he can try dialing. Once dialed, the voice comes on the phone and says, if you are a veteran push 1 and so on. When I called the hotline after I pushed 1, listened to music for several minutes before a voice came on the phone, she told me that she was not a veteran, nor did she know much about PTSD veterans. What I needed was advice on how to handle the veteran I was working with, which she did give me. How many veterans have committed suicide because of the VA's red tape? Here's a solution. When the VA is called and the veteran is contemplating suicide or hurting himself, you should be able to push 1 to get a direct line to the suicide hotline. It should automatically register that the call is coming through the VA system and, yes, it is a veteran calling. This constituent was able to get the veteran he referred to the help that he needed, but he raised an incredibly good point that I brought up repeatedly with the VA. The VA told me it would take 6 months to change from an 800 number to simply dial 1. This is unacceptable. I call on the VA again today to make this change immediately. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from Nebraska (Mr. Ashford). Mr. ASHFORD. I thank the gentleman for the time. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss a subject many of our veterans and their families understandably find great difficulty in discussing. Veteran suicide, as we have already heard, is a major problem in our country. We have all heard the numbers. An estimated 22 veterans commit suicide every day. That is one life every hour. Please keep in mind those horrific numbers have names, the names of men and women who put themselves in harm's way in order to keep each and every one of us safe. Earlier this year we passed the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention of American Veterans Act. It addresses the need for more mental healthcare experts inside the VA along with expanding the time available to veterans to seek mental health care through the VA. The new law also calls for an evaluation of all VA mental health care and suicide prevention practices to determine what is working and make recommendations on what is not. This is a major step in the right direction, but we must continue to do more. I am proud to say, Mr. Speaker, that, in Omaha, we are currently working with the Department of Veterans Affairs to create a center of excellence, a national model for veterans' care that will include top- flight mental health care and other services so much needed by our veterans in our community. That treatment would cover post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety and problems relating to other people. The debt we owe the men and women who serve this country is a debt that can never be repaid. But we must continue to ensure that we keep our promises to our veterans and support their very unique healthcare issues. Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello). Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan for hosting this Special Order to raise awareness for an issue that impacts constituents in all of our congressional districts. We can all agree that, as Members of Congress, we need to prioritize our veterans. We also need to raise awareness about the invisible wounds many of them face. I am speaking about post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, depression, which can and often does lead to thoughts of suicide. Mr. Speaker, we also need to make sure that the loved ones of these veterans have the support they need so that they may best help those who are suffering from these invisible wounds. I have been here 9 months. The House has taken some very positive steps to help veterans since I have been here and improving suicide prevention programs. It has been said by several Members already here on the floor today, the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act, a commonsense bill that is going to increase access to mental health by creating a peer support and community outreach pilot program. It is going to boost accountability with mental health care by requiring an annual evaluation of VA mental health and suicide prevention programs. It is proof that, when we put party politics aside around here, we can get good things done. We should all be proud of that. I would like to direct Members' attention to H.R. 2915, the Female Veteran Suicide Prevention Act, which has been just passed out of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. It is time to bring this bill to the floor. It will direct the VA to identify mental healthcare prevention programs and metrics that are effective in treating female veterans as part of the evaluative process required by the Clay Hunt Act, and it would require the VA to accommodate a veteran's obligation to not properly disclose classified information. Mr. Speaker, suicide prevention programs are key to maintaining continual engagement with veterans and communities, as well as to raise awareness and to help intervene, when necessary. I would also add, let's keep in mind the Economic Opportunity Subcommittee on Veterans' Affairs, which I serve on, with many other hardworking Members who are working in a consensus-oriented fashion. We need to make sure that the Transition Assistance Program is working for our veterans. We need to make sure that, from a veterans' hiring preference program, that that is working. We need to make sure that we are utilizing the best that the private sector has to offer for workforce development training for veterans returning to civilian life. We know that there is an unfair stigma associated with those who may need to seek assistance with mental health. Part of the value of why we are here today is to raise awareness and help reduce that stigma and say that we understand that there are challenges for veterans returning to civilian life and we are here to help. [[Page H6216]] We want to raise awareness. We want to make sure that the programs that we have in place are working. We are going to continue to do that. I applaud those who helped organize this Special Order here today, and I am honored to participate in it. Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from Illinois (Mrs. Bustos). Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. Sinema) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Benishek) for convening this important discussion this afternoon. As I am sure we agree, we need to continue shining a light on the epidemic of veteran suicide so we can push to improve the resources available to the brave men and women who have served our Nation. Mr. Speaker, I come from a region of Illinois called the Quad Cities. For more than two decades, my seat was held by one of the strongest advocates for veterans who has ever worked in these Chambers. I am talking about the late and the great Congressman Lane Evans. Congressman Evans was a veteran of the Marine Corps who served this body from 1983 all the way to 2007. I was proud to call him my friend. As a veteran, he understood the challenges that many of our returning heroes confront after they come home. Congressman Evans was a tireless advocate for expanding resources to our veterans and providing the mental health services that many of them need to make a successful transition back to civilian life. Today, after more than a decade of war, this generation of veterans faces a new set of challenges. We have an obligation to those who have served our Nation. As my friend, the gentlewoman from Arizona highlighted earlier in her remarks that an estimated 22 veterans commit suicide every single day. That is nearly one every hour. And we all know the statistics driving this epidemic. Military suicides are at their highest rate in 10 years. Mr. Speaker, veterans make up 20 percent of our suicides, despite making up only 10 percent of our population. Thirty percent of veterans have considered suicide. 37 percent of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans have been diagnosed with PTSD. And of the approximately 22 veterans who take their lives every day, roughly five actually get care through the VA health system. {time} 1630 It is easy to get lost in all those statistics. They are numbers. But behind each and every one of those is a real human being, a veteran with a real story that we must tell. We have a duty to help them. We all know how hard the Department of Veterans Affairs is working to keep up with this ongoing and persistent challenge, but we have to do more. That is why I proudly supported the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act, which was signed into law earlier this year. Once this legislation is fully implemented, it will take critical steps toward curbing the epidemic of veteran suicide by improving the VA resources and increasing oversight of programs designed to help our veterans get the care that they deserve. This is an important step toward stemming the ongoing crisis of veteran suicide, but it is not enough. This is why I have called on the Appropriations Committee to increase funding for veteran suicide prevention programs and outreach services. I hope all of you will join me in demanding more action for our veterans. If Congressman Evans were alive today, he would not rest until all of our veterans get the care and the support they have earned for protecting our Nation, and neither should we. Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte). Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an epidemic that is plaguing our servicemembers and our veterans, and that epidemic is suicide. Each day it is estimated, on average, 22 veterans commit suicide in the United States. That is more than double the rate for the civilian population, and it is an extremely tragic statistic. Earlier this year, the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act was signed into law to help combat this very serious problem. I applaud this step forward, but our work is far from over. We must continue to ensure that those veterans who are suffering know that they are not alone; they have family, friends, and resources readily available to help them heal and move forward. These men and women have given so much to this great Nation. It is our duty to walk with them during and after their service. I remain committed to providing the highest quality medical care and resources for these brave men and women who were wounded in the course of defending our freedom. I look forward to working with my colleagues to improve timely access to mental healthcare services to ensure our veterans in crisis receive the help that they need. I thank Mr. Benishek and Ms. Sinema for organizing this Special Order hour. Mr. BENISHEK. I yield to my colleague from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell). Mrs. DINGELL. I thank my friend from Michigan for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank my friends Congressman Benishek, Congresswoman Sinema, and Congresswoman Bustos for their leadership and for hosting this Special Order this evening on an issue that we all care very deeply about: the high rate of suicide among our veteran population. September is Suicide Prevention Month, and it is important that we draw attention to this critical issue. The facts are stark. My other colleagues have already mentioned them. A veteran commits suicide every 65 minutes. That means that 22 veterans a day are dying. Today we honor those that we have lost already and the families who have suffered so much and are left behind. These veterans were true American heroes who served their country and came home tormented. We can never forget the sacrifices that they have made. It is great, on this evening, to see my colleagues from both sides of the aisle here to talk about this issue, because it is my sincere hope that we can come together and rededicate ourselves to doing what is right for our veterans and making sure that we are dedicating sufficient resources to veterans' care. On Sunday night, in Michigan, I will gather with the family and friends of those veterans who have committed suicide in Michigan. They have built a cross for each of those lives to try to raise awareness in our community. In addition, at a meeting that I hold with my mayors, where normally we are talking about infrastructure or roads, two-thirds of that meeting was spent talking about veterans and the emotional issues we are dealing with in our communities as we see these veterans struggling. The mayors and I have started a task force to address these issues. We have started a veterans' court that has been following the model of other places, trying to raise awareness so that in the community, we see when someone is struggling and are able to put out a helping hand. My next-door neighbor's young son, when tormented, needed help; and when he called, he couldn't get it. We all have got to come together. These brave young men and women have served our country. When they came home from World War II and Korea, we celebrated them. We thanked them for their service. We formed a community around them. These young men and women are fighting for us. They are fighting for freedom. They are fighting for world security. We have an obligation to help them when they come home, to help get them the resources that they need. They have memories that haunt them. They have memories that torment them. This Suicide Prevention Month, we have to take the stigma away from mental illness. We have to recognize that young people need help sometimes, and we have to be there for them. Tonight I thank my colleagues for organizing this Special Order so that we remind people that those who have served us sometimes need that helping hand. If we can prevent it, we must, any young person from taking their [[Page H6217]] life because of the service that they gave this country. Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, nearly 10 million Americans have serious mental illness, and millions go without proper treatment or care because our Nation's mental health system is broken not only for our veterans, but for our nonveterans as well. My next speaker is Dr. Tim Murphy from Pennsylvania, the author of the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act, H.R. 2646. This will overhaul our Nation's mental healthcare system, adding grants for more psychiatrists, authorizing intervention programs, and fixing current nationwide shortages of crisis mental health beds. I yield to my colleague from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murphy). Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman for organizing this very important Special Order. Mr. Speaker, I will tell the stories of three servicemembers that I have known in my time in the Navy, in my work at Walter Reed Hospital: One is of a soldier who tried to kill himself. He put a gun to his head, pulled the trigger. The gun fired, but it didn't kill him. It left him partially blind and with a significant head injury. He struggles through life. He continues to live, but the things that caused him to do that have not left. The second is of a marine that I knew, the son of a friend, who died recently. I went to his funeral and saw him lying there, looking so peaceful. The third, a soldier, I was called upon by the family to go visit him because he had been in his room for months. He covered the windows with camouflage. Bottles and bottles of medication littered his room, holes were punched in the walls, and he felt abandoned. There was nothing more we could do for the soldier who had killed himself; there were some things we could do for the soldier who harmed himself; but there was a lot we could do for the soldier who hid himself. When soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen look down the road to suicide, there are multiple reasons. Very often it is because they have faced those unspeakable horrors of war. Perhaps they have had multiple deployments, strain within the family, the lost social relationships, divorce, job complications, which whittled and chipped away at their strength. Perhaps they lost that sense of belonging that they had with their platoon or their company, that friendship with those who faced battles with them that somehow helped prop them back up. In many cases, it is dealing with the traumatic brain injury, of the multiple blasts, explosions, the primary, secondary, or tertiary wounds that they had which affected their brain functioning and leaves them with symptoms oftentimes of psychological disorders. Sometimes that psychological disorder is that path to depression, that feeling of hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness that comes with clinical depression, when the person sometimes says: There is no treatment that can help me; I might as well give up. First let me say to veterans, Mr. Speaker, that there is treatment that can help. There is reason to hope. It is important that veterans seek out a therapist; and if that therapist doesn't seem like a good mix, seek another one. If that one doesn't seem like a good mix, seek another one. Keep going until you find the right person. It is important veterans understand their life is worth living. Yes, you are suffering in the moment, but you can't stop pursuing treatment. Don't seek the permanent solution to the temporary problem. There is always another way out besides suicide. Now, we make this more complicated for veterans, as we do with the rest of the community of people who are suffering from mental illness, by we simply don't have enough professionals out there to help. We have family members who don't see the signs of isolation and anger and drinking and drug abuse and irritability. But just because there is a healthcare provider out there, the family should not ever feel that they can't talk to that person. The healthcare provider, even without permission of the soldier, can listen; and it is important that family members contact someone even when that soldier says, ``I don't want to talk to anybody,'' because, very often, that is the disease speaking, that is the brain illness speaking. That is the part of the illness that says ``I either want to give up'' or ``I don't recognize I have a problem.'' Loved ones can call for help, but we need other things taking place here as well. We have to have families who can help that person get out of a crisis. We have to help the family understand they need to remove the means of a suicide--if it is a firearm, if it is weapons, if is drugs. But what we need to do and what my bill (H.R. 2646), the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act, does is it changes the dynamics of what our country is doing, that has abusive policies and antifamily policies which actually prevent people from getting help. What we have to do is make sure we have more access to treatment. We need more psychiatrists and psychologists--it is as plain as that--by the thousands and tens of thousands. We do not have enough. So even when someone tries to seek help, it is difficult. We need more psychiatric hospital beds for those moments when a person needs a respite, someplace to go away from the crisis of everyday life. We don't have enough. We had 550,000 psychiatric hospital beds in the 1950s. We have less than 40,000 now. Part of that is because we have Medicaid rules out there and other rules that say, you know, we don't want hospital beds anymore. Look, I don't want to see people go back to the old asylums, but sometimes a person with that sense of helplessness and worthlessness needs a place to go to recover, to get better. We also have a VA system which has said: You are not going to continue some of these drugs. Your drug isn't on our formulary list. You are not going to take it anymore. I have other legislation in which says that, if a Department of Defense doctor prescribes a person medication and it is working, the VA should automatically, without question, carry that medication and provide ease of access for it. One of the reasons we even have the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans bill is because he couldn't get the medication that worked. It is our fault. We have met the enemy, and he is us, as one character famously said. The General Accounting Office also tells us we have a disorganized system, 112 Federal agencies--112--that are supposed to deal with mental illness. The GAO tells us they don't keep track of data. There is not accountability. They don't meet. Many of these agencies haven't even gotten together since 2009 to coordinate services. Twenty homeless programs, programs scattered throughout the Federal Government--we make it the most difficult for those who have the most difficulty. Sometimes what we do, though, is we reauthorize programs that work. But make no mistake, it is not enough. Anyone who thinks that Congress has been adequately addressing the needs of the mentally ill, the seriously mentally ill veterans, is naive. We are disillusioning ourselves into thinking that, because we did something, we did the right thing. So let me speak honestly: Congress' lack of comprehensive action and its snail pace in dealing with this shares the blame. We are not passive in this. We are active and codependent in this crisis that is inflicted upon Americans. When we are in this Chamber and we hear another tragic story of someone who has perhaps killed many people in the community and then killed themselves or they did suicide by cop, we have a moment of silence--and so we should--as we grieve over the loss of innocent life. But that moment of silence should not be accompanied with silent behavior. What we need are moments of action, and strong action at that. Not only do we have the soldier suicides, we had 41,000 suicides in this country in this last year; 43,000 drug overdose deaths; homicides by those with serious mental illness; people with mental illness who are the victims of crime and homicide. {time} 1645 Then we have that slow-motion death of the homeless and the seriously mentally ill who, themselves, have come to so many other chronic illnesses that--do you know what? They are not even a statistic. We don't count them. [[Page H6218]] If people want to help, if Members want to do something, here is an action plan: become cosponsors of the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act, H.R. 2646. Don't sit idly by. Don't say, ``Some other Member can do this; let it be someone else's problem.'' It is not. It is ours. As a nation, wouldn't we do better to act instead of grieve, to turn a blind eye and to hope that someone else takes care of it, or, worse yet, to be caught up in the politics, the partisan politics and the games that plague this Chamber that says: ``I am not going to let this party have a win or this party have a win''? In the meantime, people are dying, and we sit idly by. Mr. Speaker, suicide is a plague on our Nation, on our veterans. It is a plague on, as was said in Samuel 16, the last, the least, and the lonely. We must change this system that makes it difficult for those who have the most difficulty. We must remove abusive Federal policies that say that you can't see two doctors in the same day; you can't have more than 16 hospital beds; that say it is okay to have Federal programs and grants going out there for absurd concepts like making collages, making masks; telling people to get off their medication; a Web site to help people in Boston, when it is cold, deal with the anxiety of snow; a $425,000 Web site for 3-year-olds with sing-along songs; and a $22,000 painting which sits in the Office of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to give them awareness. The only thing I am aware of, Mr. Speaker, is that it is a waste of money--a waste of taxpayers' money--and a waste of lives. If this Congress gets its act together and admits it, and if our leadership says that we can run lots of bills--and we can run lots of bills real quick--and we can suspend the bills and bring bills to the floor in a moment's notice, I have had this bill sitting around 3 years. We revise it and revise it again. We have the support of multiple organizations across the country, whether they represent parents or consumers or professionals, and another day goes by; and every few seconds another person commits suicide or has a drug overdose death, and we go home at night and sleep snugly in our beds. It doesn't have to be this way if we have more providers and if we have a Federal Government in Congress that says that we must be guided by wisdom, compassion, and faith, that says we will not wait anymore and that we will take the collective voice of every Member of Congress to do that. A few hours ago, we had the Holy Father, Pope Francis, speak in this very Chamber. His words still echo in this community. But he called us to do things together, to be motivated by love, to be engaged in a dialogue and conversation, and that is a conversation we must be having about mental illness as well, to say that we can no longer put this off. I hope Members, if they really are concerned about veteran suicide-- as I believe we are--if they are really concerned about the problems of serious mental illness--as I know we are--if Members are tired of moments of silence in those times when we come together for a few minutes of compassion, we recognize that is not enough--and I know we are--then I hope every Member, every Democrat and Republican, talks to their leadership, talks to their committee members, talks to each other and says, ``Move this bill. Make something happen.'' By the way, Mr. Speaker, let me close with this. The story I told you has a good ending. The soldier that I visited in his home with the windows covered with camouflage, with medications scattered throughout the house, and with holes punched in the wall because of his anger, we did get him help. He got stabilized. He took those barriers off the windows. He let the bright light of the world shine in again, and he engaged with people again. He has hope again. That is a story that comes because people stepped forward and helped him. The people at hospitals and military hospitals can do that. Let's make sure that the others like him whom we have not discovered yet, who are still hiding in their rooms, we get to them before their lives are taken. This is what we should be doing as a nation. Failing to do this means we are culpable as this tragedy continues. Mr. BENISHEK. I would like to thank my colleague for his passion on this issue. I would now like to yield to my colleague from California (Mr. Peters). Mr. PETERS. I want to thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to thank Congresswoman Sinema and Congressman Benishek for their leadership on this issue, which is also of prime interest to me, this epidemic of suicide in our veteran community. Mr. Speaker, San Diego has the third largest population of veterans in the country, more than 235,000. One of the most important jobs we have here in Congress is to honor their service by keeping our promises to them. September is Suicide Prevention Month, a time to focus on ending the scourge of veteran suicide that has hurt families and communities across the country. Combating suicide takes the full spectrum of services, including deployment, education, drug and alcohol abuse treatment, and ending the stigma around mental health. In San Diego, I am pleased to say, the nonprofit sector has really stepped up. We have been at the forefront of finding innovative ways to approach veteran suicide by providing services and developing cohesion in the local veteran community that came together after the Vietnam war to increase collaboration among government, private groups, and community partners. San Diego is the home of, in my district, 0800, which is an organization doing innovative work to assist easing the transition between Active Duty and civilian life. It is a community-based nonprofit that takes the existing service structure, works with the servicemembers before they leave the military to get them set, and provides the case management after they return to the civilian world to ensure that the benefits and services that veterans have earned are provided to them. Another organization, the Three Wise Men Foundation, founded by combat veteran Nathan Fletcher, utilizes community engagement and workout trainings to help veterans who were in combat and have struggled to reintegrate after coming home. There is a powerful article by Dave Phillips that The New York Times highlighted this weekend about how many veterans are turning to each other to survive. To quote that article: ``Feeling abandoned, members of the battalion have turned to a survival strategy they learned at war: depending on one another.'' We have all heard the devastating statistics of veteran suicides in the country, but thus far, the response has failed to properly address the dire situation, and we have a responsibility here in Congress to do much more than we have. The statistics don't tell the heart-wrenching stories that so many of us have heard from parents, spouses, and the loved ones of the veteran who has taken his or her own life. One such couple that Congresswoman Sinema and I know, and I have been honored to work with, is Dr. Howard and Jean Somers, who, after losing their son, Daniel, to suicide, have become tireless advocates to fix and reform the broken healthcare system at the Department of Veterans Affairs. We know that bipartisan reforms to the VA can make a difference. The Clay Hunt Act showed us that and garnered a new generation of mental health and suicide prevention services at the VA, and the Veterans Choice Act will bring accountability to a system wrought with oversight and leadership challenges, allowing for faster service closer to the veteran in need. But fixing an inefficient VA requires more than just increased funding. It requires real changes to get veterans care in new and flexible ways. We need to allow the VA to better use innovative technologies, like wireless medicine, that allow veterans access to care from the comfort of their homes, which can save lives and decrease costs to taxpayers. We need to break the stigma around mental health, particularly post- traumatic stress. The service-connected injury needs to be treated with the same gravity and respect as the physical injury that so many of our valiant warfighters have battled. So thank you again, Congresswoman Sinema and Congressman Benishek, for your consistent advocacy on reforming the VA and on ending the tragedy of veteran suicide. We have much more [[Page H6219]] work to do, and I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to work with you on it. Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Abraham). The gentleman has 8 minutes remaining. Mr. BENISHEK. I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho). Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to thank my colleagues, Representatives Sinema and Dr. Benishek, for their leadership in arranging such a Special Order on such an important topic and for the invitation to speak this afternoon on suicide prevention awareness. September is Suicide Prevention Awareness Month. It is so important that we have an open and honest dialogue about the issue of suicide. The more we talk about it, we increase people's awareness, and they are there to help the people in need. There are alternatives, and they do not have to suffer in silence. From comedian Robin Williams, to bullied young kids, to the brave men and women from our Nation's military returning from the battlefield, suicide does not discriminate. Emotional pain and despair can set in and take root in the minds and bodies of all ages across all demographics. Often, the signs of suicide go undetected, which leave those left behind asking: Why did this happen, and what could I have done to prevent this tragedy? Today a disproportionate amount of our Nation's veterans are falling victim to suicide. After all they have given to this country, it is tragic and unacceptable that our Nation's veterans often suffer in silence until it is too late for those around them to help. By shining a light on veteran suicide and all suicides, we as a nation can start to understand the urgency with which we need to solve and prevent this epidemic that our veterans, their families, and their friends struggle with. Not recognizing the signs early enough all too often leads to a loss of life. This is an important thing that we as a nation need to come together and have a strong support system in place so that those in need will reach out and not be stigmatized. Again, I want to thank our colleagues. Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright). Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to thank, particularly, Representatives Sinema and Benishek for bringing up this Special Order hour. For my own part, I speak for the northeastern part of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is home to nearly 1 million veterans. These are brave men and women who serve this Nation, a Nation that has, regrettably, not always served them. Many of the veterans suffer from mental illness. A study, as you all know, has been released that found that 22 veterans commit suicide every day. This is unacceptable. As someone who deeply cares about veterans' issues, I was proud to introduce legislation in the last Congress that would fast-track the hiring of psychiatrists who have completed a residency at a VA facility, and I was gratified that the President has incorporated many of those ideas in his policy. Initially, in this Congress, I plan to reintroduce the Veterans Mental Health Accessibility Act, an important piece of legislation that aims to provide for our brave servicemen and -women when they return from combat with both easily visible and difficult-to-detect wounds. While the physical wounds are evident immediately, the mental health ones may take longer to manifest themselves. Here is the problem: as many as 30 percent of Operation Iraqi and Enduring Freedom veterans face the possible diagnosis of a mental health disorder. But after 5 postservice years, if a condition is not diagnosed, veterans would go to the back of the line. They have missed their statute of limitations in 5 years and then experience an average wait time to receive benefits of more than 1 year. This could mean the difference between life and death. Unfortunately, mental health disorders are harder to diagnose, may take much longer to manifest, and many veterans might delay seeking treatment. We are putting it on them to self-diagnose and report within that 5-year span. We should not hold mental health disorders to the same timeline as a broken leg. The Veterans Mental Health Accessibility Act would ensure that no veteran would be denied mental health treatment no matter when combat-related mental health disorders first appear. I believe we owe a great debt to those warfighters who serve our country through military service, including those who stood ready at a moment's notice to fight for our freedom. Mr. Speaker, as long as I am a Member of Congress, I will be working to increase knowledge on this subject, to correct the shortcomings of the VA system, and to ensure that the men and women of our Armed Forces who bravely serve this country receive all the benefits to which they are entitled. Mr. BENISHEK. Nice comments, Mr. Cartwright. I appreciate it. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski), my colleague on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. Mrs. WALORSKI. Thank you, Mr. Benishek. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the distinguished gentleman from Michigan and the distinguished gentlewoman from Arizona for yielding. In honor of Suicide Prevention Month, I rise today to increase awareness about some of our bravest and most at risk: our veterans. Many of our Nation's troops, both past and present, face struggles many of us can never imagine. Every day 22 veterans take their own lives. I have experienced this same tragedy in my own district. In 2013, a constituent in my district, a former marine who served in Vietnam, began experiencing severe pain over his entire body. After visiting four VA clinics and facilities, doctors could not diagnose his condition and instead prescribed morphine for ongoing and oftentimes excruciating pain. To help manage his undiagnosed condition, doctors recommended he enter a nursing home. Unfortunately, he discovered he did not meet the eligibility requirements. Later that day, his wife was told that she had 1 hour to pick him up or they, the VA, would send him home in a cab without clothes since he did not have any at the hospital to wear. Two days later, just a week before Christmas, the pain proved too great for him to bear and he took his own life. His story details the urgency our Nation's heroes deserve. Instead of ending in heartbreak, veterans and their families need to know their lives count, which is why we must improve veterans' access to physical and mental health care. Together, we can change this system to prevent tragedies like this from ever happening again. {time} 1700 Mr. BENISHEK. Thank you very much, Mrs. Walorski. I really appreciate your comments. I think Dr. Murphy brought up a good point when he was speaking. We just recently in this House passed the 21st Century Cures Act, H.R. 6. That has been endorsed by a wide variety of professional and medical organizations, such as the American Association for Cancer Research and The Cure Alliance. We passed this bill by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 344-77. This is a piece of legislation that is going to change the way we do research at the NIH, that is going to change health care for all Americans. There is no reason that we shouldn't be able to pass a mental health care bill similar to that with a wide bipartisan effort. Today Ms. Sinema and I are leading a bipartisan group of Members of Congress to make mental health care an issue on which to move forward, and it has really been a great way to get this started. I yield to Ms. Sinema if she would like to add a few more thoughts in that regard. Ms. SINEMA. Thank you very much, Congressman Benishek. I know we will be continuing this in the next Special Order so as to allow more of our colleagues to speak, and I am really looking forward to that time. Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

joining me and putting together this special order hour. for the next hour, we will discuss an issue that is very important to me and should be unacceptable in a nation of our resources: veteran suicide. a veteran in this country commits suicide every 65 minutes. that is 22 lives extinguished every day. as the father of a veteran, a doctor who worked at a va hospital in northern michigan, and the chairman of the health subcommittee on veterans' affairs, i know that the challenges of military life do not end once our servicemembers retire from active duty. the mental wounds of war may be invisible, but they are no less real to the young men and women suffering from them. facing high unemployment rates, the stigma of post-traumatic stress disorder, and a loss of military fellowship, returning veterans often face a crisis of confidence at the very moment they should feel nothing but relief and rest. congress did make a real impact early this year when we passed the clay hunt sav act, which is helping the va put the very best mental healthcare professionals to work for our veterans and creating peer support groups to help catch those transitioning servicemembers who may otherwise fall through the cracks. however, so much more needs to be done. i am grateful to my colleagues for standing with me today for our most vulnerable veterans and their families. i look forward to hearing what they have to say and to working with them to end veteran suicide. i yield to the gentleman from louisiana (mr. abraham). mr. abraham. thank you, dr. benishek, for having this. mr. speaker, i rise today with my colleagues to raise awareness of veteran suicide prevention. let me underscore the word ``prevention''-- prevention because veteran suicide is a public health tragedy. as a doctor, i know it is a preventable tragedy. for far too long, ptsd has been stigmatized, and it is time to remove that stigma. twenty-two percent of americans who commit suicide are veterans. that statistic is unacceptable to me, and it should be unacceptable to the american people. our nation's heroes should come home to readily available mental health care. they should not have to wait days, weeks, or even months to receive treatment. veterans should not have to wait at all. the clay hunt sav act, which was signed into law earlier this year, was an excellent first step in giving veterans options, but there is more work to be done. as a member of the veterans' affairs committee and a veteran myself, i will continue to fight for a more streamlined system to treat our veterans suffering from ptsd and continue to work to reform the va system to be a system that puts the veteran first, not the bureaucrat. mr. benishek. i yield to the gentlewoman from arizona (ms. sinema). ms. sinema. thank you, congressman benishek, for joining me today as a cohost of tonight's special order. september is suicide prevention month, a time for our nation to raise awareness about the persistent scourge of suicide. tens of thousands of americans each year purposefully die by their own actions. they are our neighbors and our friends, our sons and our daughters; and too often, they are the men and women who have served our country honorably in the united states military. an estimated 22 veterans lose their lives to suicide every single day in our country. that is one life lost every 65 minutes. typically, time in the house chamber is split. republicans have 1 hour and democrats have another hour, but congressman benishek and i believe that this issue is too important to be overshadowed by partisan politics. that is why we have joined together today, with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, to show our commitment to solving this problem together and to finding real solutions for our country's veterans. this is the third year we have assembled in this chamber to raise awareness and to send a clear message that the epidemic of veteran suicide must end. we have so much work left to do. so today, we demonstrate our ongoing support for the individuals, organizations, and agencies devoted to preventing the epidemic of veteran suicide. today, we challenge the va, the department of defense, and our fellow lawmakers to do more. we are failing in our obligation to do right by those who have served so honorably. finally, we send a message to military families who have experienced this tragedy in their own families: your family's loss is not forgotten. we work for the memory of your loved ones. we will not rest until every veteran in this country has access to the care that he or she needs. {time} 1615 i have often shared the story of a young veteran in my district, sergeant daniel somers. sergeant somers was an army veteran of two tours in iraq. diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury and suffering from post- traumatic stress disorder, sergeant somers took his own life after struggling with the va bureaucracy and not getting the help he needed in time. together with the somers family, we worked to develop the classified veterans access to care act to ensure that all veterans, including those who served with classified experiences, can get immediate access to the mental health care that they need in the appropriate care setting. i recently testified before the house veterans affairs committee on the need for this important legislation, and i am grateful for the committee's support for this legislation. i am grateful for my cosponsor, congressman dan benishek. i will continue working with the committee to ensure that no veteran feels trapped, like sergeant somers did, and that all of our veterans have access to appropriate mental health care. my state, arizona, is ground zero for the va's failure to take care of our veterans. it has been over a year since we learned about the veterans at the phoenix va hospital who were kept on secret waiting lists, forced to wait months, even years, before seeing a doctor, unable to access the care they needed. these revelations were shocking and sickening. arizona veterans died while waiting for care. that is absolutely unacceptable and, frankly, it is un-american. so in arizona, we took immediate action when we learned from brave whistleblowers about this tragedy. not waiting for the phoenix va to fix their problems, we came together as a community to make sure that arizona veterans get the access to the care they needed. mr. speaker, since last summer, we have held six veterans clinic, helping nearly 1,000 veterans and military families get access to the benefits they have earned. our team helps veterans in getting access to benefits, to housing, to job placement, to education. we established a veterans mental health working group for community [[page h6215]] providers, veterans service organizations, and the local va, to bring them all together to work to improve access to services. our group meets bimonthly and has made important progress. these are some examples of the good that can come when people set aside partisanship and put veterans first. that is what is needed from all of us in this chamber and the agencies we work with: to put aside partisanship and solve the problem we face to end the scourge of veteran suicide in this country. mr. benishek. i thank the gentlewoman from arizona (ms. sinema). i really appreciate your comments and your concern for this significant problem. mr. speaker, i would like to take a moment to outline something that i have become aware of in my time here in office. while this problem is very monumental, there are many small things that the va can do right now to make a difference. one of these changes can be made by the va immediately. i would like to read a letter i received recently from an american legion representative in my district that illustrates the problem better than i could. dear dr. benishek: here is the situation. recently i encountered a suicidal veteran from the sault area who had severe ptsd, 100 percent va disabled. he called me on a wednesday hysterical and said that he was contemplating suicide. he was traveling around with his wife in the car at the time. i thought this was a very dangerous situation. after several back-and-forth conversations with him, i found out he was not taking any medicines and had not seen his va psychiatrist in a long time because, as he put it, the psychiatrist was not helping him and it seemed that he didn't really care. he insisted that he stay at wilwin, the american legion veterans facility, but i told him we needed his psychiatrist's okay. as a veteran myself, i thought i should try to help him the best that i could. so i called the va suicide hotline to get answers on how i should handle the situation. here's the problem. i called the iron mountain va. the call started out saying, if you are having a medical or mental health emergency, please hang up and dial 911. if you are having thoughts of hurting yourself and want to talk to a mental health professional, please hang up and dial 1-800-273-8255. if you are thinking of committing suicide, you are already frustrated to the point that you would be glad to talk to anyone, even if it is someone at the va. can you imagine a veteran in this position even having a paper and pencil in hand to write the number down? if he is unable to get the correct number the first time, he must redial the va, go through the whole spiel again and, hopefully, write the number on a paper the second or third time before he can try dialing. once dialed, the voice comes on the phone and says, if you are a veteran push 1 and so on. when i called the hotline after i pushed 1, listened to music for several minutes before a voice came on the phone, she told me that she was not a veteran, nor did she know much about ptsd veterans. what i needed was advice on how to handle the veteran i was working with, which she did give me. how many veterans have committed suicide because of the va's red tape? here's a solution. when the va is called and the veteran is contemplating suicide or hurting himself, you should be able to push 1 to get a direct line to the suicide hotline. it should automatically register that the call is coming through the va system and, yes, it is a veteran calling. this constituent was able to get the veteran he referred to the help that he needed, but he raised an incredibly good point that i brought up repeatedly with the va. the va told me it would take 6 months to change from an 800 number to simply dial 1. this is unacceptable. i call on the va again today to make this change immediately. mr. speaker, i yield to my colleague from nebraska (mr. ashford). mr. ashford. i thank the gentleman for the time. mr. speaker, i rise today to discuss a subject many of our veterans and their families understandably find great difficulty in discussing. veteran suicide, as we have already heard, is a major problem in our country. we have all heard the numbers. an estimated 22 veterans commit suicide every day. that is one life every hour. please keep in mind those horrific numbers have names, the names of men and women who put themselves in harm's way in order to keep each and every one of us safe. earlier this year we passed the clay hunt suicide prevention of american veterans act. it addresses the need for more mental healthcare experts inside the va along with expanding the time available to veterans to seek mental health care through the va. the new law also calls for an evaluation of all va mental health care and suicide prevention practices to determine what is working and make recommendations on what is not. this is a major step in the right direction, but we must continue to do more. i am proud to say, mr. speaker, that, in omaha, we are currently working with the department of veterans affairs to create a center of excellence, a national model for veterans' care that will include top- flight mental health care and other services so much needed by our veterans in our community. that treatment would cover post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety and problems relating to other people. the debt we owe the men and women who serve this country is a debt that can never be repaid. but we must continue to ensure that we keep our promises to our veterans and support their very unique healthcare issues. mr. benishek. mr. speaker, i yield to my colleague, the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. costello). mr. costello of pennsylvania. mr. speaker, i want to thank the gentleman from michigan for hosting this special order to raise awareness for an issue that impacts constituents in all of our congressional districts. we can all agree that, as members of congress, we need to prioritize our veterans. we also need to raise awareness about the invisible wounds many of them face. i am speaking about post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, depression, which can and often does lead to thoughts of suicide. mr. speaker, we also need to make sure that the loved ones of these veterans have the support they need so that they may best help those who are suffering from these invisible wounds. i have been here 9 months. the house has taken some very positive steps to help veterans since i have been here and improving suicide prevention programs. it has been said by several members already here on the floor today, the clay hunt suicide prevention act, a commonsense bill that is going to increase access to mental health by creating a peer support and community outreach pilot program. it is going to boost accountability with mental health care by requiring an annual evaluation of va mental health and suicide prevention programs. it is proof that, when we put party politics aside around here, we can get good things done. we should all be proud of that. i would like to direct members' attention to h.r. 2915, the female veteran suicide prevention act, which has been just passed out of the veterans' affairs committee. it is time to bring this bill to the floor. it will direct the va to identify mental healthcare prevention programs and metrics that are effective in treating female veterans as part of the evaluative process required by the clay hunt act, and it would require the va to accommodate a veteran's obligation to not properly disclose classified information. mr. speaker, suicide prevention programs are key to maintaining continual engagement with veterans and communities, as well as to raise awareness and to help intervene, when necessary. i would also add, let's keep in mind the economic opportunity subcommittee on veterans' affairs, which i serve on, with many other hardworking members who are working in a consensus-oriented fashion. we need to make sure that the transition assistance program is working for our veterans. we need to make sure that, from a veterans' hiring preference program, that that is working. we need to make sure that we are utilizing the best that the private sector has to offer for workforce development training for veterans returning to civilian life. we know that there is an unfair stigma associated with those who may need to seek assistance with mental health. part of the value of why we are here today is to raise awareness and help reduce that stigma and say that we understand that there are challenges for veterans returning to civilian life and we are here to help. [[page h6216]] we want to raise awareness. we want to make sure that the programs that we have in place are working. we are going to continue to do that. i applaud those who helped organize this special order here today, and i am honored to participate in it. mr. benishek. mr. speaker, i yield to my colleague from illinois (mrs. bustos). mrs. bustos. mr. speaker, i want to thank the gentlewoman from arizona (ms. sinema) and the gentleman from michigan (mr. benishek) for convening this important discussion this afternoon. as i am sure we agree, we need to continue shining a light on the epidemic of veteran suicide so we can push to improve the resources available to the brave men and women who have served our nation. mr. speaker, i come from a region of illinois called the quad cities. for more than two decades, my seat was held by one of the strongest advocates for veterans who has ever worked in these chambers. i am talking about the late and the great congressman lane evans. congressman evans was a veteran of the marine corps who served this body from 1983 all the way to 2007. i was proud to call him my friend. as a veteran, he understood the challenges that many of our returning heroes confront after they come home. congressman evans was a tireless advocate for expanding resources to our veterans and providing the mental health services that many of them need to make a successful transition back to civilian life. today, after more than a decade of war, this generation of veterans faces a new set of challenges. we have an obligation to those who have served our nation. as my friend, the gentlewoman from arizona highlighted earlier in her remarks that an estimated 22 veterans commit suicide every single day. that is nearly one every hour. and we all know the statistics driving this epidemic. military suicides are at their highest rate in 10 years. mr. speaker, veterans make up 20 percent of our suicides, despite making up only 10 percent of our population. thirty percent of veterans have considered suicide. 37 percent of iraq and afghanistan veterans have been diagnosed with ptsd. and of the approximately 22 veterans who take their lives every day, roughly five actually get care through the va health system. {time} 1630 it is easy to get lost in all those statistics. they are numbers. but behind each and every one of those is a real human being, a veteran with a real story that we must tell. we have a duty to help them. we all know how hard the department of veterans affairs is working to keep up with this ongoing and persistent challenge, but we have to do more. that is why i proudly supported the clay hunt suicide prevention for american veterans act, which was signed into law earlier this year. once this legislation is fully implemented, it will take critical steps toward curbing the epidemic of veteran suicide by improving the va resources and increasing oversight of programs designed to help our veterans get the care that they deserve. this is an important step toward stemming the ongoing crisis of veteran suicide, but it is not enough. this is why i have called on the appropriations committee to increase funding for veteran suicide prevention programs and outreach services. i hope all of you will join me in demanding more action for our veterans. if congressman evans were alive today, he would not rest until all of our veterans get the care and the support they have earned for protecting our nation, and neither should we. mr. benishek. mr. speaker, i yield to the gentleman from virginia (mr. goodlatte). mr. goodlatte. mr. speaker, i rise today to recognize an epidemic that is plaguing our servicemembers and our veterans, and that epidemic is suicide. each day it is estimated, on average, 22 veterans commit suicide in the united states. that is more than double the rate for the civilian population, and it is an extremely tragic statistic. earlier this year, the clay hunt suicide prevention for american veterans act was signed into law to help combat this very serious problem. i applaud this step forward, but our work is far from over. we must continue to ensure that those veterans who are suffering know that they are not alone; they have family, friends, and resources readily available to help them heal and move forward. these men and women have given so much to this great nation. it is our duty to walk with them during and after their service. i remain committed to providing the highest quality medical care and resources for these brave men and women who were wounded in the course of defending our freedom. i look forward to working with my colleagues to improve timely access to mental healthcare services to ensure our veterans in crisis receive the help that they need. i thank mr. benishek and ms. sinema for organizing this special order hour. mr. benishek. i yield to my colleague from michigan (mrs. dingell). mrs. dingell. i thank my friend from michigan for yielding. mr. speaker, i also want to thank my friends congressman benishek, congresswoman sinema, and congresswoman bustos for their leadership and for hosting this special order this evening on an issue that we all care very deeply about: the high rate of suicide among our veteran population. september is suicide prevention month, and it is important that we draw attention to this critical issue. the facts are stark. my other colleagues have already mentioned them. a veteran commits suicide every 65 minutes. that means that 22 veterans a day are dying. today we honor those that we have lost already and the families who have suffered so much and are left behind. these veterans were true american heroes who served their country and came home tormented. we can never forget the sacrifices that they have made. it is great, on this evening, to see my colleagues from both sides of the aisle here to talk about this issue, because it is my sincere hope that we can come together and rededicate ourselves to doing what is right for our veterans and making sure that we are dedicating sufficient resources to veterans' care. on sunday night, in michigan, i will gather with the family and friends of those veterans who have committed suicide in michigan. they have built a cross for each of those lives to try to raise awareness in our community. in addition, at a meeting that i hold with my mayors, where normally we are talking about infrastructure or roads, two-thirds of that meeting was spent talking about veterans and the emotional issues we are dealing with in our communities as we see these veterans struggling. the mayors and i have started a task force to address these issues. we have started a veterans' court that has been following the model of other places, trying to raise awareness so that in the community, we see when someone is struggling and are able to put out a helping hand. my next-door neighbor's young son, when tormented, needed help; and when he called, he couldn't get it. we all have got to come together. these brave young men and women have served our country. when they came home from world war ii and korea, we celebrated them. we thanked them for their service. we formed a community around them. these young men and women are fighting for us. they are fighting for freedom. they are fighting for world security. we have an obligation to help them when they come home, to help get them the resources that they need. they have memories that haunt them. they have memories that torment them. this suicide prevention month, we have to take the stigma away from mental illness. we have to recognize that young people need help sometimes, and we have to be there for them. tonight i thank my colleagues for organizing this special order so that we remind people that those who have served us sometimes need that helping hand. if we can prevent it, we must, any young person from taking their [[page h6217]] life because of the service that they gave this country. mr. benishek. mr. speaker, nearly 10 million americans have serious mental illness, and millions go without proper treatment or care because our nation's mental health system is broken not only for our veterans, but for our nonveterans as well. my next speaker is dr. tim murphy from pennsylvania, the author of the helping families in mental health crisis act, h.r. 2646. this will overhaul our nation's mental healthcare system, adding grants for more psychiatrists, authorizing intervention programs, and fixing current nationwide shortages of crisis mental health beds. i yield to my colleague from pennsylvania (mr. murphy). mr. murphy of pennsylvania. i thank the gentleman for organizing this very important special order. mr. speaker, i will tell the stories of three servicemembers that i have known in my time in the navy, in my work at walter reed hospital: one is of a soldier who tried to kill himself. he put a gun to his head, pulled the trigger. the gun fired, but it didn't kill him. it left him partially blind and with a significant head injury. he struggles through life. he continues to live, but the things that caused him to do that have not left. the second is of a marine that i knew, the son of a friend, who died recently. i went to his funeral and saw him lying there, looking so peaceful. the third, a soldier, i was called upon by the family to go visit him because he had been in his room for months. he covered the windows with camouflage. bottles and bottles of medication littered his room, holes were punched in the walls, and he felt abandoned. there was nothing more we could do for the soldier who had killed himself; there were some things we could do for the soldier who harmed himself; but there was a lot we could do for the soldier who hid himself. when soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen look down the road to suicide, there are multiple reasons. very often it is because they have faced those unspeakable horrors of war. perhaps they have had multiple deployments, strain within the family, the lost social relationships, divorce, job complications, which whittled and chipped away at their strength. perhaps they lost that sense of belonging that they had with their platoon or their company, that friendship with those who faced battles with them that somehow helped prop them back up. in many cases, it is dealing with the traumatic brain injury, of the multiple blasts, explosions, the primary, secondary, or tertiary wounds that they had which affected their brain functioning and leaves them with symptoms oftentimes of psychological disorders. sometimes that psychological disorder is that path to depression, that feeling of hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness that comes with clinical depression, when the person sometimes says: there is no treatment that can help me; i might as well give up. first let me say to veterans, mr. speaker, that there is treatment that can help. there is reason to hope. it is important that veterans seek out a therapist; and if that therapist doesn't seem like a good mix, seek another one. if that one doesn't seem like a good mix, seek another one. keep going until you find the right person. it is important veterans understand their life is worth living. yes, you are suffering in the moment, but you can't stop pursuing treatment. don't seek the permanent solution to the temporary problem. there is always another way out besides suicide. now, we make this more complicated for veterans, as we do with the rest of the community of people who are suffering from mental illness, by we simply don't have enough professionals out there to help. we have family members who don't see the signs of isolation and anger and drinking and drug abuse and irritability. but just because there is a healthcare provider out there, the family should not ever feel that they can't talk to that person. the healthcare provider, even without permission of the soldier, can listen; and it is important that family members contact someone even when that soldier says, ``i don't want to talk to anybody,'' because, very often, that is the disease speaking, that is the brain illness speaking. that is the part of the illness that says ``i either want to give up'' or ``i don't recognize i have a problem.'' loved ones can call for help, but we need other things taking place here as well. we have to have families who can help that person get out of a crisis. we have to help the family understand they need to remove the means of a suicide--if it is a firearm, if it is weapons, if is drugs. but what we need to do and what my bill (h.r. 2646), the helping families in mental health crisis act, does is it changes the dynamics of what our country is doing, that has abusive policies and antifamily policies which actually prevent people from getting help. what we have to do is make sure we have more access to treatment. we need more psychiatrists and psychologists--it is as plain as that--by the thousands and tens of thousands. we do not have enough. so even when someone tries to seek help, it is difficult. we need more psychiatric hospital beds for those moments when a person needs a respite, someplace to go away from the crisis of everyday life. we don't have enough. we had 550,000 psychiatric hospital beds in the 1950s. we have less than 40,000 now. part of that is because we have medicaid rules out there and other rules that say, you know, we don't want hospital beds anymore. look, i don't want to see people go back to the old asylums, but sometimes a person with that sense of helplessness and worthlessness needs a place to go to recover, to get better. we also have a va system which has said: you are not going to continue some of these drugs. your drug isn't on our formulary list. you are not going to take it anymore. i have other legislation in which says that, if a department of defense doctor prescribes a person medication and it is working, the va should automatically, without question, carry that medication and provide ease of access for it. one of the reasons we even have the clay hunt suicide prevention for american veterans bill is because he couldn't get the medication that worked. it is our fault. we have met the enemy, and he is us, as one character famously said. the general accounting office also tells us we have a disorganized system, 112 federal agencies--112--that are supposed to deal with mental illness. the gao tells us they don't keep track of data. there is not accountability. they don't meet. many of these agencies haven't even gotten together since 2009 to coordinate services. twenty homeless programs, programs scattered throughout the federal government--we make it the most difficult for those who have the most difficulty. sometimes what we do, though, is we reauthorize programs that work. but make no mistake, it is not enough. anyone who thinks that congress has been adequately addressing the needs of the mentally ill, the seriously mentally ill veterans, is naive. we are disillusioning ourselves into thinking that, because we did something, we did the right thing. so let me speak honestly: congress' lack of comprehensive action and its snail pace in dealing with this shares the blame. we are not passive in this. we are active and codependent in this crisis that is inflicted upon americans. when we are in this chamber and we hear another tragic story of someone who has perhaps killed many people in the community and then killed themselves or they did suicide by cop, we have a moment of silence--and so we should--as we grieve over the loss of innocent life. but that moment of silence should not be accompanied with silent behavior. what we need are moments of action, and strong action at that. not only do we have the soldier suicides, we had 41,000 suicides in this country in this last year; 43,000 drug overdose deaths; homicides by those with serious mental illness; people with mental illness who are the victims of crime and homicide. {time} 1645 then we have that slow-motion death of the homeless and the seriously mentally ill who, themselves, have come to so many other chronic illnesses that--do you know what? they are not even a statistic. we don't count them. [[page h6218]] if people want to help, if members want to do something, here is an action plan: become cosponsors of the helping families in mental health crisis act, h.r. 2646. don't sit idly by. don't say, ``some other member can do this; let it be someone else's problem.'' it is not. it is ours. as a nation, wouldn't we do better to act instead of grieve, to turn a blind eye and to hope that someone else takes care of it, or, worse yet, to be caught up in the politics, the partisan politics and the games that plague this chamber that says: ``i am not going to let this party have a win or this party have a win''? in the meantime, people are dying, and we sit idly by. mr. speaker, suicide is a plague on our nation, on our veterans. it is a plague on, as was said in samuel 16, the last, the least, and the lonely. we must change this system that makes it difficult for those who have the most difficulty. we must remove abusive federal policies that say that you can't see two doctors in the same day; you can't have more than 16 hospital beds; that say it is okay to have federal programs and grants going out there for absurd concepts like making collages, making masks; telling people to get off their medication; a web site to help people in boston, when it is cold, deal with the anxiety of snow; a $425,000 web site for 3-year-olds with sing-along songs; and a $22,000 painting which sits in the office of substance abuse and mental health services administration to give them awareness. the only thing i am aware of, mr. speaker, is that it is a waste of money--a waste of taxpayers' money--and a waste of lives. if this congress gets its act together and admits it, and if our leadership says that we can run lots of bills--and we can run lots of bills real quick--and we can suspend the bills and bring bills to the floor in a moment's notice, i have had this bill sitting around 3 years. we revise it and revise it again. we have the support of multiple organizations across the country, whether they represent parents or consumers or professionals, and another day goes by; and every few seconds another person commits suicide or has a drug overdose death, and we go home at night and sleep snugly in our beds. it doesn't have to be this way if we have more providers and if we have a federal government in congress that says that we must be guided by wisdom, compassion, and faith, that says we will not wait anymore and that we will take the collective voice of every member of congress to do that. a few hours ago, we had the holy father, pope francis, speak in this very chamber. his words still echo in this community. but he called us to do things together, to be motivated by love, to be engaged in a dialogue and conversation, and that is a conversation we must be having about mental illness as well, to say that we can no longer put this off. i hope members, if they really are concerned about veteran suicide-- as i believe we are--if they are really concerned about the problems of serious mental illness--as i know we are--if members are tired of moments of silence in those times when we come together for a few minutes of compassion, we recognize that is not enough--and i know we are--then i hope every member, every democrat and republican, talks to their leadership, talks to their committee members, talks to each other and says, ``move this bill. make something happen.'' by the way, mr. speaker, let me close with this. the story i told you has a good ending. the soldier that i visited in his home with the windows covered with camouflage, with medications scattered throughout the house, and with holes punched in the wall because of his anger, we did get him help. he got stabilized. he took those barriers off the windows. he let the bright light of the world shine in again, and he engaged with people again. he has hope again. that is a story that comes because people stepped forward and helped him. the people at hospitals and military hospitals can do that. let's make sure that the others like him whom we have not discovered yet, who are still hiding in their rooms, we get to them before their lives are taken. this is what we should be doing as a nation. failing to do this means we are culpable as this tragedy continues. mr. benishek. i would like to thank my colleague for his passion on this issue. i would now like to yield to my colleague from california (mr. peters). mr. peters. i want to thank the gentleman for yielding, and i want to thank congresswoman sinema and congressman benishek for their leadership on this issue, which is also of prime interest to me, this epidemic of suicide in our veteran community. mr. speaker, san diego has the third largest population of veterans in the country, more than 235,000. one of the most important jobs we have here in congress is to honor their service by keeping our promises to them. september is suicide prevention month, a time to focus on ending the scourge of veteran suicide that has hurt families and communities across the country. combating suicide takes the full spectrum of services, including deployment, education, drug and alcohol abuse treatment, and ending the stigma around mental health. in san diego, i am pleased to say, the nonprofit sector has really stepped up. we have been at the forefront of finding innovative ways to approach veteran suicide by providing services and developing cohesion in the local veteran community that came together after the vietnam war to increase collaboration among government, private groups, and community partners. san diego is the home of, in my district, 0800, which is an organization doing innovative work to assist easing the transition between active duty and civilian life. it is a community-based nonprofit that takes the existing service structure, works with the servicemembers before they leave the military to get them set, and provides the case management after they return to the civilian world to ensure that the benefits and services that veterans have earned are provided to them. another organization, the three wise men foundation, founded by combat veteran nathan fletcher, utilizes community engagement and workout trainings to help veterans who were in combat and have struggled to reintegrate after coming home. there is a powerful article by dave phillips that the new york times highlighted this weekend about how many veterans are turning to each other to survive. to quote that article: ``feeling abandoned, members of the battalion have turned to a survival strategy they learned at war: depending on one another.'' we have all heard the devastating statistics of veteran suicides in the country, but thus far, the response has failed to properly address the dire situation, and we have a responsibility here in congress to do much more than we have. the statistics don't tell the heart-wrenching stories that so many of us have heard from parents, spouses, and the loved ones of the veteran who has taken his or her own life. one such couple that congresswoman sinema and i know, and i have been honored to work with, is dr. howard and jean somers, who, after losing their son, daniel, to suicide, have become tireless advocates to fix and reform the broken healthcare system at the department of veterans affairs. we know that bipartisan reforms to the va can make a difference. the clay hunt act showed us that and garnered a new generation of mental health and suicide prevention services at the va, and the veterans choice act will bring accountability to a system wrought with oversight and leadership challenges, allowing for faster service closer to the veteran in need. but fixing an inefficient va requires more than just increased funding. it requires real changes to get veterans care in new and flexible ways. we need to allow the va to better use innovative technologies, like wireless medicine, that allow veterans access to care from the comfort of their homes, which can save lives and decrease costs to taxpayers. we need to break the stigma around mental health, particularly post- traumatic stress. the service-connected injury needs to be treated with the same gravity and respect as the physical injury that so many of our valiant warfighters have battled. so thank you again, congresswoman sinema and congressman benishek, for your consistent advocacy on reforming the va and on ending the tragedy of veteran suicide. we have much more [[page h6219]] work to do, and i appreciate the opportunity to be here today to work with you on it. mr. benishek. mr. speaker, how much time is remaining? the speaker pro tempore (mr. abraham). the gentleman has 8 minutes remaining. mr. benishek. i yield to the gentleman from florida (mr. yoho). mr. yoho. mr. speaker, i would like to take a moment to thank my colleagues, representatives sinema and dr. benishek, for their leadership in arranging such a special order on such an important topic and for the invitation to speak this afternoon on suicide prevention awareness. september is suicide prevention awareness month. it is so important that we have an open and honest dialogue about the issue of suicide. the more we talk about it, we increase people's awareness, and they are there to help the people in need. there are alternatives, and they do not have to suffer in silence. from comedian robin williams, to bullied young kids, to the brave men and women from our nation's military returning from the battlefield, suicide does not discriminate. emotional pain and despair can set in and take root in the minds and bodies of all ages across all demographics. often, the signs of suicide go undetected, which leave those left behind asking: why did this happen, and what could i have done to prevent this tragedy? today a disproportionate amount of our nation's veterans are falling victim to suicide. after all they have given to this country, it is tragic and unacceptable that our nation's veterans often suffer in silence until it is too late for those around them to help. by shining a light on veteran suicide and all suicides, we as a nation can start to understand the urgency with which we need to solve and prevent this epidemic that our veterans, their families, and their friends struggle with. not recognizing the signs early enough all too often leads to a loss of life. this is an important thing that we as a nation need to come together and have a strong support system in place so that those in need will reach out and not be stigmatized. again, i want to thank our colleagues. mr. benishek. mr. speaker, i yield to the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. cartwright). mr. cartwright. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman for yielding, and i want to thank, particularly, representatives sinema and benishek for bringing up this special order hour. for my own part, i speak for the northeastern part of pennsylvania. pennsylvania is home to nearly 1 million veterans. these are brave men and women who serve this nation, a nation that has, regrettably, not always served them. many of the veterans suffer from mental illness. a study, as you all know, has been released that found that 22 veterans commit suicide every day. this is unacceptable. as someone who deeply cares about veterans' issues, i was proud to introduce legislation in the last congress that would fast-track the hiring of psychiatrists who have completed a residency at a va facility, and i was gratified that the president has incorporated many of those ideas in his policy. initially, in this congress, i plan to reintroduce the veterans mental health accessibility act, an important piece of legislation that aims to provide for our brave servicemen and -women when they return from combat with both easily visible and difficult-to-detect wounds. while the physical wounds are evident immediately, the mental health ones may take longer to manifest themselves. here is the problem: as many as 30 percent of operation iraqi and enduring freedom veterans face the possible diagnosis of a mental health disorder. but after 5 postservice years, if a condition is not diagnosed, veterans would go to the back of the line. they have missed their statute of limitations in 5 years and then experience an average wait time to receive benefits of more than 1 year. this could mean the difference between life and death. unfortunately, mental health disorders are harder to diagnose, may take much longer to manifest, and many veterans might delay seeking treatment. we are putting it on them to self-diagnose and report within that 5-year span. we should not hold mental health disorders to the same timeline as a broken leg. the veterans mental health accessibility act would ensure that no veteran would be denied mental health treatment no matter when combat-related mental health disorders first appear. i believe we owe a great debt to those warfighters who serve our country through military service, including those who stood ready at a moment's notice to fight for our freedom. mr. speaker, as long as i am a member of congress, i will be working to increase knowledge on this subject, to correct the shortcomings of the va system, and to ensure that the men and women of our armed forces who bravely serve this country receive all the benefits to which they are entitled. mr. benishek. nice comments, mr. cartwright. i appreciate it. mr. speaker, i yield to the gentlewoman from indiana (mrs. walorski), my colleague on the veterans' affairs committee. mrs. walorski. thank you, mr. benishek. mr. speaker, i want to thank the distinguished gentleman from michigan and the distinguished gentlewoman from arizona for yielding. in honor of suicide prevention month, i rise today to increase awareness about some of our bravest and most at risk: our veterans. many of our nation's troops, both past and present, face struggles many of us can never imagine. every day 22 veterans take their own lives. i have experienced this same tragedy in my own district. in 2013, a constituent in my district, a former marine who served in vietnam, began experiencing severe pain over his entire body. after visiting four va clinics and facilities, doctors could not diagnose his condition and instead prescribed morphine for ongoing and oftentimes excruciating pain. to help manage his undiagnosed condition, doctors recommended he enter a nursing home. unfortunately, he discovered he did not meet the eligibility requirements. later that day, his wife was told that she had 1 hour to pick him up or they, the va, would send him home in a cab without clothes since he did not have any at the hospital to wear. two days later, just a week before christmas, the pain proved too great for him to bear and he took his own life. his story details the urgency our nation's heroes deserve. instead of ending in heartbreak, veterans and their families need to know their lives count, which is why we must improve veterans' access to physical and mental health care. together, we can change this system to prevent tragedies like this from ever happening again. {time} 1700 mr. benishek. thank you very much, mrs. walorski. i really appreciate your comments. i think dr. murphy brought up a good point when he was speaking. we just recently in this house passed the 21st century cures act, h.r. 6. that has been endorsed by a wide variety of professional and medical organizations, such as the american association for cancer research and the cure alliance. we passed this bill by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 344-77. this is a piece of legislation that is going to change the way we do research at the nih, that is going to change health care for all americans. there is no reason that we shouldn't be able to pass a mental health care bill similar to that with a wide bipartisan effort. today ms. sinema and i are leading a bipartisan group of members of congress to make mental health care an issue on which to move forward, and it has really been a great way to get this started. i yield to ms. sinema if she would like to add a few more thoughts in that regard. ms. sinema. thank you very much, congressman benishek. i know we will be continuing this in the next special order so as to allow more of our colleagues to speak, and i am really looking forward to that time. mr. benishek. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time.

Material provided by the Chair to all Members, whether provided prior to or at the hearing, shall be placed on the Committee website no later than 48 hours after the commencement of the hearing unless such material contains sensitive or classified information in which case such material shall be handled pursuant to Rule 15 of the Committee's Rules. 5. Meetings and Hearings Open to the Public A. Meetings Each meeting of the Committee or its Subcommittees for the transaction of business, [[Page H6223]] including the markup of legislation, shall be open to the public, including to radio, television, and still photography coverage, except as provided by House Rule XI, cl. 4. If the majority of Members of the Committee or Subcommittee present at the meeting, determine by a recorded vote in open session that all or part of the remainder of the meeting on that day shall be closed to the public because the disclosure of matters to be considered would endanger national security, would compromise sensitive law enforcement information, or would tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate any person or otherwise would violate any law or rule of the House; provided however, that no person other than Members of the Committee, and such congressional staff and such executive branch representatives they may authorize, shall be present in any meeting which has been closed to the public. The Chair and Ranking Minority Member are ex officio Members of all Subcommittees for the purpose of any meeting conducted by a Subcommittee. B. Hearings Each hearing conducted by the Committee or its Subcommittees shall be open to the public, including radio, television and still photography coverage. If the majority of Members of the Committee or Subcommittee present at the hearing, determine by a recorded vote in open session, that all or part of the remainder of the hearing on that day shall be closed to the public because the disclosure of matters to be considered would endanger national security, would compromise sensitive law enforcement information, or would tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate any person or otherwise would violate any law or rule of the House; provided however, that the Committee or Subcommittee may by the same procedure also vote to close one subsequent day of hearings. Notwithstanding the requirements of the preceding sentence, a majority of those present (if the requisite number of Members are present under Committee rules for the purpose of taking testimony) may vote: (i) to close the hearing for the sole purpose of discussing whether the testimony or evidence to be received would endanger the national security, would compromise sensitive law enforcement information, or violate Rule XI, cl. 2(k)(5) of the House or (ii) to close the hearing, as provided clause 2(k)(5) of Rule XI of the House. The Chair and Ranking Minority Member are ex officio Members of all Subcommittees for any hearing conducted by a Subcommittee. Members of the Committee who wish to participate in a hearing of the Subcommittee to which they are not Members shall make such request to the Chair and the Ranking Minority Member of the Subcommittee at the commencement of the hearing. The Chair, after consultation with the Ranking Minority Member of the Subcommittee, shall grant such request. No Member of the House may be excluded from non- participatory attendance at any hearing of the Committee or any Subcommittee, unless the House of Representatives shall by majority vote authorize the Committee or Subcommittees, for purposes of a particular subject of investigation, to close its hearing to Members by the same procedures designated to close hearings to the public. Members of Congress who are not Members of the Committee but would like to participate in a hearing shall notify the Chair and the Ranking Minority Member and submit a formal request no later than 24 hours before the commencement of the meeting or hearing. To the maximum extent practicable, the Committee shall provide audio and video coverage of each hearing or meeting for the transaction of business in a manner that allows the public to easily listen and view the proceedings and shall maintain the recordings of such coverage in a manner easily accessible to the public. 6. Witnesses A. Statement of Witnesses Each witness who is to appear before the Committee or Subcommittee shall file an electronic copy of the testimony with the Committee and the Ranking Minority Member no later than 48 hours before the commencement of the hearing. In addition, the witness shall provide 25 copies of the testimony by the commencement of the hearing. The Chair may waive the requirement by the witness providing 25 copies in which case the Committee or Subcommittee shall provide the 25 copies. Each non-governmental witness shall provide to the Committee and the Ranking Minority Member, no later than 48 hours before the commencement of the hearing, a curriculum vitae or other statement describing their education, employment, professional affiliation or other background information pertinent to their testimony. As required by Rule XI, cl. 2(g) of the Rules of the House, each non-governmental witness before the commencement of the hearing shall file with the Chair a disclosure form detailing any contracts or grants that the witness has with the federal government. Such information shall be posted on the Committee website within 24 hours after the witness appeared at the hearing. The failure to provide the materials set forth by the deadlines set forth in these rules may be grounds for excluding both the oral and written testimony of the witness unless waived by the Chair of the Committee or Subcommittee. The Committee will provide public access to printed materials, including the testimony of witnesses in electronic form on the Committee's website no later than 24 hours after the hearing is adjourned. Supplemental material provided after the hearing adjourns, shall be placed on the Committee website no later than 24 hours after receipt of such material. B. Number of Witnesses and Witnesses Selected by the Minority For any hearing conducted by the Committee or Subcommittee there shall be no more than four non-governmental witnesses of which the Ranking Minority Member of the Committee or Subcommittee (as appropriate) is entitled to select one witness for the hearing. Witnesses selected by the Ranking Minority Member of the Committee or Subcommittee shall be invited to testify by the Chair of the Committee or Subcommittee (as appropriate). Rule 6(A) shall apply with equal force to witnesses selected by the Ranking Minority Member of the Committee or Subcommittee. The limitations set forth in the preceding paragraph shall not apply if the Committee holds a hearing to honor the work of the small business community in conjunction with the annual celebration of Small Business Week. Witness limitations for such a hearing shall be determined by the Chair in consultation with the Ranking Minority Member. C. Interrogation of Witnesses Except when the Committee adopts a motion pursuant to subdivisions (B) and (C) of clause 2(i)(2) of Rule XI of the Rules of the House, Committee Members may question witnesses only when they have been recognized by the Chair for that purpose. Members shall have the opportunity, as set forth in Rule XI, cl. 2(j) of the Rules of the House, to question each witness on the panel for a period not to exceed five minutes. For any hearing, the Chair of the Committee or Subcommittee may offer a motion to extend the questioning of a witness or witnesses by the Member identified in the motion for more than five minutes as set forth in Rule XI, cl. 2(j)(B). The Chair of the Committee or Subcommittee shall commence questioning followed by the Ranking Minority Member. Thereafter, questioning shall alternate between the majority and minority Members in order of their arrival at the hearing after the gavel has been struck to commence the hearing with the first arriving having priority over Members of his or her party. If Members arrive simultaneously or are there prior to the gavel being struck to commence the hearing, order of questioning shall be based on seniority. In recognizing Members to question witnesses, the Chair may take into consideration the ratio of majority and minority Members present in such a manner as to not disadvantage the Members of either party. 7. Subpoenas A subpoena may be authorized and issued by the Committee in the conduct of any investigation or series of investigations or activities to require the attendance and testimony of such witness and the production of such books, records, correspondence, memoranda, papers and document, as deemed necessary. Such subpoena shall be authorized by a majority of the full Committee. The requirement that the authorization of a subpoena require a majority vote may be waived by the Ranking Member of the Committee. The Chair may issue a subpoena, in consultation with the Ranking Minority Member, when the House is out for session for more than three legislative days. 8. Quorum A quorum, for purposes of reporting a measure or recommendation, shall be a majority of the Committee Members. For purposes of taking testimony or receiving evidence, a quorum shall be one Member from the Majority and one Member from the Minority. The Chair of the Committee or Subcommittee shall exercise reasonable comity by waiting for the Ranking Minority Member even if a quorum is present before striking the gavel to commence the hearing. For hearings held by the Committee or a Subcommittee in a location other than the Committee's hearing room in Washington, DC, a quorum shall be deemed to present if the Chair of the Committee or Subcommittee is present. 9. Amendments During Mark-Up Any amendment offered to any pending legislation before the Committee must be made available in written form by any Member of the Committee. If such amendment is not available in written form when requested, the Chair shall allow an appropriate period for the provision thereof and may adjourn the markup to provide sufficient time for the provision of such written amendment. Such period or adjournment shall not prejudice the offering of such amendment. For amendments to be accepted during mark-up, there is no requirement that the amendments be filed prior to commencement of the mark-up or prepared with the assistance of the Office of Legislative Counsel. Even though it is not necessary, Members seeking to amend legislation during mark- up should draft amendments with the assistance of the Office of Legislative Counsel and consult with the Chair or Ranking Member's staff (as appropriate) in the preparation of such amendments. 10. Postponement of Proceedings The Chair in consultation with the Ranking Minority Member may postpone further [[Page H6224]] proceedings when a record vote is ordered on the question of approving any measure or matter or adopting an amendment. The Chair may resume postponed proceedings, but no later than 24 hours after such postponement, unless the House is not in session or there are conflicts with Member schedules that make it unlikely a quorum will be present to conduct business on the postponed proceeding. In such cases, the Chair will consult with Members to set a time as early as possible to resume proceedings but in no event later than the next meeting date as set forth in Rule 3 of these Rules. When proceedings resume on a postponed question, notwithstanding any intervening order for the previous question, an underlying proposition shall remain subject to further debate or amendment to the same extent as when the question was postponed. 11.

To the extent possible, the seven days shall be counted from 168 hours before the time of the Committee's hearing. The Chair, with the concurrence of the Ranking Minority Member, or upon a vote by the majority of the Committee (a quorum being present), may authorize a hearing to commence on less than 7 calendar days notice. A. Witness Lists Unless the Chair determines it is impracticable to do so, the Committee shall make a tentative witness list available at the time it makes the public announcement of the hearing. If a tentative witness list is not made available at the time of the announcement of the hearing, such witness list shall be made available as soon as practicable after such announcement is made. A final witness list shall be issued by the Committee no later than 48 hours prior to the commencement of the hearing. B.

Such material shall be made available to all Members of the Committee no later than 48 hours before the commencement of the hearing unless the Chair, after consultation with the Ranking Minority Member, determines that certain reports from departments or agencies should not be made available prior to the commencement of the hearing. Material provided by the Chair to all Members, whether provided prior to or at the hearing, shall be placed on the Committee website no later than 48 hours after the commencement of the hearing unless such material contains sensitive or classified information in which case such material shall be handled pursuant to Rule 15 of the Committee's Rules. 5. Meetings and Hearings Open to the Public A. Meetings Each meeting of the Committee or its Subcommittees for the transaction of business, [[Page H6223]] including the markup of legislation, shall be open to the public, including to radio, television, and still photography coverage, except as provided by House Rule XI, cl. 4. If the majority of Members of the Committee or Subcommittee present at the meeting, determine by a recorded vote in open session that all or part of the remainder of the meeting on that day shall be closed to the public because the disclosure of matters to be considered would endanger national security, would compromise sensitive law enforcement information, or would tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate any person or otherwise would violate any law or rule of the House; provided however, that no person other than Members of the Committee, and such congressional staff and such executive branch representatives they may authorize, shall be present in any meeting which has been closed to the public. The Chair and Ranking Minority Member are ex officio Members of all Subcommittees for the purpose of any meeting conducted by a Subcommittee. B. Hearings Each hearing conducted by the Committee or its Subcommittees shall be open to the public, including radio, television and still photography coverage. If the majority of Members of the Committee or Subcommittee present at the hearing, determine by a recorded vote in open session, that all or part of the remainder of the hearing on that day shall be closed to the public because the disclosure of matters to be considered would endanger national security, would compromise sensitive law enforcement information, or would tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate any person or otherwise would violate any law or rule of the House; provided however, that the Committee or Subcommittee may by the same procedure also vote to close one subsequent day of hearings. Notwithstanding the requirements of the preceding sentence, a majority of those present (if the requisite number of Members are present under Committee rules for the purpose of taking testimony) may vote: (i) to close the hearing for the sole purpose of discussing whether the testimony or evidence to be received would endanger the national security, would compromise sensitive law enforcement information, or violate Rule XI, cl. 2(k)(5) of the House or (ii) to close the hearing, as provided clause 2(k)(5) of Rule XI of the House. The Chair and Ranking Minority Member are ex officio Members of all Subcommittees for any hearing conducted by a Subcommittee. Members of the Committee who wish to participate in a hearing of the Subcommittee to which they are not Members shall make such request to the Chair and the Ranking Minority Member of the Subcommittee at the commencement of the hearing. The Chair, after consultation with the Ranking Minority Member of the Subcommittee, shall grant such request. No Member of the House may be excluded from non- participatory attendance at any hearing of the Committee or any Subcommittee, unless the House of Representatives shall by majority vote authorize the Committee or Subcommittees, for purposes of a particular subject of investigation, to close its hearing to Members by the same procedures designated to close hearings to the public. Members of Congress who are not Members of the Committee but would like to participate in a hearing shall notify the Chair and the Ranking Minority Member and submit a formal request no later than 24 hours before the commencement of the meeting or hearing. To the maximum extent practicable, the Committee shall provide audio and video coverage of each hearing or meeting for the transaction of business in a manner that allows the public to easily listen and view the proceedings and shall maintain the recordings of such coverage in a manner easily accessible to the public. 6. Witnesses A. Statement of Witnesses Each witness who is to appear before the Committee or Subcommittee shall file an electronic copy of the testimony with the Committee and the Ranking Minority Member no later than 48 hours before the commencement of the hearing. In addition, the witness shall provide 25 copies of the testimony by the commencement of the hearing. The Chair may waive the requirement by the witness providing 25 copies in which case the Committee or Subcommittee shall provide the 25 copies. Each non-governmental witness shall provide to the Committee and the Ranking Minority Member, no later than 48 hours before the commencement of the hearing, a curriculum vitae or other statement describing their education, employment, professional affiliation or other background information pertinent to their testimony. As required by Rule XI, cl. 2(g) of the Rules of the House, each non-governmental witness before the commencement of the hearing shall file with the Chair a disclosure form detailing any contracts or grants that the witness has with the federal government. Such information shall be posted on the Committee website within 24 hours after the witness appeared at the hearing. The failure to provide the materials set forth by the deadlines set forth in these rules may be grounds for excluding both the oral and written testimony of the witness unless waived by the Chair of the Committee or Subcommittee. The Committee will provide public access to printed materials, including the testimony of witnesses in electronic form on the Committee's website no later than 24 hours after the hearing is adjourned. Supplemental material provided after the hearing adjourns, shall be placed on the Committee website no later than 24 hours after receipt of such material. B. Number of Witnesses and Witnesses Selected by the Minority For any hearing conducted by the Committee or Subcommittee there shall be no more than four non-governmental witnesses of which the Ranking Minority Member of the Committee or Subcommittee (as appropriate) is entitled to select one witness for the hearing. Witnesses selected by the Ranking Minority Member of the Committee or Subcommittee shall be invited to testify by the Chair of the Committee or Subcommittee (as appropriate). Rule 6(A) shall apply with equal force to witnesses selected by the Ranking Minority Member of the Committee or Subcommittee. The limitations set forth in the preceding paragraph shall not apply if the Committee holds a hearing to honor the work of the small business community in conjunction with the annual celebration of Small Business Week. Witness limitations for such a hearing shall be determined by the Chair in consultation with the Ranking Minority Member. C. Interrogation of Witnesses Except when the Committee adopts a motion pursuant to subdivisions (B) and (C) of clause 2(i)(2) of Rule XI of the Rules of the House, Committee Members may question witnesses only when they have been recognized by the Chair for that purpose. Members shall have the opportunity, as set forth in Rule XI, cl. 2(j) of the Rules of the House, to question each witness on the panel for a period not to exceed five minutes. For any hearing, the Chair of the Committee or Subcommittee may offer a motion to extend the questioning of a witness or witnesses by the Member identified in the motion for more than five minutes as set forth in Rule XI, cl. 2(j)(B). The Chair of the Committee or Subcommittee shall commence questioning followed by the Ranking Minority Member. Thereafter, questioning shall alternate between the majority and minority Members in order of their arrival at the hearing after the gavel has been struck to commence the hearing with the first arriving having priority over Members of his or her party. If Members arrive simultaneously or are there prior to the gavel being struck to commence the hearing, order of questioning shall be based on seniority. In recognizing Members to question witnesses, the Chair may take into consideration the ratio of majority and minority Members present in such a manner as to not disadvantage the Members of either party. 7. Subpoenas A subpoena may be authorized and issued by the Committee in the conduct of any investigation or series of investigations or activities to require the attendance and testimony of such witness and the production of such books, records, correspondence, memoranda, papers and document, as deemed necessary. Such subpoena shall be authorized by a majority of the full Committee. The requirement that the authorization of a subpoena require a majority vote may be waived by the Ranking Member of the Committee. The Chair may issue a subpoena, in consultation with the Ranking Minority Member, when the House is out for session for more than three legislative days. 8. Quorum A quorum, for purposes of reporting a measure or recommendation, shall be a majority of the Committee Members. For purposes of taking testimony or receiving evidence, a quorum shall be one Member from the Majority and one Member from the Minority. The Chair of the Committee or Subcommittee shall exercise reasonable comity by waiting for the Ranking Minority Member even if a quorum is present before striking the gavel to commence the hearing. For hearings held by the Committee or a Subcommittee in a location other than the Committee's hearing room in Washington, DC, a quorum shall be deemed to present if the Chair of the Committee or Subcommittee is present. 9. Amendments During Mark-Up Any amendment offered to any pending legislation before the Committee must be made available in written form by any Member of the Committee. If such amendment is not available in written form when requested, the Chair shall allow an appropriate period for the provision thereof and may adjourn the markup to provide sufficient time for the provision of such written amendment. Such period or adjournment shall not prejudice the offering of such amendment. For amendments to be accepted during mark-up, there is no requirement that the amendments be filed prior to commencement of the mark-up or prepared with the assistance of the Office of Legislative Counsel. Even though it is not necessary, Members seeking to amend legislation during mark- up should draft amendments with the assistance of the Office of Legislative Counsel and consult with the Chair or Ranking Member's staff (as appropriate) in the preparation of such amendments. 10. Postponement of Proceedings The Chair in consultation with the Ranking Minority Member may postpone further [[Page H6224]] proceedings when a record vote is ordered on the question of approving any measure or matter or adopting an amendment. The Chair may resume postponed proceedings, but no later than 24 hours after such postponement, unless the House is not in session or there are conflicts with Member schedules that make it unlikely a quorum will be present to conduct business on the postponed proceeding. In such cases, the Chair will consult with Members to set a time as early as possible to resume proceedings but in no event later than the next meeting date as set forth in Rule 3 of these Rules. When proceedings resume on a postponed question, notwithstanding any intervening order for the previous question, an underlying proposition shall remain subject to further debate or amendment to the same extent as when the question was postponed. 11.

If the majority of Members of the Committee or Subcommittee present at the meeting, determine by a recorded vote in open session that all or part of the remainder of the meeting on that day shall be closed to the public because the disclosure of matters to be considered would endanger national security, would compromise sensitive law enforcement information, or would tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate any person or otherwise would violate any law or rule of the House; provided however, that no person other than Members of the Committee, and such congressional staff and such executive branch representatives they may authorize, shall be present in any meeting which has been closed to the public. The Chair and Ranking Minority Member are ex officio Members of all Subcommittees for the purpose of any meeting conducted by a Subcommittee. B. Hearings Each hearing conducted by the Committee or its Subcommittees shall be open to the public, including radio, television and still photography coverage. If the majority of Members of the Committee or Subcommittee present at the hearing, determine by a recorded vote in open session, that all or part of the remainder of the hearing on that day shall be closed to the public because the disclosure of matters to be considered would endanger national security, would compromise sensitive law enforcement information, or would tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate any person or otherwise would violate any law or rule of the House; provided however, that the Committee or Subcommittee may by the same procedure also vote to close one subsequent day of hearings. Notwithstanding the requirements of the preceding sentence, a majority of those present (if the requisite number of Members are present under Committee rules for the purpose of taking testimony) may vote: (i) to close the hearing for the sole purpose of discussing whether the testimony or evidence to be received would endanger the national security, would compromise sensitive law enforcement information, or violate Rule XI, cl. 2(k)(5) of the House or (ii) to close the hearing, as provided clause 2(k)(5) of Rule XI of the House. The Chair and Ranking Minority Member are ex officio Members of all Subcommittees for any hearing conducted by a Subcommittee.

The Chair, after consultation with the Ranking Minority Member of the Subcommittee, shall grant such request. No Member of the House may be excluded from non- participatory attendance at any hearing of the Committee or any Subcommittee, unless the House of Representatives shall by majority vote authorize the Committee or Subcommittees, for purposes of a particular subject of investigation, to close its hearing to Members by the same procedures designated to close hearings to the public. Members of Congress who are not Members of the Committee but would like to participate in a hearing shall notify the Chair and the Ranking Minority Member and submit a formal request no later than 24 hours before the commencement of the meeting or hearing. To the maximum extent practicable, the Committee shall provide audio and video coverage of each hearing or meeting for the transaction of business in a manner that allows the public to easily listen and view the proceedings and shall maintain the recordings of such coverage in a manner easily accessible to the public. 6. Witnesses A. Statement of Witnesses Each witness who is to appear before the Committee or Subcommittee shall file an electronic copy of the testimony with the Committee and the Ranking Minority Member no later than 48 hours before the commencement of the hearing. In addition, the witness shall provide 25 copies of the testimony by the commencement of the hearing. The Chair may waive the requirement by the witness providing 25 copies in which case the Committee or Subcommittee shall provide the 25 copies. Each non-governmental witness shall provide to the Committee and the Ranking Minority Member, no later than 48 hours before the commencement of the hearing, a curriculum vitae or other statement describing their education, employment, professional affiliation or other background information pertinent to their testimony. As required by Rule XI, cl. 2(g) of the Rules of the House, each non-governmental witness before the commencement of the hearing shall file with the Chair a disclosure form detailing any contracts or grants that the witness has with the federal government. Such information shall be posted on the Committee website within 24 hours after the witness appeared at the hearing. The failure to provide the materials set forth by the deadlines set forth in these rules may be grounds for excluding both the oral and written testimony of the witness unless waived by the Chair of the Committee or Subcommittee. The Committee will provide public access to printed materials, including the testimony of witnesses in electronic form on the Committee's website no later than 24 hours after the hearing is adjourned. Supplemental material provided after the hearing adjourns, shall be placed on the Committee website no later than 24 hours after receipt of such material. B. Number of Witnesses and Witnesses Selected by the Minority For any hearing conducted by the Committee or Subcommittee there shall be no more than four non-governmental witnesses of which the Ranking Minority Member of the Committee or Subcommittee (as appropriate) is entitled to select one witness for the hearing. Witnesses selected by the Ranking Minority Member of the Committee or Subcommittee shall be invited to testify by the Chair of the Committee or Subcommittee (as appropriate). Rule 6(A) shall apply with equal force to witnesses selected by the Ranking Minority Member of the Committee or Subcommittee. The limitations set forth in the preceding paragraph shall not apply if the Committee holds a hearing to honor the work of the small business community in conjunction with the annual celebration of Small Business Week. Witness limitations for such a hearing shall be determined by the Chair in consultation with the Ranking Minority Member. C. Interrogation of Witnesses Except when the Committee adopts a motion pursuant to subdivisions (B) and (C) of clause 2(i)(2) of Rule XI of the Rules of the House, Committee Members may question witnesses only when they have been recognized by the Chair for that purpose. Members shall have the opportunity, as set forth in Rule XI, cl. 2(j) of the Rules of the House, to question each witness on the panel for a period not to exceed five minutes. For any hearing, the Chair of the Committee or Subcommittee may offer a motion to extend the questioning of a witness or witnesses by the Member identified in the motion for more than five minutes as set forth in Rule XI, cl. 2(j)(B). The Chair of the Committee or Subcommittee shall commence questioning followed by the Ranking Minority Member. Thereafter, questioning shall alternate between the majority and minority Members in order of their arrival at the hearing after the gavel has been struck to commence the hearing with the first arriving having priority over Members of his or her party. If Members arrive simultaneously or are there prior to the gavel being struck to commence the hearing, order of questioning shall be based on seniority. In recognizing Members to question witnesses, the Chair may take into consideration the ratio of majority and minority Members present in such a manner as to not disadvantage the Members of either party. 7. Subpoenas A subpoena may be authorized and issued by the Committee in the conduct of any investigation or series of investigations or activities to require the attendance and testimony of such witness and the production of such books, records, correspondence, memoranda, papers and document, as deemed necessary. Such subpoena shall be authorized by a majority of the full Committee. The requirement that the authorization of a subpoena require a majority vote may be waived by the Ranking Member of the Committee. The Chair may issue a subpoena, in consultation with the Ranking Minority Member, when the House is out for session for more than three legislative days. 8. Quorum A quorum, for purposes of reporting a measure or recommendation, shall be a majority of the Committee Members. For purposes of taking testimony or receiving evidence, a quorum shall be one Member from the Majority and one Member from the Minority. The Chair of the Committee or Subcommittee shall exercise reasonable comity by waiting for the Ranking Minority Member even if a quorum is present before striking the gavel to commence the hearing. For hearings held by the Committee or a Subcommittee in a location other than the Committee's hearing room in Washington, DC, a quorum shall be deemed to present if the Chair of the Committee or Subcommittee is present. 9. Amendments During Mark-Up Any amendment offered to any pending legislation before the Committee must be made available in written form by any Member of the Committee. If such amendment is not available in written form when requested, the Chair shall allow an appropriate period for the provision thereof and may adjourn the markup to provide sufficient time for the provision of such written amendment. Such period or adjournment shall not prejudice the offering of such amendment. For amendments to be accepted during mark-up, there is no requirement that the amendments be filed prior to commencement of the mark-up or prepared with the assistance of the Office of Legislative Counsel. Even though it is not necessary, Members seeking to amend legislation during mark- up should draft amendments with the assistance of the Office of Legislative Counsel and consult with the Chair or Ranking Member's staff (as appropriate) in the preparation of such amendments. 10. Postponement of Proceedings The Chair in consultation with the Ranking Minority Member may postpone further [[Page H6224]] proceedings when a record vote is ordered on the question of approving any measure or matter or adopting an amendment. The Chair may resume postponed proceedings, but no later than 24 hours after such postponement, unless the House is not in session or there are conflicts with Member schedules that make it unlikely a quorum will be present to conduct business on the postponed proceeding. In such cases, the Chair will consult with Members to set a time as early as possible to resume proceedings but in no event later than the next meeting date as set forth in Rule 3 of these Rules. When proceedings resume on a postponed question, notwithstanding any intervening order for the previous question, an underlying proposition shall remain subject to further debate or amendment to the same extent as when the question was postponed. 11.

shall notify the chair and the ranking minority member and submit a formal request no later than 24 hours before the commencement of the meeting or hearing. to the maximum extent practicable, the committee shall provide audio and video coverage of each hearing or meeting for the transaction of business in a manner that allows the public to easily listen and view the proceedings and shall maintain the recordings of such coverage in a manner easily accessible to the public. 6. witnesses a. statement of witnesses each witness who is to appear before the committee or subcommittee shall file an electronic copy of the testimony with the committee and the ranking minority member no later than 48 hours before the commencement of the hearing. in addition, the witness shall provide 25 copies of the testimony by the commencement of the hearing. the chair may waive the requirement by the witness providing 25 copies in which case the committee or subcommittee shall provide the 25 copies. each non-governmental witness shall provide to the committee and the ranking minority member, no later than 48 hours before the commencement of the hearing, a curriculum vitae or other statement describing their education, employment, professional affiliation or other background information pertinent to their testimony. as required by rule xi, cl. 2(g) of the rules of the house, each non-governmental witness before the commencement of the hearing shall file with the chair a disclosure form detailing any contracts or grants that the witness has with the federal government. such information shall be posted on the committee website within 24 hours after the witness appeared at the hearing. the failure to provide the materials set forth by the deadlines set forth in these rules may be grounds for excluding both the oral and written testimony of the witness unless waived by the chair of the committee or subcommittee. the committee will provide public access to printed materials, including the testimony of witnesses in electronic form on the committee's website no later than 24 hours after the hearing is adjourned. supplemental material provided after the hearing adjourns, shall be placed on the committee website no later than 24 hours after receipt of such material. b. number of witnesses and witnesses selected by the minority for any hearing conducted by the committee or subcommittee there shall be no more than four non-governmental witnesses of which the ranking minority member of the committee or subcommittee (as appropriate) is entitled to select one witness for the hearing. witnesses selected by the ranking minority member of the committee or subcommittee shall be invited to testify by the chair of the committee or subcommittee (as appropriate). rule 6(a) shall apply with equal force to witnesses selected by the ranking minority member of the committee or subcommittee. the limitations set forth in the preceding paragraph shall not apply if the committee holds a hearing to honor the work of the small business community in conjunction with the annual celebration of small business week. witness limitations for such a hearing shall be determined by the chair in consultation with the ranking minority member. c. interrogation of witnesses except when the committee adopts a motion pursuant to subdivisions (b) and (c) of clause 2(i)(2) of rule xi of the rules of the house, committee members may question witnesses only when they have been recognized by the chair for that purpose. members shall have the opportunity, as set forth in rule xi, cl. 2(j) of the rules of the house, to question each witness on the panel for a period not to exceed five minutes. for any hearing, the chair of the committee or subcommittee may offer a motion to extend the questioning of a witness or witnesses by the member identified in the motion for more than five minutes as set forth in rule xi, cl. 2(j)(b). the chair of the committee or subcommittee shall commence questioning followed by the ranking minority member. thereafter, questioning shall alternate between the majority and minority members in order of their arrival at the hearing after the gavel has been struck to commence the hearing with the first arriving having priority over members of his or her party. if members arrive simultaneously or are there prior to the gavel being struck to commence the hearing, order of questioning shall be based on seniority. in recognizing members to question witnesses, the chair may take into consideration the ratio of majority and minority members present in such a manner as to not disadvantage the members of either party. 7. subpoenas a subpoena may be authorized and issued by the committee in the conduct of any investigation or series of investigations or activities to require the attendance and testimony of such witness and the production of such books, records, correspondence, memoranda, papers and document, as deemed necessary. such subpoena shall be authorized by a majority of the full committee. the requirement that the authorization of a subpoena require a majority vote may be waived by the ranking member of the committee. the chair may issue a subpoena, in consultation with the ranking minority member, when the house is out for session for more than three legislative days. 8. quorum a quorum, for purposes of reporting a measure or recommendation, shall be a majority of the committee members. for purposes of taking testimony or receiving evidence, a quorum shall be one member from the majority and one member from the minority. the chair of the committee or subcommittee shall exercise reasonable comity by waiting for the ranking minority member even if a quorum is present before striking the gavel to commence the hearing. for hearings held by the committee or a subcommittee in a location other than the committee's hearing room in washington, dc, a quorum shall be deemed to present if the chair of the committee or subcommittee is present. 9. amendments during mark-up any amendment offered to any pending legislation before the committee must be made available in written form by any member of the committee. if such amendment is not available in written form when requested, the chair shall allow an appropriate period for the provision thereof and may adjourn the markup to provide sufficient time for the provision of such written amendment. such period or adjournment shall not prejudice the offering of such amendment. for amendments to be accepted during mark-up, there is no requirement that the amendments be filed prior to commencement of the mark-up or prepared with the assistance of the office of legislative counsel. even though it is not necessary, members seeking to amend legislation during mark- up should draft amendments with the assistance of the office of legislative counsel and consult with the chair or ranking member's staff (as appropriate) in the preparation of such amendments. 10. postponement of proceedings the chair in consultation with the ranking minority member may postpone further [[page h6224]] proceedings when a record vote is ordered on the question of approving any measure or matter or adopting an amendment. the chair may resume postponed proceedings, but no later than 24 hours after such postponement, unless the house is not in session or there are conflicts with member schedules that make it unlikely a quorum will be present to conduct business on the postponed proceeding. in such cases, the chair will consult with members to set a time as early as possible to resume proceedings but in no event later than the next meeting date as set forth in rule 3 of these rules. when proceedings resume on a postponed question, notwithstanding any intervening order for the previous question, an underlying proposition shall remain subject to further debate or amendment to the same extent as when the question was

CREC-2015-09-24-pt1-PgH6220,CREC-2015-09-24,114,VETERAN SUICIDE PREVENTION,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6220-H6222] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VETERAN SUICIDE PREVENTION The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. Sinema) for 30 minutes. Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to open the Special Order this evening with my colleague and friend, Congressman Dan Benishek of Michigan. We have some colleagues who are joining us here this evening to continue the discussion we have been enjoying for the last hour of talking about the scourge of veteran suicides and how to stop this scourge. We know that there are brave whistleblowers around this country who have told us and the Nation about the problems at the VA. If it weren't for brave whistleblowers, we may not have learned about the tragedies at my VA, the Phoenix VA, and we could have lost even more lives than we have lost already. In order for the VA to change, it has to put its veterans first and change the culture. We believe that VA employees must continue to speak up and speak out. Brandon Coleman, a Marine Corps veteran, has seen firsthand the important role the VA can play in helping veterans. A decade ago he received help from a dedicated VA counselor, who helped him overcome substance abuse issues and get his life back on track. Wanting to help his fellow veterans, Brandon began working as an addiction counselor with the Phoenix VA in 2009. In January of this year, Brandon approached his supervisor after, over the course of a single week, five suicidal veterans walked out of the Phoenix VA hospital without getting the help they needed from the emergency room. After coming forward with his concerns about how the VA handled suicidal patients, Brandon was placed on administrative leave for adverse behavior and his program was shut down. Mr. Speaker, no one should fear the risk of losing his or her job for speaking out. That is why we introduced the VA Accountability Act, a bipartisan bill to hold poor-performing employees accountable and to increase protections for whistleblowers. Empowering whistleblowers helps our veterans and their families get the answers they deserve. The VA must respond to this challenge with a culture of accountability that protects veterans, not its own bureaucracy. Brandon testified before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee earlier this week on improving accountability within the VA. He is committed to fixing the VA to ensure that all veterans get the same help that he got. I would like to take some time now to turn the podium over to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell). Mr. RUSSELL. I thank the Congresswoman. Mr. Speaker, it is a serious issue that our Nation faces when we imagine the sacrifice that our veterans make only to see them become casualties in a battle with the mind. Those of us who have borne the burden of battle carry the weight of that burden the rest of our lives. As a warrior, I have seen the worst things that human beings can do to one another. I have had to take human life. I have had to watch fellow warriors lose theirs. I have caressed wounded brothers as they have been bleeding. We recall these things and carry these things, and, as warriors, we attempt to process it all when we come home. When we do come home, others attempt to interact with us not quite knowing how that interaction should play out or how to treat the Americans we really are. So, as we address this issue of veteran suicide and as we stand here to speak in support of the many good measures that we have heard today, Mr. Speaker, I would also like to provide a couple of things worth noting with which we could reach out to the community at large, to our States, to all of America. For the population that deals with returning battle veterans, purpose matters. We don't want to come home as victims. We don't want to be put in some special class. We have maintained the stresses of battle, and we have fought our Nation's wars, but purpose matters as we come home. If that purpose is somehow denied us because of fear of capacity or fear of being able to interact with other Americans in employment or in whatever it is that we put our hand to, then we will miss a great opportunity early on to engage returning veterans in things that will help them heal. Secondly, we should treat our returning veterans as the Americans they really are. We somehow unintendedly imagine them as damaged goods, or maybe they have had something happen to them that does not make them quite like we are. That is a mistake. Thirdly, when we look at the stresses of battle and how they shape our lives, we must remember this, that post-traumatic stress is treatable. As we deal with those who have faced battle as they struggle through this, it is important to note that the returning warrior has not lost his mind or her mind. It is treatable. Mr. Speaker, one can easily relate when you think about, in my home State, maybe surviving a tornado or maybe, across America, being in a horrific car accident or losing a loved one in some capacity. It creates stress on the human being, yet no one in that scenario would say, ``Well, they have been through quite a lot, so I am not sure that they can engage with the public anymore and be employed'' or, ``I am not sure they will be able to handle the daily stresses.'' Instead, we look at them, and we realize that these are life-altering experiences, whether it be through a car accident or a tornado, and we say, ``Wow, that is terrible, but they have really bounced back, and they have done a good job of recovering.'' We need to look at it in the same capacity. I am no physician, but I am a warrior who has come home. For the warrior, as he or she does come home, Mr. Speaker, we must urge all of our warriors, especially as they face insurmountable pressure about ``Does life have a purpose?'' to not live in isolation, and we must understand that the adrenalin of survival at our peak in battle, which is all around us--every sense alive to protect us as we survive-- physiologically doesn't instantly change when we come home. Those levels of adrenalin stay, and we crave them. That is why your returning veteran may ride his motorcycle at 120 miles an hour or pursue a dangerous activity. As the warrior processes it, he must understand as well that it takes time to abate that and to adjust. I also want to point out, Mr. Speaker, that our returning veterans should band together with their fellow warriors. Above all, don't quit. Only we can take ourselves out of that fight. To all of us, I think it is best to recall what Solomon tells us in Ecclesiastes in that two are better than one because they have good reward for their labor, for, if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falls, for he does not have another to help him up. Again, if two lie together, then they have heat. But how can one be warm alone? And if one prevails against him, two shall withstand him, and a threefold cord is not quickly broken. As we attempt here in government to bind up the wounds, we must also realize it is not the government's sole responsibility. As an American community, we need to bind together as those wounds are bound up to heal. Ms. SINEMA. Thank you so much, Representative Russell, for your thoughts and your participation. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn). Thank you for being here this evening. Mr. LAMBORN. I want to thank my colleagues Representative Sinema and Representative Benishek for their leadership on this issue today and for organizing this time together. I also want to thank Representative Russell for his hard-earned insights that he has shared with us. Mr. Speaker, it is critical that we raise awareness for veteran suicide prevention. Unfortunately, this much-needed awareness comes too late for one of my Colorado Springs families. I would like to tell you the story of Noah, a former marine, who served with honor in Iraq in 2009 and in Afghanistan in 2011. I will not use his last name, but his parents have offered the use of his picture. After leaving the Marine Corps, Noah began working on a business degree at [[Page H6221]] the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, and started his own online business. Now, Noah comes from a military family, his dad having honorably served for 23 years. He chose to put off college so that he could serve this great Nation. Unfortunately, his parents are appalled by the care their son did not receive from the VA. They believe their son would still be alive had he received better care. Noah was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and received a 50 percent disability rating due to PTSD. On April 2 of this year, he went to the Colorado Springs VA clinic, where medical notes from his visit state that he had had suicidal thoughts. Noah was prescribed a psychotropic drug and was sent on his way. He was not referred for suicide prevention; he was not offered counseling; and there was no follow-up from the VA. He went missing on May 4 and was found dead from an apparent suicide on May 12 of this year. As you can imagine, his family is devastated. They are asking a lot of serious questions. I had the opportunity to ask some of their questions on their behalf during a June 10 hearing by the Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight & Investigations. During the hearing, two top-level VA officials stated that they would personally look into the case and ``make sure this family had been reached out to directly.'' However, a month after the hearing, no contact had been made, and my office had to once again engage the VA on behalf of this grieving family. The VA has since stated that Noah should have been seen within 2 weeks of his medical appointment and that they are modifying their procedures to, hopefully, make sure this doesn't happen in the future. It should not take the death of a marine to get procedures right in regards to suicide prevention. We owe it to our veterans to get it right the first time. Hopefully, this Special Order and the added awareness of veteran suicide will help prevent another tragedy like Noah's. Ms. SINEMA. Thank you, Congressman Lamborn, for your contribution this evening. Mr. Speaker, before we close this evening, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Benishek), my friend, who has been gracious to cohost our Special Orders this evening. Mr. BENISHEK. Yes. It was great. It was a wonderful Special Order this evening. I want to thank all of my colleagues who took the time to come down and talk about this serious issue that faces our country. Mr. Lamborn discusses a case of suicide that he is very familiar with in his district. That story moves each and every one of us, and it is emblematic of the 22 suicides that occur every day amongst our veterans. There are stories as moving as this one and as tragic as this one as Mr. Lamborn brings up the fact that this patient was seen at the VA and was not helped at the VA. {time} 1715 We need to make sure that the Veterans Administration and this administration puts our veterans not on the back burner as something that is ongoing, but make this a crisis. This is an emergency. This needs to be dealt with now not with reassurances from bureaucrats that it is all going to be better or ``We are changing our policies.'' They have been changing their policies for a long time and nothing has happened. This needs to be an emergency response. As friends and family members of our veterans and those serving our country, there are some things that we can do. We can work to recognize the symptoms that could indicate serious problems and identify where and how to get assistance when we may need it. To all veterans struggling with whether to take your own life, know that there is no shame in asking for help. You are not broken, and God has not forgotten you. You have volunteered to go to war for us, and we have failed to provide you adequate support when you have returned home. That is changing. I beg you to reach out to your local VA, your veterans center, your veterans service organization, or your Congressman to ask for help. I mean, I had two calls today on my cell phone, which I give my number out freely, from veterans that did not get appropriate help at the VA, and I refer them to my staff to get the ball rolling, get moving. Together we can begin to turn the tide on veterans' suicide. Everyone, though, can help fight this epidemic and be there for those that were there for us. I thank my colleague from Arizona (Ms. Sinema) for closing this Special Order hour for us. Ms. SINEMA. Thank you so much, Congressman Benishek. Before we close, we have one more person who has joined us. I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Coffman). Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my unrelenting support for our Nation's veterans who are suffering, often silently, with depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and profound emotional pain. It is absolutely vital that we, as a Nation, address the crisis of veteran suicide. As a Marine Corps combat veteran, I can tell you firsthand that returning home to civilian life can be a difficult transition. Many troops used to the constant daily support of their comrades come home feeling isolated and alone. Many find themselves needing help that too often isn't there. Some units are hit particularly hard, like the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, a group that saw intense combat in Afghanistan and has continued to suffer casualties to suicide years after they have returned. 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines, has seen a suicide rate 14 times higher than that of all other Americans. It is essential that, when our men and women in uniform return to the civilian world and need to reach out for help, somebody reaches back. We need to ensure that veterans get the mental health care they need, when they need it, not after waiting weeks or months for an appointment. We need to ensure that veterans who need medication get it and veterans who don't need medication aren't unnecessarily prescribed drugs with volatile side effects. We need to ensure that, when a veteran calls the VA's Veterans Crisis Line, somebody is available on the other end to listen. But I don't believe this is a problem that begins and ends with the Department of Defense or the Department of Veterans Affairs. Veterans are in all of our communities, our schools, our places of worship, and our social clubs. All Americans should be willing to lend a hand when a veteran may be suffering silently. I share the sentiment expressed by VA Secretary McDonald earlier this year, and I know it is a statement in which my colleagues on both sides of the aisle would uniformly agree: ``Losing just one veteran to suicide is one veteran too many.'' Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker and Members, before I close with the closing statements, I want to take a moment and honor and thank Congressman Benishek not just for the work he has done tonight or the work he has done on the Veterans Committee, but for the great work he has done in Congress for the last three terms. We are sad that you are retiring. We will miss you. But we have one more chance to do this Special Order again next year, and I look forward to that time. So thank you for your help and for your service. Congressman Benishek has not just been a partner to me in the work that we have been doing to help and support veterans, he has been a leader in the Veterans Committee and in his conference and in this House of Representatives. I know, when he leaves this body, he will continue to be a shining light for veterans around this country. Thank you, Congressman. I want to close with a story about a veteran in my district. We recently received a call from David, a constituent of mine who is an Army veteran and a survivor of two suicide attempts. David told us: My mind was plagued with feelings that my parents and siblings would be better off without me because of who I had become as a person. I felt savage and inhuman. No matter what good I did, I couldn't face going back to a normal existence. I had never felt more alone in my life. [[Page H6222]] Through much time and assistance from organizations like the Wounded Warrior Project and mental and physical rehabilitation programs, David gained a new mission in life. He is helping his fellow veterans navigate a daunting system and reintegrate back into civilian life. David wants his fellow warriors to understand that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. His mission of supporting veterans led David to Rally Point, a Phoenix nonprofit veteran service organization working to assist veterans in crisis. Rally Point employs veterans like David who understand the unique needs of fellow veterans, servicemembers, and their families. These are the kinds of solutions we need to ensure that no veteran ever feels like he or she has nowhere to turn. We have made some progress. In February of this year, the President signed the Clay Hunt SAV Act into law, an important step toward improving mental health services for veterans and their families. This bipartisan legislation requires annual third-party evaluations of the VA's mental healthcare and suicide prevention programs to determine which programs are successful and to recommend improvements. It also requires collaboration on suicide prevention efforts between the VA and nonprofit mental health organizations, and it establishes a pilot program using peer support and community outreach to assist veterans transitions from Active Duty. We cannot leave our heroes to fight their toughest battles alone. Thank you again to all of our colleagues who joined us this evening. Our thoughts are with all the families who have lost a loved one to suicide. Each of us can do something to raise awareness, to be that light for a struggling veteran in our community. Businesses can display signs to let veterans know that help is always available. Mental health professionals can volunteer with organizations like Give an Hour to provide free counseling to veterans and their families. We can all learn to recognize the signs of crisis by visiting veteranscrisisline.net and reaching out to the vets in our life. Here in Congress, we can do more. We need a VA that provides real and meaningful help to veterans in need that puts veterans first and works aggressively with community providers to improve the quality and accessibility of care. We need a VA that is transparent and open to restore the trust and credibility it has lost. We, who enjoy freedom every day thanks to the sacrifices of our military servicemembers, must all step up to end the epidemic of veteran suicide. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6220-H6222] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VETERAN SUICIDE PREVENTION The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. Sinema) for 30 minutes. Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to open the Special Order this evening with my colleague and friend, Congressman Dan Benishek of Michigan. We have some colleagues who are joining us here this evening to continue the discussion we have been enjoying for the last hour of talking about the scourge of veteran suicides and how to stop this scourge. We know that there are brave whistleblowers around this country who have told us and the Nation about the problems at the VA. If it weren't for brave whistleblowers, we may not have learned about the tragedies at my VA, the Phoenix VA, and we could have lost even more lives than we have lost already. In order for the VA to change, it has to put its veterans first and change the culture. We believe that VA employees must continue to speak up and speak out. Brandon Coleman, a Marine Corps veteran, has seen firsthand the important role the VA can play in helping veterans. A decade ago he received help from a dedicated VA counselor, who helped him overcome substance abuse issues and get his life back on track. Wanting to help his fellow veterans, Brandon began working as an addiction counselor with the Phoenix VA in 2009. In January of this year, Brandon approached his supervisor after, over the course of a single week, five suicidal veterans walked out of the Phoenix VA hospital without getting the help they needed from the emergency room. After coming forward with his concerns about how the VA handled suicidal patients, Brandon was placed on administrative leave for adverse behavior and his program was shut down. Mr. Speaker, no one should fear the risk of losing his or her job for speaking out. That is why we introduced the VA Accountability Act, a bipartisan bill to hold poor-performing employees accountable and to increase protections for whistleblowers. Empowering whistleblowers helps our veterans and their families get the answers they deserve. The VA must respond to this challenge with a culture of accountability that protects veterans, not its own bureaucracy. Brandon testified before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee earlier this week on improving accountability within the VA. He is committed to fixing the VA to ensure that all veterans get the same help that he got. I would like to take some time now to turn the podium over to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell). Mr. RUSSELL. I thank the Congresswoman. Mr. Speaker, it is a serious issue that our Nation faces when we imagine the sacrifice that our veterans make only to see them become casualties in a battle with the mind. Those of us who have borne the burden of battle carry the weight of that burden the rest of our lives. As a warrior, I have seen the worst things that human beings can do to one another. I have had to take human life. I have had to watch fellow warriors lose theirs. I have caressed wounded brothers as they have been bleeding. We recall these things and carry these things, and, as warriors, we attempt to process it all when we come home. When we do come home, others attempt to interact with us not quite knowing how that interaction should play out or how to treat the Americans we really are. So, as we address this issue of veteran suicide and as we stand here to speak in support of the many good measures that we have heard today, Mr. Speaker, I would also like to provide a couple of things worth noting with which we could reach out to the community at large, to our States, to all of America. For the population that deals with returning battle veterans, purpose matters. We don't want to come home as victims. We don't want to be put in some special class. We have maintained the stresses of battle, and we have fought our Nation's wars, but purpose matters as we come home. If that purpose is somehow denied us because of fear of capacity or fear of being able to interact with other Americans in employment or in whatever it is that we put our hand to, then we will miss a great opportunity early on to engage returning veterans in things that will help them heal. Secondly, we should treat our returning veterans as the Americans they really are. We somehow unintendedly imagine them as damaged goods, or maybe they have had something happen to them that does not make them quite like we are. That is a mistake. Thirdly, when we look at the stresses of battle and how they shape our lives, we must remember this, that post-traumatic stress is treatable. As we deal with those who have faced battle as they struggle through this, it is important to note that the returning warrior has not lost his mind or her mind. It is treatable. Mr. Speaker, one can easily relate when you think about, in my home State, maybe surviving a tornado or maybe, across America, being in a horrific car accident or losing a loved one in some capacity. It creates stress on the human being, yet no one in that scenario would say, ``Well, they have been through quite a lot, so I am not sure that they can engage with the public anymore and be employed'' or, ``I am not sure they will be able to handle the daily stresses.'' Instead, we look at them, and we realize that these are life-altering experiences, whether it be through a car accident or a tornado, and we say, ``Wow, that is terrible, but they have really bounced back, and they have done a good job of recovering.'' We need to look at it in the same capacity. I am no physician, but I am a warrior who has come home. For the warrior, as he or she does come home, Mr. Speaker, we must urge all of our warriors, especially as they face insurmountable pressure about ``Does life have a purpose?'' to not live in isolation, and we must understand that the adrenalin of survival at our peak in battle, which is all around us--every sense alive to protect us as we survive-- physiologically doesn't instantly change when we come home. Those levels of adrenalin stay, and we crave them. That is why your returning veteran may ride his motorcycle at 120 miles an hour or pursue a dangerous activity. As the warrior processes it, he must understand as well that it takes time to abate that and to adjust. I also want to point out, Mr. Speaker, that our returning veterans should band together with their fellow warriors. Above all, don't quit. Only we can take ourselves out of that fight. To all of us, I think it is best to recall what Solomon tells us in Ecclesiastes in that two are better than one because they have good reward for their labor, for, if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falls, for he does not have another to help him up. Again, if two lie together, then they have heat. But how can one be warm alone? And if one prevails against him, two shall withstand him, and a threefold cord is not quickly broken. As we attempt here in government to bind up the wounds, we must also realize it is not the government's sole responsibility. As an American community, we need to bind together as those wounds are bound up to heal. Ms. SINEMA. Thank you so much, Representative Russell, for your thoughts and your participation. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn). Thank you for being here this evening. Mr. LAMBORN. I want to thank my colleagues Representative Sinema and Representative Benishek for their leadership on this issue today and for organizing this time together. I also want to thank Representative Russell for his hard-earned insights that he has shared with us. Mr. Speaker, it is critical that we raise awareness for veteran suicide prevention. Unfortunately, this much-needed awareness comes too late for one of my Colorado Springs families. I would like to tell you the story of Noah, a former marine, who served with honor in Iraq in 2009 and in Afghanistan in 2011. I will not use his last name, but his parents have offered the use of his picture. After leaving the Marine Corps, Noah began working on a business degree at [[Page H6221]] the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, and started his own online business. Now, Noah comes from a military family, his dad having honorably served for 23 years. He chose to put off college so that he could serve this great Nation. Unfortunately, his parents are appalled by the care their son did not receive from the VA. They believe their son would still be alive had he received better care. Noah was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and received a 50 percent disability rating due to PTSD. On April 2 of this year, he went to the Colorado Springs VA clinic, where medical notes from his visit state that he had had suicidal thoughts. Noah was prescribed a psychotropic drug and was sent on his way. He was not referred for suicide prevention; he was not offered counseling; and there was no follow-up from the VA. He went missing on May 4 and was found dead from an apparent suicide on May 12 of this year. As you can imagine, his family is devastated. They are asking a lot of serious questions. I had the opportunity to ask some of their questions on their behalf during a June 10 hearing by the Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight & Investigations. During the hearing, two top-level VA officials stated that they would personally look into the case and ``make sure this family had been reached out to directly.'' However, a month after the hearing, no contact had been made, and my office had to once again engage the VA on behalf of this grieving family. The VA has since stated that Noah should have been seen within 2 weeks of his medical appointment and that they are modifying their procedures to, hopefully, make sure this doesn't happen in the future. It should not take the death of a marine to get procedures right in regards to suicide prevention. We owe it to our veterans to get it right the first time. Hopefully, this Special Order and the added awareness of veteran suicide will help prevent another tragedy like Noah's. Ms. SINEMA. Thank you, Congressman Lamborn, for your contribution this evening. Mr. Speaker, before we close this evening, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Benishek), my friend, who has been gracious to cohost our Special Orders this evening. Mr. BENISHEK. Yes. It was great. It was a wonderful Special Order this evening. I want to thank all of my colleagues who took the time to come down and talk about this serious issue that faces our country. Mr. Lamborn discusses a case of suicide that he is very familiar with in his district. That story moves each and every one of us, and it is emblematic of the 22 suicides that occur every day amongst our veterans. There are stories as moving as this one and as tragic as this one as Mr. Lamborn brings up the fact that this patient was seen at the VA and was not helped at the VA. {time} 1715 We need to make sure that the Veterans Administration and this administration puts our veterans not on the back burner as something that is ongoing, but make this a crisis. This is an emergency. This needs to be dealt with now not with reassurances from bureaucrats that it is all going to be better or ``We are changing our policies.'' They have been changing their policies for a long time and nothing has happened. This needs to be an emergency response. As friends and family members of our veterans and those serving our country, there are some things that we can do. We can work to recognize the symptoms that could indicate serious problems and identify where and how to get assistance when we may need it. To all veterans struggling with whether to take your own life, know that there is no shame in asking for help. You are not broken, and God has not forgotten you. You have volunteered to go to war for us, and we have failed to provide you adequate support when you have returned home. That is changing. I beg you to reach out to your local VA, your veterans center, your veterans service organization, or your Congressman to ask for help. I mean, I had two calls today on my cell phone, which I give my number out freely, from veterans that did not get appropriate help at the VA, and I refer them to my staff to get the ball rolling, get moving. Together we can begin to turn the tide on veterans' suicide. Everyone, though, can help fight this epidemic and be there for those that were there for us. I thank my colleague from Arizona (Ms. Sinema) for closing this Special Order hour for us. Ms. SINEMA. Thank you so much, Congressman Benishek. Before we close, we have one more person who has joined us. I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Coffman). Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my unrelenting support for our Nation's veterans who are suffering, often silently, with depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and profound emotional pain. It is absolutely vital that we, as a Nation, address the crisis of veteran suicide. As a Marine Corps combat veteran, I can tell you firsthand that returning home to civilian life can be a difficult transition. Many troops used to the constant daily support of their comrades come home feeling isolated and alone. Many find themselves needing help that too often isn't there. Some units are hit particularly hard, like the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine Regiment, a group that saw intense combat in Afghanistan and has continued to suffer casualties to suicide years after they have returned. 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines, has seen a suicide rate 14 times higher than that of all other Americans. It is essential that, when our men and women in uniform return to the civilian world and need to reach out for help, somebody reaches back. We need to ensure that veterans get the mental health care they need, when they need it, not after waiting weeks or months for an appointment. We need to ensure that veterans who need medication get it and veterans who don't need medication aren't unnecessarily prescribed drugs with volatile side effects. We need to ensure that, when a veteran calls the VA's Veterans Crisis Line, somebody is available on the other end to listen. But I don't believe this is a problem that begins and ends with the Department of Defense or the Department of Veterans Affairs. Veterans are in all of our communities, our schools, our places of worship, and our social clubs. All Americans should be willing to lend a hand when a veteran may be suffering silently. I share the sentiment expressed by VA Secretary McDonald earlier this year, and I know it is a statement in which my colleagues on both sides of the aisle would uniformly agree: ``Losing just one veteran to suicide is one veteran too many.'' Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker and Members, before I close with the closing statements, I want to take a moment and honor and thank Congressman Benishek not just for the work he has done tonight or the work he has done on the Veterans Committee, but for the great work he has done in Congress for the last three terms. We are sad that you are retiring. We will miss you. But we have one more chance to do this Special Order again next year, and I look forward to that time. So thank you for your help and for your service. Congressman Benishek has not just been a partner to me in the work that we have been doing to help and support veterans, he has been a leader in the Veterans Committee and in his conference and in this House of Representatives. I know, when he leaves this body, he will continue to be a shining light for veterans around this country. Thank you, Congressman. I want to close with a story about a veteran in my district. We recently received a call from David, a constituent of mine who is an Army veteran and a survivor of two suicide attempts. David told us: My mind was plagued with feelings that my parents and siblings would be better off without me because of who I had become as a person. I felt savage and inhuman.

David wants his fellow warriors to understand that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. His mission of supporting veterans led David to Rally Point, a Phoenix nonprofit veteran service organization working to assist veterans in crisis.

I share the sentiment expressed by VA Secretary McDonald earlier this year, and I know it is a statement in which my colleagues on both sides of the aisle would uniformly agree: ``Losing just one veteran to suicide is one veteran too many.'' Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker and Members, before I close with the closing statements, I want to take a moment and honor and thank Congressman Benishek not just for the work he has done tonight or the work he has done on the Veterans Committee, but for the great work he has done in Congress for the last three terms. We are sad that you are retiring. We will miss you. But we have one more chance to do this Special Order again next year, and I look forward to that time. So thank you for your help and for your service. Congressman Benishek has not just been a partner to me in the work that we have been doing to help and support veterans, he has been a leader in the Veterans Committee and in his conference and in this House of Representatives. I know, when he leaves this body, he will continue to be a shining light for veterans around this country. Thank you, Congressman. I want to close with a story about a veteran in my district. We recently received a call from David, a constituent of mine who is an Army veteran and a survivor of two suicide attempts. David told us: My mind was plagued with feelings that my parents and siblings would be better off without me because of who I had become as a person. I felt savage and inhuman. No matter what good I did, I couldn't face going back to a normal existence. I had never felt more alone in my life. [[Page H6222]] Through much time and assistance from organizations like the Wounded Warrior Project and mental and physical rehabilitation programs, David gained a new mission in life. He is helping his fellow veterans navigate a daunting system and reintegrate back into civilian life. David wants his fellow warriors to understand that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. His mission of supporting veterans led David to Rally Point, a Phoenix nonprofit veteran service organization working to assist veterans in crisis. Rally Point employs veterans like David who understand the unique needs of fellow veterans, servicemembers, and their families. These are the kinds of solutions we need to ensure that no veteran ever feels like he or she has nowhere to turn. We have made some progress. In February of this year, the President signed the Clay Hunt SAV Act into law, an important step toward improving mental health services for veterans and their families. This bipartisan legislation requires annual third-party evaluations of the VA's mental healthcare and suicide prevention programs to determine which programs are successful and to recommend improvements. It also requires collaboration on suicide prevention efforts between the VA and nonprofit mental health organizations, and it establishes a pilot program using peer support and community outreach to assist veterans transitions from Active Duty. We cannot leave our heroes to fight their toughest battles alone. Thank you again to all of our colleagues who joined us this evening. Our thoughts are with all the families who have lost a loved one to suicide. Each of us can do something to raise awareness, to be that light for a struggling veteran in our community. Businesses can display signs to let veterans know that help is always available. Mental health professionals can volunteer with organizations like Give an Hour to provide free counseling to veterans and their families. We can all learn to recognize the signs of crisis by visiting veteranscrisisline.net and reaching out to the vets in our life. Here in Congress, we can do more. We need a VA that provides real and meaningful help to veterans in need that puts veterans first and works aggressively with community providers to improve the quality and accessibility of care. We need a VA that is transparent and open to restore the trust and credibility it has lost. We, who enjoy freedom every day thanks to the sacrifices of our military servicemembers, must all step up to end the epidemic of veteran suicide. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",package_114_55.csv,19004,19004,19078,"[congressional record volume 161, number 138 (thursday, september 24, 2015)] [house] [pages h6220-h6222] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] veteran suicide prevention the speaker pro tempore. under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the chair recognizes the gentlewoman from arizona (ms. sinema) for 30 minutes. ms. sinema. mr. speaker, i am very happy to open the special order this evening with my colleague and friend, congressman dan benishek of michigan. we have some colleagues who are joining us here this evening to continue the discussion we have been enjoying for the last hour of talking about the scourge of veteran suicides and how to stop this scourge. we know that there are brave whistleblowers around this country who have told us and the nation about the problems at the va. if it weren't for brave whistleblowers, we may not have learned about the tragedies at my va, the phoenix va, and we could have lost even more lives than we have lost already. in order for the va to change, it has to put its veterans first and change the culture. we believe that va employees must continue to speak up and speak out. brandon coleman, a marine corps veteran, has seen firsthand the important role the va can play in helping veterans. a decade ago he received help from a dedicated va counselor, who helped him overcome substance abuse issues and get his life back on track. wanting to help his fellow veterans, brandon began working as an addiction counselor with the phoenix va in 2009. in january of this year, brandon approached his supervisor after, over the course of a single week, five suicidal veterans walked out of the phoenix va hospital without getting the help they needed from the emergency room. after coming forward with his concerns about how the va handled suicidal patients, brandon was placed on administrative leave for adverse behavior and his program was shut down. mr. speaker, no one should fear the risk of losing his or her job for speaking out. that is why we introduced the va accountability act, a bipartisan bill to hold poor-performing employees accountable and to increase protections for whistleblowers. empowering whistleblowers helps our veterans and their families get the answers they deserve. the va must respond to this challenge with a culture of accountability that protects veterans, not its own bureaucracy. brandon testified before the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee earlier this week on improving accountability within the va. he is committed to fixing the va to ensure that all veterans get the same help that he got. i would like to take some time now to turn the podium over to the gentleman from oklahoma (mr. russell). mr. russell. i thank the congresswoman. mr. speaker, it is a serious issue that our nation faces when we imagine the sacrifice that our veterans make only to see them become casualties in a battle with the mind. those of us who have borne the burden of battle carry the weight of that burden the rest of our lives. as a warrior, i have seen the worst things that human beings can do to one another. i have had to take human life. i have had to watch fellow warriors lose theirs. i have caressed wounded brothers as they have been bleeding. we recall these things and carry these things, and, as warriors, we attempt to process it all when we come home. when we do come home, others attempt to interact with us not quite knowing how that interaction should play out or how to treat the americans we really are. so, as we address this issue of veteran suicide and as we stand here to speak in support of the many good measures that we have heard today, mr. speaker, i would also like to provide a couple of things worth noting with which we could reach out to the community at large, to our states, to all of america. for the population that deals with returning battle veterans, purpose matters. we don't want to come home as victims. we don't want to be put in some special class. we have maintained the stresses of battle, and we have fought our nation's wars, but purpose matters as we come home. if that purpose is somehow denied us because of fear of capacity or fear of being able to interact with other americans in employment or in whatever it is that we put our hand to, then we will miss a great opportunity early on to engage returning veterans in things that will help them heal. secondly, we should treat our returning veterans as the americans they really are. we somehow unintendedly imagine them as damaged goods, or maybe they have had something happen to them that does not make them quite like we are. that is a mistake. thirdly, when we look at the stresses of battle and how they shape our lives, we must remember this, that post-traumatic stress is treatable. as we deal with those who have faced battle as they struggle through this, it is important to note that the returning warrior has not lost his mind or her mind. it is treatable. mr. speaker, one can easily relate when you think about, in my home state, maybe surviving a tornado or maybe, across america, being in a horrific car accident or losing a loved one in some capacity. it creates stress on the human being, yet no one in that scenario would say, ``well, they have been through quite a lot, so i am not sure that they can engage with the public anymore and be employed'' or, ``i am not sure they will be able to handle the daily stresses.'' instead, we look at them, and we realize that these are life-altering experiences, whether it be through a car accident or a tornado, and we say, ``wow, that is terrible, but they have really bounced back, and they have done a good job of recovering.'' we need to look at it in the same capacity. i am no physician, but i am a warrior who has come home. for the warrior, as he or she does come home, mr. speaker, we must urge all of our warriors, especially as they face insurmountable pressure about ``does life have a purpose?'' to not live in isolation, and we must understand that the adrenalin of survival at our peak in battle, which is all around us--every sense alive to protect us as we survive-- physiologically doesn't instantly change when we come home. those levels of adrenalin stay, and we crave them. that is why your returning veteran may ride his motorcycle at 120 miles an hour or pursue a dangerous activity. as the warrior processes it, he must understand as well that it takes time to abate that and to adjust. i also want to point out, mr. speaker, that our returning veterans should band together with their fellow warriors. above all, don't quit. only we can take ourselves out of that fight. to all of us, i think it is best to recall what solomon tells us in ecclesiastes in that two are better than one because they have good reward for their labor, for, if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falls, for he does not have another to help him up. again, if two lie together, then they have heat. but how can one be warm alone? and if one prevails against him, two shall withstand him, and a threefold cord is not quickly broken. as we attempt here in government to bind up the wounds, we must also realize it is not the government's sole responsibility. as an american community, we need to bind together as those wounds are bound up to heal. ms. sinema. thank you so much, representative russell, for your thoughts and your participation. mr. speaker, i yield to the gentleman from colorado (mr. lamborn). thank you for being here this evening. mr. lamborn. i want to thank my colleagues representative sinema and representative benishek for their leadership on this issue today and for organizing this time together. i also want to thank representative russell for his hard-earned insights that he has shared with us. mr. speaker, it is critical that we raise awareness for veteran suicide prevention. unfortunately, this much-needed awareness comes too late for one of my colorado springs families. i would like to tell you the story of noah, a former marine, who served with honor in iraq in 2009 and in afghanistan in 2011. i will not use his last name, but his parents have offered the use of his picture. after leaving the marine corps, noah began working on a business degree at [[page h6221]] the university of colorado, colorado springs, and started his own online business. now, noah comes from a military family, his dad having honorably served for 23 years. he chose to put off college so that he could serve this great nation. unfortunately, his parents are appalled by the care their son did not receive from the va. they believe their son would still be alive had he received better care. noah was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and received a 50 percent disability rating due to ptsd. on april 2 of this year, he went to the colorado springs va clinic, where medical notes from his visit state that he had had suicidal thoughts. noah was prescribed a psychotropic drug and was sent on his way. he was not referred for suicide prevention; he was not offered counseling; and there was no follow-up from the va. he went missing on may 4 and was found dead from an apparent suicide on may 12 of this year. as you can imagine, his family is devastated. they are asking a lot of serious questions. i had the opportunity to ask some of their questions on their behalf during a june 10 hearing by the veterans' affairs subcommittee on oversight & investigations. during the hearing, two top-level va officials stated that they would personally look into the case and ``make sure this family had been reached out to directly.'' however, a month after the hearing, no contact had been made, and my office had to once again engage the va on behalf of this grieving family. the va has since stated that noah should have been seen within 2 weeks of his medical appointment and that they are modifying their procedures to, hopefully, make sure this doesn't happen in the future. it should not take the death of a marine to get procedures right in regards to suicide prevention. we owe it to our veterans to get it right the first time. hopefully, this special order and the added awareness of veteran suicide will help prevent another tragedy like noah's. ms. sinema. thank you, congressman lamborn, for your contribution this evening. mr. speaker, before we close this evening, i yield to the gentleman from michigan (mr. benishek), my friend, who has been gracious to cohost our special orders this evening. mr. benishek. yes. it was great. it was a wonderful special order this evening. i want to thank all of my colleagues who took the time to come down and talk about this serious issue that faces our country. mr. lamborn discusses a case of suicide that he is very familiar with in his district. that story moves each and every one of us, and it is emblematic of the 22 suicides that occur every day amongst our veterans. there are stories as moving as this one and as tragic as this one as mr. lamborn brings up the fact that this patient was seen at the va and was not helped at the va. {time} 1715 we need to make sure that the veterans administration and this administration puts our veterans not on the back burner as something that is ongoing, but make this a crisis. this is an emergency. this needs to be dealt with now not with reassurances from bureaucrats that it is all going to be better or ``we are changing our policies.'' they have been changing their policies for a long time and nothing has happened. this needs to be an emergency response. as friends and family members of our veterans and those serving our country, there are some things that we can do. we can work to recognize the symptoms that could indicate serious problems and identify where and how to get assistance when we may need it. to all veterans struggling with whether to take your own life, know that there is no shame in asking for help. you are not broken, and god has not forgotten you. you have volunteered to go to war for us, and we have failed to provide you adequate support when you have returned home. that is changing. i beg you to reach out to your local va, your veterans center, your veterans service organization, or your congressman to ask for help. i mean, i had two calls today on my cell phone, which i give my number out freely, from veterans that did not get appropriate help at the va, and i refer them to my staff to get the ball rolling, get moving. together we can begin to turn the tide on veterans' suicide. everyone, though, can help fight this epidemic and be there for those that were there for us. i thank my colleague from arizona (ms. sinema) for closing this special order hour for us. ms. sinema. thank you so much, congressman benishek. before we close, we have one more person who has joined us. i yield to the gentleman from colorado (mr. coffman). mr. coffman. mr. speaker, i rise today to voice my unrelenting support for our nation's veterans who are suffering, often silently, with depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and profound emotional pain. it is absolutely vital that we, as a nation, address the crisis of veteran suicide. as a marine corps combat veteran, i can tell you firsthand that returning home to civilian life can be a difficult transition. many troops used to the constant daily support of their comrades come home feeling isolated and alone. many find themselves needing help that too often isn't there. some units are hit particularly hard, like the 2nd battalion, 7th marine regiment, a group that saw intense combat in afghanistan and has continued to suffer casualties to suicide years after they have returned. 2nd battalion, 7th marines, has seen a suicide rate 14 times higher than that of all other americans. it is essential that, when our men and women in uniform return to the civilian world and need to reach out for help, somebody reaches back. we need to ensure that veterans get the mental health care they need, when they need it, not after waiting weeks or months for an appointment. we need to ensure that veterans who need medication get it and veterans who don't need medication aren't unnecessarily prescribed drugs with volatile side effects. we need to ensure that, when a veteran calls the va's veterans crisis line, somebody is available on the other end to listen. but i don't believe this is a problem that begins and ends with the department of defense or the department of veterans affairs. veterans are in all of our communities, our schools, our places of worship, and our social clubs. all americans should be willing to lend a hand when a veteran may be suffering silently. i share the sentiment expressed by va secretary mcdonald earlier this year, and i know it is a statement in which my colleagues on both sides of the aisle would uniformly agree: ``losing just one veteran to suicide is one veteran too many.'' ms. sinema. mr. speaker and members, before i close with the closing statements, i want to take a moment and honor and thank congressman benishek not just for the work he has done tonight or the work he has done on the veterans committee, but for the great work he has done in congress for the last three terms. we are sad that you are

CREC-2015-09-24-pt1-PgS6909-5,CREC-2015-09-24,114,HIS HOLINESS POPE FRANCIS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S6909-S6910] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HIS HOLINESS POPE FRANCIS Mr. REID. Mr. President, today Members of Congress from both Houses were honored to attend a joint meeting of Congress and receive an address from His Holiness Pope Francis, the 266th Pope of the Catholic Church. The Holy Father's visit to address a joint meeting was made possible by the foresight and efforts of Speaker John Boehner, as well as the hard work and dedication of the House and the Senate Sergeant at Arms and the entire congressional community. Everything worked out just fine. Pope Francis captured the heart and consciousness of the world with his message of love, compassion, respect, and good will to all. Sitting and listening to the speaker of the day, His Holiness Pope Francis, I am told this is the longest he has ever spoken at one time in English. He spoke slowly, and we had to listen very closely. So I went back and got a copy of the speech so I could read in my own slow way what he had said. A few things he said were really stunning. ``You are called''--he is talking to us--``to defend and preserve the dignity of your fellow citizens in the tireless and demanding pursuit of the common good, for this is the chief aim of all politics.'' Gee, that is good. He said that he wanted to enter into a dialogue with the many ``elderly persons who are a storehouse of wisdom forged by experience.'' He said: A delicate balance is required to combat violence perpetrated in the name of religion, an ideology or an economic system, while also safeguarding religious freedom, intellectual freedom and individual freedoms. . . . We know that in the attempt to be freed of the enemy without, we can be tempted to feed the enemy within. These are visionary words. He said that ``the voice of faith'' needs to ``continue to be heard, for it is a voice of fraternity and love,'' which brings out the best in each society. We need more people speaking out just as he did about the importance of faith. He said: If politics must truly be at the service of the human person, it follows that it cannot be a slave to the economy and finance. . . . We, the people of this continent, are not fearful of foreigners, because most of us were once foreigners. Now, I am not taking this line by line. I am just skipping through some things that stuck out in my mind. If we want security, let us give security; if we want life, let us give life; if we want opportunities, let us provide opportunities. . . . Why are deadly weapons being sold to those who plan to inflict untold suffering on individuals and society. He said, ``Fundamental relationships are being called into question, as is the very basis of . . . the family.'' I was so impressed with the intent of his remarks. I thought he did an extremely good job, and I am very happy that I had the opportunity to be there and listen. I admire the conviction and heart of His Holiness because it brings every effort of what we do, I think, to the forefront of what we try to do, to live up to what he suggests we should do. He inspired me, I hope all of us, with his commitment to compassion and consideration for the less fortunate. I am certain this should come as a shock to no one, given his humble beginnings. He was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to immigrant parents. Pope Francis worked as a janitor, a bouncer, a lab assistant for a chemist before he started his seminary education. Since the beginning of his papacy, Pope Francis has committed to addressing the needs of the poor, extending mercy to those in need, and restoring joy to the world. Pope Francis was once asked about his view of the church. He said that he viewed the church as ``a field hospital after battle.'' His unique approach to leading the world's 1.2 billion Catholics has captured the attention of billions, Catholic and non-Catholic alike, inspiring us all to live up to our highest values. I was forced to remember today my mentor from my high school days to my time in Congress, who became the [[Page S6910]] Governor of Nevada. We ran independent of one another. We wound up being Governor and Lieutenant Governor. He was a devout Catholic. The values he instilled in me stemmed from his faith. He was the most honest man I ever met. He was a devout Catholic, as I indicated. He went to mass virtually every day. He died--every place he went, it was early. He got to morning mass, 7 o'clock mass, early. It had not started. The priest had not come out yet. He put his head on his shoulder and died. He was such a good man. Those of us who knew him--and so many people knew him--know that he would have enjoyed living in a time where His Holiness is known not just for his influence, knowledge, and righteousness but for his good deeds and kindness to those in need. My friend Mike O'Callaghan had a lot of those same traits. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S6909-S6910] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HIS HOLINESS POPE FRANCIS Mr. REID.

Those of us who knew him--and so many people knew him--know that he would have enjoyed living in a time where His Holiness is known not just for his influence, knowledge, and righteousness but for his good deeds and kindness to those in need. My friend Mike O'Callaghan had a lot of those same traits. ____________________",package_114_55.csv,5023,5023,5097,"[congressional record volume 161, number 138 (thursday, september 24, 2015)] [senate] [pages s6909-s6910] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] his holiness pope francis mr. reid. mr. president, today members of congress from both houses were honored to attend a joint meeting of congress and receive an address from his holiness pope francis, the 266th pope of the catholic church. the holy father's visit to address a joint meeting was made possible by the foresight and efforts of speaker john boehner, as well as the hard work and dedication of the house and the senate sergeant at arms and the entire congressional community. everything worked out just fine. pope francis captured the heart and consciousness of the world with his message of love, compassion, respect, and good will to all. sitting and listening to the speaker of the day, his holiness pope francis, i am told this is the longest he has ever spoken at one time in english. he spoke slowly, and we had to listen very closely. so i went back and got a copy of the speech so i could read in my own slow way what he had said. a few things he said were really stunning. ``you are called''--he is talking to us--``to defend and preserve the dignity of your fellow citizens in the tireless and demanding pursuit of the common good, for this is the chief aim of all politics.'' gee, that is good. he said that he wanted to enter into a dialogue with the many ``elderly persons who are a storehouse of wisdom forged by experience.'' he said: a delicate balance is required to combat violence perpetrated in the name of religion, an ideology or an economic system, while also safeguarding religious freedom, intellectual freedom and individual freedoms. . . . we know that in the attempt to be freed of the enemy without, we can be tempted to feed the enemy within. these are visionary words. he said that ``the voice of faith'' needs to ``continue to be heard, for it is a voice of fraternity and love,'' which brings out the best in each society. we need more people speaking out just as he did about the importance of faith. he said: if politics must truly be at the service of the human person, it follows that it cannot be a slave to the economy and finance. . . . we, the people of this continent, are not fearful of foreigners, because most of us were once foreigners. now, i am not taking this line by line. i am just skipping through some things that stuck out in my mind. if we want security, let us give security; if we want life, let us give life; if we want opportunities, let us provide opportunities. . . . why are deadly weapons being sold to those who plan to inflict untold suffering on individuals and society. he said, ``fundamental relationships are being called into question, as is the very basis of . . . the family.'' i was so impressed with the intent of his remarks. i thought he did an extremely good job, and i am very happy that i had the opportunity to be there and listen. i admire the conviction and heart of his holiness because it brings every effort of what we do, i think, to the forefront of what we try to do, to live up to what he suggests we should do. he inspired me, i hope all of us, with his commitment to compassion and consideration for the less fortunate. i am certain this should come as a shock to no one, given his humble beginnings. he was born in buenos aires, argentina, to immigrant parents. pope francis worked as a janitor, a bouncer, a lab assistant for a chemist before he started his seminary education. since the beginning of his papacy, pope francis has committed to addressing the needs of the poor, extending mercy to those in need, and restoring joy to the world. pope francis was once asked about his view of the church. he said that he viewed the church as ``a field hospital after battle.'' his unique approach to leading the world's 1.2 billion catholics has captured the attention of billions, catholic and non-catholic alike, inspiring us all to live up to our highest values. i was forced to remember today my mentor from my high school days to my time in congress, who became the [[page s6910]] governor of nevada. we ran independent of one another. we wound up being governor and lieutenant governor. he was a devout catholic. the values he instilled in me stemmed from his faith. he was the most honest man i ever met. he was a devout catholic, as i indicated. he went to mass virtually every day. he died--every place he went, it was early. he got to morning mass, 7 o'clock mass, early. it had not started. the priest had not come out yet. he put his head on his shoulder and died. he was such a good man. those of us who knew him--and so many people knew him--know that he would have enjoyed living in a time where his holiness is known not just for his influence, knowledge, and righteousness but for his good deeds and kindness to those in need. my friend mike o'callaghan had a lot of those same traits. ____________________",5023

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Elder Richard G. Scott, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who passed away September 22, 2015, at the age of 86. Richard G. Scott had the razor-sharp mind of an engineer, fused with the tender softness of a disciple's soul. A graduate of George Washington University in mechanical engineering, who did post-graduate training in nuclear engineering, he had a brilliant mind with an uncanny capacity for formulas, projections, and calculations. Yet he became known throughout the world for an enormous heart with an equally uncanny capacity to love and to have empathy for people from every walk of life. Elder Scott's gentle voice invited all who had lost their way, who had given up hope or had wandered far to come home, home to the faith, family, and community that would bring them real peace and lasting, genuine joy. Countless individuals around the world heard his invitation to come home and rightly felt that he was talking directly to them. Ever in search of the one who was lost--Elder Scott's words and witness of Jesus Christ served as the lower lights upon the shore to gently guide many a wanderer home. Elder Scott had an extraordinary depth of empathy, particularly for those who silently suffered and anxiously sought for relief, redemption, and renewal in the midst of life's storms. He, himself, was a man acquainted with grief, having lost two young children and later his wife Jeanene to untimely deaths. He also seemed to intimately understand the feelings of deep discouragement, overwhelming uncertainty, as well as the crushing avalanche of personal inadequacy that can descend upon the human soul during difficult days and trying times. Yet he continually stood as a beacon of hope to those who struggled because he knew with an absolute certainty to what source we should look for strength and security during such days and at such times. His complete love for and belief in the divine potential of each and every soul led him to speak plainly, powerfully, and often with tender, heartfelt, personal feelings. He urged the struggling as well as the faithful to cast aside any behavior, habit or belief that weighed them down or kept them from living up to their full potential. Members of the LDS Church all around the world often felt, as they watched him speak, that he was not only speaking specifically to them but also that he was looking straight into their souls. In truth, he was just speaking with such love, empathy, and genuine compassion that he empowered his listeners to look into their own hearts and see what their Savior saw in them. Elder Scott saw people not for where they were currently positioned on the road of life but for the potential each person had to do, be, and become more. He once declared: ``We become what we want to be by consistently being what we want to become each day.'' Elder Scott's vision extended far beyond the struggles of mortality; he focused on raising our sights to higher things, grander places, and more noble thoughts. [[Page S6911]] The role of the family as the bulwark of society was paramount in his life and teachings. Elder Scott often expressed his belief in the unparalleled power and influence that a man and a woman, equally yoked as husband and wife, could have on children and communities. He taught that in marriage oneness is not sameness and of the vital importance of valuing our differences. To illustrate, he once declared: ``I may not know what it means to be a woman, but I do know what it means to be taught by one and to love one with all my heart and all my soul.'' His love for his wife Jeanene was legendary and was forever sprinkled into his sermons. I take comfort in knowing that after nearly 20 years, Elder Scott has gone to that Heavenly home he so often pointed to and is once again united with Jeanene. One of Elder Scott's colleagues described him as a clever teacher. His formula for teaching was not of the engineering variety but rather followed a pattern described in a hymn by Lorin Wheelwright entitled ``Help Me Teach with Inspiration,'' which says: Help me teach with inspiration; Grant this blessing, Lord, I pray. Help me lift a soul's ambition To a higher, nobler way. Help me reach a friend in darkness; Help me guide him thru the night. Help me show thy path to glory By the Spirit's holy light. Help me find thy lambs who wander; Help me bring them to thy keep. Teach me, Lord, to be a shepherd; Father, help me feed thy sheep. Elder Richard G. Scott was indeed an inspired teacher, a leader, and lifter of people. His amazing mind and compassionate soul enabled him to help engineer a path for all of us to return home. Mr. FLAKE. Will the Senator yield? Mr. LEE. I yield to the Senator. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I just wish to second what has been said about Elder Scott and appreciate the Senator from Arizona--or Utah, taking the time to say it. One of my fondest memories of being in Congress was at one point showing Elder Scott around a bit of the Capitol. He knew it well. He had been here before, but it was my privilege and honor to be with him at that time. It has been my privilege and honor over many years to hear him at general conference and other venues exhorting people to follow the example of Christ and to love their families, love their wives. To see him pass now after such dedicated service for so long, it is truly wonderful for him to be reunited with his wife and for his family to reflect on a life of service. I thank the Senator for his comments and wished to add my own. I yield back. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from Arizona for his kind remarks regarding Elder Scott. I would also remark, just briefly, that my late father, himself an Arizonan, would be pleased to hear me referred to as a Senator from Arizona, given that I was born there. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I think many of us today have been struck with a serious case of deja vu because once again, with a government shutdown looming, some Republicans continue to pander to their base with a political show vote instead of working with Democrats to prevent a budget crisis. Once again, it is women's health that is being used as a tea party political football, with Republicans attempting to cut off women's access to care, and once again workers and families across our country are watching Congress and wondering whether their elected officials can do the absolute bare minimum. The government shutdown that Republicans pushed us into in 2013 did nothing to help them repeal the Affordable Care Act, but it did have real consequences for families and communities we represent. Workers didn't know when they would get their next paycheck. Businesses felt the sting of fewer customers. Families across the country lost even more trust that elected officials in Washington, DC, could get anything done. In my home State of Washington, thousands of employees at Joint Base Lewis-McChord were sent home with no return in sight. Startups couldn't get small business loans, national parks such as Mount Rainier shut down. It kept families away from true national treasures and customers away from small businesses that rely on their tourism. After all of that, I had hoped Republicans would learn their lesson, especially because once that economy-rattling exercise in futility came to an end, I was proud to work with the Republican budget chairman, Paul Ryan, to do what we shouldn't have needed a shutdown to get done-- negotiate a 2-year bipartisan deal that prevented another government shutdown. It restored critical investments in priorities such as education, research, and defense jobs and showed our families that government can get something done when both sides are willing to come to the table and compromise. That deal was an important reminder that governing by crisis simply does not work. Unfortunately, now it seems that some of my Republican colleagues have forgotten that, because instead of working across the aisle on another bipartisan budget deal, as Democrats have pushed them to do for months, some Republicans are once again using a looming fiscal deadline as an opportunity to pander to their base, no matter what that means for our workers and families who are wondering whether government will still be running in a few days. Since they clearly need another reminder, attacking women's health does not keep the government open and these shutdown threats will not work. It didn't work in 2011, when House Republicans tried to defund Planned Parenthood in the budget at the very last minute. It didn't work in 2013, when extreme Members of the GOP were dead set on repealing ObamaCare, and they will not work today. I am going to be proud to vote against this partisan attempt to defund Planned Parenthood and take critical health care services away from millions of people. Then I hope that finally Republicans will remember what they should have learned last Congress: accept that enough is enough and make sure that women, workers, families, and our economy are protected from a completely unnecessary crisis. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Wasteful Spending Mr. COATS. Mr. President, since February I have been coming to the Senate floor every week to talk about the waste of the week. Back in 2010, when I made the decision to answer a call to run for the Senate again, one of the primary reasons for my decision to go forward was my alarm over the plunge into debt and rising deficit that was taking place. At the time, the national debt of this country was a little over $10 trillion. It is alarming to note that as I stand here 5 years later, our debt has nearly doubled. It's over $18 trillion in just the 5 years I have been here. There were alarm bells ringing in 2010, and those alarm bells were saying that we cannot stay on this course, that it is going to come back to haunt us someday, that it will affect our economy, that it will affect our credit rating. Someday the bill collector will be at the door of the taxpayer saying: You have to pay up big time or we are going to go into default. What took place going forward from that was a series of efforts--some of them very equally bipartisan by both Republicans and Democrats who were alarmed at where we were and wishing to come together to persuade the President to work with us and put us on a path toward fiscal responsibility. That work involved any number of proposals and iterations. We all remember the so-called Gang of 6, the Committee of 12, the Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction, and various others who had plans. It was the dominating issue of our time during the first couple of years of my return here in 2011 and 2012. After the election of 2012, when the President was reelected, at his own initiative he reached out to a few Republicans--I was one of them-- and said: I am willing to sit down and work together to deal with this. This is a [[Page S6912]] major issue affecting the future of our country, affecting our economy. I was encouraged that after the election and when no longer seeking any further office, the President would be willing to seriously work with us. We did serious work for several months. The President's top three appointees--the head of the Office of Management and Budget, his Chief of Staff, and his political director--met with eight of us on a regular basis, both here in the Capitol and at the White House. We had agreed we would not have any public meetings. We would not have staff. It would just be Members and the President's designated individuals. We did not broadcast what we were doing because we knew it would become public and then political and therefore perhaps end up with the same fate all the other efforts had resulted in. We got to the end of that, and in the end, even though we made an extraordinary number of concessions to the President, even though we essentially had put together a package of items he himself had suggested in his budget plans that we could accomplish in slowing down the growth of government, the spending, and the deficits every year that were rolling out and plunging us into debt, we came up short. At that point, it became very clear to me that we were not going to be able to achieve a long-term plan for putting us on the road to good fiscal health. So I thought: OK, I am hearing from a lot of colleagues here in the Senate but also from other outside sources saying that under sequester we just can't cut any more. We need more revenue to expand necessary spending projects in government. And while some essential functions that only government can do might need that type of attention, there is a range of things that you really have to question why they are on the books in the first place. A number of my colleagues--particularly former Senator Coburn--took this floor often--as I did, as well as others--to point out areas where not the Republican Party had decided, where not individuals representing our party had decided, but where nonpartisan agencies of the government--the General Accounting Office, the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of Management and Budget at the White House--had investigated and produced examples of spending that were either waste, fraud, or abuse, and had no legitimate qualification to stay on the books. So we started looking into this. Thanks to Senator Coburn and others, we have come up with a number of things we could easily take off the books, easily use to pay for essential things, easily use to reduce our deficit spending, keep from going into debt, return money to the taxpayers, or however we wanted to do it. So we started to accumulate that, and our goal was to reach $100 billion to simply defy the myth going around that there is not a penny we can cut and that we have done all we can do. So over the 20-some times I have been on this floor, we have come up with a number of issues which could save the taxpayer money and certainly need to be addressed. Our current total is now well over $100 billion, and today we are adding $10.5 billion to our $100 billion total. We are now at $116 billion. I said we would stop at $100 billion, but the examples keep rolling in, and so we are going to keep going every week. As long as this cycle of the Senate is in session, I will come to the floor and label yet another example of waste. Last month, when I was home in Indiana, coming down from northwest Indiana to our capital city of Indianapolis on Interstate 65 for the umpteenth time--as I drive from north to south or south to north on that road, I pass through wind farms of literally thousands of windmills. Interestingly enough, and as I observed even this time, many of them are not turning. There are windmills--a few of them turning-- driven by the wind, but most of them are not turning. We have thousands of these, and it looks as if fewer than 100 or a comparable number are operating, and so I am wondering why and whether the taxpayer is getting a good deal on this. I want to give a little bit of history of how all this came to be put in place. Back in the early 1990s--in fact, in 1992--the Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which included the renewable electricity production tax credit, called the PTC. The point was that as we looked at alternative ways to produce electricity to reduce our dependence on oil and fossil fuels, there was a tax credit created for those using windmills to create power. It was designed to be claimed if the wind farm was actually making the power. Earlier I said that many times I have come down that road and I have seen windmills that were idle. But the blades had to be turning and the electricity had to be being produced in order to receive that tax credit. At the time, because I thought we were overly dependent on Middle Eastern oil and that it was creating issues for us geopolitically and militarily and otherwise, I thought it would be good to have a stimulus here to support the creation of wind energy, to give us the ability to stand on our own and have less dependence on Middle Eastern oil. The main reason I supported it is because it was to start the process and incentivize diverse energy sources to get them off the ground. It was going to be a short-term boost to help these new energy sources become competitive. The original credit was designed under the law to last only 5\1/2\ years and then there would no longer be this credit. Well, like any other credit, subsidy, or anything else passed here which provides taxpayer support for production of something, it never expires. Few if any of them expire on the expiration date. So once again, once you get a law on the books, once you get a credit on the books, once you get a subsidy on the books, you can't get it off. Since the time the original bill passed, the wind industry and its supporters have repeatedly come to Congress and said: Just give us a few more years and then wind will be competitive, without taxpayer subsidies. As a result, this 5\1/2\-year program, which started in 1992, has been extended multiple times. In 2013, nearly two decades after the time the subsidies expired, Congress changed the rules so the facilities only have to begin construction before the expiration date to automatically qualify for a future 10-year subsidy, even before those windmills become operational. So if someone is just in the business of building windmills, as some of our major companies are, they are going to qualify for the subsidy. They are going to get the tax credit--whether or not the windmills are needed. They can just pour some concrete and start the building process, and they are going to qualify for the credit. The result is that more and more wind facilities are being constructed irrespective of the needs of the electricity grid or market demand. Just last year, Warren Buffett, who is a smart investor, noted that wind isn't profitable without subsidies. He said: For example, on wind energy, we get a tax credit if we build a lot of wind farms. That's the only reason to build them. They don't make sense without the tax credit. So regardless of the demand, regardless of whether or not those windmills need to be turning and generating electricity, regardless of whether or not that electricity can be put into the grid--and, by the way, the cost of wind energy is three to four times the cost of fossil fuel energy--regardless of any of that, the tax credit is there. In 2014 Congress retroactively extended the wind tax credit at the end of the year, and the general assumption here in Congress is that the production tax credit will once again be extended at the end of this year. That is probably going to happen. According to an estimate from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, if we continue and extend this tax credit, this will add another $10.5 billion to our budget. Clearly, it is way past time to end this seemingly never-ending subsidy. It is time to give the hardworking taxpayers savings, and it is time to stop wasteful spending. If we can prevent Congress from just automatically extending this way beyond the original 5\1/2\ years, decades beyond, we can save the taxpayers $10.5 billion. So today I am adding to this chart and picture here $10.5 billion, which now totals $116 billion-plus in terms of money that falls under the category of waste, fraud, and abuse. My colleagues cannot come down to this floor and say we can't cut a penny more of any program and defend the numerous--now [[Page S6913]] well more than 20--examples of what have been defined as waste, fraud, and abuse--not by me, not by the Republican Party, but by nonpartisan agencies of the Federal Government. There it is. Stay tuned for next week's ``Waste of the Week.'' I yield the floor. Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, it is time give it our best to move America forward and give Americans a fair shot. Let's show the American people that we can work across the aisle and across the dome to get the job done. Instead, here we are facing another shutdown showdown. There is no reason for there to be a government shutdown. Republican leadership does not want a shutdown. Democrats don't want a shutdown. There may be some drama, but we intend to keep the government open and avoid shutdown, slamdown politics. I hoped the Senate had learned its lesson in October 2013, when Republicans shut down government over the Affordable Care Act, or this February 2015, when Republicans threatened the Department of Homeland Security with shutdown over immigration policy. Senate Democrats won't be threatened and bullied into accepting poison pill riders. Serious policy issues like family planning and reproductive health deserve serious debate rather than becoming an ``add on'' rider to a funding bill. Shutdowns are bad for everyone, jeopardizing family checkbooks, business bottom lines, and the Federal checkbook. A shutdown makes it impossible for Federal agencies to meet missions that serve the American people. A shutdown means furloughed Federal employees and contractors; delayed tax returns; delayed small business loans; and delayed contracts. Uncertainty slows economic growth and hurts the health and well-being of the entire Nation. When the government was closed for 16 days in 2013, the shutdown hurt our growing economy, sacrificing 120,000 private sector jobs. Billions of dollars of economic output was lost. We lost 6.6 million work days, about 850,000 Federal employees were sent home. My home State was hit particularly hard. Maryland is home to many Federal agencies. It was not just the Federal workers that got hurt. The Baltimore Sun wrote about Jay Angle, the owner of Salsa Grill, a Peruvian restaurant in Woodlawn outside the Social Security Administration. Every day, 4,700 workers go to work at Social Security, but only 500 were on the job during the shutdown. Salsa Grill counts on the Social Security workers as customers, but they were not there. There were stories like Jay's all over the country. Because of the 2013 shutdown, hundreds of patients could not enroll in clinical trials at the National Institutes of Health, NIH, so their last chance for a miracle was delayed or denied. About 8,000 rural families had their home loan decisions delayed, pushing the American Dream down the road. Head Start grantees in seven States closed, leaving 7,200 children at home and families searching for high quality child care. Avoiding a shutdown is just the first step. We also need a new budget deal to cancel sequester. Right now our budget caps spending, but it does not cap tax breaks for billionaires and corporations that send jobs overseas. Americans are angry. They feel the rules are rigged against them and that those who write the rules don't care. But Democrats do care. We believe the people deserve a government on their side. That is why we are fighting to make sure the American people have a government that works as hard as they do. We have three steps to meet that goal. First, no government shutdown. We need to pass a clean, short-term continuing funding resolution with no poison pill riders to keep the government funded and open for business for as short a time as possible. After all, a yearlong CR just locks in sequester. The CR will give us time to take the second step, negotiating a new budget agreement that cancels sequester and lifts the spending caps equally for defense and nondefense spending so we can protect our national security and give the American people a fair shot. After the new budget agreement is reached, we will take the third step, writing and enacting an Omnibus spending bill. Remember, the Appropriations Committee needs 30 days to get the job done once we have our topline. That is my plan to cancel sequester and put the American people first. Why do we want to cancel sequester? Sequester requires draconian cuts to critical programs that will have consequences for American families for a generation. Sequester was supposed to be so arbitrary and unthinkable that it would drive Congress to a budget deal. But gridlock, hammerlock, and deadlock kept that from happening. It was the reality of sequester that led Congress to negotiate the Murray-Ryan budget deal that provided sequester relief for 2014 and 2015. Now we have got deja vu. We need a new agreement to cancel sequester- level spending in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. The Republican budget for fiscal year 2016 calls for spending at the sequester level of $1.017 trillion. The President's budget request asks for $74 billion more. That may sound like a big number, but it is hardly expensive. It is equal to the 2010 level--6 years ago. We must cancel sequester to give Americans a fair shot by investing in our country and our people. Sequester hurts national security. According to Army Chief of Staff General Raymond Odierno, only 33 percent of our brigades are ready to fight. Without sequester relief, the Army will not be truly ready to fight until 2025. Sequester keeps us from building and maintaining our physical infrastructure. Funding to build roads, bridges, and transit creates jobs while easing peoples commutes to their jobs. Sequester deepens our innovation deficit. Funding for basic research is an investment in jobs today and jobs tomorrow. New ideas and discoveries lead to startups that rev up our economy and find new cures for deadly diseases. Under spartan budgets, NIH funding has not kept up with inflation. Even the increases proposed under the Republican spending caps fund NIH by cutting education, college affordability, and labor protections. On the other hand, when we cancel sequester, we will invest in innovation and discovery without sacrificing other investments in our future. For example, the National Science Foundation would give 600 more grants supporting 7,500 scientists, students, teachers, and technicians. Cancelling sequester means meeting compelling human needs. We can help make college affordable for families. Right now, under sequester- level budgeting, Republicans instead took $300 million from Pell grants and eliminated First in the World grants to make college more affordable. Under sequester-level appropriations bills, we can not keep our promises to our veterans. Both the Senate and the House Republican bills underfund medical care at the Veterans Administration--by more than $600 million in the Senate. That is enough money to provide medical coverage for 61,000 veterans. The House also cuts $580 million for building VA health care facilities when there is a $10 billion maintenance backlog. It is clear that we need to end sequester. It is also clear that the shutdown was a disaster for everyone, not to be repeated. Because without the resources to keep our government open, agencies can not serve the American people keeping us safe, healthy, educated, moving, and thriving. The bottom line is we need a new topline. We need a new budget deal to invest in America's safety and future. We need a short-term CR, free of poison pill riders, to get there--not another shutdown. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise once again to speak against this callous, misguided effort to defund Planned Parenthood. This is a clear case of politics being put ahead of the country's best interests. This time the majority has tied this effort to the funding of the entire Federal Government--they are willing to shut down the government over this issue. That is preposterous. Planned Parenthood serves some of the most vulnerable women in our society. It cares for 2.7 million patients in the U.S.--5 million patients worldwide. Ninety-seven percent of the services its 700 clinics provide are basic health care, including breast exams, cervical cancer screenings, testing for sexually [[Page S6914]] transmitted diseases, and contraception. One in five women will use Planned Parenthood as their primary health care provider at some point in their lives. Nationwide, 80 percent of Planned Parenthood patients make less than $18,000 per year. Planned Parenthood is often the only health care option for low- income women and women in rural communities. And yet here we are, facing another effort by Republicans to block funding for this vital health care provider, an effort echoed and supported by Republicans who are running for President. Since this latest attack on Planned Parenthood began in July, I've received more than 25,000 calls and emails from women and men in California who support Planned Parenthood. While the details of the stories vary, they share the same theme: Planned Parenthood was there for them at a critical time in their lives. It was the only place they could go for health care when they were in college, earning minimum wage, or struggling to provide for their children and families. It was the only place where they felt safe and respected. It provided essential tests and screenings and allowed them to plan their families, which is critical to women's economic security over the course of their lives. Here is one example from a constituent in San Francisco. She said ``Thirty-two years ago, I was broke, and Planned Parenthood was the only place that would give me birth control. I am now retired, and my life would be so different if they hadn't been there. This is so necessary for those who can't afford it.'' Another constituent from Alameda said, ``I'm calling your office for the first time because I want you to support Planned Parenthood. When I was a young woman, their medical services saved my life. I hope this phone call helps save them in return.'' To me, that is why this organization is so important to women in this country. Not only does it provide health care, it gives women the ability to make a better future for themselves and their families. I also want to address the false claim put forward by those who are pushing to defund Planned Parenthood: They claim that Planned Parenthood patients would easily find another community clinic to go to for their health care. This is just not true. Community health centers and clinics do great work, but if 2.7 million Planned Parenthood patients were suddenly without a doctor, they simply could not handle the sudden influx of new patients. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that up to 650,000 Planned Parenthood patients would lose their access to health care. What's more, many community clinics don't provide the level of contraception care and other health care services provided by Planned Parenthood. In two-thirds of the counties where Planned Parenthood has a clinic, it serves half of the women eligible to receive family planning services under the Title X program. In California, 13 of 58 counties would not have a single clinic to provide family planning services under the Title X program without Planned Parenthood. That tells us what will happen if this funding is stripped--huge numbers of women across the country will have no place to go for vital health services. This isn't a matter of speculation. We've seen what happens when Planned Parenthood is defunded because it has happened at the state level. In 2012, Texas defunded Planned Parenthood. To serve all the women who needed access to a doctor or nurse, the remaining community clinics would have had to increase the number of patients they saw by an average of 81 percent. In other words, they would have needed to accept almost a doubling of their existing number of patients. Unsurprisingly, those clinics lacked the ability to do so. As a result, nearly 20,000 fewer women were served by the Texas Women's Health Program the following year, a 10 percent decline. The number of prescriptions for birth control was cut in half, meaning 100,000 fewer women were able to access affordable birth control. Louisiana is another State trying to defund Planned Parenthood, and recently defended its actions in court. As part of its rationale, the State actually claimed that dentists and eye doctors are capable of providing women's health care services. Let me repeat: Louisiana officials claimed that women who receive breast exams, contraceptive counseling and prescriptions, and other medical services at Planned Parenthood could go to dentists and eye doctors instead. Any woman knows that is just unrealistic. So make no mistake about it: If Planned Parenthood is defunded, many American women simply will not get the health care they need. The attacks on women's health don't stop at Planned Parenthood's door. The House of Representatives recently proposed completely eliminating the Title X program, which provides affordable family planning services to low-income women. Title X is proven to reduce abortions by preventing unplanned pregnancies. Let me repeat that: The House has proposed to eliminate a program that reduces abortions. Of course, we also know that the House voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act more than 50 times. Here in the Senate we've suffered through at least 30 similar votes. This law they want to repeal guarantees women basic preventive care like mammograms and cervical cancer screenings. It requires that prenatal care and labor and delivery are covered by insurance companies. It prevents women from being denied coverage or charged more because they're women. It's the greatest achievement for women's health in a generation; yet we wasted days and weeks on futile attempts to eliminate it. These attempts to deny women and their families access to basic health care, to defund Planned Parenthood, to eliminate funding for family planning services that reduce abortions, and to deny women the right to make their own reproductive decisions are appalling. Planned Parenthood has been under constant attack since its founding in 1916. Its founder, Margaret Sanger, was thrown in jail for providing birth control to women. The proponents of defunding Planned Parenthood have been engaged in this assault for years. The group behind this latest effort, the Center for Medical Progress, has long-standing ties to the anti-choice movement. It is currently under investigation for possible criminal activity. The individuals who obtained the footage used false identification to represent a fake medical company. The videos, which are presented to the public as the full, unedited videos, have been analyzed by forensics experts at Fusion GPS. And the truth is, they are not the full, unedited videos. Content is missing, and numerous edits have been made even to the so-called full footage videos. Many members of Congress have requested the full videos. Those requests have gone unanswered. So the point is, this is part of a sustained assault on an essential health care provider for millions of American women. I also want to reiterate the real-life consequences of the rhetoric that's been directed at Planned Parenthood and its staff. I talked about this when I spoke on this subject in July. I strongly believe that the rhetoric directed at Planned Parenthood sends a message that it is ``OK'' to intimidate its staff and patients. It is not. A few weeks ago, a Planned Parenthood health center in Washington State was severely damaged when an arsonist lit it on fire. Thankfully, no one was hurt. But I would hope that we'd learn from this event, and opponents of Planned Parenthood would think about the ramifications of their words. This is dangerous territory. In closing, we must remember that the attacks on Planned Parenthood aren't about improving women's health. They are about taking away women's rights, choices, and access to the doctors and nurses they know and trust. And quite frankly, their efforts will only jeopardize women's health by removing the only source of health care many women have available. I've seen great gains for women during my lifetime, including more education, greater workplace freedom, and the right to decide what happens to our own bodies. I simply will not stand by and watch our advances slip away. We are standing up for Planned Parenthood because we stand up for women. I urge a ``no'' vote. Let's defeat this bill and move on so we can fund the government and address many other critical issues. [[Page S6915]] Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am in strong opposition to the substitute amendment to H.J. Res. 61 imposing a moratorium on Federal funding for Planned Parenthood clinics and their affiliates unless they stop providing abortions. Let's be clear about one thing: the effort to defund Planned Parenthood is not about Federal funding for abortions. Since 1977, it has been well established under the Hyde amendment that Federal funding cannot be used for abortions, except in very narrow circumstances where the life of the mother is endangered or in cases of rape or incest. The impetus for this amendment stems from the recent release of surreptitiously recorded and heavily edited videos that falsely portray Planned Parenthood's participation in legal fetal tissue donation programs and the subsequent attempts to defund Planned Parenthood on the basis of that intrinsically dishonest campaign. It is not the first time anti-choice advocates have deliberately misrepresented Planned Parenthood. I remember when a Senator stood on the floor of the U.S. Senate 4 years ago and claimed that abortions are ``well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does''. And then his press spokesperson had to acknowledge that what he said ``wasn't intended as a factual statement''. How much of what we are hearing and seeing now isn't ``intended as a factual statement''? Senators certainly are entitled to their sincerely held positions on abortion and contraception, but I think we ought to refrain from saying things we know aren't true, especially on the floor of the United States Senate. The attack on Planned Parenthood, if successful, would have a devastating impact on women and families across this country, especially lower income women and their families. Planned Parenthood health centers are an integral part of our safety net health care system, providing high quality, affordable health care services to 2.7 million patients per year. Every year, Planned Parenthood physicians and nurses provide family planning counseling and contraception to 2.1 million women, perform nearly 400,000 screenings for cervical cancer and nearly 500,000 breast exams, and provide nearly 4.5 million tests and treatments for sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Banning Federal funding for Planned Parenthood would put millions of women at risk of having no place to go for basic, preventive health care. For many women, family planning clinics such as Planned Parenthood provide the only basic health care they receive. In fact, 6 in 10 women who access care through a family planning health center consider it their main source of health care. More than half of Planned Parenthood health centers are located in rural areas, health professional shortage areas, or medically underserved areas, putting women living in those areas at particular risk of losing access to health care services. It isn't just Planned Parenthood that is under attack; it is also the one out of every five women in this country who has relied on Planned Parenthood for health care at some point in her lifetime. Earlier this week, I also voted against invoking cloture on another assault on women's reproductive health--H.R. 36, an unconstitutional attempt to impose a nationwide ban on abortions when the ``postfertilization age'' of the fetus is determined to 20 weeks or greater, with extremely limited exceptions. More than 40 years ago, in its landmark Roe v. Wade decision, the Supreme Court made it clear that women in this country have a constitutional right to abortion services and that no legislature may ban abortion prior to viability, which is exactly what H.R. 36 attempts to do. Previous attempts to impose previability bans on abortion have been repeatedly struck down by the courts, and last year, the Supreme Court refused to review a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision permanently blocking Arizona's 20- week ban. Nevertheless, anti-choice advocates continue their relentless efforts to undermine women's reproductive rights and health in any and every way possible. The cloture votes on H.R. 36 and today's amendment to defund Planned Parenthood are simply the latest attempts. In addition to imposing an unconstitutional previability ban on abortion, H.R. 36 threatens doctors with criminal penalties, including up to 5 years in prison, for attempting or performing an abortion in violation of the bill's onerous restrictions, which is clearly intended to intimidate and discourage doctors from providing abortion care. The bill also puts the health of pregnant women at risk by allowing an exception to the 20-week ban only in the very narrow circumstance where an abortion is necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman. Therefore, under H.R. 36, a pregnant woman who develops a serious medical condition or complication after 20 weeks would be barred from terminating her pregnancy, no matter how serious the risk to her health, unless the abortion is deemed necessary to prevent the woman's death. In addition, H.R. 36 would not allow an exception in the heart- wrenching situation in which a severe fetal anomaly is discovered late in a woman's pregnancy, despite the fact that these conditions are often only detectable around 20 weeks. H.R. 36 also lacks a reasonable exception to the 20-week ban for victims of rape and incest. Adult women who have been raped would be required to report the assault to law enforcement or undergo compulsory medical treatment or counseling at least 48 hours prior to receiving an abortion, meaning that the rape survivor must have at least two appointments with two different providers in order to access the care she needs. H.R. 36's treatment of minors who have survived rape or incest is even more extreme. For minors who have been the victim of rape or incest, H.R. 36 would require proof that the crime was reported to law enforcement or the appropriate government agency in order to qualify for an exception to the 20-week ban. These extremely narrow exceptions completely ignore the fact that the majority of sexual assault survivors do not or are not able to report their assaults to law enforcement for a variety of compelling reasons. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention--CDC--estimate that only 35 percent of sexual assaults or rapes were reported to the police in 2010. It is simply unconscionable to subject survivors of rape and incest to these burdensome and unnecessary requirements in order to receive the care they need. We are 6 days away from a government shutdown; yet we have spent most of this week on misguided attempts to ban legal abortions and defund Planned Parenthood--and to link the Planned Parenthood issue to whether the Federal Government will remain open for business--even as it has been obvious to everyone that such attempts would fail. A government shutdown is a completely avoidable crisis, and using floor time this time to attack women's health care and reproductive rights instead of negotiating a bipartisan plan to fund the government is both unacceptable and irresponsible. The American people deserve better. They deserve a budget that supports a strong national defense and growing economy, not the threat of another government shutdown. I urge my colleagues to join with me in opposing these latest attacks on women's reproductive rights and access to high quality, comprehensive health care services. Recognition of the Majority Leader The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized. His Holiness Pope Francis Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I know I speak for the entire Senate when I say it was a privilege to welcome the Pope to the Capitol this morning. For the thousands who gathered on the Capitol lawn, it was an experience they are unlikely to ever forget. A quiet nod, a soft smile, a simple wave--the gestures may have been small, but their meaning ran deep, captured forever in the hearts of the faithful and the hopeful. As we turn back to the work of governing, many will interpret his words in many ways. The media certainly has. But we can also hear him as simply expressing his faith. And we all appreciate his closing remarks: God bless America. Mr. President, it is no surprise that Members of the Senate have differences on issues. That is normal, healthy even. But even if our Democratic colleagues may not agree with us on every [[Page S6916]] issue, let us agree that the scandal surrounding Planned Parenthood is deeply, deeply unsettling. Let us agree that it makes sense to at least place a scandal-plagued political organization on leave without pay and then use that money to fund women's health care as Congress investigates these serious allegations. Let us also agree that it is time for our Democratic colleagues to finally allow the Senate to fund the government, just as we have worked hard to do all year long. Here is the view the new Senate took from the beginning. The best way to fund the government is to pass a budget, and then to fund it. That may be a different approach from previous years, but it is the approach we chose to pursue when we came to office. We didn't think it was right that the Senate hadn't passed a budget in 6 years or that the Senate's Appropriations Committee hadn't passed the 12 bills necessary to fund the government in 6 years. So we changed that. The appropriations process got off to a great start. There was often a spirit of bipartisanship inside that committee. Consider that nearly all of the 12 funding bills passed with bipartisan support. More than half attracted the support of over 70 percent of Democrats. We saw our Democratic colleagues use phrases such as ``win-win-win'' or declare the appropriations legislation would ``do right by'' their particular State as they issued press releases praising the bills that they voted for. It was great to see that bipartisan action. I was hopeful that our Democratic colleagues would actually join with us on the Senate floor to debate and pass the legislation they had praised in committee. But no, they took a different path. I regret that Democratic leadership determined a crisis would be necessary to advance a policy aim of growing the government, and that our colleagues decided accordingly to block every single funding bill-- every single one--almost all of which had been supported by a significant number of Democrats in committee. So we have been forced to pursue a continuing resolution as a result. It would be much better to simply finish the appropriations process we worked so hard to advance. But if our colleagues continue to block the Senate from doing so, the Senate is left with very few options. It may be regrettable, but that is the reality we now face. The bill before us would help get things back on track. It would ensure the government remains funded and open. It would adhere to the bipartisan spending level already agreed to by both parties. It would also allow our Democratic colleagues to join us in standing up for women's health instead of a political organization mired in scandal. For 1 year, the legislation would redirect $235 million in Planned Parenthood funding to women's health instead, strengthening health centers that provide critically needed community care. I wish our colleagues hadn't pursued a strategy of blocking government funding. That strategy may have succeeded in bringing the country to this point, but there is no reason to continue blocking every attempt to fund the government or to protect political allies mired in scandal. So I am calling on colleagues across the aisle to join us in standing against a shutdown. I am calling on them to join us in standing up for women's health instead. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time following the vote until 6 p.m. be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees; further, that all time during quorum calls until 6 p.m. be charged equally between both sides. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, all time be yielded back and the Senate proceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on amendment No. 2669. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Cloture Motion Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: Cloture Motion We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Senate amendment No. 2669 to H.J. Res. 61. Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, Marco Rubio, Tom Cotton, Orrin G. Hatch, Joni Ernst, Jeff Flake, Lindsey Graham, David Vitter, Chuck Grassley, Thom Tillis, Steve Daines, Bill Cassidy, David Perdue, John Boozman, James Lankford, Thad Cochran. The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on amendment No. 2669, offered by the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, to H.J. Res. 61, shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. DURBIN.

The majority whip is recognized. His Holiness Pope Francis Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today has certainly been a historic day in Washington, DC. With the arrival of His Holiness Pope Francis this week, Washington has been flooded with the faithful who were eager to mark his first visit to the United States. I know my colleagues and I are grateful we were able to host him at a joint meeting of Congress, and we were all in awe of his incredible stamina given his schedule-- something we are not unfamiliar with. As head of the Catholic Church, Pope Francis leads a diverse community of believers. Catholics in the United States make up about one-fifth of the population in the United States and also in my home State of Texas. In fact, Catholic priests from Spain were some of our earliest settlers in Texas, and one of the dozens of missions established by the Catholic Church early in the 18th century in Texas was Mission San Antonio de Valero, what would later be called the Alamo. It was a privilege to welcome Pope Francis this morning and to hear his remarks. I am told he was the first pontiff ever to address a joint meeting of Congress. Cardinal Daniel DiNardo It was also my honor to host a friend of mine, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, who accepted my invitation to join me today to hear Pope Francis. Cardinal DiNardo is the archbishop of Galveston-Houston, home to more than 1 million Catholics--the largest number of the 15 dioceses in Texas. I have had the honor of knowing Cardinal DiNardo for a number of years, and I am grateful to him for his unwavering commitment to life and for his extreme compassion in both a pastoral and spiritual sense as well as a practical one. We saw that in action recently when historic flooding devastated many of the communities in the Houston area. During that time, Cardinal DiNardo was quick to ensure that Catholic Charities would provide some relief to those in need. There is no doubt that his leadership will continue to serve not only the Catholic community in the Galveston-Houston area well but also all of us in Texas. Mr. President, on another matter, earlier today Democrats blocked a measure that would fund the U.S. Government but redirect Federal money that currently goes to Planned Parenthood to go for women's health care at community health centers. Actually, there are many more community [[Page S6918]] health centers in Texas than there are Planned Parenthood facilities. Earlier this week I outlined how the Democrats, while earlier calling for regular order in this Chamber, have delivered on their promise to block legislation from moving forward that would fund vital parts of our government, such as the men and women in uniform who defend us. This is in spite of the fact that earlier this year, as I believe the majority leader mentioned, members of the Appropriations Committee actually did the work we were elected to do. We passed a budget and then in a bipartisan way passed appropriations bills out of the Appropriations Committee. But because they have chosen to filibuster all of these appropriations bills, we find ourselves with unneeded and unnecessary drama when it comes to funding the Federal Government-- hence the vote on Monday for closing off debate on a continuing resolution to fund the government through December 11, 2015. Unfortunately, even our uniformed military has been taken hostage to this strategy, which has created unnecessary drama, as I said, and created some real hardship. So as we approach the looming fiscal deadline of next Wednesday at midnight, it is important to remember how we got here. While Democrats filibustered legislation that would have removed all Federal funding for Planned Parenthood, this fight--the fight for the sanctity of life Pope Francis talked about this morning--is far from over. We are going to continue the four different investigations of Planned Parenthood's practices and pursue legislation that would protect the fundamental right to life of the unborn. Protecting the sanctity of life is an ongoing mission, and it does not end with this one vote. I yield the floor. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President here we are again: with just 6 days until the Federal Government has to close its doors, we find ourselves faced with another manufactured crisis. Two years ago, it was defunding the Affordable Care Act. Congress has voted nearly 60 times on that so far, all of which failed. In the meantime, more than 17 million Americans who had no health insurance have obtained health insurance. Four years ago, it was the same issue Republicans are pushing today: defunding an organization that provides health care to millions of women across this country. With the vote to defund Planned Parenthood now behind us--for the second time in as many months--it is time to move forward to pass a clean, short-term continuing resolution and get to work addressing the real challenge before us: ending sequestration. We've said it before, and it bears repeating: sequestration was never supposed to become the status quo. Its cuts are so extreme and so draconian that imposing it will hurt programs across the board, impacting every American. Sequestration neglects police and fire departments, national parks, highways and bridges, airports, public health and education; and abandons promises made to our veterans and men and women in uniform. Allowing sequester-level spending bills to become law for the next fiscal year, which the President has rightly said he will not do, would be an abdication of our sworn responsibilities as Members of Congress. We must pass a clean, continuing resolution; we must negotiate a new deal to end sequestration, and we must pass appropriations bills that reflect the urgent needs of our country, not a political score card. Last weekend, my wife, Marcelle, and I were fortunate to join hundreds of Vermont women at the 19th Annual Women's Economic Opportunity Conference in Randolph, VT. I have sponsored this conference each year in an effort to help Vermont women of all ages and generations take advantage of the economic opportunities available to them. From emerging entrepreneurs or those transitioning their careers, thousands of participants have been drawn to the conference over its nearly two decade history. Sequestration puts at risk the ability of small businesses to access loans and counseling from the Federal Government, which helps spur and strengthen our economy. Sequestration will cut critical workforce investment programs that help young workers, dislocated workers, and veterans find permanent employment. Sequestration reverses the progress we have made in recent years to restore our economy and create jobs. The economic harm of sequestration is, of course, not all that is at stake. As Senators in both parties have pointed out, sequestration hurts our national security and the readiness of our Armed Forces. Sequestration hurts our roads, our infrastructure, and our public transit systems and will deeply impact our affordable housing supply. Sequestration makes maintaining our commitment to our veterans, including a generation of disabled veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, nearly impossible. What's more, to meet the requirements of sequestration, we are poised to rob from such vital needs as job training programs and preschool development grants. The bottom line is this: sequestration was never intended to happen. But relying on budget gimmicks, as the Senate's defense spending bill does, while nearly zeroing out critical programs for low-income Americans, as the Senate's transportation and housing bill does, creates more problems. Republican leaders have waited too long to come to the table to negotiate relief from sequester-level spending caps. By passing this clean, short-term continuing resolution, we can get to work now--immediately--to negotiate a new deal that builds on the 2013 Murray-Ryan deal and keep the doors of our government open. We have now had the pointless debate over defunding Planned Parenthood. Let's move on. Let's not manufacture another crisis that puts millions of jobs on the line and hurts Americans in every state of this country. We were elected to represent our constituents. The voice from Vermonters is clear: it is time to get our work done. Mr. CORNYN. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in support of a clean, short-term continuing resolution--or, as we say, a CR--to temporarily fund the government without controversial policy riders. After the vote we just had, I hope we can move to such a measure. Even some Republican leaders have acknowledged that this previous vote was a show vote designed to appease, but to fail. It is part of a troubling pattern that has been emerging over many months of avoiding meaningful, bipartisan talks to fix the budget and waiting until the last moment to deal with issues everyone knows must be addressed. We have an obligation to the American people to keep their government working. It is one of the most basic responsibilities we have as Members of Congress. A clean CR at this juncture fulfills this obligation, keeping the government open for a few more weeks while we work on a plan to eliminate the sequester-level budget caps for defense and nondefense programs. I wish we could have begun work on an overall agreement earlier in the year, as Vice Chairwoman Mikulski and others strongly urged months ago, but at this late hour we should pass this short-term measure and move on to serious negotiations on budget caps for this year and beyond. Shutting the government down now will not serve any useful purpose. What a shutdown will do is waste taxpayers' money and hurt the economy. Indeed, the 2-week Republican government shutdown in 2013 cost our economy billions of dollars. Based on that experience, here is some of what we can expect if there is another forced government shutdown this year: The Department of Housing and Urban Development will have to furlough more than 95 percent of its workforce, impacting services to more than 60 field and regional offices nationwide. Payments will be delayed to the roughly 3,000 local public housing authorities that manage the country's publicly assisted housing programs. In fact, this shifts the burden onto them, causing them to turn to local municipalities that are equally stressed in terms of their budgets. So there is no avoiding [[Page S6919]] this pain--in fact, it will be multiplied if we shut down the government. Thousands of home sales and mortgage-refinancing packages backed by the Federal Housing Administration, the FHA, will be put on standby. People who are ready to close, people who are ready to make a commitment to a home, people who are ready to keep this economy moving will be told: Stand back; wait and see. Cities, counties, and States will not be able to move forward with new community development block grant projects, preventing important local economic investment. This is a program which affects every community in this country, and it is something which is a very positive, constructive way to give local leaders the resources to fund the local initiatives the community desperately wants and needs. This is not Big Washington; this is local America getting a chance to see their projects put in place. The Federal Aviation Administration will not be able to certify new aircraft, interrupting billions of dollars in sales. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration will be forced to stop investigations and emergency response training. Classrooms will be shuttered for 700 midshipmen at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, NY. These are young men and women who are committing themselves to serve the Nation either directly in the armed services of the United States or as members of our merchant fleet. They will basically be told to go home. Financial support will stop for the Maritime Security Program, the MSP. This is an important public-private partnership that is critical to sustaining our troops serving overseas. These are just a few examples from two of the Departments under my purview as the ranking member of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee. There are many other examples throughout the Federal Government that my colleagues are talking about today. Knowing the results that shutdowns and these hardball tactics have brought before, it is hard to believe some still are willing to resort to budget brinksmanship again. I know many of my colleagues on the other side share my concern. I particularly wish to commend Senator Collins, who has been an excellent leader in chairing the THUD subcommittee, for her support for a clean CR. She has done extraordinary work under very difficult and challenging circumstances. Her support for a clean CR so that we can negotiate a longer term budget solution is indicative of the kind of forthright, thoughtful, and in some cases very courageous service she has rendered to Maine and to the country. While we focus on the immediate showdown threat, let's remember the bigger threats we face in 2016. We are here because of the Budget Control Act and its attendant sequester-level caps on discretionary spending. Let's remember that these sequester-level caps were never intended to be implemented. At the time BCA was enacted, the cuts were considered to be extreme--in fact, so extreme that Congress would not ever let them happen, that they would embrace defense and nondefense, and that they would be an action-forcing mechanism--not an actuality of law but an action-forcing mechanism to cause us on a bipartisan basis to come up with long-term budget solutions. Unfortunately, that solution did not materialize. Over time, we had the very good work of Senator Murray and Congressman Paul Ryan to come up with a 2-year suspension, but we are right back where we were, and these sequester caps are staring us right in the face. But today, rather than working together to tackle the sequester, we are on the verge of orchestrating another fiscal crisis. And it is not a crisis that will help the American people; rather, it will hinder the American people. And, indeed, it is ironic because Members on both sides recognize the BCA cap should be raised for both defense and nondefense appropriations. Indeed, both the Defense authorization and the Defense appropriations bills carry bipartisan sense-of-the-Senate language that says: ``Sequestration relief must be accomplished for fiscal years 2016 and 2017.'' And, ``Sequestration relief should include equal defense and nondefense relief.'' So you have a bipartisan consensus on these two committees that represent a significant number of our colleagues who are essentially saying: We have to end this. And they are saying it because they believe, as I do, that our national security rests not just upon adequate elements of the Department of Defense but adequate investment for all our Federal programs. So beyond committing a clean, short-term funding bill, we must focus on eliminating these draconian spending caps imposed on us by the BCA. We know these caps will cause real harm to programs across the Federal Government that our States and constituents rely on. These are not academic issues that could be dismissed as being some programs that are ineffective and less limiting. These are across-the- board cuts that hit all our constituents and hit them hard. Indeed, months ago Chairman McCain and I together wrote to urge the Committee on the Budget to include a higher baseline funding amount for the Department of Defense in the budget resolution. We were essentially asking them to ignore the BCA caps and produce a budget that realistically recognizes the base needs of the Department of Defense-- not the one-time spending of OCO contingency but routine spending that would be projected forth. Senator McCain in particular worked in extraordinarily good faith to try to get such a provision included in the budget resolution, but he did not succeed. And, in response, the use of OCO contingency funds was incorporated to skirt the budget caps. Essentially, what the committee has done--the defense authorization committee--is it has taken the President's budget numbers, but moved money out of the base budget into OCO, beyond the President's request. And what you are doing is creating this OCO funding mechanism--in a sense, a gimmick, really--to cover the real cost--the ongoing cost, the routine continuing cost--of the Department of Defense. That is not good budgeting, and it is not good for Defense either. Because of this I was unable to support legislation on the floor for the Defense authorization bill that in many other respects--virtually every other respect--was extremely well done and extremely thought out. Again, I commend the chairman for all his efforts and those of my colleagues. I clearly disagree that using this OCO funding arrangement--gimmick, sleight of hand, whatever you want to call it--is the way to proceed forward. Relying on it essentially preempts defense from the Budget Control Act and leaves everything else under those onerous caps. As I said, that not only does not adequately and realistically fund defense, but it seriously erodes national security because national security is something more than simply what the Department of Defense does. It is the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security, and it is a myriad of other functions that will not see funding. In fact, they will see their funding begin to shrink dramatically. If we use this approach this year, with the argument that it is just a bridge to the day we finally get ourselves together, I think we are deluding ourselves. It would be much easier next year to put even more money into OCO, to take programs that are traditionally funded through the base budget of the Department of Defense and say: Well, we just don't have room. Let's put it in OCO. It becomes the gift that keeps on giving, and it will not provide the real resources and the certainty the Department of Defense needs over many years to plan for their operations. To stick things in 1-year funding is not to tell the Department of Defense: You can be confident that 2 or 3 years from now, when you are developing that new weapons system platform, the money will be there. It may, but again, it may not. We can't give them that insecurity. We have to give them a sense of certainty. Now, this is a view that is shared not just by myself and some colleagues here on both sides of the aisle but by senior Defense Department officials. They have testified repeatedly before our committee that OCO funding does not provide long-term budget certainty. They need that. And the [[Page S6920]] troops--the men and women they lead--need that. In fact, it really just allows DOD to plan for 1 year. And there are very few programs in the Department of Defense that are 1-year programs. A major weapons system is a multiyear development and then there is the production process. The strategy is not year by year. It is over several years at least. So this is not an efficient and effective way to run the organization. Proper budgeting and planning in the Department of Defense requires at least 5 years. That is the standard. The standard measure is a 5-year program forecast, budget forecast, and we are telling them: Well, this year you can have a bonanza of OCO funds. Next year could be more, could be less, could be much less. This is not the way to efficiently allocate resources for national security and to efficiently develop a strategy to counteract an increasing array of threats around the globe in many different dimensions in many different regions. If we go down this path, it will lead to instability for our troops, their families, and for our defense industrial base. They deserve certainty, not a year-to-year, perhaps- maybe, maybe-perhaps approach. We also need to recognize, as I have repeated before, that national security is not just the Department of Defense. Other agencies are critical--the Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, and Department of Treasury, which does all the terrorist financing sanctions. They have to trace funds flowing around the world to ensure they do not aid and assist terrorist activities or other maligning activities. They need resources too. Taking this approach as it stands now, using this OCO approach for defense and then letting everything else stay under BCA, will not give these agencies the resources they need. I was struck a few days ago when General Petraeus was here testifying that one of the critical areas of effort against ISIL is information warfare. They have proven to be extraordinarily adept at using social media, at communicating through the Internet. One of the questions from my colleague--which was very thoughtful and fundamental--was this: Is the State Department doing enough to counteract--as one of our major foreign policy organizations--this information campaign by ISIL? The General sort of chuckled a bit, and then he said: Let me tell you that when I was commanding, on active service, the State Department had to come to me and essentially borrow $1 million from CENTCOM funds so they could get in the ball game--to just get in the game in terms of information warfare: counteracting measures, public campaigns of information in countries throughout the globe, particularly in the Middle East. That will be much worse if we proceed down this path, and we will not be enhancing our national security. If the ISIL message is unanswered, if they are able to attract adherents from around the globe because all they can really hear is this grotesque discussion of ISIL and what they propose, and there are no counterarguments, there is no countervailing points, we lose that information war. And that is not just a DOD function. Now, we have to make investments in both defense and nondefense. But as I said before, if we stick with these BCA caps, our non-DOD programs will suffer. In addition to that, the needs of the American people will suffer. We will not be able to invest in adequate transportation and water infrastructure. We won't be able to do things that provide adequate and decent housing for our citizens. Under the budget caps we will lose jobs too. When the resources diminish, the need for workers diminishes, and that will happen. Now, we have a situation, particularly where some of our most vulnerable Americans would suffer grievously. Here are a few examples. The elderly housing program has been cut in half since 2010, even when we know the United States population today is aging faster. Every Member of this Senate has numerous elderly housing programs in their State. Their low-income seniors rely on them. I would suspect they take some pride in the fact there is adequate housing--in some cases not enough, but at least some adequate housing. They will suffer. There are 7.7 million very low income renters in the United States. That means they pay more than 50 percent of their income in rent or live in substandard housing or both. If these budget caps go into effect, then the THUD bill will not include meaningful funding for the affordable housing production program available to local governments. When we turn to Public Housing Authorities, they are facing more than $3 billion in capital needs just to keep them repaired, just to make them places that are decent to live in, where people can have appropriate hallway lighting, they can have elevators that work, they can have plumbing systems that are adequate--the basics. We are not talking about building whirlpools, spas, and Jacuzzis. This is just meeting basic requirements in maintenance and capital repairs. The level of funding PHA's are faced with is the same level we provided in the late 1980s. That is going back about 30 years. Thirty years ago, relatively speaking, we would be spending as much as we are now on simply maintaining public housing. These are real-world consequences. Again, BCA comes into play in terms of the impact on domestic programs. Funding for public transit continues to fall even while transit ridership goes up. One of the success stories over the past few years is our public transit systems. Our buses, our subway systems, our light rail systems are enjoying increased ridership. That is good for people to get to work, and it is good for our environment because of reduces the use of individual automobiles. But if our ridership goes up and the resources go down, we are going to see a system that gets less and less dependable, reliable, and effective, and we will lose not only a number of those riders but have incidents--as we have seen across the country--where there are significant safety concerns and significant disruptions. It has not been uncommon over the last several months here in Washington to hear on the radio that a whole subway line has gone down because of a maintenance problem or something else, and that day's workforce doesn't get to the office for 3 or 4 or 5 hours. Guess what. That costs a lot of private employers a great deal of money because the people aren't doing the work, and they probably would be paid. So essentially this impacts our economy, and it is multiplied. And it will be exponentially multiplied if we start cutting away the money, as suggested in the Budget Control Act. It is now time to work together and to enact first a clean CR, which will give us the time to systematically and comprehensively address the issues that are staring us straight in the face because of the BCA--the budget caps on Defense and nondefense. It is time to be able to move-- as I believe the vast majority of my colleagues want to--the excess OCO funding back into the regular budget of the Department of Defense as we raise the budget cap, and as we raise the budget cap for the Department of Defense, to recognize we have to raise the cap not only for other national security agencies to protect our country, but also for other agencies in order to invest in our economy, keep us productive, keep people employed, and also keep faith with the thousands and thousands of Americans who have worked and now may need help. There are seniors in need of rental assistance. They need the support of a good transit system to get to work or, if they are a senior citizen, to get to a doctor's appointment. They are counting on us. So I hope all my colleagues can come together, forge an agreement, avoid a shutdown, and then do something more than just keep the lights on--invest across the board in our people and watch those investments multiply to a productive, successful economy and a more secure America. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. [[Page S6921]] Unanimous Consent Request--S. Res. 224 Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, in 1975, Russian physicist Andrei Sakharov was awarded a Nobel Prize for his public opposition to the totalitarian communism of the Soviet Union. He knew what he was talking about as he had spent decades working on the Soviet nuclear weapons program, work he had originally thought was a patriotic duty that would ensure the balance of power with the United States but that he came to understand was in the service of a brutal, oppressive regime with aggressive intentions. The Soviets prohibited Sakharov from accepting the award in person, although his wife Yelena Bonner was abroad at the time. She accepted on his behalf and delivered his seminal speech, ``Peace, Progress, and Human Rights.'' In it, Sakharov declared: I am convinced that international confidence, mutual understanding, disarmament, and international security are inconceivable without an open society with freedom of information, freedom of conscience, the right to publish, and the right to travel and choose the country in which one wishes to live. I am likewise convinced that freedom of conscience, together with other civil rights, provides the basis for scientific progress and constitutes a guarantee that scientific advances will not be used to despoil mankind, providing the basis for economic and social progress, which in turn is a political guarantee for the possibility of an effective defense of social rights. He recited the names of his fellow dissidents who were being persecuted by the Soviets, but he called for peaceful reform, not a violent revolution, saying: We must today fight for every individual person separately against injustice and the violation of human rights. Much of our future depends on this. In struggling to protect human rights we must, I am convinced, first and foremost act as protectors of the innocent victims of regimes installed in various countries, without demanding the destruction or total condemnation of these regimes. We need a pliant, pluralist, tolerant community, which selectively and tentatively can bring about a free undogmatic use of the experiences of all social systems. Sakharov was relieved of all his scientific duties and, after denouncing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1980, was banished to Gorky, 250 miles east of Moscow on the Volga River, to remove him from the public eye. His wife joined him in 1984, charged with anti-Soviet slander, and was prohibited from traveling abroad for medical treatment. Sakharov began a hunger strike in protest. Soviet authorities detained and force-fed him. In solidarity, President Ronald Reagan--who was then initiating his historic negotiations with the Soviets--proclaimed May 18, 1983, National Andrei Sakharov Day, and the following year the United States Congress passed a bipartisan measure renaming the mailing address of the Soviet Embassy from 1125 16th Street to No. 1 Andrei Sakharov Plaza. Every piece of mail delivered to or sent from the embassy would thus bear the name of the courageous dissident the Soviets were trying to silence. The following year, the Soviet Union allowed Bonner to travel abroad for heart surgery, and the year after that, Gorbachev allowed Sakharov and his wife to return to Moscow, although Sakharov remained critical of the slow speed of Gorbachev's reforms until his death in 1989--just 1 month after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The bravery of Andrei Sakharov was instrumental in bringing down a great and oppressive empire. Armed only with the truth, he was able to expose to the world the reality of Soviet Communism, the futility of trying to placate or domesticate the regime, and the power of standing for human rights. Today, we have a case before us that is eerily reminiscent of Sakharov's legacy. Dr. Liu Xiaobo, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, sits today in a Chinese jail for the crime of subversion. A poet, author, and political scientist, Dr. Liu was in 1989 a visiting scholar at Columbia University, but when the pro-democracy protests broke out in Beijing in June of that year, he returned to China to aid the movement. He staged a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square in the midst of the historic student protests and insisted the protests would be nonviolent, even in the face of the violence threatened by the People's Republic of China. The PRC arrested Liu for his involvement in the Tiananmen Square demonstration and sentenced him to 2 years in prison. In 1996, the party subjected him to 3 years of ``reeducation through labor'' for questioning the single-party system. In 2004, the PRC cut Liu's phone lines and Internet connection after he published an essay criticizing the party's campaign to silence so- called subversive journalists and activists. In 2008, Liu, along with over 350 Chinese intellectuals and human rights advocates, penned ``Charter 08,'' a manifesto modeled after the Czech ``Charter 77,'' an anti-Communist manifesto written in 1977 by Vaclav Havel and others calling for human rights and political reforms in the Soviet Republics. Dr. Liu's ``Charter 08'' made 19 specific demands of the PRC, including abandoning one-party rule in favor of instituting a separation of powers composed of a legislative democracy and independent judiciary; abolition of the Hukou housing system that has victimized poor and rural Chinese for decades; and securing freedom of association, assembly, expression, and religion. ``Charter 08'' was released on December 10, 2008. Although the Communist Party quickly censored it, over 10,000 journalists, scholars, businessmen, and teachers have signed the document since 2008. Two days prior to the release of ``Charter 08''--on the eve of the 100-year anniversary of China's first Constitution and the 30-year anniversary of Beijing's Democracy Wall movement--the PRC detained Liu for his involvement in this charter. In June 2009, he was officially arrested and charged with ``inciting subversion of state power'' for his coauthorship of ``Charter 08.'' After being detained for over a year, Liu pled not guilty to ``inciting subversion of state power'' before the Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court on December 23, 2009. His defense was not allowed to present evidence, and on Christmas Day Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison with an additional 2 years' deprivation of all political rights. Beijing High Court rejected his appeal 2 months later. On October 2010, Dr. Liu Xiaobo received the Nobel Peace Prize for his leadership in writing and publishing ``Charter 08.'' Like Sakharov, he could not attend in person but accepted in absentia, boldly declaring in his acceptance speech: Hatred can rot away at a person's intelligence and conscience. Enemy mentality will poison the spirit of a nation, incite cruel mortal struggles, destroy a society's tolerance and humanity, and hinder a nation's progress toward freedom and democracy. That is why I hope to be able to transcend my personal experiences as I look upon our nation's development and social change, to counter the regime's hostility with utmost goodwill, and to dispel hatred with love. The very moment the Nobel Commission awarded the Peace Prize to Liu, his wife Liu Xia was taken into custody by the PRC. She penned an open letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping in June 2013 decrying her unjust arrest and detention: I have been under house arrest and have lost all my personal freedoms since October 2010. No one has told me any reasons for detaining me. I have thought about it over and over. Perhaps in this country it's a ``crime'' for me to be ``Liu Xiaobo's wife.'' Both Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia remain in prison today. The opening paragraph of ``Charter 08'' captures the entirety of Liu Xiaobo's lifework: Having experienced a prolonged period of human rights disasters and challenging and tortuous struggles, the awakening Chinese citizens are becoming increasingly aware that freedom, equality and human rights are universal values shared by all humankind, and that democracy, republicanism, and constitutional government make up the basic institutional framework of modern politics. A `modernization' bereft of these universal values and this basic political framework is a disastrous process that deprives people of their rights, rots away their humanity, and destroys their dignity. Where is China headed in the 21st century? Will it continue with this `modernization' under authoritarian rule, or will it endorse universal values, join the mainstream civilization, and build a democratic form of government? This is an unavoidable decision. Dr. Liu's enormous courage and willingness to voluntarily sacrifice not only his own freedom but also that of those most dear to him poses a challenge to the free world. Will we be silent, eager to enjoy the economic benefits of cooperation with the PRC? Or will we put President Xi on notice that [[Page S6922]] for America, human rights are no longer off the table, and that we are listening to the truth about Communist China. I believe that the freedom championed by Dr. Liu is possible for all the Chinese people. I believe that from Tiananmen Square to Taiwan, the evidence is clear that the Chinese desire--and are capable of-- democracy. I believe that we have a moral responsibility to not marginalize Dr. Liu and his brave fellow dissidents but to make their plight central to all our dealings with the PRC. For that reason, we should follow the example of Ronald Reagan. We should follow the example of standing up to oppression, standing up do the Soviet Union's oppression of Andrei Sakharov. For that reason, in solidarity with the Chinese people engaged in a long and nonviolent struggle for basic human rights, I am asking my colleagues to join me in creating a new version of Sakharov Plaza by naming the street in front of the People's Republic of China Embassy in Washington, DC, Liu Xiaobo Plaza. This would be the street sign that the Chinese Ambassador would look at each day. This would be the address that every piece of correspondence going into the embassy and coming out of the embassy would have written on it, just as with the Soviets when forced to recognize the bravery of Sakharov. The PRC officials will be forced to recognize the bravery of Dr. Liu and to acknowledge it dozens of times a day, day after day. I realize that this is an expedited request, but given the ongoing repression not only of the Lius but of so many other voices for political and religious freedom in China and the imminent arrival of the Chinese leader who is directly responsible for it, I hope that my colleagues will join me. I intend to propound a unanimous consent request, and it is my hope that all 100 Senators will stand with me. But for the moment, I yield the floor. Mr. CRUZ addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Capito). The Senator from Texas. Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, for reasons that I just detailed to this Chamber, reasons for which we should stand in bipartisan unanimity in support of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dr. Liu Xiaobo and in support of human rights and dissidents across the world, that we should follow the successful pattern of Sakharov Plaza under Ronald Reagan, this should be an issue that brings us all together. Accordingly, I ask unanimous consent that the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee be discharged from further consideration of and that the Senate now proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 224. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from California. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I would like to make an observation. The notice for this went out less than an hour ago. The consultations with others haven't been made. It was precipitously brought to the floor, and I can only infer that it has political implications, because the President of China is due to arrive here tomorrow and, therefore, this would be passed today, moved out of committee without a vote in front of the Senate. I don't think that is the way we should do business in this Senate. Maybe people don't believe diplomacy makes a difference, but I do. I think there will be ample time for the President to speak with the President of China and for some of us to speak as well. This is, of course--the human rights, of course--a subject. But in the absence of that, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Texas. Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I note that this is a sad day for this body. When standing up to the Soviet Union, Democrats and Republicans were able to come together in support of Andrei Sakharov, and it worked. It made a difference speaking up for human rights. The senior Senator from California is correct that this was expedited, and she is correct as to why. As I said in this floor speech, the presence of President Xi in this country is precisely the reason that we should stand in unanimity in support of human rights. It is what makes it timely until a few minutes ago, when we had been informed that there were no objections on the Democratic side and Republican side. It saddens me. I know there are many Chinese Americans in the State of California, there are many Chinese Americans in the State of Texas, and across the country there are millions of Americans who care for human rights. Just this morning we sat on the floor of the House of Representatives and listened to Pope Francis talk about putting aside petty partisan differences and coming together with a voice of compassion. Dr. Liu is in a Chinese prison, and the senior Senator from California is standing and objecting to recognizing this Nobel laureate's bravery, is standing and objecting because presumably it would embarrass his Communist captors. I, for one, think as Americans we should not be troubled by embarrassing Communist oppressors. I note, as the senior Senator from California leaves the floor, that this is not an issue that is abstract to me. My family, like Dr. Liu, has been imprisoned by oppressive regimes. My father, as a teenager, was imprisoned and tortured in Cuba. He had his nose broken. He had his teeth shattered. He lay in the blood and grime of a prison cell in Cuba. My aunt, my Tia Sonia, was a few years later again imprisoned and tortured. This time by Castro. My father by Batista and my aunt by Castro was imprisoned and tortured by a Communist regime. It is a sad statement when the United States of America cannot stand up and say: You who are imprisoned unjustly, we stand with you. If any of us listened to a word Pope Francis said this morning, that is a word we should have heard--that we should be a voice of freedom, a clarion voice of freedom across this globe. What we saw on this Senate floor saddens me greatly. I understand the Democrats feel partisan loyalty to the White House, and this White House's Secretary Clinton said at the beginning of the administration that human rights are off the table. America no longer stands for human rights. We will coddle up with oppressors if they make cheap calculators to sell in our stores. I think they are values that transcend the mighty dollar, and it is entirely possible to deal with foreign countries and yet maintain our principles and speak with unanimity. A couple of years ago I had the opportunity to visit with Natan Sharansky, the famed Soviet dissident. He and I visited in Jerusalem. He talked to me about how, when he was in the Soviet gulag, the prisoners would pass from cell to cell notes: Did you hear what President Reagan said--``evil empire,'' ``ash heap of history,'' ``tear down this wall''? The leadership of the United States of America--mind you, it wasn't partisan leadership; it was clear bipartisan leadership in America--shined a light to the dark of those prison cells. I pray today that Dr. Liu, in his prison cell, does not hear word that the Democratic Senators are unwilling to stand with him. That is heartbreaking at a level rarely seen. It is one thing for us to disagree on partisan matters. We can have disagreements over the appropriate rate of capital gains taxes. But for standing with an oppressed Nobel Peace Prize laureate, for standing up to Communist oppression, that should not be a partisan divide. The objection raised by the senior Senator from California is deeply disappointing, and I intend to continue to press this issue because the voice of America, the voice for freedom that Pope Francis urged us to aspire to will not be extinguished. It is who we are that is essential to our character and to our integrity. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. Gun Violence Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, over the course of the summer we have watched with horror as thousands more have died in Syria and Iraq, and the debate over what we should do about it has been omnipresent here in the Senate and in the House. We have held hearings, appeared on television to tell our story of how we should respond, and talked about it on the floor of the [[Page S6923]] Senate and the House. Similarly, we have watched the conflict continue to persist in eastern Ukraine. Although they have not had the same number of casualties as we have seen in Syria and Iraq, they have had similar death and destruction, and we have responded with a vigorous debate on the floor of the Senate--again, hearings in committees, letters to the President, bipartisan pieces of legislation that have been proposed--about how the United States should seek to reduce the amount of casualties in a place like eastern Ukraine, and we are also debating what our response should be in Syria and Iraq. What if I told you that this summer 4,000 people died in another conflict in which there was absolutely no debate here in the Congress? What if I told you there were 4,000 people who died this summer in a conflict and not a single committee in the Congress held a hearing on it? What if I told you there was a conflict this summer in which 4,000 people perished and not a single Member of the majority party in the House or the Senate has proposed any comprehensive way to deal with it? This chart shows the number of people on a daily, monthly, and annual basis who are killed by guns. On average, it is 86 a day, 26,000 a month, and 31,000 a year. This summer, while kids were out of school, over 4,000 people--just this summer--died across this country from gun violence. I come to the floor not as often as I would like but as often as I can to tell some of their stories because I kind of thought these numbers would be enough to persuade Members of this body to do something--anything--to try to stem the scourge of gun violence in this body, but it hasn't, and so my hope is maybe by telling the stories of some of these individuals, it will hopefully make a difference. Every day we add dozens of stories of young men and women--mostly young men and women--whose lives were cut short, whose greatness we were never able to see, whose potential was never realized because they were killed by a gun. This summer we have been gripped by mass shooting after mass shooting. Cynthia Hurd, Tywanza Sanders, Sharonda Singleton, Myra Thompson, Ethel Lance, Susie Jackson, Daniel Simmons, and DePayne Doctor, and Clementa Pinckney--we don't know all of those names, but we know about many of them because they were killed at a mass shooting in a church in South Carolina. Sgt Carson Holmquist, PO2 Randall Smith, GySgt Thomas Sullivan, LCpl ``Skip'' Wells, and SSgt David Wyatt--maybe you have heard their names because they were all killed at a shooting in Tennessee at a Chattanooga Armed Forces recruiting center. Maybe you have heard of Jillian Johnson and Mayci Breaux, who were killed in a movie theater in Lafayette, LA, in July of this year. Most people have now heard of Allison Parker and Adam Ward, who were gunned down on live TV just a few weeks ago in Virginia. On each one of those days--June 17, a shooting in South Carolina; July 16, a shooting in Tennessee; July 24, a shooting in Louisiana; and August 26, a shooting in Virginia--there were dozens more people who died from gunshot wounds whom we never heard of, but they meant something to their families. To this day their loss is experienced deeply by those who knew them well. Some of them were people who were close to those of us who serve in public service. Matthew Shlonsky was killed this summer in Washington, DC. On August 15 he was heading to a going-away party, and he had just stepped out of a cab when he was shot outside of the Shaw-Howard Metro station. He was the sixth gunshot victim in the Shaw area in a little over a week. Think about what it is like to live in a neighborhood in which there have been six shootings over the course of a week. Think of the fear that breeds in those communities. We knew Matthew because he was an intern for one of our colleagues. He was working as a consultant at Deloitte, but he had served as a Senate intern. He was an amazing kid by all accounts. He traveled the world, spoke two languages, and was a star hockey player. His future was absolutely limitless. But because this city is awash in guns--many of them illegal, many of them in the hands of criminals who get them because of giant, gaping holes in our background check system--Matthew Shlonsky is no longer with us. He is dead at the age of 23. How about the heartbreaking story of Carey Gabay, who was 43 years old. He was serving as an assistant counsel to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, and before that he had been counsel of the Empire State Development Corporation. He died on September 16--just on the back end of the summer--after he was caught in the crossfire of a shooting in New York City. He was an innocent bystander when he was shot in the head while attending the pre-West Indian American Day Parade festival with friends and family. He was the son of Jamaican immigrants and grew up in public housing in the Bronx. He had done amazingly well. He attended Harvard University and Harvard Law School. He was working for the Governor and trying to make a better life for others by trying to give opportunities to kids who grow up in the same circumstance as he did. A friend described him as ``an amazing human being who melded public service, professionalism, personal integrity with warmth and caring for everyone he knew.'' He was 43 years old when he was gunned down in broad daylight outside of a festival simply because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. This summer 4,000 people were killed by guns, and not a single public hearing has occurred in the U.S. Senate to discuss a solution. There is not even mention of a debate happening anytime soon on the floor of the Senate as to how we stop these episodes of mass slaughter. We are averaging more than one mass shooting in this country every single day this year. That is astounding. That is shocking. Yet there is total, utter, absolute silence from the world's greatest deliberative body on what we should do about it. I am the last person to say there is any panacea coming from the Congress on how to stem gun violence. We are never going to be able to eliminate these epidemic rates of gun violence just by one law or set of laws that are passed. But what is an absolute indictment of this place is that we don't even try. I have made this contention on the floor before, and I will make it again. I truly believe our silence on this has become complicity. We have become accomplices to these murders because by saying and doing nothing, we offer up a kind of quiet endorsement to people who exist in the fringes of their minds and who are thinking about contemplating violence, and the leaders of this country are doing absolutely nothing to seriously condemn or stop their destructive, malevolent behavior. Our silence has become complicit. I hope that at some point over the course of the rest of this year, we can begin a conversation as to how we can turn these numbers back in the right direction. There is no other country in the industrialized world that even comes close to these numbers. I can offer a suggestion on where to start. If between now and December we can't come to a common understanding on our gun laws--I still don't understand why we can't just do that since 90 percent of Americans support expansive background checks--let's start by fixing the mental health care system. I think there are a lot of reasons why Adam Lanza walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School and killed 20 kids over 2 years ago. The child advocate in Connecticut issued a damning report on his interactions with the mental health care system. His mother tried and tried and tried, but in the end she gave up and let him retreat into the isolation of his room, where he plotted these murders. That family and mother and young man ran into barrier after barrier and obstacle after obstacle trying to find a course of treatment for his very serious set of illnesses. What we know is that people with mental illness are much more likely to be the victims of gun violence than the perpetrators of it. There is no inherent connection between being mentally ill and being violent. There is no greater incidence of mental illness in the United States than anywhere else in the world. Yet we have epidemic rates of gun violence. But I will certainly be the first to admit that if we fix our mental health care system, it will help lots of people who have no intersections with gun violence, and it will [[Page S6924]] push these numbers downward because some of these people are committing these murders because they are not getting treatment for serious illnesses. Senator Cassidy and I--frankly, we don't agree on a lot because he is a conservative Republican from the Deep South, and I am a progressive Democrat from the Northeast--introduced a mental health reform measure which has broad bipartisan support and which would seek to break down these barriers in order to get care for the seriously mentally ill and try to get the parents more involved in the care, especially of young adults. It would increase the capacity in our mental health treatment system for both outpatient and inpatient care. Maybe over the course of the rest of this year, at the very least we can make a dent in the massive shortfalls in our behavioral health care system. The families I have become so close with in Sandy Hook, CT, commanded me to come down to the floor every week or so and tell these stories, the voices of victims. They would like us to come together on a set of meaningful changes to our gun laws. They just don't understand why Adam Lanza was able to walk into the school with a gun that killed 20 little boys and girls in less than 5 minutes because of how powerful it was with the 30-round cartridges he was able to use. They don't want our inability to get action on gun laws to stop us from making other progress that would make the next Adam Lanza less likely. Maybe we can do that. But we should do something. Our silence is an embarrassment after this summer of mass shootings. These news reports should command us to action, but we, frankly, shouldn't have had to wait for the news reports of shootings in Virginia or Louisiana or South Carolina because these numbers were just as true last year as they are this year. Maybe there are more episodes of mass violence and mass shootings and headline-grabbing atrocities, but these numbers which reflect what is happening on the ground in New Haven, CT; Hartford, CT; Boston, MA; Chicago, IL; and Los Angeles have been a reality for a long time, and we should have woken up long ago. But maybe over the course of this year we can make some progress so that moving forward there are a few less voices of victims to bring to the floor of the Senate. I thank the Presiding Officer. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Volkswagen Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I rise to speak about recent revelations that Volkswagen woefully deceived regulators and the general public to artificially lower emissions of its 2009 to 2015 Volkswagen and Audi diesel vehicles. These actions raise significant consumer, environmental, and public health concerns. According to the EPA's Notice of Violation of the Clean Air Act, Volkswagen used a sophisticated software algorithm on certain vehicles that detected when vehicles were undergoing emissions testing. This software--referred to as a ``defeat device''--allows vehicles to meet emissions standards during testing, but under normal driving situations, these same vehicles emit nitrogen oxides up to 40 times the allowable emissions standards. This is unbelievable. I think we can imagine that such technology exists, but I don't think we ever thought that one of our major international car companies would be alleged to have used it. So far approximately 482,000 diesel vehicles sold in the United States and 11 million cars worldwide have been affected. A deliberate attempt like this by a company to mislead regulators and the general public is completely unacceptable. This raises serious questions that need answers: Why did Volkswagen, for more than a year, claim that the discrepancies in the emissions tests and the levels on the road were a technical error? Who at Volkswagen signed off on the defeat device? Did executives at Volkswagen know these actions were put into place to deliberately deceive regulators and the general public? Does the EPA have the necessary testing systems in place to detect such devices that trick the software? Have other auto manufacturers of clean diesel vehicles been tampering with their software to get around emissions standards? How do we ensure that this never happens again? This is a matter of public trust. Consumers were lied to and sold a product under false pretenses. Those consumers who brought certain Volkswagen Jettas, Beetles, Passats, and certain Audis with 2-liter diesel engines believed they were purchasing a vehicle that would provide premium fuel economy and performance while also meeting strict emissions standards. Who wouldn't be enticed by these vehicles after they were named the ``Green Car of the Year'' and ``Eco-Friendly Car of the Year'' by national publications? We now know these consumers were duped and that they will now have to bring their vehicles under compliance to meet Federal emissions standards. Volkswagen will likely pay for the repairs but what about the costs of reduced fuel economy and lower resale values? Congress intentionally included strong enforceability elements into the Clean Air Act statute. Regulations promulgated under the Clean Air Act aimed to protect human health and the environment by reducing nitrogen oxide and other pollutants. Motor vehicles are the primary source of nitrogen oxide pollution from transportation. These highly reactive gases play a major role in atmospheric reactions that produce smog. That smog accelerates climate change and exacerbates respiratory diseases that harm human health, including asthma, which affects 23 million Americans, including 6 million children. That is why we have emissions standards. It is not just some far-off number that is put into place; it is to protect children from getting asthma; it is to protect the world from heating up; it is to ensure that we protect our environment for generations to come. The Clean Air Act requires automakers to certify to the EPA that their vehicles will meet applicable Federal emissions standards to control air pollution. Through this process, Volkswagen deceived regulators into believing these vehicles produced low emissions. Vehicles with the defeat device emit anywhere from 5 to 40 times more nitrogen oxide than allowed by law while on the road. If we pick a number in the middle of the range--let's say 20 times as much--it would mean that Volkswagen's fleet in the U.S. produces 46,657 more tons of harmful smog. Changes to the EPA's emissions standards testing process are needed as well. I have written to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy to express that concern. The EPA needs to explain why their systems did not detect this deceptive software and what changes the Agency will be making with their testing processes. I strongly urge the EPA to establish robust safeguards to prevent automakers from gaming the system and prevent this from happening again. There must also be a full investigation into Volkswagen's actions. The Department of Justice is conducting a criminal investigation into the company's actions, and I urge DOJ to leave no stone unturned in its investigation to determine how a company could have willfully deceived Federal regulators and the general public. Volkswagen must conduct a thorough and comprehensive public education campaign to ensure that all owners of these vehicles are made aware of the defect and are informed about where and when they can go to get their vehicle fixed. The Department of Transportation, which has expertise with vehicle recalls, should also play an active role. If we learned anything from the General Motors and Takata airbag recalls, it is that recalls need to be broad enough from the outset and cover affected vehicle models and years, the general public needs to know how and where to get their vehicle repaired, and automakers must have a system in place to make timely repairs with replacement parts that truly fix the problem. Other agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission, should also take a serious look at how they can help in this process. [[Page S6925]] As a member of both the Senate Commerce Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee, I believe that consumers must be protected. I also believe Volkswagen's competitors that actually follow the law should be able to play on an even playing field. Other car companies that follow the law did the right thing. They put the right systems in place, and they should not be penalized because one car company did this. They should have been able to play on an even playing field. If there is an uneven playing field, it hurts American employees, it hurts American companies, and mostly it hurts American consumers. The actions by Volkswagen to deliberately deceive consumers around the world about the emissions levels in their cars is fundamentally about a breach in trust. Consumers thought they were getting the same product that was being advertised, when what they were getting was a product that met those standards only when it was tested, only for 1 day, and only for the time of the emissions testing. As Federal agencies move forward with their investigation, it is critical that we get to the bottom of this to figure out how this happened, what the extent was, and if it is happening with any other automakers to ensure that what happened never happens again. Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Pilot's Bill of Rights 2 Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I wish to take advantage of an opportunity to bring up the subject that no one is talking about now. Of course, right now everyone has been in the middle of the Pope's visit and other things and what is happening with the Iran bill and the votes we have. I wish to mention there is something else very significant going on right now, that we are in the middle of, and that is the Pilot's Bill of Rights 2. To put it into perspective, 3 years ago last month we had the Pilot's Bill of Rights 1, and it was one people were not aware of. There are only 617,000 pilots in America, so it is not one of these issues that gets an awful lot of attention. But the mere fact that those 617,000 people--many of them are single-issue people. A lot of people are not aware that prior to the passage of the Pilot's Bill of Rights 3 years ago, there was just one area left within our system whereupon you are guilty until proven innocent. That is exactly what we corrected with that bill, just to refresh the memory of my colleagues. It gave the pilots who were accused of something the evidence that was used against them. I had a personal experience with it. It actually happened to me. I was never sensitive to that until such time as I experienced it myself. What we have right now is we are up to 64 cosponsors of the Pilot's Bill of Rights 2. The major part of this bill is something that is out there that doesn't resolve anything. Ten years ago, as kind of an experiment, we put in a sport pilot-eligible exemption so that the pilots of small aircraft would not have to have what they call a third- class medical. The result of this was that after a 10-year period, the medical safety experience of these pilots has been identical to those with medical certificates. A joint study was made following that by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association and by the EAA, the Experimental Aircraft Association, of the 46,976 accidents over a 6-year period. Of those, only 99 had a medical cause as a factor. That is less than one- quarter of 1 percent. Of those 99, none would have been prevented by the current third-class medical. That shows that experiment worked and there is no reason to have a third-class medical. So people are aware that some changes have been made, I want to briefly outline the modifications that have been made. The modifications require three things for pilots to qualify for an exemption. The exemption we are talking about is the exemption from having to take a third-class medical exemption process every 2 years-- sometimes more extensive than that. First, pilots will have to complete an online medical education course. Secondly, pilots have to maintain verification that they have been to a doctor at least once every 4 years and certify that they are receiving the care they need by a physician to treat any medical condition that warrants it. Third, a pilot would have to complete a comprehensive medical review by the FAA. That would be applied to a new pilot, so they establish a benchmark as to what a pilot's physical condition is. The pilot would be required to take an online medical course every 2 years. This gives the pilot access to information on medical issues that may not be covered by a doctor in a medical examination but that would have an impact on their physical condition to fly. For example, this course would make sure pilots are aware of impacts on interactions of over-the-counter and prescription medications and how these interactions could impact their flying capabilities. Requiring pilots to take this course boosts aviation safety for the aviation community. Secondly, pilots would need to complete an exam by their personal physician at least once every 4 years and include a proof of their doctor's visit in their logbooks. This resolves the problem most people are concerned about; that they would have to at least see a physician and be assured that they didn't have some condition they didn't have prior to that. Furthermore, the pilots would be required to certify that they are under the care and treatment of a doctor for any medical condition that would warrant treatment. Pilots would do this instead of visiting an aviation medical examiner every 2 years and sometimes even more frequently than that. With this modification, we are actually encouraging pilots to be honest about their health and seek treatment for it. Right now pilots are incentivized to hide any medical condition from the FAA, including by not seeking treatment for it, out of the fear that the pilot might lose his wings. We don't want that to happen. People who are not pilots do not realize how significant it is that you don't want to be taken out of the air, particularly for some reason that is not justified. Pilots, like any individual, maintain stronger relationships with their personal physician, and this is a good thing that fosters an honest dialogue between pilots and doctors, which is something we should all want and something that is not there today. We want pilots to get the treatment they need. Any medically treated pilot is safer than one who is not being treated. So for many pilots the most burdensome aspects of the FAA controversy is simply the constant churn of submitting paperwork over and over, every 2 years or less, even when there has been no change in their medical status. This bill, as modified, gives pilots a break from the bureaucracy. The third requirement for pilots to receive the third-class medical exemption is to complete one FAA medical review. So if a new pilot comes in, we need a benchmark--where is that pilot, what is his physical condition today--so as time goes by we can see how he might be changing. If someone does not have an existing medical certificate, such as new pilots who have never gone through an exam, they would have to do it before they fall into qualifying for the exemption. By the way, of the 617,000 pilots in America today, this is the one thing that concerns me more than anything else, which is to have to go back and go through the type of examination they are required to, now that we know the 10-year experiment of being exempt has worked. There is one caveat. If a pilot flying under the third-class medical exemption is diagnosed with a severe condition--let's talk about maybe a heart attack--then they need to go through the FAA special issuance process to receive medical clearance to fly again. Again, this would only be needed to be done one time. The ability of the FAA to maintain a stranglehold on pilots will be gone. I am confident the changes will result in a safer flying environment. I want to reiterate that the Pilot's Bill of Rights does not change the certification standard to obtain a pilot's certificate. All pilots still have to possess the pilot's certificate, pass the required practical tests and necessary check rides to [[Page S6926]] demonstrate that they have the knowledge, skills, and ability to safely operate their plane. Further, this bill does not change the fundamental responsibility of every pilot to self-certify their ability to fly each time they get into the cockpit of a plane. I am a pilot, and every time I get in a plane I make a conscious decision that I am fit to fly. Everyone I know who is a pilot does the same thing. Again, all of this is not necessary. When you go back and realize that over the 10 years of the experiment with a limited number of pilots there were no changes. There is no difference between those who have or have not had the pilot exams. With these changes, the third- class medical exemption and the Pilot's Bill of Rights is enjoying a greater level of support from Members of the Senate. Support from general aviation is strongly bipartisan. Sixty-four of my colleagues are cosponsors of this legislation. Half of those are Democrats and half are Republicans. Groups representing general aviation in the community and in the pilot unions have declared their support for the bill. General aviation organizations, such as the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, the Experimental Pilots Association, and the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, support the bill. The National Association of State Aviation Officials support the bill, the Allied Pilots Association and the Southwest Pilots Association, both unions which represent 23,000 pilots who fly for American Airlines, U.S. Airways, and Southwest Airlines, support the bill. Pilots for NetJets support the bill. The bill has strong bipartisan support. I urge all the Members who support general aviation and all the economic activity of general aviation to be a part of this bill. One of the reasons I am doing this today is one of the two organizations--and I am not sure which one it is, it is either the AOPA or the AA--is doing a major effort right now to encourage the pilot population out there to encourage their Members of the Senate to cosponsor this bill. Again, we currently have 64 sponsors of the bill. I can't think of any reason we can't get everyone else. The same individuals who supported it 3 years ago should be there to support it. So I encourage those few Members of the Senate who are not sponsors to look at it very carefully. It may be 617,000 people are not a lot of people, but of the 617,000 people, most of them are single-issue people. So it would be very good to join in on this. This is something we now have demonstrated clearly is not going to incur any safety hazards and it is going to be a real godsend for pilots who don't want to go through this bureaucracy every 2 years or more frequently in some cases. The bill is out there, and it is one I feel very strongly that we ought to be able to work into our floor use probably in the next very short period of time. With that, I do yield the floor because my very good friend from Delaware is here to say something profound. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware. Transportation Funding Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I don't know that I will say anything profound, but I appreciate the chairman of our committee saying that. Madam President, and fellow native West Virginian, I will show a map of the United States in just a minute, and there are some States that are delaying and some States that are cutting back on transportation projects. One of them is West Virginia. One of them is Delaware. I want to talk a little bit about that. Before I do, I would like to go back in time 10 months to the election of last year. I am reminded of the message I heard from the electorate that came out of that election. To simplify it, there were three things they were trying to tell us. No. 1, they want us to work together; No. 2, they want us to get things done; and, No. 3, they want us to get things done that will actually strengthen our economic recovery. If you go back in time to the January--the week Barack Obama and Joe Biden were inaugurated as President and Vice President, 628,000 people filed for unemployment insurance in that 1 week in January of 2009. Any time that weekly number of people filing for unemployment insurance is over 400,000, we are losing jobs in this country and in the economy. Last Thursday we got a number from the Department of Labor. Last week's number was about 265,000 who filed for unemployment. That was last week. There is a new number today--I am not sure what it was, but for the last 28 weeks that number of people filing for unemployment insurance has been under 300,000. I think that is the longest that we have been keeping track, where we had 28 consecutive weeks where fewer than 300,000 people in this country were applying for unemployment insurance. That number is way under 400,000, so we are adding jobs, and we are expecting to continue to add jobs in this country. There are still people looking for jobs in my State, there are in West Virginia, and other States as well, but when you consider the unemployment rate was about 10 percent in the early part of 2009 and today it is a little over 5 percent, we are making progress, but we can make a lot more progress. One of the ways we can make progress is by dealing with our fiscal plan and not hold the Nation's economy hostage with our inability to pass a spending plan. And God help us if we drop the ball on this again and have another shutdown. I sure hope we come to our senses and avoid doing that. My hope is that we will. One of the other ways we can strengthen our economic recovery--and it is right out there for us to seize and do--is to make sure that in a nation where roads, highways, bridges, and transit systems are deteriorating, where we need to make improvements and we need to build, frankly, new projects--new highways, bridges, roads and transit systems--at the very least we need to maintain the quality of what we have or improve the quality of road safety, surfaces, potholes, you name it. There is a lot of work to be done, and there are a lot of people who would like to do the work. The McKinsey Global Institute, an arm of the national consulting firm McKinsey, looked at what we could do for our growing GDP in this country if we fully funded a 6-year transportation plan, what we could do for an employment opportunity if we funded a 6-year transportation plan, and the numbers are remarkable--I think amazing. We were told that fully funding a 6-year transportation plan would grow our GDP by approximately 1.5 percent per year--not for 1 year but for the life of the transportation plan that we funded--probably 6 years at 1.5 percent a year. When you consider the GDP growth over the last couple years, even though it is better than it was, adding 1.5 percent of the GDP growth would help our economy grow in a robust way. We are told by McKinsey & Company's study that a 6-year transportation plan robustly funded would put about 1.8 million people to work. A lot of folks would like to be building roads, highways, and transportation systems, and they don't have employment opportunities because we are not funding them. We are not funding them. Let's take a quick look at this map if we could. The States that are gray are States, as far as we know, that are not planning to delay or cancel projects. They are not even considering delaying projects, but the States that are in red, including Delaware over here, are States that have delayed or cancelled projects. The States that are in yellow, including West Virginia, are States that are considering project delays. That is not good. I have not counted the number of States--it looks like seven--that are in red. Those are the States that have delayed projects. More than that, probably 10, are considering doing that. Why is it important for us to fully fund at the Federal level--do our share for roads, highways, bridges, transit funding? It is because about half of the money that our States spend through their departments of transportation, half their money comes from Federal user fees--largely Federal user fees--primarily, not entirely, but primarily user fees on the sale of gasoline. It has been unchanged in 23 years--not since 1993--22 years. The user fee on diesel has been unchanged for some 22 years, right where we were. The price of everything else goes up. Concrete goes up, asphalt goes up, steel goes up, and labor goes up. We have more energy-efficient vehicles. They are not using as much gas or [[Page S6927]] diesel. That is a good thing, but it is also a bad thing for having funding for transportation projects. So I want to look at a map and would invite all of us to consider it. I don't anybody who says--any economist worth their salt--who does not say: Fully funding a multi- year transportation plan, not for 6 months or 3 months, something like that, but fully funding it--robustly funding it for 6 years--will do great things for our economy. The reason we end up with job growth of something like 1.8 million people, according to McKinsey and Company, is because the economy works far more efficiently if roads, highways, bridges are operating and working well. So I just want to share that and start off my remarks today. I have some numbers here that I would like to share. So far in 2015, this year, four States--Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee, and Wyoming--have shelved some $805 million in projects due to the uncertainty over Federal funds. Again, the uncertainty is over roughly half the money that they are going to spend on roads, highways, and bridges. It comes from Federal user fees, Federal taxes. Our transportation system--at least the way we fund it--has been broken since 2008. Since that time, in the last 5 or 6 years, we have passed I think 12 short-term patches to the tune of nearly $74 billion. How do we pay for them? We pay for them with budget gimmicks. That is how we do it. And we pay for them with debt. When we issue debt, we borrow money. We sell Treasury securities, and we sell them around the world. Among the countries that buy them are China and the Chinese people. We are then beholden to them as our creditors. It puts us in a situation that I do not find too comfortable. My guess is some of you don't either. There are better alternatives to fund our Nation's transportation system. I only mentioned a couple of them. I feel as if I have not a magic wand but the ability to see into the future. Twenty years from now, I think there is a pretty good chance that we will have figured out how to pay for roads, highways, bridges, and transit systems by figuring out how to make sure those folks who use transportation pay for it. One of the ways we are trying to do that--they have been trying to do that in Oregon for almost 10 years. They have something called road user charge. Some people have heard of that term. More people have heard of something called vehicle miles traveled, and the ability to say your vehicle--I don't care what kind of vehicle it is, but we know how many miles that vehicle travels on a road, highway or bridge in the course of a year. There is fee that is attached to that. Some people are uncomfortable with that because it has implications on privacy. I can understand that. In Oregon they are trying to figure it out. They have got about 5,000 vehicles--at least--in their system. They are sort of--I like to say States are laboratories of democracy. In this case, Oregon is trying to be the laboratory. I believe California is looking at being another laboratory to figure out we make something like vehicle miles traveled work in a State. Oregon is good-sized state, and California is a very big State. If they can do that, then we will learn from them, not just at the State level but perhaps at the Federal level as well. I think we will be funding projects--not just now but in the future, 20 years from now--through tooling. When I travel back to my native State of West Virginia, I go through West Virginia and I pay tolls. When I was a little kid and they first built the turnpike, we would have to stop and find change--whatever--stop every 5 or 10 miles. You don't do that anymore. We don't do that anymore in Delaware either, because we have--in Delaware and I think in West Virginia--highway- speed E-ZPass. It is an express E-ZPass. You go through, and it is charged to your credit card that you have already established when you establish your E-ZPass plan. Also, we now have the technology that even if folks don't have an E- ZPass--in some tolling operations around the country, a person drives through in their vehicle, car, truck, van, whatever the system--when you go through the toll plaza, they don't collect a toll. They have a highly accurate camera with the ability to take pictures of the vehicle and great pictures of your license plates, and then they send a bill to the owner of that vehicle. So you don't even have to have high-speed E- ZPass. But a combination of those two, systems like E-ZPass and systems like the one I just described where people drive through with no E- ZPass or a similar system, but they actually get billed for it later on. They do not get billed and fined; they just get billed for it. If you don't pay it, then I am sure something will happen. But I think 20 years from now we will have something that looks a lot like that. My guess is we will also have user fees, but not everybody likes tolling. As it turns out, Oregon has been working on road user charge, also known as vehicle miles traveled. They have been working on it for 10 years, and they have got 5,000 people in the plan. So this is not going to happen in 5 years or 10 years, but maybe 20 years for both a combination of tolling and vehicle miles traveled. There is another idea out there that is used in some places around the country. It is called 3P or P3. When I first heard that, I thought they were talking about P-3 airplanes. I spent a lot of years of my life as a naval flight officer in P-3 aircraft. I used to command them, but they were not talking about airplanes when they were talking about P3. They were talking about public-private partnerships. We have some pretty good examples of where that is working. We can learn from those in different States. I think that can be part of the future. It ought to be. Put the three of them together, is that a comprehensive plan? Not entirely, but it is pretty good approach. It is a heck of a lot better than what we have been doing: pension smoothing, increasing fees for TSA. Instead of improving aviation safety, we put the money in the transportation trust fund. Raising Customs fees--instead of putting the money in ways to make our borders most robust and so forth, we put some of that money in the transportation trust fund. We sell oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve--I think probably at a bad time to sell it, when the price is really low. They say: Buy low, sell high. Well, if we are going to sell petroleum out of the petroleum reserve--the price of oil is about as low right now as it has been in a long, long time. I am told that--I don't know if it was last week or the week before-- there are 10,000 gasoline stations across the country where they are selling gasoline for less than $2 a gallon. I don't know what they are charging in West Virginia, but I filled up my Chrysler Town and Country minivan, which has 403,000 miles on it, and I paid $2.15 a gallon. There are some places in Delaware where people are paying less and in neighboring New Jersey where they are paying less. But right now, it does not make much sense to sell oil out of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. There are some people who want to and who want to use that money to go into the transportation trust fund. I think that is foolish. We have to be smarter than that. I have another chart I want us to take a look at. I want to thank ``Vanna White'' here for putting up these charts. I will pay for that later. This chart talks about legislation--it is kind of ironic. That is S. 1994. I mentioned earlier how the last time we raised the Federal gasoline and diesel tax or fee was in 1993 when we raised it to 18 cents for gas and about 23, 24 cents for diesel. They have been there for 22 years. One of the things I have done is introduce legislation, and I have done so with Dick Durbin, who used to serve on the Bowles-Simpson Commission--remember the Bowles-Simpson Commission. I thought it was a great approach to figure out how to seriously address our Nation's deficit in a variety of ways. One of the ways that Bowles-Simpson said we should address our deficit situation--I will say our budget deficits are down--topped out, I think, in 2009 at $1.4 trillion. This year we are down about $400 billion. Is that an improvement? Yes, it is. Do we have some ways to go? We sure do. What Bowles-Simpson suggested is that we raise the gas or diesel tax at the Federal level by a penny each quarter, a penny every 3 months for 15 quarters. So effectively you would be raising the gas or diesel tax by 3 or 4 cents a year for 4 years and index it going forward. [[Page S6928]] What Senator Durbin and I have introduced is actually something quite similar to that, which a majority of the Bowles-Simpson Commission voted for. It is called the Traffic Relief Act. What it calls for is an annual 4 cent gas increase in gas and diesel. That would be for a total of about 4 years--4 cents a year for 4 years. After that, we would index those user fees, those taxes, to the rate of inflation. The rate of inflation is pretty low lately, so they would not go up very much if the rate of inflation stays where it is. If the rate of inflation rears its head again, then that would be different. A fellow who was a member of my staff back in Wilmington, DE--when we introduced this bill, the price for gas at a station in the neighborhood where his family buys gas--in the space of 2 days, the price of gas either went up or went down by 13 cents. It went up in 2 days, 13 cents. As we know, the price of oil moves up and down all of the time. My own belief is--and I have heard this from a lot of people--there are a lot of days or a lot of weeks where the price of gas or diesel goes up a lot more than 4 cents. Right now our world is not literally awash in oil but certainly figuratively awash in oil. One of the reasons the price at the pump for gas and diesel is so low--as I said earlier, a couple of weeks ago there were 10,000 gas stations across the country selling gas for less than two bucks a gallon. One of the reasons it is so low is because the United States is producing a lot more than we have for some time, and so are a bunch of other countries, including the OPEC nations. With the approval of the Iran agreement, as the Iranians comply with the agreement--my hope is that they will comply in spirit and in letter, and then as a result of that, they will be in a position to begin selling. They have only been selling some of their oil products to customers, including I think India, maybe Japan, China, but they will be able to sell more products. A world that is already awash in oil is going to find that Iran, which I think has the fourth greatest oil reserves in the world, is going to be back in the market and selling their own products. I believe that will keep the prices from rising anytime soon. And I think there is reason to believe that the price at the pump, which is already quite low, might even go down further. Time will tell. I have one last poster board here I wish to look at for just a moment. Our legislation--this is a typo here. It says that it restores $240 billion for the highway trust fund. It is not $240 billion, it is $220 billion. Still, compared to what? Compared to nothing. Compared to doing nothing, it is a whole lot. If we had a status quo, any kind of a status quo increase--a highway bill or a transportation bill--we would use maybe half of that. So what we are talking about is double, just getting by, And we have such a backlog of work to do, that it doesn't make sense just to push enough money to these projects to get by. This would provide roughly twice that amount of money and would maybe not raise our GDP by 1.5 percent, but it would sure raise it. It may not put 1.8 million people to work over the next year, but it would put a lot of people to work and people who like to do these jobs. The money would fully fund the Federal highway and transit programs in our country. It would increase investments in upgrades and in repairs as well. It would do it in a way that doesn't drop a huge burden on users of these products--gasoline and diesel--all in one fell swoop. It is like 4 cents a year over 4 years. After 4 years, there will be a 16-cent increase. People say: Well, what is that in terms of practical impact? What does that actually mean for somebody? I am told that it is actually--I don't drink a lot of coffee, but my friends who do get a small coffee over in the Dirksen Building across the street. They pay $1.70, and if they get a medium-sized coffee, it is like $2.50, and a really big one is maybe a little bit over $3. This is not really fancy coffee but just a regular cup of coffee with cream and sugar, and the price is maybe $2 or $3. Literally for the price of a cup of coffee a week, for those of us who use roads, highways, bridges, who buy gas, who buy diesel, we could have a much better transportation system. This isn't $10 a week or $20 a week or $30 a week. That increase over 4 years--4 cents a year for 4 years--without the data for the average driver, that is about a cup of coffee a week. Is that too much to pay for roads, highways, bridges, and a good transit system? I don't think so. There is an interest in offsetting some of these increases with a regressive tax, but there is an interest in offsetting some of that by making some tweaks like Michigan is going to do with their State earned-income tax credit with a Republican Governor and Republican legislature. I think there is maybe a lesson or something we can do there to help address the regressive nature of this tax. I close by saying I come to this floor from time to time and I mention one of the things I love to do. I don't know if you ever do this, Madam President, but I love to ask people who have been married a long time ``What is the secret for being married for a long time?'' I have done it for years. I have asked this question of hundreds of people who are older folks who have been married 30 years, 40 years, 50 years, 60 years, 70 years. I ask them ``What is the secret?'' I get hilarious answers. I get some that are very poignant and others are just plain memorable for a lot of reasons. But the best answer I have ever gotten is there are two C's. What are the two C's? Communicate and compromise. That is not only the secret for a vibrant marriage between two people, it is also the secret for a vibrant democracy, to communicate and compromise. I would add a third C, and that is to collaborate. What the American people said to us last November--whether they are Republicans, Democrats, or Independents--is that they want us to communicate, they want us to compromise, and they want us to collaborate, and we need to do that. One idea I have not mentioned here bears mentioning. It was an idea that was endorsed last year by the administration and was endorsed last year by the immediate past chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, with whom our President served, Dave Camp. He retired earlier this year as a Congressman from Michigan, a very good person. What they proposed is international tax reform. What both Chairman Camp at the time and the administration said is that there are about $2 trillion in overseas profits of American companies. They are just keeping it over there and they are not that anxious to bring it back because they don't want to have to pay--I don't know--35 percent, 33 percent, 32 percent, 29 percent. They are looking for a lower tax break and then to bring it back when it makes sense. The administration and Dave Camp said: Let's deem it repatriated. The Treasury said: All right. You have money over there, American companies. Bring it back. It is going to be taxed at about 10 percent. That was the proposal. The administration said: American companies that have money over there, we want you to bring it back. You won't be taxed at 35 percent or 25 percent, but you will be taxed at about 14 percent. That is an idea, and it is an interesting idea. It doesn't solve the problem forever. It provides one-time money--quite a bit of it--for roads, bridges, rail, and for airports as well. It doesn't solve the problem permanently, but it surely gives us a lot of money. Not every company likes that idea, and not everybody who serves here likes that idea, but it is a serious idea, and it is one that deserves a lot of consideration, and I hope we will do that. Let me just say this. At the end of the day, if we come to the end of this calendar year--when we run out of money yet again for roads, highways, and bridges and we say ``Well, what are we going to do now?''--we will have not just the States I pointed out here in yellow and red that are bailing on projects, delaying and stopping them in some cases, we will have a lot more yellow and a whole lot more red on the map I had up earlier. What do we do about it? Do we just do what we have done for 5 years and kick the can down the road yet again and look for cats and dogs and wherever we can find a few bucks and sort of throw them at the problem for a while, not make a real committed effort? Frankly, we are not giving the voters in this country any reason to feel encouraged about our courage. I hope we don't do that. [[Page S6929]] If at the end of the day we don't do some kind of international tax reform, good ideas such as expanding tolling, vehicle miles traveled, and public-private partnerships--those are all good ideas, and I hope we grow them all. We are not going to have them all in place in the kind of scope we need by the end of this year. If we find ourselves at a time and place where we run out of money, where the States are looking to us and we are running out of money at the Federal level--and the price of gas is two bucks a gallon at gas stations across America--my hope is people will say: You know, for the price of a cup of coffee, I could have good roads, highways, bridges, and transit systems again. For the price of a cup of coffee a week, I could have that. Forty cents a week, maybe. Maybe that is not a bad deal for their family or for our country. I want people to think about that. In the weeks to come, I am going to be talking a lot about this proposal. My hope is that as time goes buy, people will say--like my dad used to say in West Virginia when my sister and I were little kids growing up and they were in West Virginia--my dad used to say to my sister and me after we had done yet another boneheaded stunt: Just use some common sense. He said that a lot. He did not say it that nicely. But I think this may be an opportunity for us to use some of that common sense here, and I know he would approve, and at the end of the day, so would the voters of America. There are a number of States that have actually done what I am talking about. They have raised their user fees, and in some cases they have phased them in over a couple of years. It is interesting what happened in the elections last year where the State legislators had voted to do that, where they raised the user fees in order to would pay for roads, highways, and bridges. Interestingly enough, the legislators who voted for that--Republicans--didn't get thrown out of office. Ninety-five percent of them were reelected. They won their primaries, they won their general elections, and they were reelected. The Democrats who voted for those modest user fees increases didn't get thrown out of office either. In the States that raised the money locally to make the improvements that were needed in transportation, 90 percent of the Democrats won their primaries and they won their general elections. They were reelected. People want us to make hard choices here. They don't want us to continue to kid them or fool them; they want us to do the real thing. They want us to work together. They want us to get things done. They want us to strengthen our economic recovery, and this is not a bad way to do that. With that, I see a great American from New Mexico has joined us. He is somebody who has worked with the Senator from Louisiana and the Senator who was just here before, Mr. Inhofe, the chairman of the EPW Committee, to try to find a good way for us to strengthen the economic recovery and at the same time to further clean our air, promote public health, and do good things for our public environment. I wish to say to Tom Udall how proud I am to be his colleague and how much I appreciate his leadership position on a very important issue, an environmental law that hasn't been updated in almost 40 years and, frankly, doesn't work. It has never worked, and we need to do something about it. Under his leadership, along with our other two colleagues, my hope is that we will. I look forward to what he has to say. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico. TSCA Mr. UDALL. Madam President, thank you very much for the recognition. I wish to say to Senator Carper about TSCA that we have been working on--you were one of the early Senators who really cared about this issue. You were involved with it, and you helped it develop. Over time, we did a marvelous thing in terms of improving what Senator Frank Lautenberg had put on the table, bipartisan--he developed a lot of Republican and Democratic support--and you were a key player all the way through. So we know--we think at this point, you and I believe--and we do a lot of visiting around on both sides of the aisle--that this is ready to go. We now have I think 53 cosponsors. We are developing more cosponsors every day, and we don't think there is any real hostility toward the bill in terms of wanting amendments that aren't relevant. That is a key factor for us, and both sides need to focus on that. I would like to express my appreciation to you for what you have done on TSCA to help blend it into and make it into a bipartisan product. We have been trying--you know, it has been very busy with the Pope in town, with the sequester facing us and the shutdown and things such as that. We have been trying to get onto the floor to talk about this, and I think we are going to continue to do that in the future. But it is tremendously important that this gets some floor time now, and I know you have been working on that with me. Do you see this as a product that is better than current law? I mean, my sense is it is much better than the current law. Mr. CARPER. If I could respond to my friend, I have a friend who-- when you ask him ``How are you doing?'' he says ``Compared to what?'' And when we talk about the legislation initially introduced by Senator Lautenberg, Senator Vitter, and now coauthored by you, Senator Vitter, and Senator Inhofe, with input from a number of us, I always say: Well, compared to what? The idea here is to ensure that the EPA does its due diligence on toxic substances in this country. And there are thousands or tens of thousands of chemicals--you know better than I do--that exist in our environment--in our air, our ground, in water--tens of thousands. Are they all toxic? No. But my recollection--correct me if I am wrong in this, but I think that out of those thousands, tens of thousands, I believe the EPA in the last 38 years has actually done their due diligence on really fewer than 200, maybe even fewer than 10 when you get down to it, maybe even just 5. And you say: How long has this bill been around, this law been around? Thirty-eight years. And they have now finished work on five highly toxic substances? If we can't do better than that, we ought to quit, and this is not the time to quit. It is sort of like football. You take the kickoff, and you are in your own territory and you start marching down the field. You get into the other team's territory, get down to the 20-yard line, and you are in the red zone--not in the end zone, but you are in the red zone. I think with your leadership and that of our colleagues, we are in the red zone. We need to bring this onto the floor with 53 cosponsors equally divided between Democrats and Republicans. There is a lot of interest in the House, and I think there is support from the administration. We ought to get this done. Thank you. Mr. UDALL. Madam President, it bears repeating. Senator Carper is very modest, and he is a humble man, but he has done a lot to help bring us to this point. I think he is one of the Senators here who work the best across the aisle, and that is what has happened. We have had a lot of Senators who have wanted to work across the aisle on this bill. As Senator Carper knows, on the Environment and Public Works Committee, he was joined by Senator Booker, Senator Whitehouse, and Senator Merkley in terms of helping to mark up the bill and make it a better product. When the Senator talks about going across the finish line, with 53 cosponsors about evenly divided between Democrat and Republican--I think it is almost exactly even--that sends a signal to our majority leader that this has tremendous support in both caucuses. I believe the Presiding Officer here is on the bill. So everybody standing on the Senate floor right now is on what is a good, bipartisan product. So we are going to work very carefully in the next couple of days to see that attention is brought to this, and hopefully we will have an opportunity to have a debate with amendments and then meet with the House. The House, as Senator Carper knows, has already passed a piece of legislation, I think 378 to 1--1 person in the House opposing it. So we have a bill that is alive and ready to go, and we need to get it out [[Page S6930]] of the Senate so we can conference it with the House and get it to the President's desk for his signature. I don't know if the Senator has any other thoughts on what is the best way to move forward. I mean, obviously we have to be bipartisan, but at this particular point, is it the Senator's sense we are ready to go, from everything he has seen from the Environment and Public Works Committee and these other Senators in various places? Is it ready to go? Mr. CARPER. If I may respond to my colleague's question, I don't care if the majority leader is a Republican or a Democrat--they are always trying to figure out how do we have time on the calendar to get this stuff done. They are always looking at ways. And one of the best ways to ensure legislation actually fits into a reasonably small period of time is to line up bipartisan support. I tell my colleague, I have been here in the Senate for a while, and this is almost a picture-book way to pass legislation: Work it up through the grassroots--Democratic Lautenberg and Republican Vitter and now with your role and others. There are not many bills in the Senate that have 26 or 27 Democrats and an equal number of Republicans. Has everything been worked out? No. Is there a need for amendments? Yes. Is there a need for a filibuster? No. We should bring it to the floor. I think we should go to the majority leader and visit with him early and often and continue to remind him. And those who believe in this, whether they happen to be on the environmental side or happen to be folks in the health care arena or maybe on the manufacturing side--and we thank those who have helped us draft this--we ask for them not to be silent about it but to urge not just us but the leadership to find time--a couple of days--to bring this bill to the floor and just get it done. With that, I say to my colleague and the Presiding Officer, if I put down my microphone and pack up my bag, I can have dinner with my wife in the First State of Delaware, and that is my goal. So I will bid you adieu. Mr. UDALL. I thank the Senator. I wish you Godspeed on that train headed to Wilmington because you have a wonderful wife. Mr. CARPER. Well, it is not the last train to Clarksville, but it is the next train to Wilmington. Mr. UDALL. And let me say again that not only on TSCA, as Senator Carper held, we were going to have speeches earlier in the week, but we were unable, with some of the scheduling issues and everything, to get down here and talk as a group. We had Senator Whitehouse, who was going to come down, and Senator Merkley was going to come down, as well as several of the key members of the Environment and Public Works Committee who played such a big role in terms of moving this bill forward. The person who really kicked this off was Senator Frank Lautenberg. What a star in terms of bipartisanship. I remember working with him when I was on the Environment and Public Works Committee for a long period of time on a very substantive piece of legislation. It was so good, we couldn't find much bipartisanship on it, and he understood that. It got out of the committee. It wasn't ready for prime time here on the floor, and so what we ended up doing was saying we need to go back to square one. Senator Lautenberg took that very seriously. He met with Senator Vitter. Senator Manchin played a role in that, and Senator Manchin was one of the ones who were going to come to the floor to talk, and he played a role in getting them together. As a result, a bipartisan bill came out in the last Congress. That has continued now for almost 2\1/2\ years, and it is a very good product. Madam President, the American people want a government that works, not one that shuts down to send a message. They want a Congress that moves the Nation forward, not one that grinds to a halt. They want a responsible budget that supports working families and strengthens our economy and creates jobs. These should be our priorities, not an attack on women's health care. I understand some people have strong views about a woman's right to choose that are different from mine. There are strong differences of opinion on many important issues in this Senate and in the Congress-- health care, energy, climate change, foreign policy. We could make a very long list. I read an insightful quote the other day from my good friend Republican Senator Lamar Alexander. Senator Alexander said: ``If we had a shutdown every time we had a dispute over a contentious issue, the government would never open.'' I think that is a very wise observation. We do have many differences, but, most importantly, we must have the broader national interest in mind. The clock is ticking. Funding runs out in just a few days. We need a clean continuing resolution, and we need it now--a temporary funding bill just to keep the lights on. Have we forgotten what happened 2 years ago? The people of my home State of New Mexico have not forgotten. We were badly hurt by the shutdown then, and we would be badly hurt by a shutdown now. In Los Alamos and Sandia, our two DOE labs are working on modernizing aging nuclear weapons systems to keep them safe and secure. It is foolish to cause unnecessary disruption to projects of this significance where there is no margin for error. Each of these labs employs thousands of people, many of them scientists at the top of their field. Why would we threaten their paychecks and the important national security work they are doing? We have three Air Force bases in New Mexico--Cannon, Kirtland, and Holloman--all serving a variety of unique national security missions for our country. White Sands Missile Range, unlike any facility in the country, provides critical research and testing for future technologies. Shutdowns and sequestration send a terrible message to the men and women at these facilities. It limits their effectiveness and harms the economies in nearby communities, such as Clovis, Albuquerque, Alamogordo, and Dona Ana County. Shutdowns mean lost jobs and lost revenue, all in the face of a struggling economy. We cannot afford another government shutdown, and we cannot afford a return to sequester cuts. These are bad choices. These are self-inflicted wounds. A clean CR will keep the government open, but we need a long-term cure. We need a bipartisan budget agreement--one that makes smart investments and meets the real needs of American families. The people of my State work hard. Many are still struggling. The economy of New Mexico has not yet recovered completely from the recession. We know New Mexicans want us to come together and push for a stronger recovery. New Mexicans are eager for solutions, and they are tired of these political games that threaten jobs and weaken our economy. Yet here we are once again facing a manufactured crisis. We all know that in fiscal year 2016, which begins next week, the Murray-Ryan budget deal will expire and we will be left with a return to sequestration. As ranking member of the interior subcommittee on the Committee on Appropriations, I would like to talk about that today because the impacts of the funding levels required by the Budget Control Act are clear and they are very destructive. Just look at the Senate Interior appropriations bill reported out of the committee in June. To stay within the spending limits we faced under sequestration, it slashes more than $2 billion from the President's budget request. That means it doesn't provide enough funding for basic water infrastructure or to protect our public lands or to fulfill our trust responsibility to American Indians and Alaska Natives. I know my chairman, Senator Murkowski, did the very best she could with the allocation she was given, but here is the reality: The Budget Control Act caps don't meet the needs of our Nation. They fail critical programs. They fail our communities in New Mexico and nationwide. Our Nation faces an infrastructure crisis. Yet the Senate bill cuts grants to States for water and sewer infrastructure by more than $500 million below fiscal year 2015 levels. Actions have consequences, and here are the consequences of the Senate bill: Some 230 communities will not have their water projects funded, 14,000 construction jobs will not be created, and [[Page S6931]] $1 billion in matching and leveraged funds from State partners will be lost. The Senate bill also shortchanges the National Park Service with $318 million less than the President requested. That means 1,000 fewer park rangers. That means $150 million less to maintain our national parks even though the Service will celebrate its centennial in 2016 and will host a record number of visitors at national parks nationwide. We have 15 national parks in New Mexico, including our newest national park, the Valles Caldera National Preserve. These parks and other public lands in my State are critical not only for conservation but for our economy. A shutdown would be a disaster; sequestration is just a slower moving disaster. Carlsbad Caverns National Park, Bandelier National Monument, Tent Rocks National Monument, Bosque Del Apache Wildlife Refuge, and many other sites are key economic assets. These sites help grow jobs, they help communities grow, and they are great conservation assets in communities across the country. We cannot keep asking them to do more and more on less. Yet, without a sensible budget, that is exactly where we are headed in New Mexico and across the Nation. The Senate Interior appropriations bill also cuts more than $300 million from the President's request for the Indian Health Service. We have a solemn trust responsibility to Native Americans, and we are failing. Again, these are not just numbers. The impact is very real and very painful. It means the Indian Health Service will fund 20,000 fewer doctor visits in 2016 and nearly 1,000 fewer hospital stays. It means falling further behind. We need a responsible budget to meet our obligation to the Indian Health Service and other tribal programs, such as housing, school construction, Indian education. All of those are being hurt by this sequestration budget. We cannot continue being shortsighted. We can't keep shortchanging programs that make a real difference in the lives of all Americans. This includes art and cultural programs, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and funding for our national forests and wildlife refuges. And the list goes on and on. The time is now, and we are running out of time. We are on the wrong train, on the wrong track, and going nowhere. Fortunately, there is a solution. Let's pass a clean CR, and let's work together to pass a budget that actually meets the needs of our Nation, with sensible funding levels for defense and nondefense programs alike. Before I wrap up my remarks, I wish to call attention to another deadline that is fast approaching. The authorization for the Land and Water Conservation Fund will expire on September 30 if this Congress doesn't act. Recently, I was one of 53 Members who called on the leadership of this Chamber to pass an extension of the law, and I want to reiterate that call today. The Land and Water Conservation Fund just celebrated its 50th birthday. It enjoys strong bipartisan support because the idea behind it is so simple and so powerful. When this Nation develops one natural resource--our oil and gas reserves--we invest some of the proceeds in other critical conservation priorities. For five decades now, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has protected our national parks, forests, and other public lands. It helps ensure hunting, fishing, and recreational access, and it improves and expands our local parks and recreation facilities. The program has been a tremendous success and has had a tremendous impact on my State, from urban refuges--such as the Valle de Oro--to wide open preserves such as the Valles Caldera. It provides crucial funding to preserve open spaces, strengthen the economy, and enhance our way of life. LWCF allows us to leverage today's resources to protect vital lands and waters for future generations. Allowing the law to expire breaks that compact. It doesn't make any sense, and it doesn't have to happen. We shouldn't let the Land and Water Conservation Fund expire, even for a single day. I call on this Chamber to act swiftly to permanently authorize this important program and ensure that it is fully funded. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, those of us who believe in protecting innocent and precious life may have lost a vote today, but we are steadily winning a larger argument--a critical argument that goes to the heart of who we want to be as a society. We can feel momentum for life on the rise just as we see extremism on the other side increasing. By placing their allegiance with the far left instead of women, Democrats are making a losing bet they will come to regret over the long term. Today, however, we must grapple with the challenges of the present. Democrats' insistence on blocking the strategy pursued today means we have to consider the options now before us. The reality is that the government will shut down next week if Congress does not act. The president of Right to Life said to those of us who believe in protecting life: There are two different roads we can take. One is to insist that no more money go to Planned Parenthood and cause a government shutdown (which won't result in actually defunding Planned Parenthood). The other is to take a slightly longer- term approach, taking advantage of the fact that we have the attention of the country as probably never before. . . . Every well-informed pro-lifer wants to defund Planned Parenthood. I want to defund Planned Parenthood. There are wonderful pro-life men and women in Congress who want to defund Planned Parenthood. And, certainly National Right to Life wants to defund Planned Parenthood. The difference here is in strategy. This is not the end of this debate or this discussion. I urge colleagues to join me in supporting the legislation I am about to file which would ensure that the government remains open. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S6910-S6931] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HIRE MORE HEROES ACT OF 2015 The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Elder Richard G. Scott, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who passed away September 22, 2015, at the age of 86. Richard G. Scott had the razor-sharp mind of an engineer, fused with the tender softness of a disciple's soul. A graduate of George Washington University in mechanical engineering, who did post-graduate training in nuclear engineering, he had a brilliant mind with an uncanny capacity for formulas, projections, and calculations. Yet he became known throughout the world for an enormous heart with an equally uncanny capacity to love and to have empathy for people from every walk of life. Elder Scott's gentle voice invited all who had lost their way, who had given up hope or had wandered far to come home, home to the faith, family, and community that would bring them real peace and lasting, genuine joy. Countless individuals around the world heard his invitation to come home and rightly felt that he was talking directly to them. Ever in search of the one who was lost--Elder Scott's words and witness of Jesus Christ served as the lower lights upon the shore to gently guide many a wanderer home. Elder Scott had an extraordinary depth of empathy, particularly for those who silently suffered and anxiously sought for relief, redemption, and renewal in the midst of life's storms. He, himself, was a man acquainted with grief, having lost two young children and later his wife Jeanene to untimely deaths. He also seemed to intimately understand the feelings of deep discouragement, overwhelming uncertainty, as well as the crushing avalanche of personal inadequacy that can descend upon the human soul during difficult days and trying times. Yet he continually stood as a beacon of hope to those who struggled because he knew with an absolute certainty to what source we should look for strength and security during such days and at such times. His complete love for and belief in the divine potential of each and every soul led him to speak plainly, powerfully, and often with tender, heartfelt, personal feelings. He urged the struggling as well as the faithful to cast aside any behavior, habit or belief that weighed them down or kept them from living up to their full potential. Members of the LDS Church all around the world often felt, as they watched him speak, that he was not only speaking specifically to them but also that he was looking straight into their souls. In truth, he was just speaking with such love, empathy, and genuine compassion that he empowered his listeners to look into their own hearts and see what their Savior saw in them. Elder Scott saw people not for where they were currently positioned on the road of life but for the potential each person had to do, be, and become more. He once declared: ``We become what we want to be by consistently being what we want to become each day.'' Elder Scott's vision extended far beyond the struggles of mortality; he focused on raising our sights to higher things, grander places, and more noble thoughts. [[Page S6911]] The role of the family as the bulwark of society was paramount in his life and teachings. Elder Scott often expressed his belief in the unparalleled power and influence that a man and a woman, equally yoked as husband and wife, could have on children and communities. He taught that in marriage oneness is not sameness and of the vital importance of valuing our differences. To illustrate, he once declared: ``I may not know what it means to be a woman, but I do know what it means to be taught by one and to love one with all my heart and all my soul.'' His love for his wife Jeanene was legendary and was forever sprinkled into his sermons. I take comfort in knowing that after nearly 20 years, Elder Scott has gone to that Heavenly home he so often pointed to and is once again united with Jeanene. One of Elder Scott's colleagues described him as a clever teacher. His formula for teaching was not of the engineering variety but rather followed a pattern described in a hymn by Lorin Wheelwright entitled ``Help Me Teach with Inspiration,'' which says: Help me teach with inspiration; Grant this blessing, Lord, I pray. Help me lift a soul's ambition To a higher, nobler way. Help me reach a friend in darkness; Help me guide him thru the night. Help me show thy path to glory By the Spirit's holy light. Help me find thy lambs who wander; Help me bring them to thy keep. Teach me, Lord, to be a shepherd; Father, help me feed thy sheep. Elder Richard G. Scott was indeed an inspired teacher, a leader, and lifter of people. His amazing mind and compassionate soul enabled him to help engineer a path for all of us to return home. Mr. FLAKE. Will the Senator yield? Mr. LEE. I yield to the Senator. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I just wish to second what has been said about Elder Scott and appreciate the Senator from Arizona--or Utah, taking the time to say it. One of my fondest memories of being in Congress was at one point showing Elder Scott around a bit of the Capitol. He knew it well. He had been here before, but it was my privilege and honor to be with him at that time. It has been my privilege and honor over many years to hear him at general conference and other venues exhorting people to follow the example of Christ and to love their families, love their wives. To see him pass now after such dedicated service for so long, it is truly wonderful for him to be reunited with his wife and for his family to reflect on a life of service. I thank the Senator for his comments and wished to add my own. I yield back. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from Arizona for his kind remarks regarding Elder Scott. I would also remark, just briefly, that my late father, himself an Arizonan, would be pleased to hear me referred to as a Senator from Arizona, given that I was born there. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I think many of us today have been struck with a serious case of deja vu because once again, with a government shutdown looming, some Republicans continue to pander to their base with a political show vote instead of working with Democrats to prevent a budget crisis. Once again, it is women's health that is being used as a tea party political football, with Republicans attempting to cut off women's access to care, and once again workers and families across our country are watching Congress and wondering whether their elected officials can do the absolute bare minimum. The government shutdown that Republicans pushed us into in 2013 did nothing to help them repeal the Affordable Care Act, but it did have real consequences for families and communities we represent. Workers didn't know when they would get their next paycheck. Businesses felt the sting of fewer customers. Families across the country lost even more trust that elected officials in Washington, DC, could get anything done. In my home State of Washington, thousands of employees at Joint Base Lewis-McChord were sent home with no return in sight. Startups couldn't get small business loans, national parks such as Mount Rainier shut down. It kept families away from true national treasures and customers away from small businesses that rely on their tourism. After all of that, I had hoped Republicans would learn their lesson, especially because once that economy-rattling exercise in futility came to an end, I was proud to work with the Republican budget chairman, Paul Ryan, to do what we shouldn't have needed a shutdown to get done-- negotiate a 2-year bipartisan deal that prevented another government shutdown. It restored critical investments in priorities such as education, research, and defense jobs and showed our families that government can get something done when both sides are willing to come to the table and compromise. That deal was an important reminder that governing by crisis simply does not work. Unfortunately, now it seems that some of my Republican colleagues have forgotten that, because instead of working across the aisle on another bipartisan budget deal, as Democrats have pushed them to do for months, some Republicans are once again using a looming fiscal deadline as an opportunity to pander to their base, no matter what that means for our workers and families who are wondering whether government will still be running in a few days. Since they clearly need another reminder, attacking women's health does not keep the government open and these shutdown threats will not work. It didn't work in 2011, when House Republicans tried to defund Planned Parenthood in the budget at the very last minute. It didn't work in 2013, when extreme Members of the GOP were dead set on repealing ObamaCare, and they will not work today. I am going to be proud to vote against this partisan attempt to defund Planned Parenthood and take critical health care services away from millions of people. Then I hope that finally Republicans will remember what they should have learned last Congress: accept that enough is enough and make sure that women, workers, families, and our economy are protected from a completely unnecessary crisis. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Wasteful Spending Mr. COATS. Mr. President, since February I have been coming to the Senate floor every week to talk about the waste of the week. Back in 2010, when I made the decision to answer a call to run for the Senate again, one of the primary reasons for my decision to go forward was my alarm over the plunge into debt and rising deficit that was taking place. At the time, the national debt of this country was a little over $10 trillion. It is alarming to note that as I stand here 5 years later, our debt has nearly doubled. It's over $18 trillion in just the 5 years I have been here. There were alarm bells ringing in 2010, and those alarm bells were saying that we cannot stay on this course, that it is going to come back to haunt us someday, that it will affect our economy, that it will affect our credit rating. Someday the bill collector will be at the door of the taxpayer saying: You have to pay up big time or we are going to go into default. What took place going forward from that was a series of efforts--some of them very equally bipartisan by both Republicans and Democrats who were alarmed at where we were and wishing to come together to persuade the President to work with us and put us on a path toward fiscal responsibility. That work involved any number of proposals and iterations. We all remember the so-called Gang of 6, the Committee of 12, the Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction, and various others who had plans. It was the dominating issue of our time during the first couple of years of my return here in 2011 and 2012. After the election of 2012, when the President was reelected, at his own initiative he reached out to a few Republicans--I was one of them-- and said: I am willing to sit down and work together to deal with this. This is a [[Page S6912]] major issue affecting the future of our country, affecting our economy. I was encouraged that after the election and when no longer seeking any further office, the President would be willing to seriously work with us. We did serious work for several months. The President's top three appointees--the head of the Office of Management and Budget, his Chief of Staff, and his political director--met with eight of us on a regular basis, both here in the Capitol and at the White House. We had agreed we would not have any public meetings. We would not have staff. It would just be Members and the President's designated individuals. We did not broadcast what we were doing because we knew it would become public and then political and therefore perhaps end up with the same fate all the other efforts had resulted in. We got to the end of that, and in the end, even though we made an extraordinary number of concessions to the President, even though we essentially had put together a package of items he himself had suggested in his budget plans that we could accomplish in slowing down the growth of government, the spending, and the deficits every year that were rolling out and plunging us into debt, we came up short. At that point, it became very clear to me that we were not going to be able to achieve a long-term plan for putting us on the road to good fiscal health. So I thought: OK, I am hearing from a lot of colleagues here in the Senate but also from other outside sources saying that under sequester we just can't cut any more. We need more revenue to expand necessary spending projects in government. And while some essential functions that only government can do might need that type of attention, there is a range of things that you really have to question why they are on the books in the first place. A number of my colleagues--particularly former Senator Coburn--took this floor often--as I did, as well as others--to point out areas where not the Republican Party had decided, where not individuals representing our party had decided, but where nonpartisan agencies of the government--the General Accounting Office, the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of Management and Budget at the White House--had investigated and produced examples of spending that were either waste, fraud, or abuse, and had no legitimate qualification to stay on the books. So we started looking into this. Thanks to Senator Coburn and others, we have come up with a number of things we could easily take off the books, easily use to pay for essential things, easily use to reduce our deficit spending, keep from going into debt, return money to the taxpayers, or however we wanted to do it. So we started to accumulate that, and our goal was to reach $100 billion to simply defy the myth going around that there is not a penny we can cut and that we have done all we can do. So over the 20-some times I have been on this floor, we have come up with a number of issues which could save the taxpayer money and certainly need to be addressed. Our current total is now well over $100 billion, and today we are adding $10.5 billion to our $100 billion total. We are now at $116 billion. I said we would stop at $100 billion, but the examples keep rolling in, and so we are going to keep going every week. As long as this cycle of the Senate is in session, I will come to the floor and label yet another example of waste. Last month, when I was home in Indiana, coming down from northwest Indiana to our capital city of Indianapolis on Interstate 65 for the umpteenth time--as I drive from north to south or south to north on that road, I pass through wind farms of literally thousands of windmills. Interestingly enough, and as I observed even this time, many of them are not turning. There are windmills--a few of them turning-- driven by the wind, but most of them are not turning. We have thousands of these, and it looks as if fewer than 100 or a comparable number are operating, and so I am wondering why and whether the taxpayer is getting a good deal on this. I want to give a little bit of history of how all this came to be put in place. Back in the early 1990s--in fact, in 1992--the Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which included the renewable electricity production tax credit, called the PTC. The point was that as we looked at alternative ways to produce electricity to reduce our dependence on oil and fossil fuels, there was a tax credit created for those using windmills to create power. It was designed to be claimed if the wind farm was actually making the power. Earlier I said that many times I have come down that road and I have seen windmills that were idle. But the blades had to be turning and the electricity had to be being produced in order to receive that tax credit. At the time, because I thought we were overly dependent on Middle Eastern oil and that it was creating issues for us geopolitically and militarily and otherwise, I thought it would be good to have a stimulus here to support the creation of wind energy, to give us the ability to stand on our own and have less dependence on Middle Eastern oil. The main reason I supported it is because it was to start the process and incentivize diverse energy sources to get them off the ground. It was going to be a short-term boost to help these new energy sources become competitive. The original credit was designed under the law to last only 5\1/2\ years and then there would no longer be this credit. Well, like any other credit, subsidy, or anything else passed here which provides taxpayer support for production of something, it never expires. Few if any of them expire on the expiration date. So once again, once you get a law on the books, once you get a credit on the books, once you get a subsidy on the books, you can't get it off. Since the time the original bill passed, the wind industry and its supporters have repeatedly come to Congress and said: Just give us a few more years and then wind will be competitive, without taxpayer subsidies. As a result, this 5\1/2\-year program, which started in 1992, has been extended multiple times. In 2013, nearly two decades after the time the subsidies expired, Congress changed the rules so the facilities only have to begin construction before the expiration date to automatically qualify for a future 10-year subsidy, even before those windmills become operational. So if someone is just in the business of building windmills, as some of our major companies are, they are going to qualify for the subsidy. They are going to get the tax credit--whether or not the windmills are needed. They can just pour some concrete and start the building process, and they are going to qualify for the credit. The result is that more and more wind facilities are being constructed irrespective of the needs of the electricity grid or market demand. Just last year, Warren Buffett, who is a smart investor, noted that wind isn't profitable without subsidies. He said: For example, on wind energy, we get a tax credit if we build a lot of wind farms. That's the only reason to build them. They don't make sense without the tax credit. So regardless of the demand, regardless of whether or not those windmills need to be turning and generating electricity, regardless of whether or not that electricity can be put into the grid--and, by the way, the cost of wind energy is three to four times the cost of fossil fuel energy--regardless of any of that, the tax credit is there. In 2014 Congress retroactively extended the wind tax credit at the end of the year, and the general assumption here in Congress is that the production tax credit will once again be extended at the end of this year. That is probably going to happen. According to an estimate from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, if we continue and extend this tax credit, this will add another $10.5 billion to our budget. Clearly, it is way past time to end this seemingly never-ending subsidy. It is time to give the hardworking taxpayers savings, and it is time to stop wasteful spending. If we can prevent Congress from just automatically extending this way beyond the original 5\1/2\ years, decades beyond, we can save the taxpayers $10.5 billion. So today I am adding to this chart and picture here $10.5 billion, which now totals $116 billion-plus in terms of money that falls under the category of waste, fraud, and abuse. My colleagues cannot come down to this floor and say we can't cut a penny more of any program and defend the numerous--now [[Page S6913]] well more than 20--examples of what have been defined as waste, fraud, and abuse--not by me, not by the Republican Party, but by nonpartisan agencies of the Federal Government. There it is. Stay tuned for next week's ``Waste of the Week.'' I yield the floor. Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, it is time give it our best to move America forward and give Americans a fair shot. Let's show the American people that we can work across the aisle and across the dome to get the job done. Instead, here we are facing another shutdown showdown. There is no reason for there to be a government shutdown. Republican leadership does not want a shutdown. Democrats don't want a shutdown. There may be some drama, but we intend to keep the government open and avoid shutdown, slamdown politics. I hoped the Senate had learned its lesson in October 2013, when Republicans shut down government over the Affordable Care Act, or this February 2015, when Republicans threatened the Department of Homeland Security with shutdown over immigration policy. Senate Democrats won't be threatened and bullied into accepting poison pill riders. Serious policy issues like family planning and reproductive health deserve serious debate rather than becoming an ``add on'' rider to a funding bill. Shutdowns are bad for everyone, jeopardizing family checkbooks, business bottom lines, and the Federal checkbook. A shutdown makes it impossible for Federal agencies to meet missions that serve the American people. A shutdown means furloughed Federal employees and contractors; delayed tax returns; delayed small business loans; and delayed contracts. Uncertainty slows economic growth and hurts the health and well-being of the entire Nation. When the government was closed for 16 days in 2013, the shutdown hurt our growing economy, sacrificing 120,000 private sector jobs. Billions of dollars of economic output was lost. We lost 6.6 million work days, about 850,000 Federal employees were sent home. My home State was hit particularly hard. Maryland is home to many Federal agencies. It was not just the Federal workers that got hurt. The Baltimore Sun wrote about Jay Angle, the owner of Salsa Grill, a Peruvian restaurant in Woodlawn outside the Social Security Administration. Every day, 4,700 workers go to work at Social Security, but only 500 were on the job during the shutdown. Salsa Grill counts on the Social Security workers as customers, but they were not there. There were stories like Jay's all over the country. Because of the 2013 shutdown, hundreds of patients could not enroll in clinical trials at the National Institutes of Health, NIH, so their last chance for a miracle was delayed or denied. About 8,000 rural families had their home loan decisions delayed, pushing the American Dream down the road. Head Start grantees in seven States closed, leaving 7,200 children at home and families searching for high quality child care. Avoiding a shutdown is just the first step. We also need a new budget deal to cancel sequester. Right now our budget caps spending, but it does not cap tax breaks for billionaires and corporations that send jobs overseas. Americans are angry. They feel the rules are rigged against them and that those who write the rules don't care. But Democrats do care. We believe the people deserve a government on their side. That is why we are fighting to make sure the American people have a government that works as hard as they do. We have three steps to meet that goal. First, no government shutdown. We need to pass a clean, short-term continuing funding resolution with no poison pill riders to keep the government funded and open for business for as short a time as possible. After all, a yearlong CR just locks in sequester. The CR will give us time to take the second step, negotiating a new budget agreement that cancels sequester and lifts the spending caps equally for defense and nondefense spending so we can protect our national security and give the American people a fair shot. After the new budget agreement is reached, we will take the third step, writing and enacting an Omnibus spending bill. Remember, the Appropriations Committee needs 30 days to get the job done once we have our topline. That is my plan to cancel sequester and put the American people first. Why do we want to cancel sequester? Sequester requires draconian cuts to critical programs that will have consequences for American families for a generation. Sequester was supposed to be so arbitrary and unthinkable that it would drive Congress to a budget deal. But gridlock, hammerlock, and deadlock kept that from happening. It was the reality of sequester that led Congress to negotiate the Murray-Ryan budget deal that provided sequester relief for 2014 and 2015. Now we have got deja vu. We need a new agreement to cancel sequester- level spending in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. The Republican budget for fiscal year 2016 calls for spending at the sequester level of $1.017 trillion. The President's budget request asks for $74 billion more. That may sound like a big number, but it is hardly expensive. It is equal to the 2010 level--6 years ago. We must cancel sequester to give Americans a fair shot by investing in our country and our people. Sequester hurts national security. According to Army Chief of Staff General Raymond Odierno, only 33 percent of our brigades are ready to fight. Without sequester relief, the Army will not be truly ready to fight until 2025. Sequester keeps us from building and maintaining our physical infrastructure. Funding to build roads, bridges, and transit creates jobs while easing peoples commutes to their jobs. Sequester deepens our innovation deficit. Funding for basic research is an investment in jobs today and jobs tomorrow. New ideas and discoveries lead to startups that rev up our economy and find new cures for deadly diseases. Under spartan budgets, NIH funding has not kept up with inflation. Even the increases proposed under the Republican spending caps fund NIH by cutting education, college affordability, and labor protections. On the other hand, when we cancel sequester, we will invest in innovation and discovery without sacrificing other investments in our future. For example, the National Science Foundation would give 600 more grants supporting 7,500 scientists, students, teachers, and technicians. Cancelling sequester means meeting compelling human needs. We can help make college affordable for families. Right now, under sequester- level budgeting, Republicans instead took $300 million from Pell grants and eliminated First in the World grants to make college more affordable. Under sequester-level appropriations bills, we can not keep our promises to our veterans. Both the Senate and the House Republican bills underfund medical care at the Veterans Administration--by more than $600 million in the Senate. That is enough money to provide medical coverage for 61,000 veterans. The House also cuts $580 million for building VA health care facilities when there is a $10 billion maintenance backlog. It is clear that we need to end sequester. It is also clear that the shutdown was a disaster for everyone, not to be repeated. Because without the resources to keep our government open, agencies can not serve the American people keeping us safe, healthy, educated, moving, and thriving. The bottom line is we need a new topline. We need a new budget deal to invest in America's safety and future. We need a short-term CR, free of poison pill riders, to get there--not another shutdown. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise once again to speak against this callous, misguided effort to defund Planned Parenthood. This is a clear case of politics being put ahead of the country's best interests. This time the majority has tied this effort to the funding of the entire Federal Government--they are willing to shut down the government over this issue. That is preposterous. Planned Parenthood serves some of the most vulnerable women in our society. It cares for 2.7 million patients in the U.S.--5 million patients worldwide. Ninety-seven percent of the services its 700 clinics provide are basic health care, including breast exams, cervical cancer screenings, testing for sexually [[Page S6914]] transmitted diseases, and contraception. One in five women will use Planned Parenthood as their primary health care provider at some point in their lives. Nationwide, 80 percent of Planned Parenthood patients make less than $18,000 per year. Planned Parenthood is often the only health care option for low- income women and women in rural communities. And yet here we are, facing another effort by Republicans to block funding for this vital health care provider, an effort echoed and supported by Republicans who are running for President. Since this latest attack on Planned Parenthood began in July, I've received more than 25,000 calls and emails from women and men in California who support Planned Parenthood. While the details of the stories vary, they share the same theme: Planned Parenthood was there for them at a critical time in their lives. It was the only place they could go for health care when they were in college, earning minimum wage, or struggling to provide for their children and families. It was the only place where they felt safe and respected. It provided essential tests and screenings and allowed them to plan their families, which is critical to women's economic security over the course of their lives. Here is one example from a constituent in San Francisco. She said ``Thirty-two years ago, I was broke, and Planned Parenthood was the only place that would give me birth control. I am now retired, and my life would be so different if they hadn't been there. This is so necessary for those who can't afford it.'' Another constituent from Alameda said, ``I'm calling your office for the first time because I want you to support Planned Parenthood. When I was a young woman, their medical services saved my life. I hope this phone call helps save them in return.'' To me, that is why this organization is so important to women in this country. Not only does it provide health care, it gives women the ability to make a better future for themselves and their families. I also want to address the false claim put forward by those who are pushing to defund Planned Parenthood: They claim that Planned Parenthood patients would easily find another community clinic to go to for their health care. This is just not true. Community health centers and clinics do great work, but if 2.7 million Planned Parenthood patients were suddenly without a doctor, they simply could not handle the sudden influx of new patients. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that up to 650,000 Planned Parenthood patients would lose their access to health care. What's more, many community clinics don't provide the level of contraception care and other health care services provided by Planned Parenthood. In two-thirds of the counties where Planned Parenthood has a clinic, it serves half of the women eligible to receive family planning services under the Title X program. In California, 13 of 58 counties would not have a single clinic to provide family planning services under the Title X program without Planned Parenthood. That tells us what will happen if this funding is stripped--huge numbers of women across the country will have no place to go for vital health services. This isn't a matter of speculation. We've seen what happens when Planned Parenthood is defunded because it has happened at the state level. In 2012, Texas defunded Planned Parenthood. To serve all the women who needed access to a doctor or nurse, the remaining community clinics would have had to increase the number of patients they saw by an average of 81 percent. In other words, they would have needed to accept almost a doubling of their existing number of patients. Unsurprisingly, those clinics lacked the ability to do so. As a result, nearly 20,000 fewer women were served by the Texas Women's Health Program the following year, a 10 percent decline. The number of prescriptions for birth control was cut in half, meaning 100,000 fewer women were able to access affordable birth control. Louisiana is another State trying to defund Planned Parenthood, and recently defended its actions in court. As part of its rationale, the State actually claimed that dentists and eye doctors are capable of providing women's health care services. Let me repeat: Louisiana officials claimed that women who receive breast exams, contraceptive counseling and prescriptions, and other medical services at Planned Parenthood could go to dentists and eye doctors instead. Any woman knows that is just unrealistic. So make no mistake about it: If Planned Parenthood is defunded, many American women simply will not get the health care they need. The attacks on women's health don't stop at Planned Parenthood's door. The House of Representatives recently proposed completely eliminating the Title X program, which provides affordable family planning services to low-income women. Title X is proven to reduce abortions by preventing unplanned pregnancies. Let me repeat that: The House has proposed to eliminate a program that reduces abortions. Of course, we also know that the House voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act more than 50 times. Here in the Senate we've suffered through at least 30 similar votes. This law they want to repeal guarantees women basic preventive care like mammograms and cervical cancer screenings. It requires that prenatal care and labor and delivery are covered by insurance companies. It prevents women from being denied coverage or charged more because they're women. It's the greatest achievement for women's health in a generation; yet we wasted days and weeks on futile attempts to eliminate it. These attempts to deny women and their families access to basic health care, to defund Planned Parenthood, to eliminate funding for family planning services that reduce abortions, and to deny women the right to make their own reproductive decisions are appalling. Planned Parenthood has been under constant attack since its founding in 1916. Its founder, Margaret Sanger, was thrown in jail for providing birth control to women. The proponents of defunding Planned Parenthood have been engaged in this assault for years. The group behind this latest effort, the Center for Medical Progress, has long-standing ties to the anti-choice movement. It is currently under investigation for possible criminal activity. The individuals who obtained the footage used false identification to represent a fake medical company. The videos, which are presented to the public as the full, unedited videos, have been analyzed by forensics experts at Fusion GPS. And the truth is, they are not the full, unedited videos. Content is missing, and numerous edits have been made even to the so-called full footage videos. Many members of Congress have requested the full videos. Those requests have gone unanswered. So the point is, this is part of a sustained assault on an essential health care provider for millions of American women. I also want to reiterate the real-life consequences of the rhetoric that's been directed at Planned Parenthood and its staff. I talked about this when I spoke on this subject in July. I strongly believe that the rhetoric directed at Planned Parenthood sends a message that it is ``OK'' to intimidate its staff and patients. It is not. A few weeks ago, a Planned Parenthood health center in Washington State was severely damaged when an arsonist lit it on fire. Thankfully, no one was hurt. But I would hope that we'd learn from this event, and opponents of Planned Parenthood would think about the ramifications of their words. This is dangerous territory. In closing, we must remember that the attacks on Planned Parenthood aren't about improving women's health. They are about taking away women's rights, choices, and access to the doctors and nurses they know and trust. And quite frankly, their efforts will only jeopardize women's health by removing the only source of health care many women have available. I've seen great gains for women during my lifetime, including more education, greater workplace freedom, and the right to decide what happens to our own bodies. I simply will not stand by and watch our advances slip away. We are standing up for Planned Parenthood because we stand up for women. I urge a ``no'' vote. Let's defeat this bill and move on so we can fund the government and address many other critical issues. [[Page S6915]] Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am in strong opposition to the substitute amendment to H.J. Res. 61 imposing a moratorium on Federal funding for Planned Parenthood clinics and their affiliates unless they stop providing abortions. Let's be clear about one thing: the effort to defund Planned Parenthood is not about Federal funding for abortions. Since 1977, it has been well established under the Hyde amendment that Federal funding cannot be used for abortions, except in very narrow circumstances where the life of the mother is endangered or in cases of rape or incest. The impetus for this amendment stems from the recent release of surreptitiously recorded and heavily edited videos that falsely portray Planned Parenthood's participation in legal fetal tissue donation programs and the subsequent attempts to defund Planned Parenthood on the basis of that intrinsically dishonest campaign. It is not the first time anti-choice advocates have deliberately misrepresented Planned Parenthood. I remember when a Senator stood on the floor of the U.S. Senate 4 years ago and claimed that abortions are ``well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does''. And then his press spokesperson had to acknowledge that what he said ``wasn't intended as a factual statement''. How much of what we are hearing and seeing now isn't ``intended as a factual statement''? Senators certainly are entitled to their sincerely held positions on abortion and contraception, but I think we ought to refrain from saying things we know aren't true, especially on the floor of the United States Senate. The attack on Planned Parenthood, if successful, would have a devastating impact on women and families across this country, especially lower income women and their families. Planned Parenthood health centers are an integral part of our safety net health care system, providing high quality, affordable health care services to 2.7 million patients per year. Every year, Planned Parenthood physicians and nurses provide family planning counseling and contraception to 2.1 million women, perform nearly 400,000 screenings for cervical cancer and nearly 500,000 breast exams, and provide nearly 4.5 million tests and treatments for sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Banning Federal funding for Planned Parenthood would put millions of women at risk of having no place to go for basic, preventive health care. For many women, family planning clinics such as Planned Parenthood provide the only basic health care they receive. In fact, 6 in 10 women who access care through a family planning health center consider it their main source of health care. More than half of Planned Parenthood health centers are located in rural areas, health professional shortage areas, or medically underserved areas, putting women living in those areas at particular risk of losing access to health care services. It isn't just Planned Parenthood that is under attack; it is also the one out of every five women in this country who has relied on Planned Parenthood for health care at some point in her lifetime. Earlier this week, I also voted against invoking cloture on another assault on women's reproductive health--H.R. 36, an unconstitutional attempt to impose a nationwide ban on abortions when the ``postfertilization age'' of the fetus is determined to 20 weeks or greater, with extremely limited exceptions. More than 40 years ago, in its landmark Roe v. Wade decision, the Supreme Court made it clear that women in this country have a constitutional right to abortion services and that no legislature may ban abortion prior to viability, which is exactly what H.R. 36 attempts to do. Previous attempts to impose previability bans on abortion have been repeatedly struck down by the courts, and last year, the Supreme Court refused to review a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision permanently blocking Arizona's 20- week ban. Nevertheless, anti-choice advocates continue their relentless efforts to undermine women's reproductive rights and health in any and every way possible. The cloture votes on H.R. 36 and today's amendment to defund Planned Parenthood are simply the latest attempts. In addition to imposing an unconstitutional previability ban on abortion, H.R. 36 threatens doctors with criminal penalties, including up to 5 years in prison, for attempting or performing an abortion in violation of the bill's onerous restrictions, which is clearly intended to intimidate and discourage doctors from providing abortion care. The bill also puts the health of pregnant women at risk by allowing an exception to the 20-week ban only in the very narrow circumstance where an abortion is necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman. Therefore, under H.R. 36, a pregnant woman who develops a serious medical condition or complication after 20 weeks would be barred from terminating her pregnancy, no matter how serious the risk to her health, unless the abortion is deemed necessary to prevent the woman's death. In addition, H.R. 36 would not allow an exception in the heart- wrenching situation in which a severe fetal anomaly is discovered late in a woman's pregnancy, despite the fact that these conditions are often only detectable around 20 weeks. H.R. 36 also lacks a reasonable exception to the 20-week ban for victims of rape and incest. Adult women who have been raped would be required to report the assault to law enforcement or undergo compulsory medical treatment or counseling at least 48 hours prior to receiving an abortion, meaning that the rape survivor must have at least two appointments with two different providers in order to access the care she needs. H.R. 36's treatment of minors who have survived rape or incest is even more extreme. For minors who have been the victim of rape or incest, H.R. 36 would require proof that the crime was reported to law enforcement or the appropriate government agency in order to qualify for an exception to the 20-week ban. These extremely narrow exceptions completely ignore the fact that the majority of sexual assault survivors do not or are not able to report their assaults to law enforcement for a variety of compelling reasons. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention--CDC--estimate that only 35 percent of sexual assaults or rapes were reported to the police in 2010. It is simply unconscionable to subject survivors of rape and incest to these burdensome and unnecessary requirements in order to receive the care they need. We are 6 days away from a government shutdown; yet we have spent most of this week on misguided attempts to ban legal abortions and defund Planned Parenthood--and to link the Planned Parenthood issue to whether the Federal Government will remain open for business--even as it has been obvious to everyone that such attempts would fail. A government shutdown is a completely avoidable crisis, and using floor time this time to attack women's health care and reproductive rights instead of negotiating a bipartisan plan to fund the government is both unacceptable and irresponsible. The American people deserve better. They deserve a budget that supports a strong national defense and growing economy, not the threat of another government shutdown. I urge my colleagues to join with me in opposing these latest attacks on women's reproductive rights and access to high quality, comprehensive health care services. Recognition of the Majority Leader The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized. His Holiness Pope Francis Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I know I speak for the entire Senate when I say it was a privilege to welcome the Pope to the Capitol this morning. For the thousands who gathered on the Capitol lawn, it was an experience they are unlikely to ever forget. A quiet nod, a soft smile, a simple wave--the gestures may have been small, but their meaning ran deep, captured forever in the hearts of the faithful and the hopeful. As we turn back to the work of governing, many will interpret his words in many ways. The media certainly has. But we can also hear him as simply expressing his faith. And we all appreciate his closing remarks: God bless America. Mr. President, it is no surprise that Members of the Senate have differences on issues. That is normal, healthy even. But even if our Democratic colleagues may not agree with us on every [[Page S6916]] issue, let us agree that the scandal surrounding Planned Parenthood is deeply, deeply unsettling. Let us agree that it makes sense to at least place a scandal-plagued political organization on leave without pay and then use that money to fund women's health care as Congress investigates these serious allegations. Let us also agree that it is time for our Democratic colleagues to finally allow the Senate to fund the government, just as we have worked hard to do all year long. Here is the view the new Senate took from the beginning. The best way to fund the government is to pass a budget, and then to fund it. That may be a different approach from previous years, but it is the approach we chose to pursue when we came to office. We didn't think it was right that the Senate hadn't passed a budget in 6 years or that the Senate's Appropriations Committee hadn't passed the 12 bills necessary to fund the government in 6 years. So we changed that. The appropriations process got off to a great start. There was often a spirit of bipartisanship inside that committee. Consider that nearly all of the 12 funding bills passed with bipartisan support. More than half attracted the support of over 70 percent of Democrats. We saw our Democratic colleagues use phrases such as ``win-win-win'' or declare the appropriations legislation would ``do right by'' their particular State as they issued press releases praising the bills that they voted for. It was great to see that bipartisan action. I was hopeful that our Democratic colleagues would actually join with us on the Senate floor to debate and pass the legislation they had praised in committee. But no, they took a different path. I regret that Democratic leadership determined a crisis would be necessary to advance a policy aim of growing the government, and that our colleagues decided accordingly to block every single funding bill-- every single one--almost all of which had been supported by a significant number of Democrats in committee. So we have been forced to pursue a continuing resolution as a result. It would be much better to simply finish the appropriations process we worked so hard to advance. But if our colleagues continue to block the Senate from doing so, the Senate is left with very few options. It may be regrettable, but that is the reality we now face. The bill before us would help get things back on track. It would ensure the government remains funded and open. It would adhere to the bipartisan spending level already agreed to by both parties. It would also allow our Democratic colleagues to join us in standing up for women's health instead of a political organization mired in scandal. For 1 year, the legislation would redirect $235 million in Planned Parenthood funding to women's health instead, strengthening health centers that provide critically needed community care. I wish our colleagues hadn't pursued a strategy of blocking government funding. That strategy may have succeeded in bringing the country to this point, but there is no reason to continue blocking every attempt to fund the government or to protect political allies mired in scandal. So I am calling on colleagues across the aisle to join us in standing against a shutdown. I am calling on them to join us in standing up for women's health instead. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time following the vote until 6 p.m. be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees; further, that all time during quorum calls until 6 p.m. be charged equally between both sides. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, all time be yielded back and the Senate proceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on amendment No. 2669. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.

The majority whip is recognized. His Holiness Pope Francis Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today has certainly been a historic day in Washington, DC. With the arrival of His Holiness Pope Francis this week, Washington has been flooded with the faithful who were eager to mark his first visit to the United States. I know my colleagues and I are grateful we were able to host him at a joint meeting of Congress, and we were all in awe of his incredible stamina given his schedule-- something we are not unfamiliar with. As head of the Catholic Church, Pope Francis leads a diverse community of believers. Catholics in the United States make up about one-fifth of the population in the United States and also in my home State of Texas. In fact, Catholic priests from Spain were some of our earliest settlers in Texas, and one of the dozens of missions established by the Catholic Church early in the 18th century in Texas was Mission San Antonio de Valero, what would later be called the Alamo. It was a privilege to welcome Pope Francis this morning and to hear his remarks. I am told he was the first pontiff ever to address a joint meeting of Congress. Cardinal Daniel DiNardo It was also my honor to host a friend of mine, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, who accepted my invitation to join me today to hear Pope Francis. Cardinal DiNardo is the archbishop of Galveston-Houston, home to more than 1 million Catholics--the largest number of the 15 dioceses in Texas. I have had the honor of knowing Cardinal DiNardo for a number of years, and I am grateful to him for his unwavering commitment to life and for his extreme compassion in both a pastoral and spiritual sense as well as a practical one. We saw that in action recently when historic flooding devastated many of the communities in the Houston area. During that time, Cardinal DiNardo was quick to ensure that Catholic Charities would provide some relief to those in need. There is no doubt that his leadership will continue to serve not only the Catholic community in the Galveston-Houston area well but also all of us in Texas. Mr. President, on another matter, earlier today Democrats blocked a measure that would fund the U.S. Government but redirect Federal money that currently goes to Planned Parenthood to go for women's health care at community health centers. Actually, there are many more community [[Page S6918]] health centers in Texas than there are Planned Parenthood facilities. Earlier this week I outlined how the Democrats, while earlier calling for regular order in this Chamber, have delivered on their promise to block legislation from moving forward that would fund vital parts of our government, such as the men and women in uniform who defend us. This is in spite of the fact that earlier this year, as I believe the majority leader mentioned, members of the Appropriations Committee actually did the work we were elected to do. We passed a budget and then in a bipartisan way passed appropriations bills out of the Appropriations Committee. But because they have chosen to filibuster all of these appropriations bills, we find ourselves with unneeded and unnecessary drama when it comes to funding the Federal Government-- hence the vote on Monday for closing off debate on a continuing resolution to fund the government through December 11, 2015. Unfortunately, even our uniformed military has been taken hostage to this strategy, which has created unnecessary drama, as I said, and created some real hardship. So as we approach the looming fiscal deadline of next Wednesday at midnight, it is important to remember how we got here. While Democrats filibustered legislation that would have removed all Federal funding for Planned Parenthood, this fight--the fight for the sanctity of life Pope Francis talked about this morning--is far from over. We are going to continue the four different investigations of Planned Parenthood's practices and pursue legislation that would protect the fundamental right to life of the unborn. Protecting the sanctity of life is an ongoing mission, and it does not end with this one vote. I yield the floor. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President here we are again: with just 6 days until the Federal Government has to close its doors, we find ourselves faced with another manufactured crisis. Two years ago, it was defunding the Affordable Care Act. Congress has voted nearly 60 times on that so far, all of which failed. In the meantime, more than 17 million Americans who had no health insurance have obtained health insurance. Four years ago, it was the same issue Republicans are pushing today: defunding an organization that provides health care to millions of women across this country. With the vote to defund Planned Parenthood now behind us--for the second time in as many months--it is time to move forward to pass a clean, short-term continuing resolution and get to work addressing the real challenge before us: ending sequestration. We've said it before, and it bears repeating: sequestration was never supposed to become the status quo. Its cuts are so extreme and so draconian that imposing it will hurt programs across the board, impacting every American. Sequestration neglects police and fire departments, national parks, highways and bridges, airports, public health and education; and abandons promises made to our veterans and men and women in uniform. Allowing sequester-level spending bills to become law for the next fiscal year, which the President has rightly said he will not do, would be an abdication of our sworn responsibilities as Members of Congress. We must pass a clean, continuing resolution; we must negotiate a new deal to end sequestration, and we must pass appropriations bills that reflect the urgent needs of our country, not a political score card. Last weekend, my wife, Marcelle, and I were fortunate to join hundreds of Vermont women at the 19th Annual Women's Economic Opportunity Conference in Randolph, VT. I have sponsored this conference each year in an effort to help Vermont women of all ages and generations take advantage of the economic opportunities available to them. From emerging entrepreneurs or those transitioning their careers, thousands of participants have been drawn to the conference over its nearly two decade history. Sequestration puts at risk the ability of small businesses to access loans and counseling from the Federal Government, which helps spur and strengthen our economy. Sequestration will cut critical workforce investment programs that help young workers, dislocated workers, and veterans find permanent employment. Sequestration reverses the progress we have made in recent years to restore our economy and create jobs. The economic harm of sequestration is, of course, not all that is at stake. As Senators in both parties have pointed out, sequestration hurts our national security and the readiness of our Armed Forces. Sequestration hurts our roads, our infrastructure, and our public transit systems and will deeply impact our affordable housing supply. Sequestration makes maintaining our commitment to our veterans, including a generation of disabled veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, nearly impossible. What's more, to meet the requirements of sequestration, we are poised to rob from such vital needs as job training programs and preschool development grants. The bottom line is this: sequestration was never intended to happen. But relying on budget gimmicks, as the Senate's defense spending bill does, while nearly zeroing out critical programs for low-income Americans, as the Senate's transportation and housing bill does, creates more problems. Republican leaders have waited too long to come to the table to negotiate relief from sequester-level spending caps. By passing this clean, short-term continuing resolution, we can get to work now--immediately--to negotiate a new deal that builds on the 2013 Murray-Ryan deal and keep the doors of our government open. We have now had the pointless debate over defunding Planned Parenthood. Let's move on. Let's not manufacture another crisis that puts millions of jobs on the line and hurts Americans in every state of this country. We were elected to represent our constituents. The voice from Vermonters is clear: it is time to get our work done. Mr. CORNYN. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in support of a clean, short-term continuing resolution--or, as we say, a CR--to temporarily fund the government without controversial policy riders. After the vote we just had, I hope we can move to such a measure. Even some Republican leaders have acknowledged that this previous vote was a show vote designed to appease, but to fail. It is part of a troubling pattern that has been emerging over many months of avoiding meaningful, bipartisan talks to fix the budget and waiting until the last moment to deal with issues everyone knows must be addressed. We have an obligation to the American people to keep their government working. It is one of the most basic responsibilities we have as Members of Congress. A clean CR at this juncture fulfills this obligation, keeping the government open for a few more weeks while we work on a plan to eliminate the sequester-level budget caps for defense and nondefense programs. I wish we could have begun work on an overall agreement earlier in the year, as Vice Chairwoman Mikulski and others strongly urged months ago, but at this late hour we should pass this short-term measure and move on to serious negotiations on budget caps for this year and beyond. Shutting the government down now will not serve any useful purpose. What a shutdown will do is waste taxpayers' money and hurt the economy. Indeed, the 2-week Republican government shutdown in 2013 cost our economy billions of dollars. Based on that experience, here is some of what we can expect if there is another forced government shutdown this year: The Department of Housing and Urban Development will have to furlough more than 95 percent of its workforce, impacting services to more than 60 field and regional offices nationwide. Payments will be delayed to the roughly 3,000 local public housing authorities that manage the country's publicly assisted housing programs. In fact, this shifts the burden onto them, causing them to turn to local municipalities that are equally stressed in terms of their budgets. So there is no avoiding [[Page S6919]] this pain--in fact, it will be multiplied if we shut down the government. Thousands of home sales and mortgage-refinancing packages backed by the Federal Housing Administration, the FHA, will be put on standby. People who are ready to close, people who are ready to make a commitment to a home, people who are ready to keep this economy moving will be told: Stand back; wait and see. Cities, counties, and States will not be able to move forward with new community development block grant projects, preventing important local economic investment. This is a program which affects every community in this country, and it is something which is a very positive, constructive way to give local leaders the resources to fund the local initiatives the community desperately wants and needs. This is not Big Washington; this is local America getting a chance to see their projects put in place. The Federal Aviation Administration will not be able to certify new aircraft, interrupting billions of dollars in sales. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration will be forced to stop investigations and emergency response training. Classrooms will be shuttered for 700 midshipmen at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, NY. These are young men and women who are committing themselves to serve the Nation either directly in the armed services of the United States or as members of our merchant fleet. They will basically be told to go home. Financial support will stop for the Maritime Security Program, the MSP. This is an important public-private partnership that is critical to sustaining our troops serving overseas. These are just a few examples from two of the Departments under my purview as the ranking member of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee. There are many other examples throughout the Federal Government that my colleagues are talking about today. Knowing the results that shutdowns and these hardball tactics have brought before, it is hard to believe some still are willing to resort to budget brinksmanship again. I know many of my colleagues on the other side share my concern. I particularly wish to commend Senator Collins, who has been an excellent leader in chairing the THUD subcommittee, for her support for a clean CR. She has done extraordinary work under very difficult and challenging circumstances. Her support for a clean CR so that we can negotiate a longer term budget solution is indicative of the kind of forthright, thoughtful, and in some cases very courageous service she has rendered to Maine and to the country. While we focus on the immediate showdown threat, let's remember the bigger threats we face in 2016. We are here because of the Budget Control Act and its attendant sequester-level caps on discretionary spending. Let's remember that these sequester-level caps were never intended to be implemented. At the time BCA was enacted, the cuts were considered to be extreme--in fact, so extreme that Congress would not ever let them happen, that they would embrace defense and nondefense, and that they would be an action-forcing mechanism--not an actuality of law but an action-forcing mechanism to cause us on a bipartisan basis to come up with long-term budget solutions. Unfortunately, that solution did not materialize. Over time, we had the very good work of Senator Murray and Congressman Paul Ryan to come up with a 2-year suspension, but we are right back where we were, and these sequester caps are staring us right in the face. But today, rather than working together to tackle the sequester, we are on the verge of orchestrating another fiscal crisis. And it is not a crisis that will help the American people; rather, it will hinder the American people. And, indeed, it is ironic because Members on both sides recognize the BCA cap should be raised for both defense and nondefense appropriations. Indeed, both the Defense authorization and the Defense appropriations bills carry bipartisan sense-of-the-Senate language that says: ``Sequestration relief must be accomplished for fiscal years 2016 and 2017.'' And, ``Sequestration relief should include equal defense and nondefense relief.'' So you have a bipartisan consensus on these two committees that represent a significant number of our colleagues who are essentially saying: We have to end this. And they are saying it because they believe, as I do, that our national security rests not just upon adequate elements of the Department of Defense but adequate investment for all our Federal programs. So beyond committing a clean, short-term funding bill, we must focus on eliminating these draconian spending caps imposed on us by the BCA. We know these caps will cause real harm to programs across the Federal Government that our States and constituents rely on. These are not academic issues that could be dismissed as being some programs that are ineffective and less limiting. These are across-the- board cuts that hit all our constituents and hit them hard. Indeed, months ago Chairman McCain and I together wrote to urge the Committee on the Budget to include a higher baseline funding amount for the Department of Defense in the budget resolution. We were essentially asking them to ignore the BCA caps and produce a budget that realistically recognizes the base needs of the Department of Defense-- not the one-time spending of OCO contingency but routine spending that would be projected forth. Senator McCain in particular worked in extraordinarily good faith to try to get such a provision included in the budget resolution, but he did not succeed. And, in response, the use of OCO contingency funds was incorporated to skirt the budget caps. Essentially, what the committee has done--the defense authorization committee--is it has taken the President's budget numbers, but moved money out of the base budget into OCO, beyond the President's request. And what you are doing is creating this OCO funding mechanism--in a sense, a gimmick, really--to cover the real cost--the ongoing cost, the routine continuing cost--of the Department of Defense. That is not good budgeting, and it is not good for Defense either. Because of this I was unable to support legislation on the floor for the Defense authorization bill that in many other respects--virtually every other respect--was extremely well done and extremely thought out. Again, I commend the chairman for all his efforts and those of my colleagues. I clearly disagree that using this OCO funding arrangement--gimmick, sleight of hand, whatever you want to call it--is the way to proceed forward. Relying on it essentially preempts defense from the Budget Control Act and leaves everything else under those onerous caps. As I said, that not only does not adequately and realistically fund defense, but it seriously erodes national security because national security is something more than simply what the Department of Defense does. It is the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security, and it is a myriad of other functions that will not see funding. In fact, they will see their funding begin to shrink dramatically. If we use this approach this year, with the argument that it is just a bridge to the day we finally get ourselves together, I think we are deluding ourselves. It would be much easier next year to put even more money into OCO, to take programs that are traditionally funded through the base budget of the Department of Defense and say: Well, we just don't have room. Let's put it in OCO. It becomes the gift that keeps on giving, and it will not provide the real resources and the certainty the Department of Defense needs over many years to plan for their operations. To stick things in 1-year funding is not to tell the Department of Defense: You can be confident that 2 or 3 years from now, when you are developing that new weapons system platform, the money will be there. It may, but again, it may not. We can't give them that insecurity. We have to give them a sense of certainty. Now, this is a view that is shared not just by myself and some colleagues here on both sides of the aisle but by senior Defense Department officials. They have testified repeatedly before our committee that OCO funding does not provide long-term budget certainty. They need that. And the [[Page S6920]] troops--the men and women they lead--need that. In fact, it really just allows DOD to plan for 1 year. And there are very few programs in the Department of Defense that are 1-year programs. A major weapons system is a multiyear development and then there is the production process. The strategy is not year by year. It is over several years at least. So this is not an efficient and effective way to run the organization. Proper budgeting and planning in the Department of Defense requires at least 5 years. That is the standard. The standard measure is a 5-year program forecast, budget forecast, and we are telling them: Well, this year you can have a bonanza of OCO funds. Next year could be more, could be less, could be much less. This is not the way to efficiently allocate resources for national security and to efficiently develop a strategy to counteract an increasing array of threats around the globe in many different dimensions in many different regions. If we go down this path, it will lead to instability for our troops, their families, and for our defense industrial base. They deserve certainty, not a year-to-year, perhaps- maybe, maybe-perhaps approach. We also need to recognize, as I have repeated before, that national security is not just the Department of Defense. Other agencies are critical--the Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, and Department of Treasury, which does all the terrorist financing sanctions. They have to trace funds flowing around the world to ensure they do not aid and assist terrorist activities or other maligning activities. They need resources too. Taking this approach as it stands now, using this OCO approach for defense and then letting everything else stay under BCA, will not give these agencies the resources they need. I was struck a few days ago when General Petraeus was here testifying that one of the critical areas of effort against ISIL is information warfare. They have proven to be extraordinarily adept at using social media, at communicating through the Internet. One of the questions from my colleague--which was very thoughtful and fundamental--was this: Is the State Department doing enough to counteract--as one of our major foreign policy organizations--this information campaign by ISIL? The General sort of chuckled a bit, and then he said: Let me tell you that when I was commanding, on active service, the State Department had to come to me and essentially borrow $1 million from CENTCOM funds so they could get in the ball game--to just get in the game in terms of information warfare: counteracting measures, public campaigns of information in countries throughout the globe, particularly in the Middle East. That will be much worse if we proceed down this path, and we will not be enhancing our national security. If the ISIL message is unanswered, if they are able to attract adherents from around the globe because all they can really hear is this grotesque discussion of ISIL and what they propose, and there are no counterarguments, there is no countervailing points, we lose that information war. And that is not just a DOD function. Now, we have to make investments in both defense and nondefense. But as I said before, if we stick with these BCA caps, our non-DOD programs will suffer. In addition to that, the needs of the American people will suffer. We will not be able to invest in adequate transportation and water infrastructure. We won't be able to do things that provide adequate and decent housing for our citizens. Under the budget caps we will lose jobs too. When the resources diminish, the need for workers diminishes, and that will happen. Now, we have a situation, particularly where some of our most vulnerable Americans would suffer grievously. Here are a few examples. The elderly housing program has been cut in half since 2010, even when we know the United States population today is aging faster. Every Member of this Senate has numerous elderly housing programs in their State. Their low-income seniors rely on them. I would suspect they take some pride in the fact there is adequate housing--in some cases not enough, but at least some adequate housing. They will suffer. There are 7.7 million very low income renters in the United States. That means they pay more than 50 percent of their income in rent or live in substandard housing or both. If these budget caps go into effect, then the THUD bill will not include meaningful funding for the affordable housing production program available to local governments. When we turn to Public Housing Authorities, they are facing more than $3 billion in capital needs just to keep them repaired, just to make them places that are decent to live in, where people can have appropriate hallway lighting, they can have elevators that work, they can have plumbing systems that are adequate--the basics. We are not talking about building whirlpools, spas, and Jacuzzis. This is just meeting basic requirements in maintenance and capital repairs. The level of funding PHA's are faced with is the same level we provided in the late 1980s. That is going back about 30 years. Thirty years ago, relatively speaking, we would be spending as much as we are now on simply maintaining public housing. These are real-world consequences. Again, BCA comes into play in terms of the impact on domestic programs. Funding for public transit continues to fall even while transit ridership goes up. One of the success stories over the past few years is our public transit systems. Our buses, our subway systems, our light rail systems are enjoying increased ridership. That is good for people to get to work, and it is good for our environment because of reduces the use of individual automobiles. But if our ridership goes up and the resources go down, we are going to see a system that gets less and less dependable, reliable, and effective, and we will lose not only a number of those riders but have incidents--as we have seen across the country--where there are significant safety concerns and significant disruptions. It has not been uncommon over the last several months here in Washington to hear on the radio that a whole subway line has gone down because of a maintenance problem or something else, and that day's workforce doesn't get to the office for 3 or 4 or 5 hours. Guess what. That costs a lot of private employers a great deal of money because the people aren't doing the work, and they probably would be paid. So essentially this impacts our economy, and it is multiplied. And it will be exponentially multiplied if we start cutting away the money, as suggested in the Budget Control Act. It is now time to work together and to enact first a clean CR, which will give us the time to systematically and comprehensively address the issues that are staring us straight in the face because of the BCA--the budget caps on Defense and nondefense. It is time to be able to move-- as I believe the vast majority of my colleagues want to--the excess OCO funding back into the regular budget of the Department of Defense as we raise the budget cap, and as we raise the budget cap for the Department of Defense, to recognize we have to raise the cap not only for other national security agencies to protect our country, but also for other agencies in order to invest in our economy, keep us productive, keep people employed, and also keep faith with the thousands and thousands of Americans who have worked and now may need help. There are seniors in need of rental assistance. They need the support of a good transit system to get to work or, if they are a senior citizen, to get to a doctor's appointment. They are counting on us. So I hope all my colleagues can come together, forge an agreement, avoid a shutdown, and then do something more than just keep the lights on--invest across the board in our people and watch those investments multiply to a productive, successful economy and a more secure America. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. [[Page S6921]] Unanimous Consent Request--S. Res. 224 Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, in 1975, Russian physicist Andrei Sakharov was awarded a Nobel Prize for his public opposition to the totalitarian communism of the Soviet Union. He knew what he was talking about as he had spent decades working on the Soviet nuclear weapons program, work he had originally thought was a patriotic duty that would ensure the balance of power with the United States but that he came to understand was in the service of a brutal, oppressive regime with aggressive intentions. The Soviets prohibited Sakharov from accepting the award in person, although his wife Yelena Bonner was abroad at the time. She accepted on his behalf and delivered his seminal speech, ``Peace, Progress, and Human Rights.'' In it, Sakharov declared: I am convinced that international confidence, mutual understanding, disarmament, and international security are inconceivable without an open society with freedom of information, freedom of conscience, the right to publish, and the right to travel and choose the country in which one wishes to live. I am likewise convinced that freedom of conscience, together with other civil rights, provides the basis for scientific progress and constitutes a guarantee that scientific advances will not be used to despoil mankind, providing the basis for economic and social progress, which in turn is a political guarantee for the possibility of an effective defense of social rights. He recited the names of his fellow dissidents who were being persecuted by the Soviets, but he called for peaceful reform, not a violent revolution, saying: We must today fight for every individual person separately against injustice and the violation of human rights. Much of our future depends on this. In struggling to protect human rights we must, I am convinced, first and foremost act as protectors of the innocent victims of regimes installed in various countries, without demanding the destruction or total condemnation of these regimes. We need a pliant, pluralist, tolerant community, which selectively and tentatively can bring about a free undogmatic use of the experiences of all social systems. Sakharov was relieved of all his scientific duties and, after denouncing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1980, was banished to Gorky, 250 miles east of Moscow on the Volga River, to remove him from the public eye. His wife joined him in 1984, charged with anti-Soviet slander, and was prohibited from traveling abroad for medical treatment. Sakharov began a hunger strike in protest. Soviet authorities detained and force-fed him. In solidarity, President Ronald Reagan--who was then initiating his historic negotiations with the Soviets--proclaimed May 18, 1983, National Andrei Sakharov Day, and the following year the United States Congress passed a bipartisan measure renaming the mailing address of the Soviet Embassy from 1125 16th Street to No. 1 Andrei Sakharov Plaza. Every piece of mail delivered to or sent from the embassy would thus bear the name of the courageous dissident the Soviets were trying to silence. The following year, the Soviet Union allowed Bonner to travel abroad for heart surgery, and the year after that, Gorbachev allowed Sakharov and his wife to return to Moscow, although Sakharov remained critical of the slow speed of Gorbachev's reforms until his death in 1989--just 1 month after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The bravery of Andrei Sakharov was instrumental in bringing down a great and oppressive empire. Armed only with the truth, he was able to expose to the world the reality of Soviet Communism, the futility of trying to placate or domesticate the regime, and the power of standing for human rights. Today, we have a case before us that is eerily reminiscent of Sakharov's legacy. Dr. Liu Xiaobo, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, sits today in a Chinese jail for the crime of subversion. A poet, author, and political scientist, Dr. Liu was in 1989 a visiting scholar at Columbia University, but when the pro-democracy protests broke out in Beijing in June of that year, he returned to China to aid the movement. He staged a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square in the midst of the historic student protests and insisted the protests would be nonviolent, even in the face of the violence threatened by the People's Republic of China. The PRC arrested Liu for his involvement in the Tiananmen Square demonstration and sentenced him to 2 years in prison. In 1996, the party subjected him to 3 years of ``reeducation through labor'' for questioning the single-party system. In 2004, the PRC cut Liu's phone lines and Internet connection after he published an essay criticizing the party's campaign to silence so- called subversive journalists and activists. In 2008, Liu, along with over 350 Chinese intellectuals and human rights advocates, penned ``Charter 08,'' a manifesto modeled after the Czech ``Charter 77,'' an anti-Communist manifesto written in 1977 by Vaclav Havel and others calling for human rights and political reforms in the Soviet Republics. Dr. Liu's ``Charter 08'' made 19 specific demands of the PRC, including abandoning one-party rule in favor of instituting a separation of powers composed of a legislative democracy and independent judiciary; abolition of the Hukou housing system that has victimized poor and rural Chinese for decades; and securing freedom of association, assembly, expression, and religion. ``Charter 08'' was released on December 10, 2008. Although the Communist Party quickly censored it, over 10,000 journalists, scholars, businessmen, and teachers have signed the document since 2008. Two days prior to the release of ``Charter 08''--on the eve of the 100-year anniversary of China's first Constitution and the 30-year anniversary of Beijing's Democracy Wall movement--the PRC detained Liu for his involvement in this charter. In June 2009, he was officially arrested and charged with ``inciting subversion of state power'' for his coauthorship of ``Charter 08.'' After being detained for over a year, Liu pled not guilty to ``inciting subversion of state power'' before the Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court on December 23, 2009. His defense was not allowed to present evidence, and on Christmas Day Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison with an additional 2 years' deprivation of all political rights. Beijing High Court rejected his appeal 2 months later. On October 2010, Dr. Liu Xiaobo received the Nobel Peace Prize for his leadership in writing and publishing ``Charter 08.'' Like Sakharov, he could not attend in person but accepted in absentia, boldly declaring in his acceptance speech: Hatred can rot away at a person's intelligence and conscience. Enemy mentality will poison the spirit of a nation, incite cruel mortal struggles, destroy a society's tolerance and humanity, and hinder a nation's progress toward freedom and democracy. That is why I hope to be able to transcend my personal experiences as I look upon our nation's development and social change, to counter the regime's hostility with utmost goodwill, and to dispel hatred with love. The very moment the Nobel Commission awarded the Peace Prize to Liu, his wife Liu Xia was taken into custody by the PRC. She penned an open letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping in June 2013 decrying her unjust arrest and detention: I have been under house arrest and have lost all my personal freedoms since October 2010. No one has told me any reasons for detaining me. I have thought about it over and over. Perhaps in this country it's a ``crime'' for me to be ``Liu Xiaobo's wife.'' Both Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia remain in prison today. The opening paragraph of ``Charter 08'' captures the entirety of Liu Xiaobo's lifework: Having experienced a prolonged period of human rights disasters and challenging and tortuous struggles, the awakening Chinese citizens are becoming increasingly aware that freedom, equality and human rights are universal values shared by all humankind, and that democracy, republicanism, and constitutional government make up the basic institutional framework of modern politics. A `modernization' bereft of these universal values and this basic political framework is a disastrous process that deprives people of their rights, rots away their humanity, and destroys their dignity. Where is China headed in the 21st century? Will it continue with this `modernization' under authoritarian rule, or will it endorse universal values, join the mainstream civilization, and build a democratic form of government? This is an unavoidable decision. Dr. Liu's enormous courage and willingness to voluntarily sacrifice not only his own freedom but also that of those most dear to him poses a challenge to the free world. Will we be silent, eager to enjoy the economic benefits of cooperation with the PRC? Or will we put President Xi on notice that [[Page S6922]] for America, human rights are no longer off the table, and that we are listening to the truth about Communist China. I believe that the freedom championed by Dr. Liu is possible for all the Chinese people. I believe that from Tiananmen Square to Taiwan, the evidence is clear that the Chinese desire--and are capable of-- democracy. I believe that we have a moral responsibility to not marginalize Dr. Liu and his brave fellow dissidents but to make their plight central to all our dealings with the PRC. For that reason, we should follow the example of Ronald Reagan. We should follow the example of standing up to oppression, standing up do the Soviet Union's oppression of Andrei Sakharov. For that reason, in solidarity with the Chinese people engaged in a long and nonviolent struggle for basic human rights, I am asking my colleagues to join me in creating a new version of Sakharov Plaza by naming the street in front of the People's Republic of China Embassy in Washington, DC, Liu Xiaobo Plaza. This would be the street sign that the Chinese Ambassador would look at each day. This would be the address that every piece of correspondence going into the embassy and coming out of the embassy would have written on it, just as with the Soviets when forced to recognize the bravery of Sakharov. The PRC officials will be forced to recognize the bravery of Dr. Liu and to acknowledge it dozens of times a day, day after day. I realize that this is an expedited request, but given the ongoing repression not only of the Lius but of so many other voices for political and religious freedom in China and the imminent arrival of the Chinese leader who is directly responsible for it, I hope that my colleagues will join me. I intend to propound a unanimous consent request, and it is my hope that all 100 Senators will stand with me. But for the moment, I yield the floor. Mr. CRUZ addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Capito). The Senator from Texas. Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, for reasons that I just detailed to this Chamber, reasons for which we should stand in bipartisan unanimity in support of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dr. Liu Xiaobo and in support of human rights and dissidents across the world, that we should follow the successful pattern of Sakharov Plaza under Ronald Reagan, this should be an issue that brings us all together. Accordingly, I ask unanimous consent that the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee be discharged from further consideration of and that the Senate now proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 224. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from California. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I would like to make an observation. The notice for this went out less than an hour ago. The consultations with others haven't been made. It was precipitously brought to the floor, and I can only infer that it has political implications, because the President of China is due to arrive here tomorrow and, therefore, this would be passed today, moved out of committee without a vote in front of the Senate. I don't think that is the way we should do business in this Senate. Maybe people don't believe diplomacy makes a difference, but I do. I think there will be ample time for the President to speak with the President of China and for some of us to speak as well. This is, of course--the human rights, of course--a subject. But in the absence of that, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Texas. Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I note that this is a sad day for this body. When standing up to the Soviet Union, Democrats and Republicans were able to come together in support of Andrei Sakharov, and it worked. It made a difference speaking up for human rights. The senior Senator from California is correct that this was expedited, and she is correct as to why. As I said in this floor speech, the presence of President Xi in this country is precisely the reason that we should stand in unanimity in support of human rights. It is what makes it timely until a few minutes ago, when we had been informed that there were no objections on the Democratic side and Republican side. It saddens me. I know there are many Chinese Americans in the State of California, there are many Chinese Americans in the State of Texas, and across the country there are millions of Americans who care for human rights. Just this morning we sat on the floor of the House of Representatives and listened to Pope Francis talk about putting aside petty partisan differences and coming together with a voice of compassion. Dr. Liu is in a Chinese prison, and the senior Senator from California is standing and objecting to recognizing this Nobel laureate's bravery, is standing and objecting because presumably it would embarrass his Communist captors. I, for one, think as Americans we should not be troubled by embarrassing Communist oppressors. I note, as the senior Senator from California leaves the floor, that this is not an issue that is abstract to me. My family, like Dr. Liu, has been imprisoned by oppressive regimes. My father, as a teenager, was imprisoned and tortured in Cuba. He had his nose broken. He had his teeth shattered. He lay in the blood and grime of a prison cell in Cuba. My aunt, my Tia Sonia, was a few years later again imprisoned and tortured. This time by Castro. My father by Batista and my aunt by Castro was imprisoned and tortured by a Communist regime. It is a sad statement when the United States of America cannot stand up and say: You who are imprisoned unjustly, we stand with you. If any of us listened to a word Pope Francis said this morning, that is a word we should have heard--that we should be a voice of freedom, a clarion voice of freedom across this globe. What we saw on this Senate floor saddens me greatly. I understand the Democrats feel partisan loyalty to the White House, and this White House's Secretary Clinton said at the beginning of the administration that human rights are off the table. America no longer stands for human rights. We will coddle up with oppressors if they make cheap calculators to sell in our stores. I think they are values that transcend the mighty dollar, and it is entirely possible to deal with foreign countries and yet maintain our principles and speak with unanimity. A couple of years ago I had the opportunity to visit with Natan Sharansky, the famed Soviet dissident. He and I visited in Jerusalem. He talked to me about how, when he was in the Soviet gulag, the prisoners would pass from cell to cell notes: Did you hear what President Reagan said--``evil empire,'' ``ash heap of history,'' ``tear down this wall''? The leadership of the United States of America--mind you, it wasn't partisan leadership; it was clear bipartisan leadership in America--shined a light to the dark of those prison cells. I pray today that Dr. Liu, in his prison cell, does not hear word that the Democratic Senators are unwilling to stand with him. That is heartbreaking at a level rarely seen. It is one thing for us to disagree on partisan matters. We can have disagreements over the appropriate rate of capital gains taxes. But for standing with an oppressed Nobel Peace Prize laureate, for standing up to Communist oppression, that should not be a partisan divide. The objection raised by the senior Senator from California is deeply disappointing, and I intend to continue to press this issue because the voice of America, the voice for freedom that Pope Francis urged us to aspire to will not be extinguished. It is who we are that is essential to our character and to our integrity. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. Gun Violence Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, over the course of the summer we have watched with horror as thousands more have died in Syria and Iraq, and the debate over what we should do about it has been omnipresent here in the Senate and in the House. We have held hearings, appeared on television to tell our story of how we should respond, and talked about it on the floor of the [[Page S6923]] Senate and the House. Similarly, we have watched the conflict continue to persist in eastern Ukraine. Although they have not had the same number of casualties as we have seen in Syria and Iraq, they have had similar death and destruction, and we have responded with a vigorous debate on the floor of the Senate--again, hearings in committees, letters to the President, bipartisan pieces of legislation that have been proposed--about how the United States should seek to reduce the amount of casualties in a place like eastern Ukraine, and we are also debating what our response should be in Syria and Iraq. What if I told you that this summer 4,000 people died in another conflict in which there was absolutely no debate here in the Congress? What if I told you there were 4,000 people who died this summer in a conflict and not a single committee in the Congress held a hearing on it? What if I told you there was a conflict this summer in which 4,000 people perished and not a single Member of the majority party in the House or the Senate has proposed any comprehensive way to deal with it? This chart shows the number of people on a daily, monthly, and annual basis who are killed by guns. On average, it is 86 a day, 26,000 a month, and 31,000 a year. This summer, while kids were out of school, over 4,000 people--just this summer--died across this country from gun violence. I come to the floor not as often as I would like but as often as I can to tell some of their stories because I kind of thought these numbers would be enough to persuade Members of this body to do something--anything--to try to stem the scourge of gun violence in this body, but it hasn't, and so my hope is maybe by telling the stories of some of these individuals, it will hopefully make a difference. Every day we add dozens of stories of young men and women--mostly young men and women--whose lives were cut short, whose greatness we were never able to see, whose potential was never realized because they were killed by a gun. This summer we have been gripped by mass shooting after mass shooting. Cynthia Hurd, Tywanza Sanders, Sharonda Singleton, Myra Thompson, Ethel Lance, Susie Jackson, Daniel Simmons, and DePayne Doctor, and Clementa Pinckney--we don't know all of those names, but we know about many of them because they were killed at a mass shooting in a church in South Carolina. Sgt Carson Holmquist, PO2 Randall Smith, GySgt Thomas Sullivan, LCpl ``Skip'' Wells, and SSgt David Wyatt--maybe you have heard their names because they were all killed at a shooting in Tennessee at a Chattanooga Armed Forces recruiting center. Maybe you have heard of Jillian Johnson and Mayci Breaux, who were killed in a movie theater in Lafayette, LA, in July of this year. Most people have now heard of Allison Parker and Adam Ward, who were gunned down on live TV just a few weeks ago in Virginia. On each one of those days--June 17, a shooting in South Carolina; July 16, a shooting in Tennessee; July 24, a shooting in Louisiana; and August 26, a shooting in Virginia--there were dozens more people who died from gunshot wounds whom we never heard of, but they meant something to their families. To this day their loss is experienced deeply by those who knew them well. Some of them were people who were close to those of us who serve in public service. Matthew Shlonsky was killed this summer in Washington, DC. On August 15 he was heading to a going-away party, and he had just stepped out of a cab when he was shot outside of the Shaw-Howard Metro station. He was the sixth gunshot victim in the Shaw area in a little over a week. Think about what it is like to live in a neighborhood in which there have been six shootings over the course of a week. Think of the fear that breeds in those communities. We knew Matthew because he was an intern for one of our colleagues. He was working as a consultant at Deloitte, but he had served as a Senate intern. He was an amazing kid by all accounts. He traveled the world, spoke two languages, and was a star hockey player. His future was absolutely limitless. But because this city is awash in guns--many of them illegal, many of them in the hands of criminals who get them because of giant, gaping holes in our background check system--Matthew Shlonsky is no longer with us. He is dead at the age of 23. How about the heartbreaking story of Carey Gabay, who was 43 years old. He was serving as an assistant counsel to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, and before that he had been counsel of the Empire State Development Corporation. He died on September 16--just on the back end of the summer--after he was caught in the crossfire of a shooting in New York City. He was an innocent bystander when he was shot in the head while attending the pre-West Indian American Day Parade festival with friends and family. He was the son of Jamaican immigrants and grew up in public housing in the Bronx. He had done amazingly well. He attended Harvard University and Harvard Law School. He was working for the Governor and trying to make a better life for others by trying to give opportunities to kids who grow up in the same circumstance as he did. A friend described him as ``an amazing human being who melded public service, professionalism, personal integrity with warmth and caring for everyone he knew.'' He was 43 years old when he was gunned down in broad daylight outside of a festival simply because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. This summer 4,000 people were killed by guns, and not a single public hearing has occurred in the U.S. Senate to discuss a solution. There is not even mention of a debate happening anytime soon on the floor of the Senate as to how we stop these episodes of mass slaughter. We are averaging more than one mass shooting in this country every single day this year. That is astounding. That is shocking. Yet there is total, utter, absolute silence from the world's greatest deliberative body on what we should do about it. I am the last person to say there is any panacea coming from the Congress on how to stem gun violence. We are never going to be able to eliminate these epidemic rates of gun violence just by one law or set of laws that are passed. But what is an absolute indictment of this place is that we don't even try. I have made this contention on the floor before, and I will make it again. I truly believe our silence on this has become complicity. We have become accomplices to these murders because by saying and doing nothing, we offer up a kind of quiet endorsement to people who exist in the fringes of their minds and who are thinking about contemplating violence, and the leaders of this country are doing absolutely nothing to seriously condemn or stop their destructive, malevolent behavior. Our silence has become complicit. I hope that at some point over the course of the rest of this year, we can begin a conversation as to how we can turn these numbers back in the right direction. There is no other country in the industrialized world that even comes close to these numbers. I can offer a suggestion on where to start. If between now and December we can't come to a common understanding on our gun laws--I still don't understand why we can't just do that since 90 percent of Americans support expansive background checks--let's start by fixing the mental health care system. I think there are a lot of reasons why Adam Lanza walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School and killed 20 kids over 2 years ago. The child advocate in Connecticut issued a damning report on his interactions with the mental health care system. His mother tried and tried and tried, but in the end she gave up and let him retreat into the isolation of his room, where he plotted these murders. That family and mother and young man ran into barrier after barrier and obstacle after obstacle trying to find a course of treatment for his very serious set of illnesses. What we know is that people with mental illness are much more likely to be the victims of gun violence than the perpetrators of it. There is no inherent connection between being mentally ill and being violent. There is no greater incidence of mental illness in the United States than anywhere else in the world. Yet we have epidemic rates of gun violence. But I will certainly be the first to admit that if we fix our mental health care system, it will help lots of people who have no intersections with gun violence, and it will [[Page S6924]] push these numbers downward because some of these people are committing these murders because they are not getting treatment for serious illnesses. Senator Cassidy and I--frankly, we don't agree on a lot because he is a conservative Republican from the Deep South, and I am a progressive Democrat from the Northeast--introduced a mental health reform measure which has broad bipartisan support and which would seek to break down these barriers in order to get care for the seriously mentally ill and try to get the parents more involved in the care, especially of young adults. It would increase the capacity in our mental health treatment system for both outpatient and inpatient care. Maybe over the course of the rest of this year, at the very least we can make a dent in the massive shortfalls in our behavioral health care system. The families I have become so close with in Sandy Hook, CT, commanded me to come down to the floor every week or so and tell these stories, the voices of victims. They would like us to come together on a set of meaningful changes to our gun laws. They just don't understand why Adam Lanza was able to walk into the school with a gun that killed 20 little boys and girls in less than 5 minutes because of how powerful it was with the 30-round cartridges he was able to use. They don't want our inability to get action on gun laws to stop us from making other progress that would make the next Adam Lanza less likely. Maybe we can do that. But we should do something. Our silence is an embarrassment after this summer of mass shootings. These news reports should command us to action, but we, frankly, shouldn't have had to wait for the news reports of shootings in Virginia or Louisiana or South Carolina because these numbers were just as true last year as they are this year. Maybe there are more episodes of mass violence and mass shootings and headline-grabbing atrocities, but these numbers which reflect what is happening on the ground in New Haven, CT; Hartford, CT; Boston, MA; Chicago, IL; and Los Angeles have been a reality for a long time, and we should have woken up long ago. But maybe over the course of this year we can make some progress so that moving forward there are a few less voices of victims to bring to the floor of the Senate. I thank the Presiding Officer. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Volkswagen Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I rise to speak about recent revelations that Volkswagen woefully deceived regulators and the general public to artificially lower emissions of its 2009 to 2015 Volkswagen and Audi diesel vehicles. These actions raise significant consumer, environmental, and public health concerns. According to the EPA's Notice of Violation of the Clean Air Act, Volkswagen used a sophisticated software algorithm on certain vehicles that detected when vehicles were undergoing emissions testing. This software--referred to as a ``defeat device''--allows vehicles to meet emissions standards during testing, but under normal driving situations, these same vehicles emit nitrogen oxides up to 40 times the allowable emissions standards. This is unbelievable. I think we can imagine that such technology exists, but I don't think we ever thought that one of our major international car companies would be alleged to have used it. So far approximately 482,000 diesel vehicles sold in the United States and 11 million cars worldwide have been affected. A deliberate attempt like this by a company to mislead regulators and the general public is completely unacceptable. This raises serious questions that need answers: Why did Volkswagen, for more than a year, claim that the discrepancies in the emissions tests and the levels on the road were a technical error? Who at Volkswagen signed off on the defeat device? Did executives at Volkswagen know these actions were put into place to deliberately deceive regulators and the general public? Does the EPA have the necessary testing systems in place to detect such devices that trick the software? Have other auto manufacturers of clean diesel vehicles been tampering with their software to get around emissions standards? How do we ensure that this never happens again? This is a matter of public trust. Consumers were lied to and sold a product under false pretenses. Those consumers who brought certain Volkswagen Jettas, Beetles, Passats, and certain Audis with 2-liter diesel engines believed they were purchasing a vehicle that would provide premium fuel economy and performance while also meeting strict emissions standards. Who wouldn't be enticed by these vehicles after they were named the ``Green Car of the Year'' and ``Eco-Friendly Car of the Year'' by national publications? We now know these consumers were duped and that they will now have to bring their vehicles under compliance to meet Federal emissions standards. Volkswagen will likely pay for the repairs but what about the costs of reduced fuel economy and lower resale values? Congress intentionally included strong enforceability elements into the Clean Air Act statute. Regulations promulgated under the Clean Air Act aimed to protect human health and the environment by reducing nitrogen oxide and other pollutants. Motor vehicles are the primary source of nitrogen oxide pollution from transportation. These highly reactive gases play a major role in atmospheric reactions that produce smog. That smog accelerates climate change and exacerbates respiratory diseases that harm human health, including asthma, which affects 23 million Americans, including 6 million children. That is why we have emissions standards. It is not just some far-off number that is put into place; it is to protect children from getting asthma; it is to protect the world from heating up; it is to ensure that we protect our environment for generations to come. The Clean Air Act requires automakers to certify to the EPA that their vehicles will meet applicable Federal emissions standards to control air pollution. Through this process, Volkswagen deceived regulators into believing these vehicles produced low emissions. Vehicles with the defeat device emit anywhere from 5 to 40 times more nitrogen oxide than allowed by law while on the road. If we pick a number in the middle of the range--let's say 20 times as much--it would mean that Volkswagen's fleet in the U.S. produces 46,657 more tons of harmful smog. Changes to the EPA's emissions standards testing process are needed as well. I have written to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy to express that concern. The EPA needs to explain why their systems did not detect this deceptive software and what changes the Agency will be making with their testing processes. I strongly urge the EPA to establish robust safeguards to prevent automakers from gaming the system and prevent this from happening again. There must also be a full investigation into Volkswagen's actions. The Department of Justice is conducting a criminal investigation into the company's actions, and I urge DOJ to leave no stone unturned in its investigation to determine how a company could have willfully deceived Federal regulators and the general public. Volkswagen must conduct a thorough and comprehensive public education campaign to ensure that all owners of these vehicles are made aware of the defect and are informed about where and when they can go to get their vehicle fixed. The Department of Transportation, which has expertise with vehicle recalls, should also play an active role. If we learned anything from the General Motors and Takata airbag recalls, it is that recalls need to be broad enough from the outset and cover affected vehicle models and years, the general public needs to know how and where to get their vehicle repaired, and automakers must have a system in place to make timely repairs with replacement parts that truly fix the problem. Other agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission, should also take a serious look at how they can help in this process. [[Page S6925]] As a member of both the Senate Commerce Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee, I believe that consumers must be protected. I also believe Volkswagen's competitors that actually follow the law should be able to play on an even playing field. Other car companies that follow the law did the right thing. They put the right systems in place, and they should not be penalized because one car company did this. They should have been able to play on an even playing field. If there is an uneven playing field, it hurts American employees, it hurts American companies, and mostly it hurts American consumers. The actions by Volkswagen to deliberately deceive consumers around the world about the emissions levels in their cars is fundamentally about a breach in trust. Consumers thought they were getting the same product that was being advertised, when what they were getting was a product that met those standards only when it was tested, only for 1 day, and only for the time of the emissions testing. As Federal agencies move forward with their investigation, it is critical that we get to the bottom of this to figure out how this happened, what the extent was, and if it is happening with any other automakers to ensure that what happened never happens again. Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Pilot's Bill of Rights 2 Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I wish to take advantage of an opportunity to bring up the subject that no one is talking about now. Of course, right now everyone has been in the middle of the Pope's visit and other things and what is happening with the Iran bill and the votes we have. I wish to mention there is something else very significant going on right now, that we are in the middle of, and that is the Pilot's Bill of Rights 2. To put it into perspective, 3 years ago last month we had the Pilot's Bill of Rights 1, and it was one people were not aware of. There are only 617,000 pilots in America, so it is not one of these issues that gets an awful lot of attention. But the mere fact that those 617,000 people--many of them are single-issue people. A lot of people are not aware that prior to the passage of the Pilot's Bill of Rights 3 years ago, there was just one area left within our system whereupon you are guilty until proven innocent. That is exactly what we corrected with that bill, just to refresh the memory of my colleagues. It gave the pilots who were accused of something the evidence that was used against them. I had a personal experience with it. It actually happened to me. I was never sensitive to that until such time as I experienced it myself. What we have right now is we are up to 64 cosponsors of the Pilot's Bill of Rights 2. The major part of this bill is something that is out there that doesn't resolve anything. Ten years ago, as kind of an experiment, we put in a sport pilot-eligible exemption so that the pilots of small aircraft would not have to have what they call a third- class medical. The result of this was that after a 10-year period, the medical safety experience of these pilots has been identical to those with medical certificates. A joint study was made following that by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association and by the EAA, the Experimental Aircraft Association, of the 46,976 accidents over a 6-year period. Of those, only 99 had a medical cause as a factor. That is less than one- quarter of 1 percent. Of those 99, none would have been prevented by the current third-class medical. That shows that experiment worked and there is no reason to have a third-class medical. So people are aware that some changes have been made, I want to briefly outline the modifications that have been made. The modifications require three things for pilots to qualify for an exemption. The exemption we are talking about is the exemption from having to take a third-class medical exemption process every 2 years-- sometimes more extensive than that. First, pilots will have to complete an online medical education course. Secondly, pilots have to maintain verification that they have been to a doctor at least once every 4 years and certify that they are receiving the care they need by a physician to treat any medical condition that warrants it. Third, a pilot would have to complete a comprehensive medical review by the FAA. That would be applied to a new pilot, so they establish a benchmark as to what a pilot's physical condition is. The pilot would be required to take an online medical course every 2 years. This gives the pilot access to information on medical issues that may not be covered by a doctor in a medical examination but that would have an impact on their physical condition to fly. For example, this course would make sure pilots are aware of impacts on interactions of over-the-counter and prescription medications and how these interactions could impact their flying capabilities. Requiring pilots to take this course boosts aviation safety for the aviation community. Secondly, pilots would need to complete an exam by their personal physician at least once every 4 years and include a proof of their doctor's visit in their logbooks. This resolves the problem most people are concerned about; that they would have to at least see a physician and be assured that they didn't have some condition they didn't have prior to that. Furthermore, the pilots would be required to certify that they are under the care and treatment of a doctor for any medical condition that would warrant treatment. Pilots would do this instead of visiting an aviation medical examiner every 2 years and sometimes even more frequently than that. With this modification, we are actually encouraging pilots to be honest about their health and seek treatment for it. Right now pilots are incentivized to hide any medical condition from the FAA, including by not seeking treatment for it, out of the fear that the pilot might lose his wings. We don't want that to happen. People who are not pilots do not realize how significant it is that you don't want to be taken out of the air, particularly for some reason that is not justified. Pilots, like any individual, maintain stronger relationships with their personal physician, and this is a good thing that fosters an honest dialogue between pilots and doctors, which is something we should all want and something that is not there today. We want pilots to get the treatment they need. Any medically treated pilot is safer than one who is not being treated. So for many pilots the most burdensome aspects of the FAA controversy is simply the constant churn of submitting paperwork over and over, every 2 years or less, even when there has been no change in their medical status. This bill, as modified, gives pilots a break from the bureaucracy. The third requirement for pilots to receive the third-class medical exemption is to complete one FAA medical review. So if a new pilot comes in, we need a benchmark--where is that pilot, what is his physical condition today--so as time goes by we can see how he might be changing. If someone does not have an existing medical certificate, such as new pilots who have never gone through an exam, they would have to do it before they fall into qualifying for the exemption. By the way, of the 617,000 pilots in America today, this is the one thing that concerns me more than anything else, which is to have to go back and go through the type of examination they are required to, now that we know the 10-year experiment of being exempt has worked. There is one caveat. If a pilot flying under the third-class medical exemption is diagnosed with a severe condition--let's talk about maybe a heart attack--then they need to go through the FAA special issuance process to receive medical clearance to fly again. Again, this would only be needed to be done one time. The ability of the FAA to maintain a stranglehold on pilots will be gone. I am confident the changes will result in a safer flying environment. I want to reiterate that the Pilot's Bill of Rights does not change the certification standard to obtain a pilot's certificate. All pilots still have to possess the pilot's certificate, pass the required practical tests and necessary check rides to [[Page S6926]] demonstrate that they have the knowledge, skills, and ability to safely operate their plane. Further, this bill does not change the fundamental responsibility of every pilot to self-certify their ability to fly each time they get into the cockpit of a plane. I am a pilot, and every time I get in a plane I make a conscious decision that I am fit to fly. Everyone I know who is a pilot does the same thing. Again, all of this is not necessary. When you go back and realize that over the 10 years of the experiment with a limited number of pilots there were no changes. There is no difference between those who have or have not had the pilot exams. With these changes, the third- class medical exemption and the Pilot's Bill of Rights is enjoying a greater level of support from Members of the Senate. Support from general aviation is strongly bipartisan. Sixty-four of my colleagues are cosponsors of this legislation. Half of those are Democrats and half are Republicans. Groups representing general aviation in the community and in the pilot unions have declared their support for the bill. General aviation organizations, such as the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, the Experimental Pilots Association, and the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, support the bill. The National Association of State Aviation Officials support the bill, the Allied Pilots Association and the Southwest Pilots Association, both unions which represent 23,000 pilots who fly for American Airlines, U.S. Airways, and Southwest Airlines, support the bill. Pilots for NetJets support the bill. The bill has strong bipartisan support. I urge all the Members who support general aviation and all the economic activity of general aviation to be a part of this bill. One of the reasons I am doing this today is one of the two organizations--and I am not sure which one it is, it is either the AOPA or the AA--is doing a major effort right now to encourage the pilot population out there to encourage their Members of the Senate to cosponsor this bill. Again, we currently have 64 sponsors of the bill. I can't think of any reason we can't get everyone else. The same individuals who supported it 3 years ago should be there to support it. So I encourage those few Members of the Senate who are not sponsors to look at it very carefully. It may be 617,000 people are not a lot of people, but of the 617,000 people, most of them are single-issue people. So it would be very good to join in on this. This is something we now have demonstrated clearly is not going to incur any safety hazards and it is going to be a real godsend for pilots who don't want to go through this bureaucracy every 2 years or more frequently in some cases. The bill is out there, and it is one I feel very strongly that we ought to be able to work into our floor use probably in the next very short period of time. With that, I do yield the floor because my very good friend from Delaware is here to say something profound. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware. Transportation Funding Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I don't know that I will say anything profound, but I appreciate the chairman of our committee saying that. Madam President, and fellow native West Virginian, I will show a map of the United States in just a minute, and there are some States that are delaying and some States that are cutting back on transportation projects. One of them is West Virginia. One of them is Delaware. I want to talk a little bit about that. Before I do, I would like to go back in time 10 months to the election of last year. I am reminded of the message I heard from the electorate that came out of that election. To simplify it, there were three things they were trying to tell us. No. 1, they want us to work together; No. 2, they want us to get things done; and, No. 3, they want us to get things done that will actually strengthen our economic recovery. If you go back in time to the January--the week Barack Obama and Joe Biden were inaugurated as President and Vice President, 628,000 people filed for unemployment insurance in that 1 week in January of 2009. Any time that weekly number of people filing for unemployment insurance is over 400,000, we are losing jobs in this country and in the economy. Last Thursday we got a number from the Department of Labor. Last week's number was about 265,000 who filed for unemployment. That was last week. There is a new number today--I am not sure what it was, but for the last 28 weeks that number of people filing for unemployment insurance has been under 300,000. I think that is the longest that we have been keeping track, where we had 28 consecutive weeks where fewer than 300,000 people in this country were applying for unemployment insurance. That number is way under 400,000, so we are adding jobs, and we are expecting to continue to add jobs in this country. There are still people looking for jobs in my State, there are in West Virginia, and other States as well, but when you consider the unemployment rate was about 10 percent in the early part of 2009 and today it is a little over 5 percent, we are making progress, but we can make a lot more progress. One of the ways we can make progress is by dealing with our fiscal plan and not hold the Nation's economy hostage with our inability to pass a spending plan. And God help us if we drop the ball on this again and have another shutdown. I sure hope we come to our senses and avoid doing that. My hope is that we will. One of the other ways we can strengthen our economic recovery--and it is right out there for us to seize and do--is to make sure that in a nation where roads, highways, bridges, and transit systems are deteriorating, where we need to make improvements and we need to build, frankly, new projects--new highways, bridges, roads and transit systems--at the very least we need to maintain the quality of what we have or improve the quality of road safety, surfaces, potholes, you name it. There is a lot of work to be done, and there are a lot of people who would like to do the work. The McKinsey Global Institute, an arm of the national consulting firm McKinsey, looked at what we could do for our growing GDP in this country if we fully funded a 6-year transportation plan, what we could do for an employment opportunity if we funded a 6-year transportation plan, and the numbers are remarkable--I think amazing. We were told that fully funding a 6-year transportation plan would grow our GDP by approximately 1.5 percent per year--not for 1 year but for the life of the transportation plan that we funded--probably 6 years at 1.5 percent a year. When you consider the GDP growth over the last couple years, even though it is better than it was, adding 1.5 percent of the GDP growth would help our economy grow in a robust way. We are told by McKinsey & Company's study that a 6-year transportation plan robustly funded would put about 1.8 million people to work. A lot of folks would like to be building roads, highways, and transportation systems, and they don't have employment opportunities because we are not funding them. We are not funding them. Let's take a quick look at this map if we could. The States that are gray are States, as far as we know, that are not planning to delay or cancel projects. They are not even considering delaying projects, but the States that are in red, including Delaware over here, are States that have delayed or cancelled projects. The States that are in yellow, including West Virginia, are States that are considering project delays. That is not good. I have not counted the number of States--it looks like seven--that are in red. Those are the States that have delayed projects. More than that, probably 10, are considering doing that. Why is it important for us to fully fund at the Federal level--do our share for roads, highways, bridges, transit funding? It is because about half of the money that our States spend through their departments of transportation, half their money comes from Federal user fees--largely Federal user fees--primarily, not entirely, but primarily user fees on the sale of gasoline. It has been unchanged in 23 years--not since 1993--22 years. The user fee on diesel has been unchanged for some 22 years, right where we were. The price of everything else goes up. Concrete goes up, asphalt goes up, steel goes up, and labor goes up. We have more energy-efficient vehicles. They are not using as much gas or [[Page S6927]] diesel. That is a good thing, but it is also a bad thing for having funding for transportation projects. So I want to look at a map and would invite all of us to consider it. I don't anybody who says--any economist worth their salt--who does not say: Fully funding a multi- year transportation plan, not for 6 months or 3 months, something like that, but fully funding it--robustly funding it for 6 years--will do great things for our economy. The reason we end up with job growth of something like 1.8 million people, according to McKinsey and Company, is because the economy works far more efficiently if roads, highways, bridges are operating and working well. So I just want to share that and start off my remarks today. I have some numbers here that I would like to share. So far in 2015, this year, four States--Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee, and Wyoming--have shelved some $805 million in projects due to the uncertainty over Federal funds. Again, the uncertainty is over roughly half the money that they are going to spend on roads, highways, and bridges. It comes from Federal user fees, Federal taxes. Our transportation system--at least the way we fund it--has been broken since 2008. Since that time, in the last 5 or 6 years, we have passed I think 12 short-term patches to the tune of nearly $74 billion. How do we pay for them? We pay for them with budget gimmicks. That is how we do it. And we pay for them with debt. When we issue debt, we borrow money. We sell Treasury securities, and we sell them around the world. Among the countries that buy them are China and the Chinese people. We are then beholden to them as our creditors. It puts us in a situation that I do not find too comfortable. My guess is some of you don't either. There are better alternatives to fund our Nation's transportation system. I only mentioned a couple of them. I feel as if I have not a magic wand but the ability to see into the future. Twenty years from now, I think there is a pretty good chance that we will have figured out how to pay for roads, highways, bridges, and transit systems by figuring out how to make sure those folks who use transportation pay for it. One of the ways we are trying to do that--they have been trying to do that in Oregon for almost 10 years. They have something called road user charge. Some people have heard of that term. More people have heard of something called vehicle miles traveled, and the ability to say your vehicle--I don't care what kind of vehicle it is, but we know how many miles that vehicle travels on a road, highway or bridge in the course of a year. There is fee that is attached to that. Some people are uncomfortable with that because it has implications on privacy. I can understand that. In Oregon they are trying to figure it out. They have got about 5,000 vehicles--at least--in their system. They are sort of--I like to say States are laboratories of democracy. In this case, Oregon is trying to be the laboratory. I believe California is looking at being another laboratory to figure out we make something like vehicle miles traveled work in a State. Oregon is good-sized state, and California is a very big State. If they can do that, then we will learn from them, not just at the State level but perhaps at the Federal level as well. I think we will be funding projects--not just now but in the future, 20 years from now--through tooling. When I travel back to my native State of West Virginia, I go through West Virginia and I pay tolls. When I was a little kid and they first built the turnpike, we would have to stop and find change--whatever--stop every 5 or 10 miles. You don't do that anymore. We don't do that anymore in Delaware either, because we have--in Delaware and I think in West Virginia--highway- speed E-ZPass. It is an express E-ZPass. You go through, and it is charged to your credit card that you have already established when you establish your E-ZPass plan. Also, we now have the technology that even if folks don't have an E- ZPass--in some tolling operations around the country, a person drives through in their vehicle, car, truck, van, whatever the system--when you go through the toll plaza, they don't collect a toll. They have a highly accurate camera with the ability to take pictures of the vehicle and great pictures of your license plates, and then they send a bill to the owner of that vehicle. So you don't even have to have high-speed E- ZPass. But a combination of those two, systems like E-ZPass and systems like the one I just described where people drive through with no E- ZPass or a similar system, but they actually get billed for it later on. They do not get billed and fined; they just get billed for it. If you don't pay it, then I am sure something will happen. But I think 20 years from now we will have something that looks a lot like that. My guess is we will also have user fees, but not everybody likes tolling. As it turns out, Oregon has been working on road user charge, also known as vehicle miles traveled. They have been working on it for 10 years, and they have got 5,000 people in the plan. So this is not going to happen in 5 years or 10 years, but maybe 20 years for both a combination of tolling and vehicle miles traveled. There is another idea out there that is used in some places around the country. It is called 3P or P3. When I first heard that, I thought they were talking about P-3 airplanes. I spent a lot of years of my life as a naval flight officer in P-3 aircraft. I used to command them, but they were not talking about airplanes when they were talking about P3. They were talking about public-private partnerships. We have some pretty good examples of where that is working. We can learn from those in different States. I think that can be part of the future. It ought to be. Put the three of them together, is that a comprehensive plan? Not entirely, but it is pretty good approach. It is a heck of a lot better than what we have been doing: pension smoothing, increasing fees for TSA. Instead of improving aviation safety, we put the money in the transportation trust fund. Raising Customs fees--instead of putting the money in ways to make our borders most robust and so forth, we put some of that money in the transportation trust fund. We sell oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve--I think probably at a bad time to sell it, when the price is really low. They say: Buy low, sell high. Well, if we are going to sell petroleum out of the petroleum reserve--the price of oil is about as low right now as it has been in a long, long time. I am told that--I don't know if it was last week or the week before-- there are 10,000 gasoline stations across the country where they are selling gasoline for less than $2 a gallon. I don't know what they are charging in West Virginia, but I filled up my Chrysler Town and Country minivan, which has 403,000 miles on it, and I paid $2.15 a gallon. There are some places in Delaware where people are paying less and in neighboring New Jersey where they are paying less. But right now, it does not make much sense to sell oil out of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. There are some people who want to and who want to use that money to go into the transportation trust fund. I think that is foolish. We have to be smarter than that. I have another chart I want us to take a look at. I want to thank ``Vanna White'' here for putting up these charts. I will pay for that later. This chart talks about legislation--it is kind of ironic. That is S. 1994. I mentioned earlier how the last time we raised the Federal gasoline and diesel tax or fee was in 1993 when we raised it to 18 cents for gas and about 23, 24 cents for diesel. They have been there for 22 years. One of the things I have done is introduce legislation, and I have done so with Dick Durbin, who used to serve on the Bowles-Simpson Commission--remember the Bowles-Simpson Commission. I thought it was a great approach to figure out how to seriously address our Nation's deficit in a variety of ways. One of the ways that Bowles-Simpson said we should address our deficit situation--I will say our budget deficits are down--topped out, I think, in 2009 at $1.4 trillion. This year we are down about $400 billion. Is that an improvement? Yes, it is. Do we have some ways to go? We sure do. What Bowles-Simpson suggested is that we raise the gas or diesel tax at the Federal level by a penny each quarter, a penny every 3 months for 15 quarters. So effectively you would be raising the gas or diesel tax by 3 or 4 cents a year for 4 years and index it going forward. [[Page S6928]] What Senator Durbin and I have introduced is actually something quite similar to that, which a majority of the Bowles-Simpson Commission voted for. It is called the Traffic Relief Act. What it calls for is an annual 4 cent gas increase in gas and diesel. That would be for a total of about 4 years--4 cents a year for 4 years. After that, we would index those user fees, those taxes, to the rate of inflation. The rate of inflation is pretty low lately, so they would not go up very much if the rate of inflation stays where it is. If the rate of inflation rears its head again, then that would be different. A fellow who was a member of my staff back in Wilmington, DE--when we introduced this bill, the price for gas at a station in the neighborhood where his family buys gas--in the space of 2 days, the price of gas either went up or went down by 13 cents. It went up in 2 days, 13 cents. As we know, the price of oil moves up and down all of the time. My own belief is--and I have heard this from a lot of people--there are a lot of days or a lot of weeks where the price of gas or diesel goes up a lot more than 4 cents. Right now our world is not literally awash in oil but certainly figuratively awash in oil. One of the reasons the price at the pump for gas and diesel is so low--as I said earlier, a couple of weeks ago there were 10,000 gas stations across the country selling gas for less than two bucks a gallon. One of the reasons it is so low is because the United States is producing a lot more than we have for some time, and so are a bunch of other countries, including the OPEC nations. With the approval of the Iran agreement, as the Iranians comply with the agreement--my hope is that they will comply in spirit and in letter, and then as a result of that, they will be in a position to begin selling. They have only been selling some of their oil products to customers, including I think India, maybe Japan, China, but they will be able to sell more products. A world that is already awash in oil is going to find that Iran, which I think has the fourth greatest oil reserves in the world, is going to be back in the market and selling their own products. I believe that will keep the prices from rising anytime soon. And I think there is reason to believe that the price at the pump, which is already quite low, might even go down further. Time will tell. I have one last poster board here I wish to look at for just a moment. Our legislation--this is a typo here. It says that it restores $240 billion for the highway trust fund. It is not $240 billion, it is $220 billion. Still, compared to what? Compared to nothing. Compared to doing nothing, it is a whole lot. If we had a status quo, any kind of a status quo increase--a highway bill or a transportation bill--we would use maybe half of that. So what we are talking about is double, just getting by, And we have such a backlog of work to do, that it doesn't make sense just to push enough money to these projects to get by. This would provide roughly twice that amount of money and would maybe not raise our GDP by 1.5 percent, but it would sure raise it. It may not put 1.8 million people to work over the next year, but it would put a lot of people to work and people who like to do these jobs. The money would fully fund the Federal highway and transit programs in our country. It would increase investments in upgrades and in repairs as well. It would do it in a way that doesn't drop a huge burden on users of these products--gasoline and diesel--all in one fell swoop. It is like 4 cents a year over 4 years. After 4 years, there will be a 16-cent increase. People say: Well, what is that in terms of practical impact? What does that actually mean for somebody? I am told that it is actually--I don't drink a lot of coffee, but my friends who do get a small coffee over in the Dirksen Building across the street. They pay $1.70, and if they get a medium-sized coffee, it is like $2.50, and a really big one is maybe a little bit over $3. This is not really fancy coffee but just a regular cup of coffee with cream and sugar, and the price is maybe $2 or $3. Literally for the price of a cup of coffee a week, for those of us who use roads, highways, bridges, who buy gas, who buy diesel, we could have a much better transportation system. This isn't $10 a week or $20 a week or $30 a week. That increase over 4 years--4 cents a year for 4 years--without the data for the average driver, that is about a cup of coffee a week. Is that too much to pay for roads, highways, bridges, and a good transit system? I don't think so. There is an interest in offsetting some of these increases with a regressive tax, but there is an interest in offsetting some of that by making some tweaks like Michigan is going to do with their State earned-income tax credit with a Republican Governor and Republican legislature. I think there is maybe a lesson or something we can do there to help address the regressive nature of this tax. I close by saying I come to this floor from time to time and I mention one of the things I love to do. I don't know if you ever do this, Madam President, but I love to ask people who have been married a long time ``What is the secret for being married for a long time?'' I have done it for years. I have asked this question of hundreds of people who are older folks who have been married 30 years, 40 years, 50 years, 60 years, 70 years. I ask them ``What is the secret?'' I get hilarious answers. I get some that are very poignant and others are just plain memorable for a lot of reasons. But the best answer I have ever gotten is there are two C's. What are the two C's? Communicate and compromise. That is not only the secret for a vibrant marriage between two people, it is also the secret for a vibrant democracy, to communicate and compromise. I would add a third C, and that is to collaborate. What the American people said to us last November--whether they are Republicans, Democrats, or Independents--is that they want us to communicate, they want us to compromise, and they want us to collaborate, and we need to do that. One idea I have not mentioned here bears mentioning. It was an idea that was endorsed last year by the administration and was endorsed last year by the immediate past chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, with whom our President served, Dave Camp. He retired earlier this year as a Congressman from Michigan, a very good person. What they proposed is international tax reform. What both Chairman Camp at the time and the administration said is that there are about $2 trillion in overseas profits of American companies. They are just keeping it over there and they are not that anxious to bring it back because they don't want to have to pay--I don't know--35 percent, 33 percent, 32 percent, 29 percent. They are looking for a lower tax break and then to bring it back when it makes sense. The administration and Dave Camp said: Let's deem it repatriated. The Treasury said: All right. You have money over there, American companies. Bring it back. It is going to be taxed at about 10 percent. That was the proposal. The administration said: American companies that have money over there, we want you to bring it back. You won't be taxed at 35 percent or 25 percent, but you will be taxed at about 14 percent. That is an idea, and it is an interesting idea. It doesn't solve the problem forever. It provides one-time money--quite a bit of it--for roads, bridges, rail, and for airports as well. It doesn't solve the problem permanently, but it surely gives us a lot of money. Not every company likes that idea, and not everybody who serves here likes that idea, but it is a serious idea, and it is one that deserves a lot of consideration, and I hope we will do that. Let me just say this. At the end of the day, if we come to the end of this calendar year--when we run out of money yet again for roads, highways, and bridges and we say ``Well, what are we going to do now?''--we will have not just the States I pointed out here in yellow and red that are bailing on projects, delaying and stopping them in some cases, we will have a lot more yellow and a whole lot more red on the map I had up earlier. What do we do about it? Do we just do what we have done for 5 years and kick the can down the road yet again and look for cats and dogs and wherever we can find a few bucks and sort of throw them at the problem for a while, not make a real committed effort? Frankly, we are not giving the voters in this country any reason to feel encouraged about our courage. I hope we don't do that. [[Page S6929]] If at the end of the day we don't do some kind of international tax reform, good ideas such as expanding tolling, vehicle miles traveled, and public-private partnerships--those are all good ideas, and I hope we grow them all. We are not going to have them all in place in the kind of scope we need by the end of this year. If we find ourselves at a time and place where we run out of money, where the States are looking to us and we are running out of money at the Federal level--and the price of gas is two bucks a gallon at gas stations across America--my hope is people will say: You know, for the price of a cup of coffee, I could have good roads, highways, bridges, and transit systems again. For the price of a cup of coffee a week, I could have that. Forty cents a week, maybe. Maybe that is not a bad deal for their family or for our country. I want people to think about that. In the weeks to come, I am going to be talking a lot about this proposal. My hope is that as time goes buy, people will say--like my dad used to say in West Virginia when my sister and I were little kids growing up and they were in West Virginia--my dad used to say to my sister and me after we had done yet another boneheaded stunt: Just use some common sense. He said that a lot. He did not say it that nicely. But I think this may be an opportunity for us to use some of that common sense here, and I know he would approve, and at the end of the day, so would the voters of America. There are a number of States that have actually done what I am talking about. They have raised their user fees, and in some cases they have phased them in over a couple of years. It is interesting what happened in the elections last year where the State legislators had voted to do that, where they raised the user fees in order to would pay for roads, highways, and bridges. Interestingly enough, the legislators who voted for that--Republicans--didn't get thrown out of office. Ninety-five percent of them were reelected. They won their primaries, they won their general elections, and they were reelected. The Democrats who voted for those modest user fees increases didn't get thrown out of office either. In the States that raised the money locally to make the improvements that were needed in transportation, 90 percent of the Democrats won their primaries and they won their general elections. They were reelected. People want us to make hard choices here. They don't want us to continue to kid them or fool them; they want us to do the real thing. They want us to work together. They want us to get things done. They want us to strengthen our economic recovery, and this is not a bad way to do that. With that, I see a great American from New Mexico has joined us. He is somebody who has worked with the Senator from Louisiana and the Senator who was just here before, Mr. Inhofe, the chairman of the EPW Committee, to try to find a good way for us to strengthen the economic recovery and at the same time to further clean our air, promote public health, and do good things for our public environment. I wish to say to Tom Udall how proud I am to be his colleague and how much I appreciate his leadership position on a very important issue, an environmental law that hasn't been updated in almost 40 years and, frankly, doesn't work. It has never worked, and we need to do something about it. Under his leadership, along with our other two colleagues, my hope is that we will. I look forward to what he has to say. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico. TSCA Mr. UDALL. Madam President, thank you very much for the recognition. I wish to say to Senator Carper about TSCA that we have been working on--you were one of the early Senators who really cared about this issue. You were involved with it, and you helped it develop. Over time, we did a marvelous thing in terms of improving what Senator Frank Lautenberg had put on the table, bipartisan--he developed a lot of Republican and Democratic support--and you were a key player all the way through. So we know--we think at this point, you and I believe--and we do a lot of visiting around on both sides of the aisle--that this is ready to go. We now have I think 53 cosponsors. We are developing more cosponsors every day, and we don't think there is any real hostility toward the bill in terms of wanting amendments that aren't relevant. That is a key factor for us, and both sides need to focus on that. I would like to express my appreciation to you for what you have done on TSCA to help blend it into and make it into a bipartisan product. We have been trying--you know, it has been very busy with the Pope in town, with the sequester facing us and the shutdown and things such as that. We have been trying to get onto the floor to talk about this, and I think we are going to continue to do that in the future. But it is tremendously important that this gets some floor time now, and I know you have been working on that with me. Do you see this as a product that is better than current law? I mean, my sense is it is much better than the current law. Mr. CARPER. If I could respond to my friend, I have a friend who-- when you ask him ``How are you doing?'' he says ``Compared to what?'' And when we talk about the legislation initially introduced by Senator Lautenberg, Senator Vitter, and now coauthored by you, Senator Vitter, and Senator Inhofe, with input from a number of us, I always say: Well, compared to what? The idea here is to ensure that the EPA does its due diligence on toxic substances in this country. And there are thousands or tens of thousands of chemicals--you know better than I do--that exist in our environment--in our air, our ground, in water--tens of thousands. Are they all toxic? No. But my recollection--correct me if I am wrong in this, but I think that out of those thousands, tens of thousands, I believe the EPA in the last 38 years has actually done their due diligence on really fewer than 200, maybe even fewer than 10 when you get down to it, maybe even just 5. And you say: How long has this bill been around, this law been around? Thirty-eight years. And they have now finished work on five highly toxic substances? If we can't do better than that, we ought to quit, and this is not the time to quit. It is sort of like football. You take the kickoff, and you are in your own territory and you start marching down the field. You get into the other team's territory, get down to the 20-yard line, and you are in the red zone--not in the end zone, but you are in the red zone. I think with your leadership and that of our colleagues, we are in the red zone. We need to bring this onto the floor with 53 cosponsors equally divided between Democrats and Republicans. There is a lot of interest in the House, and I think there is support from the administration. We ought to get this done. Thank you. Mr. UDALL. Madam President, it bears repeating. Senator Carper is very modest, and he is a humble man, but he has done a lot to help bring us to this point. I think he is one of the Senators here who work the best across the aisle, and that is what has happened. We have had a lot of Senators who have wanted to work across the aisle on this bill. As Senator Carper knows, on the Environment and Public Works Committee, he was joined by Senator Booker, Senator Whitehouse, and Senator Merkley in terms of helping to mark up the bill and make it a better product. When the Senator talks about going across the finish line, with 53 cosponsors about evenly divided between Democrat and Republican--I think it is almost exactly even--that sends a signal to our majority leader that this has tremendous support in both caucuses. I believe the Presiding Officer here is on the bill. So everybody standing on the Senate floor right now is on what is a good, bipartisan product. So we are going to work very carefully in the next couple of days to see that attention is brought to this, and hopefully we will have an opportunity to have a debate with amendments and then meet with the House. The House, as Senator Carper knows, has already passed a piece of legislation, I think 378 to 1--1 person in the House opposing it. So we have a bill that is alive and ready to go, and we need to get it out [[Page S6930]] of the Senate so we can conference it with the House and get it to the President's desk for his signature. I don't know if the Senator has any other thoughts on what is the best way to move forward. I mean, obviously we have to be bipartisan, but at this particular point, is it the Senator's sense we are ready to go, from everything he has seen from the Environment and Public Works Committee and these other Senators in various places? Is it ready to go? Mr. CARPER. If I may respond to my colleague's question, I don't care if the majority leader is a Republican or a Democrat--they are always trying to figure out how do we have time on the calendar to get this stuff done. They are always looking at ways. And one of the best ways to ensure legislation actually fits into a reasonably small period of time is to line up bipartisan support. I tell my colleague, I have been here in the Senate for a while, and this is almost a picture-book way to pass legislation: Work it up through the grassroots--Democratic Lautenberg and Republican Vitter and now with your role and others. There are not many bills in the Senate that have 26 or 27 Democrats and an equal number of Republicans. Has everything been worked out? No. Is there a need for amendments? Yes. Is there a need for a filibuster? No. We should bring it to the floor. I think we should go to the majority leader and visit with him early and often and continue to remind him. And those who believe in this, whether they happen to be on the environmental side or happen to be folks in the health care arena or maybe on the manufacturing side--and we thank those who have helped us draft this--we ask for them not to be silent about it but to urge not just us but the leadership to find time--a couple of days--to bring this bill to the floor and just get it done. With that, I say to my colleague and the Presiding Officer, if I put down my microphone and pack up my bag, I can have dinner with my wife in the First State of Delaware, and that is my goal. So I will bid you adieu. Mr. UDALL. I thank the Senator. I wish you Godspeed on that train headed to Wilmington because you have a wonderful wife. Mr. CARPER. Well, it is not the last train to Clarksville, but it is the next train to Wilmington. Mr. UDALL. And let me say again that not only on TSCA, as Senator Carper held, we were going to have speeches earlier in the week, but we were unable, with some of the scheduling issues and everything, to get down here and talk as a group. We had Senator Whitehouse, who was going to come down, and Senator Merkley was going to come down, as well as several of the key members of the Environment and Public Works Committee who played such a big role in terms of moving this bill forward. The person who really kicked this off was Senator Frank Lautenberg. What a star in terms of bipartisanship. I remember working with him when I was on the Environment and Public Works Committee for a long period of time on a very substantive piece of legislation. It was so good, we couldn't find much bipartisanship on it, and he understood that. It got out of the committee. It wasn't ready for prime time here on the floor, and so what we ended up doing was saying we need to go back to square one. Senator Lautenberg took that very seriously. He met with Senator Vitter. Senator Manchin played a role in that, and Senator Manchin was one of the ones who were going to come to the floor to talk, and he played a role in getting them together. As a result, a bipartisan bill came out in the last Congress. That has continued now for almost 2\1/2\ years, and it is a very good product. Madam President, the American people want a government that works, not one that shuts down to send a message. They want a Congress that moves the Nation forward, not one that grinds to a halt. They want a responsible budget that supports working families and strengthens our economy and creates jobs. These should be our priorities, not an attack on women's health care. I understand some people have strong views about a woman's right to choose that are different from mine. There are strong differences of opinion on many important issues in this Senate and in the Congress-- health care, energy, climate change, foreign policy. We could make a very long list. I read an insightful quote the other day from my good friend Republican Senator Lamar Alexander. Senator Alexander said: ``If we had a shutdown every time we had a dispute over a contentious issue, the government would never open.'' I think that is a very wise observation. We do have many differences, but, most importantly, we must have the broader national interest in mind. The clock is ticking. Funding runs out in just a few days. We need a clean continuing resolution, and we need it now--a temporary funding bill just to keep the lights on. Have we forgotten what happened 2 years ago? The people of my home State of New Mexico have not forgotten. We were badly hurt by the shutdown then, and we would be badly hurt by a shutdown now. In Los Alamos and Sandia, our two DOE labs are working on modernizing aging nuclear weapons systems to keep them safe and secure. It is foolish to cause unnecessary disruption to projects of this significance where there is no margin for error. Each of these labs employs thousands of people, many of them scientists at the top of their field. Why would we threaten their paychecks and the important national security work they are doing? We have three Air Force bases in New Mexico--Cannon, Kirtland, and Holloman--all serving a variety of unique national security missions for our country. White Sands Missile Range, unlike any facility in the country, provides critical research and testing for future technologies. Shutdowns and sequestration send a terrible message to the men and women at these facilities. It limits their effectiveness and harms the economies in nearby communities, such as Clovis, Albuquerque, Alamogordo, and Dona Ana County. Shutdowns mean lost jobs and lost revenue, all in the face of a struggling economy. We cannot afford another government shutdown, and we cannot afford a return to sequester cuts. These are bad choices. These are self-inflicted wounds. A clean CR will keep the government open, but we need a long-term cure. We need a bipartisan budget agreement--one that makes smart investments and meets the real needs of American families. The people of my State work hard. Many are still struggling. The economy of New Mexico has not yet recovered completely from the recession. We know New Mexicans want us to come together and push for a stronger recovery. New Mexicans are eager for solutions, and they are tired of these political games that threaten jobs and weaken our economy. Yet here we are once again facing a manufactured crisis. We all know that in fiscal year 2016, which begins next week, the Murray-Ryan budget deal will expire and we will be left with a return to sequestration. As ranking member of the interior subcommittee on the Committee on Appropriations, I would like to talk about that today because the impacts of the funding levels required by the Budget Control Act are clear and they are very destructive. Just look at the Senate Interior appropriations bill reported out of the committee in June. To stay within the spending limits we faced under sequestration, it slashes more than $2 billion from the President's budget request. That means it doesn't provide enough funding for basic water infrastructure or to protect our public lands or to fulfill our trust responsibility to American Indians and Alaska Natives. I know my chairman, Senator Murkowski, did the very best she could with the allocation she was given, but here is the reality: The Budget Control Act caps don't meet the needs of our Nation. They fail critical programs. They fail our communities in New Mexico and nationwide. Our Nation faces an infrastructure crisis. Yet the Senate bill cuts grants to States for water and sewer infrastructure by more than $500 million below fiscal year 2015 levels. Actions have consequences, and here are the consequences of the Senate bill: Some 230 communities will not have their water projects funded, 14,000 construction jobs will not be created, and [[Page S6931]] $1 billion in matching and leveraged funds from State partners will be lost. The Senate bill also shortchanges the National Park Service with $318 million less than the President requested. That means 1,000 fewer park rangers. That means $150 million less to maintain our national parks even though the Service will celebrate its centennial in 2016 and will host a record number of visitors at national parks nationwide. We have 15 national parks in New Mexico, including our newest national park, the Valles Caldera National Preserve. These parks and other public lands in my State are critical not only for conservation but for our economy. A shutdown would be a disaster; sequestration is just a slower moving disaster. Carlsbad Caverns National Park, Bandelier National Monument, Tent Rocks National Monument, Bosque Del Apache Wildlife Refuge, and many other sites are key economic assets. These sites help grow jobs, they help communities grow, and they are great conservation assets in communities across the country. We cannot keep asking them to do more and more on less. Yet, without a sensible budget, that is exactly where we are headed in New Mexico and across the Nation. The Senate Interior appropriations bill also cuts more than $300 million from the President's request for the Indian Health Service. We have a solemn trust responsibility to Native Americans, and we are failing. Again, these are not just numbers. The impact is very real and very painful. It means the Indian Health Service will fund 20,000 fewer doctor visits in 2016 and nearly 1,000 fewer hospital stays. It means falling further behind. We need a responsible budget to meet our obligation to the Indian Health Service and other tribal programs, such as housing, school construction, Indian education. All of those are being hurt by this sequestration budget. We cannot continue being shortsighted. We can't keep shortchanging programs that make a real difference in the lives of all Americans. This includes art and cultural programs, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and funding for our national forests and wildlife refuges. And the list goes on and on. The time is now, and we are running out of time. We are on the wrong train, on the wrong track, and going nowhere. Fortunately, there is a solution. Let's pass a clean CR, and let's work together to pass a budget that actually meets the needs of our Nation, with sensible funding levels for defense and nondefense programs alike. Before I wrap up my remarks, I wish to call attention to another deadline that is fast approaching. The authorization for the Land and Water Conservation Fund will expire on September 30 if this Congress doesn't act. Recently, I was one of 53 Members who called on the leadership of this Chamber to pass an extension of the law, and I want to reiterate that call today. The Land and Water Conservation Fund just celebrated its 50th birthday. It enjoys strong bipartisan support because the idea behind it is so simple and so powerful. When this Nation develops one natural resource--our oil and gas reserves--we invest some of the proceeds in other critical conservation priorities. For five decades now, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has protected our national parks, forests, and other public lands. It helps ensure hunting, fishing, and recreational access, and it improves and expands our local parks and recreation facilities. The program has been a tremendous success and has had a tremendous impact on my State, from urban refuges--such as the Valle de Oro--to wide open preserves such as the Valles Caldera. It provides crucial funding to preserve open spaces, strengthen the economy, and enhance our way of life. LWCF allows us to leverage today's resources to protect vital lands and waters for future generations. Allowing the law to expire breaks that compact. It doesn't make any sense, and it doesn't have to happen. We shouldn't let the Land and Water Conservation Fund expire, even for a single day. I call on this Chamber to act swiftly to permanently authorize this important program and ensure that it is fully funded. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, those of us who believe in protecting innocent and precious life may have lost a vote today, but we are steadily winning a larger argument--a critical argument that goes to the heart of who we want to be as a society. We can feel momentum for life on the rise just as we see extremism on the other side increasing. By placing their allegiance with the far left instead of women, Democrats are making a losing bet they will come to regret over the long term. Today, however, we must grapple with the challenges of the present. Democrats' insistence on blocking the strategy pursued today means we have to consider the options now before us. The reality is that the government will shut down next week if Congress does not act. The president of Right to Life said to those of us who believe in protecting life: There are two different roads we can take. One is to insist that no more money go to Planned Parenthood and cause a government shutdown (which won't result in actually defunding Planned Parenthood). The other is to take a slightly longer- term approach, taking advantage of the fact that we have the attention of the country as probably never before. . . . Every well-informed pro-lifer wants to defund Planned Parenthood. I want to defund Planned Parenthood. There are wonderful pro-life men and women in Congress who want to defund Planned Parenthood. And, certainly National Right to Life wants to defund Planned Parenthood. The difference here is in strategy. This is not the end of this debate or this discussion. I urge colleagues to join me in supporting the legislation I am about to file which would ensure that the government remains open. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Elder Richard G. Scott, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who passed away September 22, 2015, at the age of 86. Richard G. Scott had the razor-sharp mind of an engineer, fused with the tender softness of a disciple's soul. A graduate of George Washington University in mechanical engineering, who did post-graduate training in nuclear engineering, he had a brilliant mind with an uncanny capacity for formulas, projections, and calculations. Yet he became known throughout the world for an enormous heart with an equally uncanny capacity to love and to have empathy for people from every walk of life. Elder Scott's gentle voice invited all who had lost their way, who had given up hope or had wandered far to come home, home to the faith, family, and community that would bring them real peace and lasting, genuine joy. Countless individuals around the world heard his invitation to come home and rightly felt that he was talking directly to them. Ever in search of the one who was lost--Elder Scott's words and witness of Jesus Christ served as the lower lights upon the shore to gently guide many a wanderer home. Elder Scott had an extraordinary depth of empathy, particularly for those who silently suffered and anxiously sought for relief, redemption, and renewal in the midst of life's storms. He, himself, was a man acquainted with grief, having lost two young children and later his wife Jeanene to untimely deaths. He also seemed to intimately understand the feelings of deep discouragement, overwhelming uncertainty, as well as the crushing avalanche of personal inadequacy that can descend upon the human soul during difficult days and trying times. Yet he continually stood as a beacon of hope to those who struggled because he knew with an absolute certainty to what source we should look for strength and security during such days and at such times. His complete love for and belief in the divine potential of each and every soul led him to speak plainly, powerfully, and often with tender, heartfelt, personal feelings. He urged the struggling as well as the faithful to cast aside any behavior, habit or belief that weighed them down or kept them from living up to their full potential. Members of the LDS Church all around the world often felt, as they watched him speak, that he was not only speaking specifically to them but also that he was looking straight into their souls. In truth, he was just speaking with such love, empathy, and genuine compassion that he empowered his listeners to look into their own hearts and see what their Savior saw in them. Elder Scott saw people not for where they were currently positioned on the road of life but for the potential each person had to do, be, and become more. He once declared: ``We become what we want to be by consistently being what we want to become each day.'' Elder Scott's vision extended far beyond the struggles of mortality; he focused on raising our sights to higher things, grander places, and more noble thoughts. [[Page S6911]] The role of the family as the bulwark of society was paramount in his life and teachings. Elder Scott often expressed his belief in the unparalleled power and influence that a man and a woman, equally yoked as husband and wife, could have on children and communities. He taught that in marriage oneness is not sameness and of the vital importance of valuing our differences. To illustrate, he once declared: ``I may not know what it means to be a woman, but I do know what it means to be taught by one and to love one with all my heart and all my soul.'' His love for his wife Jeanene was legendary and was forever sprinkled into his sermons. I take comfort in knowing that after nearly 20 years, Elder Scott has gone to that Heavenly home he so often pointed to and is once again united with Jeanene. One of Elder Scott's colleagues described him as a clever teacher. His formula for teaching was not of the engineering variety but rather followed a pattern described in a hymn by Lorin Wheelwright entitled ``Help Me Teach with Inspiration,'' which says: Help me teach with inspiration; Grant this blessing, Lord, I pray. Help me lift a soul's ambition To a higher, nobler way. Help me reach a friend in darkness; Help me guide him thru the night. Help me show thy path to glory By the Spirit's holy light. Help me find thy lambs who wander; Help me bring them to thy keep. Teach me, Lord, to be a shepherd; Father, help me feed thy sheep. Elder Richard G. Scott was indeed an inspired teacher, a leader, and lifter of people. His amazing mind and compassionate soul enabled him to help engineer a path for all of us to return home. Mr. FLAKE. Will the Senator yield? Mr. LEE. I yield to the Senator. Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I just wish to second what has been said about Elder Scott and appreciate the Senator from Arizona--or Utah, taking the time to say it. One of my fondest memories of being in Congress was at one point showing Elder Scott around a bit of the Capitol. He knew it well. He had been here before, but it was my privilege and honor to be with him at that time. It has been my privilege and honor over many years to hear him at general conference and other venues exhorting people to follow the example of Christ and to love their families, love their wives. To see him pass now after such dedicated service for so long, it is truly wonderful for him to be reunited with his wife and for his family to reflect on a life of service. I thank the Senator for his comments and wished to add my own. I yield back. Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from Arizona for his kind remarks regarding Elder Scott. I would also remark, just briefly, that my late father, himself an Arizonan, would be pleased to hear me referred to as a Senator from Arizona, given that I was born there. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I think many of us today have been struck with a serious case of deja vu because once again, with a government shutdown looming, some Republicans continue to pander to their base with a political show vote instead of working with Democrats to prevent a budget crisis. Once again, it is women's health that is being used as a tea party political football, with Republicans attempting to cut off women's access to care, and once again workers and families across our country are watching Congress and wondering whether their elected officials can do the absolute bare minimum. The government shutdown that Republicans pushed us into in 2013 did nothing to help them repeal the Affordable Care Act, but it did have real consequences for families and communities we represent. Workers didn't know when they would get their next paycheck. Businesses felt the sting of fewer customers. Families across the country lost even more trust that elected officials in Washington, DC, could get anything done. In my home State of Washington, thousands of employees at Joint Base Lewis-McChord were sent home with no return in sight. Startups couldn't get small business loans, national parks such as Mount Rainier shut down. It kept families away from true national treasures and customers away from small businesses that rely on their tourism. After all of that, I had hoped Republicans would learn their lesson, especially because once that economy-rattling exercise in futility came to an end, I was proud to work with the Republican budget chairman, Paul Ryan, to do what we shouldn't have needed a shutdown to get done-- negotiate a 2-year bipartisan deal that prevented another government shutdown. It restored critical investments in priorities such as education, research, and defense jobs and showed our families that government can get something done when both sides are willing to come to the table and compromise. That deal was an important reminder that governing by crisis simply does not work. Unfortunately, now it seems that some of my Republican colleagues have forgotten that, because instead of working across the aisle on another bipartisan budget deal, as Democrats have pushed them to do for months, some Republicans are once again using a looming fiscal deadline as an opportunity to pander to their base, no matter what that means for our workers and families who are wondering whether government will still be running in a few days. Since they clearly need another reminder, attacking women's health does not keep the government open and these shutdown threats will not work. It didn't work in 2011, when House Republicans tried to defund Planned Parenthood in the budget at the very last minute. It didn't work in 2013, when extreme Members of the GOP were dead set on repealing ObamaCare, and they will not work today. I am going to be proud to vote against this partisan attempt to defund Planned Parenthood and take critical health care services away from millions of people. Then I hope that finally Republicans will remember what they should have learned last Congress: accept that enough is enough and make sure that women, workers, families, and our economy are protected from a completely unnecessary crisis. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Wasteful Spending Mr. COATS. Mr. President, since February I have been coming to the Senate floor every week to talk about the waste of the week. Back in 2010, when I made the decision to answer a call to run for the Senate again, one of the primary reasons for my decision to go forward was my alarm over the plunge into debt and rising deficit that was taking place. At the time, the national debt of this country was a little over $10 trillion. It is alarming to note that as I stand here 5 years later, our debt has nearly doubled. It's over $18 trillion in just the 5 years I have been here. There were alarm bells ringing in 2010, and those alarm bells were saying that we cannot stay on this course, that it is going to come back to haunt us someday, that it will affect our economy, that it will affect our credit rating. Someday the bill collector will be at the door of the taxpayer saying: You have to pay up big time or we are going to go into default. What took place going forward from that was a series of efforts--some of them very equally bipartisan by both Republicans and Democrats who were alarmed at where we were and wishing to come together to persuade the President to work with us and put us on a path toward fiscal responsibility. That work involved any number of proposals and iterations. We all remember the so-called Gang of 6, the Committee of 12, the Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction, and various others who had plans. It was the dominating issue of our time during the first couple of years of my return here in 2011 and 2012. After the election of 2012, when the President was reelected, at his own initiative he reached out to a few Republicans--I was one of them-- and said: I am willing to sit down and work together to deal with this. This is a [[Page S6912]] major issue affecting the future of our country, affecting our economy. I was encouraged that after the election and when no longer seeking any further office, the President would be willing to seriously work with us. We did serious work for several months. The President's top three appointees--the head of the Office of Management and Budget, his Chief of Staff, and his political director--met with eight of us on a regular basis, both here in the Capitol and at the White House. We had agreed we would not have any public meetings. We would not have staff. It would just be Members and the President's designated individuals. We did not broadcast what we were doing because we knew it would become public and then political and therefore perhaps end up with the same fate all the other efforts had resulted in. We got to the end of that, and in the end, even though we made an extraordinary number of concessions to the President, even though we essentially had put together a package of items he himself had suggested in his budget plans that we could accomplish in slowing down the growth of government, the spending, and the deficits every year that were rolling out and plunging us into debt, we came up short. At that point, it became very clear to me that we were not going to be able to achieve a long-term plan for putting us on the road to good fiscal health. So I thought: OK, I am hearing from a lot of colleagues here in the Senate but also from other outside sources saying that under sequester we just can't cut any more. We need more revenue to expand necessary spending projects in government. And while some essential functions that only government can do might need that type of attention, there is a range of things that you really have to question why they are on the books in the first place. A number of my colleagues--particularly former Senator Coburn--took this floor often--as I did, as well as others--to point out areas where not the Republican Party had decided, where not individuals representing our party had decided, but where nonpartisan agencies of the government--the General Accounting Office, the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of Management and Budget at the White House--had investigated and produced examples of spending that were either waste, fraud, or abuse, and had no legitimate qualification to stay on the books. So we started looking into this. Thanks to Senator Coburn and others, we have come up with a number of things we could easily take off the books, easily use to pay for essential things, easily use to reduce our deficit spending, keep from going into debt, return money to the taxpayers, or however we wanted to do it. So we started to accumulate that, and our goal was to reach $100 billion to simply defy the myth going around that there is not a penny we can cut and that we have done all we can do. So over the 20-some times I have been on this floor, we have come up with a number of issues which could save the taxpayer money and certainly need to be addressed. Our current total is now well over $100 billion, and today we are adding $10.5 billion to our $100 billion total. We are now at $116 billion. I said we would stop at $100 billion, but the examples keep rolling in, and so we are going to keep going every week. As long as this cycle of the Senate is in session, I will come to the floor and label yet another example of waste. Last month, when I was home in Indiana, coming down from northwest Indiana to our capital city of Indianapolis on Interstate 65 for the umpteenth time--as I drive from north to south or south to north on that road, I pass through wind farms of literally thousands of windmills. Interestingly enough, and as I observed even this time, many of them are not turning. There are windmills--a few of them turning-- driven by the wind, but most of them are not turning. We have thousands of these, and it looks as if fewer than 100 or a comparable number are operating, and so I am wondering why and whether the taxpayer is getting a good deal on this. I want to give a little bit of history of how all this came to be put in place. Back in the early 1990s--in fact, in 1992--the Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which included the renewable electricity production tax credit, called the PTC. The point was that as we looked at alternative ways to produce electricity to reduce our dependence on oil and fossil fuels, there was a tax credit created for those using windmills to create power. It was designed to be claimed if the wind farm was actually making the power. Earlier I said that many times I have come down that road and I have seen windmills that were idle. But the blades had to be turning and the electricity had to be being produced in order to receive that tax credit. At the time, because I thought we were overly dependent on Middle Eastern oil and that it was creating issues for us geopolitically and militarily and otherwise, I thought it would be good to have a stimulus here to support the creation of wind energy, to give us the ability to stand on our own and have less dependence on Middle Eastern oil. The main reason I supported it is because it was to start the process and incentivize diverse energy sources to get them off the ground. It was going to be a short-term boost to help these new energy sources become competitive. The original credit was designed under the law to last only 5\1/2\ years and then there would no longer be this credit. Well, like any other credit, subsidy, or anything else passed here which provides taxpayer support for production of something, it never expires. Few if any of them expire on the expiration date. So once again, once you get a law on the books, once you get a credit on the books, once you get a subsidy on the books, you can't get it off. Since the time the original bill passed, the wind industry and its supporters have repeatedly come to Congress and said: Just give us a few more years and then wind will be competitive, without taxpayer subsidies. As a result, this 5\1/2\-year program, which started in 1992, has been extended multiple times. In 2013, nearly two decades after the time the subsidies expired, Congress changed the rules so the facilities only have to begin construction before the expiration date to automatically qualify for a future 10-year subsidy, even before those windmills become operational. So if someone is just in the business of building windmills, as some of our major companies are, they are going to qualify for the subsidy. They are going to get the tax credit--whether or not the windmills are needed. They can just pour some concrete and start the building process, and they are going to qualify for the credit. The result is that more and more wind facilities are being constructed irrespective of the needs of the electricity grid or market demand. Just last year, Warren Buffett, who is a smart investor, noted that wind isn't profitable without subsidies. He said: For example, on wind energy, we get a tax credit if we build a lot of wind farms. That's the only reason to build them. They don't make sense without the tax credit. So regardless of the demand, regardless of whether or not those windmills need to be turning and generating electricity, regardless of whether or not that electricity can be put into the grid--and, by the way, the cost of wind energy is three to four times the cost of fossil fuel energy--regardless of any of that, the tax credit is there. In 2014 Congress retroactively extended the wind tax credit at the end of the year, and the general assumption here in Congress is that the production tax credit will once again be extended at the end of this year. That is probably going to happen. According to an estimate from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, if we continue and extend this tax credit, this will add another $10.5 billion to our budget. Clearly, it is way past time to end this seemingly never-ending subsidy. It is time to give the hardworking taxpayers savings, and it is time to stop wasteful spending. If we can prevent Congress from just automatically extending this way beyond the original 5\1/2\ years, decades beyond, we can save the taxpayers $10.5 billion. So today I am adding to this chart and picture here $10.5 billion, which now totals $116 billion-plus in terms of money that falls under the category of waste, fraud, and abuse. My colleagues cannot come down to this floor and say we can't cut a penny more of any program and defend the numerous--now [[Page S6913]] well more than 20--examples of what have been defined as waste, fraud, and abuse--not by me, not by the Republican Party, but by nonpartisan agencies of the Federal Government. There it is. Stay tuned for next week's ``Waste of the Week.'' I yield the floor. Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, it is time give it our best to move America forward and give Americans a fair shot. Let's show the American people that we can work across the aisle and across the dome to get the job done. Instead, here we are facing another shutdown showdown. There is no reason for there to be a government shutdown. Republican leadership does not want a shutdown. Democrats don't want a shutdown. There may be some drama, but we intend to keep the government open and avoid shutdown, slamdown politics. I hoped the Senate had learned its lesson in October 2013, when Republicans shut down government over the Affordable Care Act, or this February 2015, when Republicans threatened the Department of Homeland Security with shutdown over immigration policy. Senate Democrats won't be threatened and bullied into accepting poison pill riders. Serious policy issues like family planning and reproductive health deserve serious debate rather than becoming an ``add on'' rider to a funding bill. Shutdowns are bad for everyone, jeopardizing family checkbooks, business bottom lines, and the Federal checkbook. A shutdown makes it impossible for Federal agencies to meet missions that serve the American people. A shutdown means furloughed Federal employees and contractors; delayed tax returns; delayed small business loans; and delayed contracts. Uncertainty slows economic growth and hurts the health and well-being of the entire Nation. When the government was closed for 16 days in 2013, the shutdown hurt our growing economy, sacrificing 120,000 private sector jobs. Billions of dollars of economic output was lost. We lost 6.6 million work days, about 850,000 Federal employees were sent home. My home State was hit particularly hard. Maryland is home to many Federal agencies. It was not just the Federal workers that got hurt. The Baltimore Sun wrote about Jay Angle, the owner of Salsa Grill, a Peruvian restaurant in Woodlawn outside the Social Security Administration. Every day, 4,700 workers go to work at Social Security, but only 500 were on the job during the shutdown. Salsa Grill counts on the Social Security workers as customers, but they were not there. There were stories like Jay's all over the country. Because of the 2013 shutdown, hundreds of patients could not enroll in clinical trials at the National Institutes of Health, NIH, so their last chance for a miracle was delayed or denied. About 8,000 rural families had their home loan decisions delayed, pushing the American Dream down the road. Head Start grantees in seven States closed, leaving 7,200 children at home and families searching for high quality child care. Avoiding a shutdown is just the first step. We also need a new budget deal to cancel sequester. Right now our budget caps spending, but it does not cap tax breaks for billionaires and corporations that send jobs overseas. Americans are angry. They feel the rules are rigged against them and that those who write the rules don't care. But Democrats do care. We believe the people deserve a government on their side. That is why we are fighting to make sure the American people have a government that works as hard as they do. We have three steps to meet that goal. First, no government shutdown. We need to pass a clean, short-term continuing funding resolution with no poison pill riders to keep the government funded and open for business for as short a time as possible. After all, a yearlong CR just locks in sequester. The CR will give us time to take the second step, negotiating a new budget agreement that cancels sequester and lifts the spending caps equally for defense and nondefense spending so we can protect our national security and give the American people a fair shot. After the new budget agreement is reached, we will take the third step, writing and enacting an Omnibus spending bill. Remember, the Appropriations Committee needs 30 days to get the job done once we have our topline. That is my plan to cancel sequester and put the American people first. Why do we want to cancel sequester? Sequester requires draconian cuts to critical programs that will have consequences for American families for a generation. Sequester was supposed to be so arbitrary and unthinkable that it would drive Congress to a budget deal. But gridlock, hammerlock, and deadlock kept that from happening. It was the reality of sequester that led Congress to negotiate the Murray-Ryan budget deal that provided sequester relief for 2014 and 2015. Now we have got deja vu. We need a new agreement to cancel sequester- level spending in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. The Republican budget for fiscal year 2016 calls for spending at the sequester level of $1.017 trillion. The President's budget request asks for $74 billion more. That may sound like a big number, but it is hardly expensive. It is equal to the 2010 level--6 years ago. We must cancel sequester to give Americans a fair shot by investing in our country and our people. Sequester hurts national security. According to Army Chief of Staff General Raymond Odierno, only 33 percent of our brigades are ready to fight. Without sequester relief, the Army will not be truly ready to fight until 2025. Sequester keeps us from building and maintaining our physical infrastructure. Funding to build roads, bridges, and transit creates jobs while easing peoples commutes to their jobs. Sequester deepens our innovation deficit. Funding for basic research is an investment in jobs today and jobs tomorrow. New ideas and discoveries lead to startups that rev up our economy and find new cures for deadly diseases. Under spartan budgets, NIH funding has not kept up with inflation. Even the increases proposed under the Republican spending caps fund NIH by cutting education, college affordability, and labor protections. On the other hand, when we cancel sequester, we will invest in innovation and discovery without sacrificing other investments in our future. For example, the National Science Foundation would give 600 more grants supporting 7,500 scientists, students, teachers, and technicians. Cancelling sequester means meeting compelling human needs. We can help make college affordable for families. Right now, under sequester- level budgeting, Republicans instead took $300 million from Pell grants and eliminated First in the World grants to make college more affordable. Under sequester-level appropriations bills, we can not keep our promises to our veterans. Both the Senate and the House Republican bills underfund medical care at the Veterans Administration--by more than $600 million in the Senate. That is enough money to provide medical coverage for 61,000 veterans. The House also cuts $580 million for building VA health care facilities when there is a $10 billion maintenance backlog. It is clear that we need to end sequester. It is also clear that the shutdown was a disaster for everyone, not to be repeated. Because without the resources to keep our government open, agencies can not serve the American people keeping us safe, healthy, educated, moving, and thriving. The bottom line is we need a new topline. We need a new budget deal to invest in America's safety and future. We need a short-term CR, free of poison pill riders, to get there--not another shutdown. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise once again to speak against this callous, misguided effort to defund Planned Parenthood. This is a clear case of politics being put ahead of the country's best interests. This time the majority has tied this effort to the funding of the entire Federal Government--they are willing to shut down the government over this issue. That is preposterous. Planned Parenthood serves some of the most vulnerable women in our society. It cares for 2.7 million patients in the U.S.--5 million patients worldwide. Ninety-seven percent of the services its 700 clinics provide are basic health care, including breast exams, cervical cancer screenings, testing for sexually [[Page S6914]] transmitted diseases, and contraception. One in five women will use Planned Parenthood as their primary health care provider at some point in their lives. Nationwide, 80 percent of Planned Parenthood patients make less than $18,000 per year. Planned Parenthood is often the only health care option for low- income women and women in rural communities. And yet here we are, facing another effort by Republicans to block funding for this vital health care provider, an effort echoed and supported by Republicans who are running for President. Since this latest attack on Planned Parenthood began in July, I've received more than 25,000 calls and emails from women and men in California who support Planned Parenthood. While the details of the stories vary, they share the same theme: Planned Parenthood was there for them at a critical time in their lives. It was the only place they could go for health care when they were in college, earning minimum wage, or struggling to provide for their children and families. It was the only place where they felt safe and respected. It provided essential tests and screenings and allowed them to plan their families, which is critical to women's economic security over the course of their lives. Here is one example from a constituent in San Francisco. She said ``Thirty-two years ago, I was broke, and Planned Parenthood was the only place that would give me birth control. I am now retired, and my life would be so different if they hadn't been there. This is so necessary for those who can't afford it.'' Another constituent from Alameda said, ``I'm calling your office for the first time because I want you to support Planned Parenthood. When I was a young woman, their medical services saved my life. I hope this phone call helps save them in return.'' To me, that is why this organization is so important to women in this country. Not only does it provide health care, it gives women the ability to make a better future for themselves and their families. I also want to address the false claim put forward by those who are pushing to defund Planned Parenthood: They claim that Planned Parenthood patients would easily find another community clinic to go to for their health care. This is just not true. Community health centers and clinics do great work, but if 2.7 million Planned Parenthood patients were suddenly without a doctor, they simply could not handle the sudden influx of new patients. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that up to 650,000 Planned Parenthood patients would lose their access to health care. What's more, many community clinics don't provide the level of contraception care and other health care services provided by Planned Parenthood. In two-thirds of the counties where Planned Parenthood has a clinic, it serves half of the women eligible to receive family planning services under the Title X program. In California, 13 of 58 counties would not have a single clinic to provide family planning services under the Title X program without Planned Parenthood. That tells us what will happen if this funding is stripped--huge numbers of women across the country will have no place to go for vital health services. This isn't a matter of speculation. We've seen what happens when Planned Parenthood is defunded because it has happened at the state level. In 2012, Texas defunded Planned Parenthood. To serve all the women who needed access to a doctor or nurse, the remaining community clinics would have had to increase the number of patients they saw by an average of 81 percent. In other words, they would have needed to accept almost a doubling of their existing number of patients. Unsurprisingly, those clinics lacked the ability to do so. As a result, nearly 20,000 fewer women were served by the Texas Women's Health Program the following year, a 10 percent decline. The number of prescriptions for birth control was cut in half, meaning 100,000 fewer women were able to access affordable birth control. Louisiana is another State trying to defund Planned Parenthood, and recently defended its actions in court. As part of its rationale, the State actually claimed that dentists and eye doctors are capable of providing women's health care services. Let me repeat: Louisiana officials claimed that women who receive breast exams, contraceptive counseling and prescriptions, and other medical services at Planned Parenthood could go to dentists and eye doctors instead. Any woman knows that is just unrealistic. So make no mistake about it: If Planned Parenthood is defunded, many American women simply will not get the health care they need. The attacks on women's health don't stop at Planned Parenthood's door. The House of Representatives recently proposed completely eliminating the Title X program, which provides affordable family planning services to low-income women. Title X is proven to reduce abortions by preventing unplanned pregnancies. Let me repeat that: The House has proposed to eliminate a program that reduces abortions. Of course, we also know that the House voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act more than 50 times. Here in the Senate we've suffered through at least 30 similar votes. This law they want to repeal guarantees women basic preventive care like mammograms and cervical cancer screenings. It requires that prenatal care and labor and delivery are covered by insurance companies. It prevents women from being denied coverage or charged more because they're women. It's the greatest achievement for women's health in a generation; yet we wasted days and weeks on futile attempts to eliminate it. These attempts to deny women and their families access to basic health care, to defund Planned Parenthood, to eliminate funding for family planning services that reduce abortions, and to deny women the right to make their own reproductive decisions are appalling. Planned Parenthood has been under constant attack since its founding in 1916. Its founder, Margaret Sanger, was thrown in jail for providing birth control to women. The proponents of defunding Planned Parenthood have been engaged in this assault for years. The group behind this latest effort, the Center for Medical Progress, has long-standing ties to the anti-choice movement. It is currently under investigation for possible criminal activity. The individuals who obtained the footage used false identification to represent a fake medical company. The videos, which are presented to the public as the full, unedited videos, have been analyzed by forensics experts at Fusion GPS. And the truth is, they are not the full, unedited videos. Content is missing, and numerous edits have been made even to the so-called full footage videos. Many members of Congress have requested the full videos. Those requests have gone unanswered. So the point is, this is part of a sustained assault on an essential health care provider for millions of American women. I also want to reiterate the real-life consequences of the rhetoric that's been directed at Planned Parenthood and its staff. I talked about this when I spoke on this subject in July. I strongly believe that the rhetoric directed at Planned Parenthood sends a message that it is ``OK'' to intimidate its staff and patients. It is not. A few weeks ago, a Planned Parenthood health center in Washington State was severely damaged when an arsonist lit it on fire. Thankfully, no one was hurt. But I would hope that we'd learn from this event, and opponents of Planned Parenthood would think about the ramifications of their words. This is dangerous territory. In closing, we must remember that the attacks on Planned Parenthood aren't about improving women's health. They are about taking away women's rights, choices, and access to the doctors and nurses they know and trust. And quite frankly, their efforts will only jeopardize women's health by removing the only source of health care many women have available. I've seen great gains for women during my lifetime, including more education, greater workplace freedom, and the right to decide what happens to our own bodies. I simply will not stand by and watch our advances slip away. We are standing up for Planned Parenthood because we stand up for women. I urge a ``no'' vote. Let's defeat this bill and move on so we can fund the government and address many other critical issues. [[Page S6915]] Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am in strong opposition to the substitute amendment to H.J. Res. 61 imposing a moratorium on Federal funding for Planned Parenthood clinics and their affiliates unless they stop providing abortions. Let's be clear about one thing: the effort to defund Planned Parenthood is not about Federal funding for abortions. Since 1977, it has been well established under the Hyde amendment that Federal funding cannot be used for abortions, except in very narrow circumstances where the life of the mother is endangered or in cases of rape or incest. The impetus for this amendment stems from the recent release of surreptitiously recorded and heavily edited videos that falsely portray Planned Parenthood's participation in legal fetal tissue donation programs and the subsequent attempts to defund Planned Parenthood on the basis of that intrinsically dishonest campaign. It is not the first time anti-choice advocates have deliberately misrepresented Planned Parenthood. I remember when a Senator stood on the floor of the U.S. Senate 4 years ago and claimed that abortions are ``well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does''. And then his press spokesperson had to acknowledge that what he said ``wasn't intended as a factual statement''. How much of what we are hearing and seeing now isn't ``intended as a factual statement''? Senators certainly are entitled to their sincerely held positions on abortion and contraception, but I think we ought to refrain from saying things we know aren't true, especially on the floor of the United States Senate. The attack on Planned Parenthood, if successful, would have a devastating impact on women and families across this country, especially lower income women and their families. Planned Parenthood health centers are an integral part of our safety net health care system, providing high quality, affordable health care services to 2.7 million patients per year. Every year, Planned Parenthood physicians and nurses provide family planning counseling and contraception to 2.1 million women, perform nearly 400,000 screenings for cervical cancer and nearly 500,000 breast exams, and provide nearly 4.5 million tests and treatments for sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Banning Federal funding for Planned Parenthood would put millions of women at risk of having no place to go for basic, preventive health care. For many women, family planning clinics such as Planned Parenthood provide the only basic health care they receive. In fact, 6 in 10 women who access care through a family planning health center consider it their main source of health care. More than half of Planned Parenthood health centers are located in rural areas, health professional shortage areas, or medically underserved areas, putting women living in those areas at particular risk of losing access to health care services. It isn't just Planned Parenthood that is under attack; it is also the one out of every five women in this country who has relied on Planned Parenthood for health care at some point in her lifetime. Earlier this week, I also voted against invoking cloture on another assault on women's reproductive health--H.R. 36, an unconstitutional attempt to impose a nationwide ban on abortions when the ``postfertilization age'' of the fetus is determined to 20 weeks or greater, with extremely limited exceptions. More than 40 years ago, in its landmark Roe v. Wade decision, the Supreme Court made it clear that women in this country have a constitutional right to abortion services and that no legislature may ban abortion prior to viability, which is exactly what H.R. 36 attempts to do. Previous attempts to impose previability bans on abortion have been repeatedly struck down by the courts, and last year, the Supreme Court refused to review a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision permanently blocking Arizona's 20- week ban. Nevertheless, anti-choice advocates continue their relentless efforts to undermine women's reproductive rights and health in any and every way possible. The cloture votes on H.R. 36 and today's amendment to defund Planned Parenthood are simply the latest attempts. In addition to imposing an unconstitutional previability ban on abortion, H.R. 36 threatens doctors with criminal penalties, including up to 5 years in prison, for attempting or performing an abortion in violation of the bill's onerous restrictions, which is clearly intended to intimidate and discourage doctors from providing abortion care. The bill also puts the health of pregnant women at risk by allowing an exception to the 20-week ban only in the very narrow circumstance where an abortion is necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman. Therefore, under H.R. 36, a pregnant woman who develops a serious medical condition or complication after 20 weeks would be barred from terminating her pregnancy, no matter how serious the risk to her health, unless the abortion is deemed necessary to prevent the woman's death. In addition, H.R. 36 would not allow an exception in the heart- wrenching situation in which a severe fetal anomaly is discovered late in a woman's pregnancy, despite the fact that these conditions are often only detectable around 20 weeks. H.R. 36 also lacks a reasonable exception to the 20-week ban for victims of rape and incest. Adult women who have been raped would be required to report the assault to law enforcement or undergo compulsory medical treatment or counseling at least 48 hours prior to receiving an abortion, meaning that the rape survivor must have at least two appointments with two different providers in order to access the care she needs. H.R. 36's treatment of minors who have survived rape or incest is even more extreme. For minors who have been the victim of rape or incest, H.R. 36 would require proof that the crime was reported to law enforcement or the appropriate government agency in order to qualify for an exception to the 20-week ban. These extremely narrow exceptions completely ignore the fact that the majority of sexual assault survivors do not or are not able to report their assaults to law enforcement for a variety of compelling reasons. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention--CDC--estimate that only 35 percent of sexual assaults or rapes were reported to the police in 2010. It is simply unconscionable to subject survivors of rape and incest to these burdensome and unnecessary requirements in order to receive the care they need. We are 6 days away from a government shutdown; yet we have spent most of this week on misguided attempts to ban legal abortions and defund Planned Parenthood--and to link the Planned Parenthood issue to whether the Federal Government will remain open for business--even as it has been obvious to everyone that such attempts would fail. A government shutdown is a completely avoidable crisis, and using floor time this time to attack women's health care and reproductive rights instead of negotiating a bipartisan plan to fund the government is both unacceptable and irresponsible. The American people deserve better. They deserve a budget that supports a strong national defense and growing economy, not the threat of another government shutdown. I urge my colleagues to join with me in opposing these latest attacks on women's reproductive rights and access to high quality, comprehensive health care services. Recognition of the Majority Leader The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized. His Holiness Pope Francis Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I know I speak for the entire Senate when I say it was a privilege to welcome the Pope to the Capitol this morning. For the thousands who gathered on the Capitol lawn, it was an experience they are unlikely to ever forget. A quiet nod, a soft smile, a simple wave--the gestures may have been small, but their meaning ran deep, captured forever in the hearts of the faithful and the hopeful. As we turn back to the work of governing, many will interpret his words in many ways. The media certainly has. But we can also hear him as simply expressing his faith. And we all appreciate his closing remarks: God bless America. Mr. President, it is no surprise that Members of the Senate have differences on issues. That is normal, healthy even. But even if our Democratic colleagues may not agree with us on every [[Page S6916]] issue, let us agree that the scandal surrounding Planned Parenthood is deeply, deeply unsettling. Let us agree that it makes sense to at least place a scandal-plagued political organization on leave without pay and then use that money to fund women's health care as Congress investigates these serious allegations. Let us also agree that it is time for our Democratic colleagues to finally allow the Senate to fund the government, just as we have worked hard to do all year long. Here is the view the new Senate took from the beginning. The best way to fund the government is to pass a budget, and then to fund it. That may be a different approach from previous years, but it is the approach we chose to pursue when we came to office. We didn't think it was right that the Senate hadn't passed a budget in 6 years or that the Senate's Appropriations Committee hadn't passed the 12 bills necessary to fund the government in 6 years. So we changed that. The appropriations process got off to a great start. There was often a spirit of bipartisanship inside that committee. Consider that nearly all of the 12 funding bills passed with bipartisan support. More than half attracted the support of over 70 percent of Democrats. We saw our Democratic colleagues use phrases such as ``win-win-win'' or declare the appropriations legislation would ``do right by'' their particular State as they issued press releases praising the bills that they voted for. It was great to see that bipartisan action. I was hopeful that our Democratic colleagues would actually join with us on the Senate floor to debate and pass the legislation they had praised in committee. But no, they took a different path. I regret that Democratic leadership determined a crisis would be necessary to advance a policy aim of growing the government, and that our colleagues decided accordingly to block every single funding bill-- every single one--almost all of which had been supported by a significant number of Democrats in committee. So we have been forced to pursue a continuing resolution as a result. It would be much better to simply finish the appropriations process we worked so hard to advance. But if our colleagues continue to block the Senate from doing so, the Senate is left with very few options. It may be regrettable, but that is the reality we now face. The bill before us would help get things back on track. It would ensure the government remains funded and open. It would adhere to the bipartisan spending level already agreed to by both parties. It would also allow our Democratic colleagues to join us in standing up for women's health instead of a political organization mired in scandal. For 1 year, the legislation would redirect $235 million in Planned Parenthood funding to women's health instead, strengthening health centers that provide critically needed community care. I wish our colleagues hadn't pursued a strategy of blocking government funding. That strategy may have succeeded in bringing the country to this point, but there is no reason to continue blocking every attempt to fund the government or to protect political allies mired in scandal. So I am calling on colleagues across the aisle to join us in standing against a shutdown. I am calling on them to join us in standing up for women's health instead. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time following the vote until 6 p.m. be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees; further, that all time during quorum calls until 6 p.m. be charged equally between both sides. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, all time be yielded back and the Senate proceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on amendment No. 2669. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.

The majority whip is recognized. His Holiness Pope Francis Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today has certainly been a historic day in Washington, DC. With the arrival of His Holiness Pope Francis this week, Washington has been flooded with the faithful who were eager to mark his first visit to the United States. I know my colleagues and I are grateful we were able to host him at a joint meeting of Congress, and we were all in awe of his incredible stamina given his schedule-- something we are not unfamiliar with. As head of the Catholic Church, Pope Francis leads a diverse community of believers. Catholics in the United States make up about one-fifth of the population in the United States and also in my home State of Texas. In fact, Catholic priests from Spain were some of our earliest settlers in Texas, and one of the dozens of missions established by the Catholic Church early in the 18th century in Texas was Mission San Antonio de Valero, what would later be called the Alamo. It was a privilege to welcome Pope Francis this morning and to hear his remarks. I am told he was the first pontiff ever to address a joint meeting of Congress. Cardinal Daniel DiNardo It was also my honor to host a friend of mine, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, who accepted my invitation to join me today to hear Pope Francis. Cardinal DiNardo is the archbishop of Galveston-Houston, home to more than 1 million Catholics--the largest number of the 15 dioceses in Texas. I have had the honor of knowing Cardinal DiNardo for a number of years, and I am grateful to him for his unwavering commitment to life and for his extreme compassion in both a pastoral and spiritual sense as well as a practical one. We saw that in action recently when historic flooding devastated many of the communities in the Houston area. During that time, Cardinal DiNardo was quick to ensure that Catholic Charities would provide some relief to those in need. There is no doubt that his leadership will continue to serve not only the Catholic community in the Galveston-Houston area well but also all of us in Texas. Mr. President, on another matter, earlier today Democrats blocked a measure that would fund the U.S. Government but redirect Federal money that currently goes to Planned Parenthood to go for women's health care at community health centers. Actually, there are many more community [[Page S6918]] health centers in Texas than there are Planned Parenthood facilities. Earlier this week I outlined how the Democrats, while earlier calling for regular order in this Chamber, have delivered on their promise to block legislation from moving forward that would fund vital parts of our government, such as the men and women in uniform who defend us. This is in spite of the fact that earlier this year, as I believe the majority leader mentioned, members of the Appropriations Committee actually did the work we were elected to do. We passed a budget and then in a bipartisan way passed appropriations bills out of the Appropriations Committee. But because they have chosen to filibuster all of these appropriations bills, we find ourselves with unneeded and unnecessary drama when it comes to funding the Federal Government-- hence the vote on Monday for closing off debate on a continuing resolution to fund the government through December 11, 2015. Unfortunately, even our uniformed military has been taken hostage to this strategy, which has created unnecessary drama, as I said, and created some real hardship. So as we approach the looming fiscal deadline of next Wednesday at midnight, it is important to remember how we got here. While Democrats filibustered legislation that would have removed all Federal funding for Planned Parenthood, this fight--the fight for the sanctity of life Pope Francis talked about this morning--is far from over. We are going to continue the four different investigations of Planned Parenthood's practices and pursue legislation that would protect the fundamental right to life of the unborn. Protecting the sanctity of life is an ongoing mission, and it does not end with this one vote. I yield the floor. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President here we are again: with just 6 days until the Federal Government has to close its doors, we find ourselves faced with another manufactured crisis. Two years ago, it was defunding the Affordable Care Act. Congress has voted nearly 60 times on that so far, all of which failed. In the meantime, more than 17 million Americans who had no health insurance have obtained health insurance. Four years ago, it was the same issue Republicans are pushing today: defunding an organization that provides health care to millions of women across this country. With the vote to defund Planned Parenthood now behind us--for the second time in as many months--it is time to move forward to pass a clean, short-term continuing resolution and get to work addressing the real challenge before us: ending sequestration. We've said it before, and it bears repeating: sequestration was never supposed to become the status quo. Its cuts are so extreme and so draconian that imposing it will hurt programs across the board, impacting every American. Sequestration neglects police and fire departments, national parks, highways and bridges, airports, public health and education; and abandons promises made to our veterans and men and women in uniform. Allowing sequester-level spending bills to become law for the next fiscal year, which the President has rightly said he will not do, would be an abdication of our sworn responsibilities as Members of Congress. We must pass a clean, continuing resolution; we must negotiate a new deal to end sequestration, and we must pass appropriations bills that reflect the urgent needs of our country, not a political score card. Last weekend, my wife, Marcelle, and I were fortunate to join hundreds of Vermont women at the 19th Annual Women's Economic Opportunity Conference in Randolph, VT. I have sponsored this conference each year in an effort to help Vermont women of all ages and generations take advantage of the economic opportunities available to them. From emerging entrepreneurs or those transitioning their careers, thousands of participants have been drawn to the conference over its nearly two decade history. Sequestration puts at risk the ability of small businesses to access loans and counseling from the Federal Government, which helps spur and strengthen our economy. Sequestration will cut critical workforce investment programs that help young workers, dislocated workers, and veterans find permanent employment. Sequestration reverses the progress we have made in recent years to restore our economy and create jobs. The economic harm of sequestration is, of course, not all that is at stake. As Senators in both parties have pointed out, sequestration hurts our national security and the readiness of our Armed Forces. Sequestration hurts our roads, our infrastructure, and our public transit systems and will deeply impact our affordable housing supply. Sequestration makes maintaining our commitment to our veterans, including a generation of disabled veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, nearly impossible. What's more, to meet the requirements of sequestration, we are poised to rob from such vital needs as job training programs and preschool development grants. The bottom line is this: sequestration was never intended to happen. But relying on budget gimmicks, as the Senate's defense spending bill does, while nearly zeroing out critical programs for low-income Americans, as the Senate's transportation and housing bill does, creates more problems. Republican leaders have waited too long to come to the table to negotiate relief from sequester-level spending caps. By passing this clean, short-term continuing resolution, we can get to work now--immediately--to negotiate a new deal that builds on the 2013 Murray-Ryan deal and keep the doors of our government open. We have now had the pointless debate over defunding Planned Parenthood. Let's move on. Let's not manufacture another crisis that puts millions of jobs on the line and hurts Americans in every state of this country. We were elected to represent our constituents. The voice from Vermonters is clear: it is time to get our work done. Mr. CORNYN. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in support of a clean, short-term continuing resolution--or, as we say, a CR--to temporarily fund the government without controversial policy riders. After the vote we just had, I hope we can move to such a measure. Even some Republican leaders have acknowledged that this previous vote was a show vote designed to appease, but to fail. It is part of a troubling pattern that has been emerging over many months of avoiding meaningful, bipartisan talks to fix the budget and waiting until the last moment to deal with issues everyone knows must be addressed. We have an obligation to the American people to keep their government working. It is one of the most basic responsibilities we have as Members of Congress. A clean CR at this juncture fulfills this obligation, keeping the government open for a few more weeks while we work on a plan to eliminate the sequester-level budget caps for defense and nondefense programs. I wish we could have begun work on an overall agreement earlier in the year, as Vice Chairwoman Mikulski and others strongly urged months ago, but at this late hour we should pass this short-term measure and move on to serious negotiations on budget caps for this year and beyond. Shutting the government down now will not serve any useful purpose. What a shutdown will do is waste taxpayers' money and hurt the economy. Indeed, the 2-week Republican government shutdown in 2013 cost our economy billions of dollars. Based on that experience, here is some of what we can expect if there is another forced government shutdown this year: The Department of Housing and Urban Development will have to furlough more than 95 percent of its workforce, impacting services to more than 60 field and regional offices nationwide. Payments will be delayed to the roughly 3,000 local public housing authorities that manage the country's publicly assisted housing programs. In fact, this shifts the burden onto them, causing them to turn to local municipalities that are equally stressed in terms of their budgets. So there is no avoiding [[Page S6919]] this pain--in fact, it will be multiplied if we shut down the government. Thousands of home sales and mortgage-refinancing packages backed by the Federal Housing Administration, the FHA, will be put on standby. People who are ready to close, people who are ready to make a commitment to a home, people who are ready to keep this economy moving will be told: Stand back; wait and see. Cities, counties, and States will not be able to move forward with new community development block grant projects, preventing important local economic investment. This is a program which affects every community in this country, and it is something which is a very positive, constructive way to give local leaders the resources to fund the local initiatives the community desperately wants and needs. This is not Big Washington; this is local America getting a chance to see their projects put in place. The Federal Aviation Administration will not be able to certify new aircraft, interrupting billions of dollars in sales. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration will be forced to stop investigations and emergency response training. Classrooms will be shuttered for 700 midshipmen at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, NY. These are young men and women who are committing themselves to serve the Nation either directly in the armed services of the United States or as members of our merchant fleet. They will basically be told to go home. Financial support will stop for the Maritime Security Program, the MSP. This is an important public-private partnership that is critical to sustaining our troops serving overseas. These are just a few examples from two of the Departments under my purview as the ranking member of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee. There are many other examples throughout the Federal Government that my colleagues are talking about today. Knowing the results that shutdowns and these hardball tactics have brought before, it is hard to believe some still are willing to resort to budget brinksmanship again. I know many of my colleagues on the other side share my concern. I particularly wish to commend Senator Collins, who has been an excellent leader in chairing the THUD subcommittee, for her support for a clean CR. She has done extraordinary work under very difficult and challenging circumstances. Her support for a clean CR so that we can negotiate a longer term budget solution is indicative of the kind of forthright, thoughtful, and in some cases very courageous service she has rendered to Maine and to the country. While we focus on the immediate showdown threat, let's remember the bigger threats we face in 2016. We are here because of the Budget Control Act and its attendant sequester-level caps on discretionary spending. Let's remember that these sequester-level caps were never intended to be implemented. At the time BCA was enacted, the cuts were considered to be extreme--in fact, so extreme that Congress would not ever let them happen, that they would embrace defense and nondefense, and that they would be an action-forcing mechanism--not an actuality of law but an action-forcing mechanism to cause us on a bipartisan basis to come up with long-term budget solutions. Unfortunately, that solution did not materialize. Over time, we had the very good work of Senator Murray and Congressman Paul Ryan to come up with a 2-year suspension, but we are right back where we were, and these sequester caps are staring us right in the face. But today, rather than working together to tackle the sequester, we are on the verge of orchestrating another fiscal crisis. And it is not a crisis that will help the American people; rather, it will hinder the American people. And, indeed, it is ironic because Members on both sides recognize the BCA cap should be raised for both defense and nondefense appropriations. Indeed, both the Defense authorization and the Defense appropriations bills carry bipartisan sense-of-the-Senate language that says: ``Sequestration relief must be accomplished for fiscal years 2016 and 2017.'' And, ``Sequestration relief should include equal defense and nondefense relief.'' So you have a bipartisan consensus on these two committees that represent a significant number of our colleagues who are essentially saying: We have to end this. And they are saying it because they believe, as I do, that our national security rests not just upon adequate elements of the Department of Defense but adequate investment for all our Federal programs. So beyond committing a clean, short-term funding bill, we must focus on eliminating these draconian spending caps imposed on us by the BCA. We know these caps will cause real harm to programs across the Federal Government that our States and constituents rely on. These are not academic issues that could be dismissed as being some programs that are ineffective and less limiting. These are across-the- board cuts that hit all our constituents and hit them hard. Indeed, months ago Chairman McCain and I together wrote to urge the Committee on the Budget to include a higher baseline funding amount for the Department of Defense in the budget resolution. We were essentially asking them to ignore the BCA caps and produce a budget that realistically recognizes the base needs of the Department of Defense-- not the one-time spending of OCO contingency but routine spending that would be projected forth. Senator McCain in particular worked in extraordinarily good faith to try to get such a provision included in the budget resolution, but he did not succeed. And, in response, the use of OCO contingency funds was incorporated to skirt the budget caps. Essentially, what the committee has done--the defense authorization committee--is it has taken the President's budget numbers, but moved money out of the base budget into OCO, beyond the President's request. And what you are doing is creating this OCO funding mechanism--in a sense, a gimmick, really--to cover the real cost--the ongoing cost, the routine continuing cost--of the Department of Defense. That is not good budgeting, and it is not good for Defense either. Because of this I was unable to support legislation on the floor for the Defense authorization bill that in many other respects--virtually every other respect--was extremely well done and extremely thought out. Again, I commend the chairman for all his efforts and those of my colleagues. I clearly disagree that using this OCO funding arrangement--gimmick, sleight of hand, whatever you want to call it--is the way to proceed forward. Relying on it essentially preempts defense from the Budget Control Act and leaves everything else under those onerous caps. As I said, that not only does not adequately and realistically fund defense, but it seriously erodes national security because national security is something more than simply what the Department of Defense does. It is the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security, and it is a myriad of other functions that will not see funding. In fact, they will see their funding begin to shrink dramatically. If we use this approach this year, with the argument that it is just a bridge to the day we finally get ourselves together, I think we are deluding ourselves. It would be much easier next year to put even more money into OCO, to take programs that are traditionally funded through the base budget of the Department of Defense and say: Well, we just don't have room. Let's put it in OCO. It becomes the gift that keeps on giving, and it will not provide the real resources and the certainty the Department of Defense needs over many years to plan for their operations. To stick things in 1-year funding is not to tell the Department of Defense: You can be confident that 2 or 3 years from now, when you are developing that new weapons system platform, the money will be there. It may, but again, it may not. We can't give them that insecurity. We have to give them a sense of certainty. Now, this is a view that is shared not just by myself and some colleagues here on both sides of the aisle but by senior Defense Department officials. They have testified repeatedly before our committee that OCO funding does not provide long-term budget certainty. They need that. And the [[Page S6920]] troops--the men and women they lead--need that. In fact, it really just allows DOD to plan for 1 year. And there are very few programs in the Department of Defense that are 1-year programs. A major weapons system is a multiyear development and then there is the production process. The strategy is not year by year. It is over several years at least. So this is not an efficient and effective way to run the organization. Proper budgeting and planning in the Department of Defense requires at least 5 years. That is the standard. The standard measure is a 5-year program forecast, budget forecast, and we are telling them: Well, this year you can have a bonanza of OCO funds. Next year could be more, could be less, could be much less. This is not the way to efficiently allocate resources for national security and to efficiently develop a strategy to counteract an increasing array of threats around the globe in many different dimensions in many different regions. If we go down this path, it will lead to instability for our troops, their families, and for our defense industrial base. They deserve certainty, not a year-to-year, perhaps- maybe, maybe-perhaps approach. We also need to recognize, as I have repeated before, that national security is not just the Department of Defense. Other agencies are critical--the Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, and Department of Treasury, which does all the terrorist financing sanctions. They have to trace funds flowing around the world to ensure they do not aid and assist terrorist activities or other maligning activities. They need resources too. Taking this approach as it stands now, using this OCO approach for defense and then letting everything else stay under BCA, will not give these agencies the resources they need. I was struck a few days ago when General Petraeus was here testifying that one of the critical areas of effort against ISIL is information warfare. They have proven to be extraordinarily adept at using social media, at communicating through the Internet. One of the questions from my colleague--which was very thoughtful and fundamental--was this: Is the State Department doing enough to counteract--as one of our major foreign policy organizations--this information campaign by ISIL? The General sort of chuckled a bit, and then he said: Let me tell you that when I was commanding, on active service, the State Department had to come to me and essentially borrow $1 million from CENTCOM funds so they could get in the ball game--to just get in the game in terms of information warfare: counteracting measures, public campaigns of information in countries throughout the globe, particularly in the Middle East. That will be much worse if we proceed down this path, and we will not be enhancing our national security. If the ISIL message is unanswered, if they are able to attract adherents from around the globe because all they can really hear is this grotesque discussion of ISIL and what they propose, and there are no counterarguments, there is no countervailing points, we lose that information war. And that is not just a DOD function. Now, we have to make investments in both defense and nondefense. But as I said before, if we stick with these BCA caps, our non-DOD programs will suffer. In addition to that, the needs of the American people will suffer. We will not be able to invest in adequate transportation and water infrastructure. We won't be able to do things that provide adequate and decent housing for our citizens. Under the budget caps we will lose jobs too. When the resources diminish, the need for workers diminishes, and that will happen. Now, we have a situation, particularly where some of our most vulnerable Americans would suffer grievously. Here are a few examples. The elderly housing program has been cut in half since 2010, even when we know the United States population today is aging faster. Every Member of this Senate has numerous elderly housing programs in their State. Their low-income seniors rely on them. I would suspect they take some pride in the fact there is adequate housing--in some cases not enough, but at least some adequate housing. They will suffer. There are 7.7 million very low income renters in the United States. That means they pay more than 50 percent of their income in rent or live in substandard housing or both. If these budget caps go into effect, then the THUD bill will not include meaningful funding for the affordable housing production program available to local governments. When we turn to Public Housing Authorities, they are facing more than $3 billion in capital needs just to keep them repaired, just to make them places that are decent to live in, where people can have appropriate hallway lighting, they can have elevators that work, they can have plumbing systems that are adequate--the basics. We are not talking about building whirlpools, spas, and Jacuzzis. This is just meeting basic requirements in maintenance and capital repairs. The level of funding PHA's are faced with is the same level we provided in the late 1980s. That is going back about 30 years. Thirty years ago, relatively speaking, we would be spending as much as we are now on simply maintaining public housing. These are real-world consequences. Again, BCA comes into play in terms of the impact on domestic programs. Funding for public transit continues to fall even while transit ridership goes up. One of the success stories over the past few years is our public transit systems. Our buses, our subway systems, our light rail systems are enjoying increased ridership. That is good for people to get to work, and it is good for our environment because of reduces the use of individual automobiles. But if our ridership goes up and the resources go down, we are going to see a system that gets less and less dependable, reliable, and effective, and we will lose not only a number of those riders but have incidents--as we have seen across the country--where there are significant safety concerns and significant disruptions. It has not been uncommon over the last several months here in Washington to hear on the radio that a whole subway line has gone down because of a maintenance problem or something else, and that day's workforce doesn't get to the office for 3 or 4 or 5 hours. Guess what. That costs a lot of private employers a great deal of money because the people aren't doing the work, and they probably would be paid. So essentially this impacts our economy, and it is multiplied. And it will be exponentially multiplied if we start cutting away the money, as suggested in the Budget Control Act. It is now time to work together and to enact first a clean CR, which will give us the time to systematically and comprehensively address the issues that are staring us straight in the face because of the BCA--the budget caps on Defense and nondefense. It is time to be able to move-- as I believe the vast majority of my colleagues want to--the excess OCO funding back into the regular budget of the Department of Defense as we raise the budget cap, and as we raise the budget cap for the Department of Defense, to recognize we have to raise the cap not only for other national security agencies to protect our country, but also for other agencies in order to invest in our economy, keep us productive, keep people employed, and also keep faith with the thousands and thousands of Americans who have worked and now may need help. There are seniors in need of rental assistance. They need the support of a good transit system to get to work or, if they are a senior citizen, to get to a doctor's appointment. They are counting on us. So I hope all my colleagues can come together, forge an agreement, avoid a shutdown, and then do something more than just keep the lights on--invest across the board in our people and watch those investments multiply to a productive, successful economy and a more secure America. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. [[Page S6921]] Unanimous Consent Request--S. Res. 224 Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, in 1975, Russian physicist Andrei Sakharov was awarded a Nobel Prize for his public opposition to the totalitarian communism of the Soviet Union. He knew what he was talking about as he had spent decades working on the Soviet nuclear weapons program, work he had originally thought was a patriotic duty that would ensure the balance of power with the United States but that he came to understand was in the service of a brutal, oppressive regime with aggressive intentions. The Soviets prohibited Sakharov from accepting the award in person, although his wife Yelena Bonner was abroad at the time. She accepted on his behalf and delivered his seminal speech, ``Peace, Progress, and Human Rights.'' In it, Sakharov declared: I am convinced that international confidence, mutual understanding, disarmament, and international security are inconceivable without an open society with freedom of information, freedom of conscience, the right to publish, and the right to travel and choose the country in which one wishes to live. I am likewise convinced that freedom of conscience, together with other civil rights, provides the basis for scientific progress and constitutes a guarantee that scientific advances will not be used to despoil mankind, providing the basis for economic and social progress, which in turn is a political guarantee for the possibility of an effective defense of social rights. He recited the names of his fellow dissidents who were being persecuted by the Soviets, but he called for peaceful reform, not a violent revolution, saying: We must today fight for every individual person separately against injustice and the violation of human rights. Much of our future depends on this. In struggling to protect human rights we must, I am convinced, first and foremost act as protectors of the innocent victims of regimes installed in various countries, without demanding the destruction or total condemnation of these regimes. We need a pliant, pluralist, tolerant community, which selectively and tentatively can bring about a free undogmatic use of the experiences of all social systems. Sakharov was relieved of all his scientific duties and, after denouncing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1980, was banished to Gorky, 250 miles east of Moscow on the Volga River, to remove him from the public eye. His wife joined him in 1984, charged with anti-Soviet slander, and was prohibited from traveling abroad for medical treatment. Sakharov began a hunger strike in protest. Soviet authorities detained and force-fed him. In solidarity, President Ronald Reagan--who was then initiating his historic negotiations with the Soviets--proclaimed May 18, 1983, National Andrei Sakharov Day, and the following year the United States Congress passed a bipartisan measure renaming the mailing address of the Soviet Embassy from 1125 16th Street to No. 1 Andrei Sakharov Plaza. Every piece of mail delivered to or sent from the embassy would thus bear the name of the courageous dissident the Soviets were trying to silence. The following year, the Soviet Union allowed Bonner to travel abroad for heart surgery, and the year after that, Gorbachev allowed Sakharov and his wife to return to Moscow, although Sakharov remained critical of the slow speed of Gorbachev's reforms until his death in 1989--just 1 month after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The bravery of Andrei Sakharov was instrumental in bringing down a great and oppressive empire. Armed only with the truth, he was able to expose to the world the reality of Soviet Communism, the futility of trying to placate or domesticate the regime, and the power of standing for human rights. Today, we have a case before us that is eerily reminiscent of Sakharov's legacy. Dr. Liu Xiaobo, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, sits today in a Chinese jail for the crime of subversion. A poet, author, and political scientist, Dr. Liu was in 1989 a visiting scholar at Columbia University, but when the pro-democracy protests broke out in Beijing in June of that year, he returned to China to aid the movement. He staged a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square in the midst of the historic student protests and insisted the protests would be nonviolent, even in the face of the violence threatened by the People's Republic of China. The PRC arrested Liu for his involvement in the Tiananmen Square demonstration and sentenced him to 2 years in prison. In 1996, the party subjected him to 3 years of ``reeducation through labor'' for questioning the single-party system. In 2004, the PRC cut Liu's phone lines and Internet connection after he published an essay criticizing the party's campaign to silence so- called subversive journalists and activists. In 2008, Liu, along with over 350 Chinese intellectuals and human rights advocates, penned ``Charter 08,'' a manifesto modeled after the Czech ``Charter 77,'' an anti-Communist manifesto written in 1977 by Vaclav Havel and others calling for human rights and political reforms in the Soviet Republics. Dr. Liu's ``Charter 08'' made 19 specific demands of the PRC, including abandoning one-party rule in favor of instituting a separation of powers composed of a legislative democracy and independent judiciary; abolition of the Hukou housing system that has victimized poor and rural Chinese for decades; and securing freedom of association, assembly, expression, and religion. ``Charter 08'' was released on December 10, 2008. Although the Communist Party quickly censored it, over 10,000 journalists, scholars, businessmen, and teachers have signed the document since 2008. Two days prior to the release of ``Charter 08''--on the eve of the 100-year anniversary of China's first Constitution and the 30-year anniversary of Beijing's Democracy Wall movement--the PRC detained Liu for his involvement in this charter. In June 2009, he was officially arrested and charged with ``inciting subversion of state power'' for his coauthorship of ``Charter 08.'' After being detained for over a year, Liu pled not guilty to ``inciting subversion of state power'' before the Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court on December 23, 2009. His defense was not allowed to present evidence, and on Christmas Day Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison with an additional 2 years' deprivation of all political rights. Beijing High Court rejected his appeal 2 months later. On October 2010, Dr. Liu Xiaobo received the Nobel Peace Prize for his leadership in writing and publishing ``Charter 08.'' Like Sakharov, he could not attend in person but accepted in absentia, boldly declaring in his acceptance speech: Hatred can rot away at a person's intelligence and conscience. Enemy mentality will poison the spirit of a nation, incite cruel mortal struggles, destroy a society's tolerance and humanity, and hinder a nation's progress toward freedom and democracy. That is why I hope to be able to transcend my personal experiences as I look upon our nation's development and social change, to counter the regime's hostility with utmost goodwill, and to dispel hatred with love. The very moment the Nobel Commission awarded the Peace Prize to Liu, his wife Liu Xia was taken into custody by the PRC. She penned an open letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping in June 2013 decrying her unjust arrest and detention: I have been under house arrest and have lost all my personal freedoms since October 2010. No one has told me any reasons for detaining me. I have thought about it over and over. Perhaps in this country it's a ``crime'' for me to be ``Liu Xiaobo's wife.'' Both Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia remain in prison today. The opening paragraph of ``Charter 08'' captures the entirety of Liu Xiaobo's lifework: Having experienced a prolonged period of human rights disasters and challenging and tortuous struggles, the awakening Chinese citizens are becoming increasingly aware that freedom, equality and human rights are universal values shared by all humankind, and that democracy, republicanism, and constitutional government make up the basic institutional framework of modern politics. A `modernization' bereft of these universal values and this basic political framework is a disastrous process that deprives people of their rights, rots away their humanity, and destroys their dignity. Where is China headed in the 21st century? Will it continue with this `modernization' under authoritarian rule, or will it endorse universal values, join the mainstream civilization, and build a democratic form of government? This is an unavoidable decision. Dr. Liu's enormous courage and willingness to voluntarily sacrifice not only his own freedom but also that of those most dear to him poses a challenge to the free world. Will we be silent, eager to enjoy the economic benefits of cooperation with the PRC? Or will we put President Xi on notice that [[Page S6922]] for America, human rights are no longer off the table, and that we are listening to the truth about Communist China. I believe that the freedom championed by Dr. Liu is possible for all the Chinese people. I believe that from Tiananmen Square to Taiwan, the evidence is clear that the Chinese desire--and are capable of-- democracy. I believe that we have a moral responsibility to not marginalize Dr. Liu and his brave fellow dissidents but to make their plight central to all our dealings with the PRC. For that reason, we should follow the example of Ronald Reagan. We should follow the example of standing up to oppression, standing up do the Soviet Union's oppression of Andrei Sakharov. For that reason, in solidarity with the Chinese people engaged in a long and nonviolent struggle for basic human rights, I am asking my colleagues to join me in creating a new version of Sakharov Plaza by naming the street in front of the People's Republic of China Embassy in Washington, DC, Liu Xiaobo Plaza. This would be the street sign that the Chinese Ambassador would look at each day. This would be the address that every piece of correspondence going into the embassy and coming out of the embassy would have written on it, just as with the Soviets when forced to recognize the bravery of Sakharov. The PRC officials will be forced to recognize the bravery of Dr. Liu and to acknowledge it dozens of times a day, day after day. I realize that this is an expedited request, but given the ongoing repression not only of the Lius but of so many other voices for political and religious freedom in China and the imminent arrival of the Chinese leader who is directly responsible for it, I hope that my colleagues will join me. I intend to propound a unanimous consent request, and it is my hope that all 100 Senators will stand with me. But for the moment, I yield the floor. Mr. CRUZ addressed the Chair. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Capito). The Senator from Texas. Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, for reasons that I just detailed to this Chamber, reasons for which we should stand in bipartisan unanimity in support of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dr. Liu Xiaobo and in support of human rights and dissidents across the world, that we should follow the successful pattern of Sakharov Plaza under Ronald Reagan, this should be an issue that brings us all together. Accordingly, I ask unanimous consent that the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee be discharged from further consideration of and that the Senate now proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 224. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from California. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I would like to make an observation. The notice for this went out less than an hour ago. The consultations with others haven't been made. It was precipitously brought to the floor, and I can only infer that it has political implications, because the President of China is due to arrive here tomorrow and, therefore, this would be passed today, moved out of committee without a vote in front of the Senate. I don't think that is the way we should do business in this Senate. Maybe people don't believe diplomacy makes a difference, but I do. I think there will be ample time for the President to speak with the President of China and for some of us to speak as well. This is, of course--the human rights, of course--a subject. But in the absence of that, I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Texas. Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I note that this is a sad day for this body. When standing up to the Soviet Union, Democrats and Republicans were able to come together in support of Andrei Sakharov, and it worked. It made a difference speaking up for human rights. The senior Senator from California is correct that this was expedited, and she is correct as to why. As I said in this floor speech, the presence of President Xi in this country is precisely the reason that we should stand in unanimity in support of human rights. It is what makes it timely until a few minutes ago, when we had been informed that there were no objections on the Democratic side and Republican side. It saddens me. I know there are many Chinese Americans in the State of California, there are many Chinese Americans in the State of Texas, and across the country there are millions of Americans who care for human rights. Just this morning we sat on the floor of the House of Representatives and listened to Pope Francis talk about putting aside petty partisan differences and coming together with a voice of compassion. Dr. Liu is in a Chinese prison, and the senior Senator from California is standing and objecting to recognizing this Nobel laureate's bravery, is standing and objecting because presumably it would embarrass his Communist captors. I, for one, think as Americans we should not be troubled by embarrassing Communist oppressors. I note, as the senior Senator from California leaves the floor, that this is not an issue that is abstract to me. My family, like Dr. Liu, has been imprisoned by oppressive regimes. My father, as a teenager, was imprisoned and tortured in Cuba. He had his nose broken. He had his teeth shattered. He lay in the blood and grime of a prison cell in Cuba. My aunt, my Tia Sonia, was a few years later again imprisoned and tortured. This time by Castro. My father by Batista and my aunt by Castro was imprisoned and tortured by a Communist regime. It is a sad statement when the United States of America cannot stand up and say: You who are imprisoned unjustly, we stand with you. If any of us listened to a word Pope Francis said this morning, that is a word we should have heard--that we should be a voice of freedom, a clarion voice of freedom across this globe. What we saw on this Senate floor saddens me greatly. I understand the Democrats feel partisan loyalty to the White House, and this White House's Secretary Clinton said at the beginning of the administration that human rights are off the table. America no longer stands for human rights. We will coddle up with oppressors if they make cheap calculators to sell in our stores. I think they are values that transcend the mighty dollar, and it is entirely possible to deal with foreign countries and yet maintain our principles and speak with unanimity. A couple of years ago I had the opportunity to visit with Natan Sharansky, the famed Soviet dissident. He and I visited in Jerusalem. He talked to me about how, when he was in the Soviet gulag, the prisoners would pass from cell to cell notes: Did you hear what President Reagan said--``evil empire,'' ``ash heap of history,'' ``tear down this wall''? The leadership of the United States of America--mind you, it wasn't partisan leadership; it was clear bipartisan leadership in America--shined a light to the dark of those prison cells. I pray today that Dr. Liu, in his prison cell, does not hear word that the Democratic Senators are unwilling to stand with him. That is heartbreaking at a level rarely seen. It is one thing for us to disagree on partisan matters. We can have disagreements over the appropriate rate of capital gains taxes. But for standing with an oppressed Nobel Peace Prize laureate, for standing up to Communist oppression, that should not be a partisan divide. The objection raised by the senior Senator from California is deeply disappointing, and I intend to continue to press this issue because the voice of America, the voice for freedom that Pope Francis urged us to aspire to will not be extinguished. It is who we are that is essential to our character and to our integrity. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. Gun Violence Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, over the course of the summer we have watched with horror as thousands more have died in Syria and Iraq, and the debate over what we should do about it has been omnipresent here in the Senate and in the House. We have held hearings, appeared on television to tell our story of how we should respond, and talked about it on the floor of the [[Page S6923]] Senate and the House. Similarly, we have watched the conflict continue to persist in eastern Ukraine. Although they have not had the same number of casualties as we have seen in Syria and Iraq, they have had similar death and destruction, and we have responded with a vigorous debate on the floor of the Senate--again, hearings in committees, letters to the President, bipartisan pieces of legislation that have been proposed--about how the United States should seek to reduce the amount of casualties in a place like eastern Ukraine, and we are also debating what our response should be in Syria and Iraq. What if I told you that this summer 4,000 people died in another conflict in which there was absolutely no debate here in the Congress? What if I told you there were 4,000 people who died this summer in a conflict and not a single committee in the Congress held a hearing on it? What if I told you there was a conflict this summer in which 4,000 people perished and not a single Member of the majority party in the House or the Senate has proposed any comprehensive way to deal with it? This chart shows the number of people on a daily, monthly, and annual basis who are killed by guns. On average, it is 86 a day, 26,000 a month, and 31,000 a year. This summer, while kids were out of school, over 4,000 people--just this summer--died across this country from gun violence. I come to the floor not as often as I would like but as often as I can to tell some of their stories because I kind of thought these numbers would be enough to persuade Members of this body to do something--anything--to try to stem the scourge of gun violence in this body, but it hasn't, and so my hope is maybe by telling the stories of some of these individuals, it will hopefully make a difference. Every day we add dozens of stories of young men and women--mostly young men and women--whose lives were cut short, whose greatness we were never able to see, whose potential was never realized because they were killed by a gun. This summer we have been gripped by mass shooting after mass shooting. Cynthia Hurd, Tywanza Sanders, Sharonda Singleton, Myra Thompson, Ethel Lance, Susie Jackson, Daniel Simmons, and DePayne Doctor, and Clementa Pinckney--we don't know all of those names, but we know about many of them because they were killed at a mass shooting in a church in South Carolina. Sgt Carson Holmquist, PO2 Randall Smith, GySgt Thomas Sullivan, LCpl ``Skip'' Wells, and SSgt David Wyatt--maybe you have heard their names because they were all killed at a shooting in Tennessee at a Chattanooga Armed Forces recruiting center. Maybe you have heard of Jillian Johnson and Mayci Breaux, who were killed in a movie theater in Lafayette, LA, in July of this year. Most people have now heard of Allison Parker and Adam Ward, who were gunned down on live TV just a few weeks ago in Virginia. On each one of those days--June 17, a shooting in South Carolina; July 16, a shooting in Tennessee; July 24, a shooting in Louisiana; and August 26, a shooting in Virginia--there were dozens more people who died from gunshot wounds whom we never heard of, but they meant something to their families. To this day their loss is experienced deeply by those who knew them well. Some of them were people who were close to those of us who serve in public service. Matthew Shlonsky was killed this summer in Washington, DC. On August 15 he was heading to a going-away party, and he had just stepped out of a cab when he was shot outside of the Shaw-Howard Metro station. He was the sixth gunshot victim in the Shaw area in a little over a week. Think about what it is like to live in a neighborhood in which there have been six shootings over the course of a week. Think of the fear that breeds in those communities. We knew Matthew because he was an intern for one of our colleagues. He was working as a consultant at Deloitte, but he had served as a Senate intern. He was an amazing kid by all accounts. He traveled the world, spoke two languages, and was a star hockey player. His future was absolutely limitless. But because this city is awash in guns--many of them illegal, many of them in the hands of criminals who get them because of giant, gaping holes in our background check system--Matthew Shlonsky is no longer with us. He is dead at the age of 23. How about the heartbreaking story of Carey Gabay, who was 43 years old. He was serving as an assistant counsel to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, and before that he had been counsel of the Empire State Development Corporation. He died on September 16--just on the back end of the summer--after he was caught in the crossfire of a shooting in New York City. He was an innocent bystander when he was shot in the head while attending the pre-West Indian American Day Parade festival with friends and family. He was the son of Jamaican immigrants and grew up in public housing in the Bronx. He had done amazingly well. He attended Harvard University and Harvard Law School. He was working for the Governor and trying to make a better life for others by trying to give opportunities to kids who grow up in the same circumstance as he did. A friend described him as ``an amazing human being who melded public service, professionalism, personal integrity with warmth and caring for everyone he knew.'' He was 43 years old when he was gunned down in broad daylight outside of a festival simply because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. This summer 4,000 people were killed by guns, and not a single public hearing has occurred in the U.S. Senate to discuss a solution. There is not even mention of a debate happening anytime soon on the floor of the Senate as to how we stop these episodes of mass slaughter. We are averaging more than one mass shooting in this country every single day this year. That is astounding. That is shocking. Yet there is total, utter, absolute silence from the world's greatest deliberative body on what we should do about it. I am the last person to say there is any panacea coming from the Congress on how to stem gun violence. We are never going to be able to eliminate these epidemic rates of gun violence just by one law or set of laws that are passed. But what is an absolute indictment of this place is that we don't even try. I have made this contention on the floor before, and I will make it again. I truly believe our silence on this has become complicity. We have become accomplices to these murders because by saying and doing nothing, we offer up a kind of quiet endorsement to people who exist in the fringes of their minds and who are thinking about contemplating violence, and the leaders of this country are doing absolutely nothing to seriously condemn or stop their destructive, malevolent behavior. Our silence has become complicit. I hope that at some point over the course of the rest of this year, we can begin a conversation as to how we can turn these numbers back in the right direction. There is no other country in the industrialized world that even comes close to these numbers. I can offer a suggestion on where to start. If between now and December we can't come to a common understanding on our gun laws--I still don't understand why we can't just do that since 90 percent of Americans support expansive background checks--let's start by fixing the mental health care system. I think there are a lot of reasons why Adam Lanza walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School and killed 20 kids over 2 years ago. The child advocate in Connecticut issued a damning report on his interactions with the mental health care system. His mother tried and tried and tried, but in the end she gave up and let him retreat into the isolation of his room, where he plotted these murders. That family and mother and young man ran into barrier after barrier and obstacle after obstacle trying to find a course of treatment for his very serious set of illnesses. What we know is that people with mental illness are much more likely to be the victims of gun violence than the perpetrators of it. There is no inherent connection between being mentally ill and being violent. There is no greater incidence of mental illness in the United States than anywhere else in the world. Yet we have epidemic rates of gun violence. But I will certainly be the first to admit that if we fix our mental health care system, it will help lots of people who have no intersections with gun violence, and it will [[Page S6924]] push these numbers downward because some of these people are committing these murders because they are not getting treatment for serious illnesses. Senator Cassidy and I--frankly, we don't agree on a lot because he is a conservative Republican from the Deep South, and I am a progressive Democrat from the Northeast--introduced a mental health reform measure which has broad bipartisan support and which would seek to break down these barriers in order to get care for the seriously mentally ill and try to get the parents more involved in the care, especially of young adults. It would increase the capacity in our mental health treatment system for both outpatient and inpatient care. Maybe over the course of the rest of this year, at the very least we can make a dent in the massive shortfalls in our behavioral health care system. The families I have become so close with in Sandy Hook, CT, commanded me to come down to the floor every week or so and tell these stories, the voices of victims. They would like us to come together on a set of meaningful changes to our gun laws. They just don't understand why Adam Lanza was able to walk into the school with a gun that killed 20 little boys and girls in less than 5 minutes because of how powerful it was with the 30-round cartridges he was able to use. They don't want our inability to get action on gun laws to stop us from making other progress that would make the next Adam Lanza less likely. Maybe we can do that. But we should do something. Our silence is an embarrassment after this summer of mass shootings. These news reports should command us to action, but we, frankly, shouldn't have had to wait for the news reports of shootings in Virginia or Louisiana or South Carolina because these numbers were just as true last year as they are this year. Maybe there are more episodes of mass violence and mass shootings and headline-grabbing atrocities, but these numbers which reflect what is happening on the ground in New Haven, CT; Hartford, CT; Boston, MA; Chicago, IL; and Los Angeles have been a reality for a long time, and we should have woken up long ago. But maybe over the course of this year we can make some progress so that moving forward there are a few less voices of victims to bring to the floor of the Senate. I thank the Presiding Officer. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Volkswagen Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I rise to speak about recent revelations that Volkswagen woefully deceived regulators and the general public to artificially lower emissions of its 2009 to 2015 Volkswagen and Audi diesel vehicles. These actions raise significant consumer, environmental, and public health concerns. According to the EPA's Notice of Violation of the Clean Air Act, Volkswagen used a sophisticated software algorithm on certain vehicles that detected when vehicles were undergoing emissions testing. This software--referred to as a ``defeat device''--allows vehicles to meet emissions standards during testing, but under normal driving situations, these same vehicles emit nitrogen oxides up to 40 times the allowable emissions standards. This is unbelievable. I think we can imagine that such technology exists, but I don't think we ever thought that one of our major international car companies would be alleged to have used it. So far approximately 482,000 diesel vehicles sold in the United States and 11 million cars worldwide have been affected. A deliberate attempt like this by a company to mislead regulators and the general public is completely unacceptable. This raises serious questions that need answers: Why did Volkswagen, for more than a year, claim that the discrepancies in the emissions tests and the levels on the road were a technical error? Who at Volkswagen signed off on the defeat device? Did executives at Volkswagen know these actions were put into place to deliberately deceive regulators and the general public? Does the EPA have the necessary testing systems in place to detect such devices that trick the software? Have other auto manufacturers of clean diesel vehicles been tampering with their software to get around emissions standards? How do we ensure that this never happens again? This is a matter of public trust. Consumers were lied to and sold a product under false pretenses. Those consumers who brought certain Volkswagen Jettas, Beetles, Passats, and certain Audis with 2-liter diesel engines believed they were purchasing a vehicle that would provide premium fuel economy and performance while also meeting strict emissions standards. Who wouldn't be enticed by these vehicles after they were named the ``Green Car of the Year'' and ``Eco-Friendly Car of the Year'' by national publications? We now know these consumers were duped and that they will now have to bring their vehicles under compliance to meet Federal emissions standards. Volkswagen will likely pay for the repairs but what about the costs of reduced fuel economy and lower resale values? Congress intentionally included strong enforceability elements into the Clean Air Act statute. Regulations promulgated under the Clean Air Act aimed to protect human health and the environment by reducing nitrogen oxide and other pollutants. Motor vehicles are the primary source of nitrogen oxide pollution from transportation. These highly reactive gases play a major role in atmospheric reactions that produce smog. That smog accelerates climate change and exacerbates respiratory diseases that harm human health, including asthma, which affects 23 million Americans, including 6 million children. That is why we have emissions standards. It is not just some far-off number that is put into place; it is to protect children from getting asthma; it is to protect the world from heating up; it is to ensure that we protect our environment for generations to come. The Clean Air Act requires automakers to certify to the EPA that their vehicles will meet applicable Federal emissions standards to control air pollution. Through this process, Volkswagen deceived regulators into believing these vehicles produced low emissions. Vehicles with the defeat device emit anywhere from 5 to 40 times more nitrogen oxide than allowed by law while on the road. If we pick a number in the middle of the range--let's say 20 times as much--it would mean that Volkswagen's fleet in the U.S. produces 46,657 more tons of harmful smog. Changes to the EPA's emissions standards testing process are needed as well. I have written to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy to express that concern. The EPA needs to explain why their systems did not detect this deceptive software and what changes the Agency will be making with their testing processes. I strongly urge the EPA to establish robust safeguards to prevent automakers from gaming the system and prevent this from happening again. There must also be a full investigation into Volkswagen's actions. The Department of Justice is conducting a criminal investigation into the company's actions, and I urge DOJ to leave no stone unturned in its investigation to determine how a company could have willfully deceived Federal regulators and the general public. Volkswagen must conduct a thorough and comprehensive public education campaign to ensure that all owners of these vehicles are made aware of the defect and are informed about where and when they can go to get their vehicle fixed. The Department of Transportation, which has expertise with vehicle recalls, should also play an active role. If we learned anything from the General Motors and Takata airbag recalls, it is that recalls need to be broad enough from the outset and cover affected vehicle models and years, the general public needs to know how and where to get their vehicle repaired, and automakers must have a system in place to make timely repairs with replacement parts that truly fix the problem. Other agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission, should also take a serious look at how they can help in this process. [[Page S6925]] As a member of both the Senate Commerce Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee, I believe that consumers must be protected. I also believe Volkswagen's competitors that actually follow the law should be able to play on an even playing field. Other car companies that follow the law did the right thing. They put the right systems in place, and they should not be penalized because one car company did this. They should have been able to play on an even playing field. If there is an uneven playing field, it hurts American employees, it hurts American companies, and mostly it hurts American consumers. The actions by Volkswagen to deliberately deceive consumers around the world about the emissions levels in their cars is fundamentally about a breach in trust. Consumers thought they were getting the same product that was being advertised, when what they were getting was a product that met those standards only when it was tested, only for 1 day, and only for the time of the emissions testing. As Federal agencies move forward with their investigation, it is critical that we get to the bottom of this to figure out how this happened, what the extent was, and if it is happening with any other automakers to ensure that what happened never happens again. Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Pilot's Bill of Rights 2 Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I wish to take advantage of an opportunity to bring up the subject that no one is talking about now. Of course, right now everyone has been in the middle of the Pope's visit and other things and what is happening with the Iran bill and the votes we have. I wish to mention there is something else very significant going on right now, that we are in the middle of, and that is the Pilot's Bill of Rights 2. To put it into perspective, 3 years ago last month we had the Pilot's Bill of Rights 1, and it was one people were not aware of. There are only 617,000 pilots in America, so it is not one of these issues that gets an awful lot of attention. But the mere fact that those 617,000 people--many of them are single-issue people. A lot of people are not aware that prior to the passage of the Pilot's Bill of Rights 3 years ago, there was just one area left within our system whereupon you are guilty until proven innocent. That is exactly what we corrected with that bill, just to refresh the memory of my colleagues. It gave the pilots who were accused of something the evidence that was used against them. I had a personal experience with it. It actually happened to me. I was never sensitive to that until such time as I experienced it myself. What we have right now is we are up to 64 cosponsors of the Pilot's Bill of Rights 2. The major part of this bill is something that is out there that doesn't resolve anything. Ten years ago, as kind of an experiment, we put in a sport pilot-eligible exemption so that the pilots of small aircraft would not have to have what they call a third- class medical. The result of this was that after a 10-year period, the medical safety experience of these pilots has been identical to those with medical certificates. A joint study was made following that by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association and by the EAA, the Experimental Aircraft Association, of the 46,976 accidents over a 6-year period. Of those, only 99 had a medical cause as a factor. That is less than one- quarter of 1 percent. Of those 99, none would have been prevented by the current third-class medical. That shows that experiment worked and there is no reason to have a third-class medical. So people are aware that some changes have been made, I want to briefly outline the modifications that have been made. The modifications require three things for pilots to qualify for an exemption. The exemption we are talking about is the exemption from having to take a third-class medical exemption process every 2 years-- sometimes more extensive than that. First, pilots will have to complete an online medical education course. Secondly, pilots have to maintain verification that they have been to a doctor at least once every 4 years and certify that they are receiving the care they need by a physician to treat any medical condition that warrants it. Third, a pilot would have to complete a comprehensive medical review by the FAA. That would be applied to a new pilot, so they establish a benchmark as to what a pilot's physical condition is. The pilot would be required to take an online medical course every 2 years. This gives the pilot access to information on medical issues that may not be covered by a doctor in a medical examination but that would have an impact on their physical condition to fly. For example, this course would make sure pilots are aware of impacts on interactions of over-the-counter and prescription medications and how these interactions could impact their flying capabilities. Requiring pilots to take this course boosts aviation safety for the aviation community. Secondly, pilots would need to complete an exam by their personal physician at least once every 4 years and include a proof of their doctor's visit in their logbooks. This resolves the problem most people are concerned about; that they would have to at least see a physician and be assured that they didn't have some condition they didn't have prior to that. Furthermore, the pilots would be required to certify that they are under the care and treatment of a doctor for any medical condition that would warrant treatment. Pilots would do this instead of visiting an aviation medical examiner every 2 years and sometimes even more frequently than that. With this modification, we are actually encouraging pilots to be honest about their health and seek treatment for it. Right now pilots are incentivized to hide any medical condition from the FAA, including by not seeking treatment for it, out of the fear that the pilot might lose his wings. We don't want that to happen. People who are not pilots do not realize how significant it is that you don't want to be taken out of the air, particularly for some reason that is not justified. Pilots, like any individual, maintain stronger relationships with their personal physician, and this is a good thing that fosters an honest dialogue between pilots and doctors, which is something we should all want and something that is not there today. We want pilots to get the treatment they need. Any medically treated pilot is safer than one who is not being treated. So for many pilots the most burdensome aspects of the FAA controversy is simply the constant churn of submitting paperwork over and over, every 2 years or less, even when there has been no change in their medical status. This bill, as modified, gives pilots a break from the bureaucracy. The third requirement for pilots to receive the third-class medical exemption is to complete one FAA medical review. So if a new pilot comes in, we need a benchmark--where is that pilot, what is his physical condition today--so as time goes by we can see how he might be changing. If someone does not have an existing medical certificate, such as new pilots who have never gone through an exam, they would have to do it before they fall into qualifying for the exemption. By the way, of the 617,000 pilots in America today, this is the one thing that concerns me more than anything else, which is to have to go back and go through the type of examination they are required to, now that we know the 10-year experiment of being exempt has worked. There is one caveat. If a pilot flying under the third-class medical exemption is diagnosed with a severe condition--let's talk about maybe a heart attack--then they need to go through the FAA special issuance process to receive medical clearance to fly again. Again, this would only be needed to be done one time. The ability of the FAA to maintain a stranglehold on pilots will be gone. I am confident the changes will result in a safer flying environment. I want to reiterate that the Pilot's Bill of Rights does not change the certification standard to obtain a pilot's certificate. All pilots still have to possess the pilot's certificate, pass the required practical tests and necessary check rides to [[Page S6926]] demonstrate that they have the knowledge, skills, and ability to safely operate their plane. Further, this bill does not change the fundamental responsibility of every pilot to self-certify their ability to fly each time they get into the cockpit of a plane. I am a pilot, and every time I get in a plane I make a conscious decision that I am fit to fly. Everyone I know who is a pilot does the same thing. Again, all of this is not necessary. When you go back and realize that over the 10 years of the experiment with a limited number of pilots there were no changes. There is no difference between those who have or have not had the pilot exams. With these changes, the third- class medical exemption and the Pilot's Bill of Rights is enjoying a greater level of support from Members of the Senate. Support from general aviation is strongly bipartisan. Sixty-four of my colleagues are cosponsors of this legislation. Half of those are Democrats and half are Republicans. Groups representing general aviation in the community and in the pilot unions have declared their support for the bill. General aviation organizations, such as the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, the Experimental Pilots Association, and the General Aviation Manufacturers Association, support the bill. The National Association of State Aviation Officials support the bill, the Allied Pilots Association and the Southwest Pilots Association, both unions which represent 23,000 pilots who fly for American Airlines, U.S. Airways, and Southwest Airlines, support the bill. Pilots for NetJets support the bill. The bill has strong bipartisan support. I urge all the Members who support general aviation and all the economic activity of general aviation to be a part of this bill. One of the reasons I am doing this today is one of the two organizations--and I am not sure which one it is, it is either the AOPA or the AA--is doing a major effort right now to encourage the pilot population out there to encourage their Members of the Senate to cosponsor this bill. Again, we currently have 64 sponsors of the bill. I can't think of any reason we can't get everyone else. The same individuals who supported it 3 years ago should be there to support it. So I encourage those few Members of the Senate who are not sponsors to look at it very carefully. It may be 617,000 people are not a lot of people, but of the 617,000 people, most of them are single-issue people. So it would be very good to join in on this. This is something we now have demonstrated clearly is not going to incur any safety hazards and it is going to be a real godsend for pilots who don't want to go through this bureaucracy every 2 years or more frequently in some cases. The bill is out there, and it is one I feel very strongly that we ought to be able to work into our floor use probably in the next very short period of time. With that, I do yield the floor because my very good friend from Delaware is here to say something profound. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware. Transportation Funding Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I don't know that I will say anything profound, but I appreciate the chairman of our committee saying that. Madam President, and fellow native West Virginian, I will show a map of the United States in just a minute, and there are some States that are delaying and some States that are cutting back on transportation projects. One of them is West Virginia. One of them is Delaware. I want to talk a little bit about that. Before I do, I would like to go back in time 10 months to the election of last year. I am reminded of the message I heard from the electorate that came out of that election. To simplify it, there were three things they were trying to tell us. No. 1, they want us to work together; No. 2, they want us to get things done; and, No. 3, they want us to get things done that will actually strengthen our economic recovery. If you go back in time to the January--the week Barack Obama and Joe Biden were inaugurated as President and Vice President, 628,000 people filed for unemployment insurance in that 1 week in January of 2009. Any time that weekly number of people filing for unemployment insurance is over 400,000, we are losing jobs in this country and in the economy. Last Thursday we got a number from the Department of Labor. Last week's number was about 265,000 who filed for unemployment. That was last week. There is a new number today--I am not sure what it was, but for the last 28 weeks that number of people filing for unemployment insurance has been under 300,000. I think that is the longest that we have been keeping track, where we had 28 consecutive weeks where fewer than 300,000 people in this country were applying for unemployment insurance. That number is way under 400,000, so we are adding jobs, and we are expecting to continue to add jobs in this country. There are still people looking for jobs in my State, there are in West Virginia, and other States as well, but when you consider the unemployment rate was about 10 percent in the early part of 2009 and today it is a little over 5 percent, we are making progress, but we can make a lot more progress. One of the ways we can make progress is by dealing with our fiscal plan and not hold the Nation's economy hostage with our inability to pass a spending plan. And God help us if we drop the ball on this again and have another shutdown. I sure hope we come to our senses and avoid doing that. My hope is that we will. One of the other ways we can strengthen our economic recovery--and it is right out there for us to seize and do--is to make sure that in a nation where roads, highways, bridges, and transit systems are deteriorating, where we need to make improvements and we need to build, frankly, new projects--new highways, bridges, roads and transit systems--at the very least we need to maintain the quality of what we have or improve the quality of road safety, surfaces, potholes, you name it. There is a lot of work to be done, and there are a lot of people who would like to do the work. The McKinsey Global Institute, an arm of the national consulting firm McKinsey, looked at what we could do for our growing GDP in this country if we fully funded a 6-year transportation plan, what we could do for an employment opportunity if we funded a 6-year transportation plan, and the numbers are remarkable--I think amazing. We were told that fully funding a 6-year transportation plan would grow our GDP by approximately 1.5 percent per year--not for 1 year but for the life of the transportation plan that we funded--probably 6 years at 1.5 percent a year. When you consider the GDP growth over the last couple years, even though it is better than it was, adding 1.5 percent of the GDP growth would help our economy grow in a robust way. We are told by McKinsey & Company's study that a 6-year transportation plan robustly funded would put about 1.8 million people to work. A lot of folks would like to be building roads, highways, and transportation systems, and they don't have employment opportunities because we are not funding them. We are not funding them. Let's take a quick look at this map if we could. The States that are gray are States, as far as we know, that are not planning to delay or cancel projects. They are not even considering delaying projects, but the States that are in red, including Delaware over here, are States that have delayed or cancelled projects. The States that are in yellow, including West Virginia, are States that are considering project delays. That is not good. I have not counted the number of States--it looks like seven--that are in red. Those are the States that have delayed projects. More than that, probably 10, are considering doing that. Why is it important for us to fully fund at the Federal level--do our share for roads, highways, bridges, transit funding? It is because about half of the money that our States spend through their departments of transportation, half their money comes from Federal user fees--largely Federal user fees--primarily, not entirely, but primarily user fees on the sale of gasoline. It has been unchanged in 23 years--not since 1993--22 years. The user fee on diesel has been unchanged for some 22 years, right where we were. The price of everything else goes up. Concrete goes up, asphalt goes up, steel goes up, and labor goes up. We have more energy-efficient vehicles. They are not using as much gas or [[Page S6927]] diesel. That is a good thing, but it is also a bad thing for having funding for transportation projects. So I want to look at a map and would invite all of us to consider it. I don't anybody who says--any economist worth their salt--who does not say: Fully funding a multi- year transportation plan, not for 6 months or 3 months, something like that, but fully funding it--robustly funding it for 6 years--will do great things for our economy. The reason we end up with job growth of something like 1.8 million people, according to McKinsey and Company, is because the economy works far more efficiently if roads, highways, bridges are operating and working well. So I just want to share that and start off my remarks today. I have some numbers here that I would like to share. So far in 2015, this year, four States--Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee, and Wyoming--have shelved some $805 million in projects due to the uncertainty over Federal funds. Again, the uncertainty is over roughly half the money that they are going to spend on roads, highways, and bridges. It comes from Federal user fees, Federal taxes. Our transportation system--at least the way we fund it--has been broken since 2008. Since that time, in the last 5 or 6 years, we have passed I think 12 short-term patches to the tune of nearly $74 billion. How do we pay for them? We pay for them with budget gimmicks. That is how we do it. And we pay for them with debt. When we issue debt, we borrow money. We sell Treasury securities, and we sell them around the world. Among the countries that buy them are China and the Chinese people. We are then beholden to them as our creditors. It puts us in a situation that I do not find too comfortable. My guess is some of you don't either. There are better alternatives to fund our Nation's transportation system. I only mentioned a couple of them. I feel as if I have not a magic wand but the ability to see into the future. Twenty years from now, I think there is a pretty good chance that we will have figured out how to pay for roads, highways, bridges, and transit systems by figuring out how to make sure those folks who use transportation pay for it. One of the ways we are trying to do that--they have been trying to do that in Oregon for almost 10 years. They have something called road user charge. Some people have heard of that term. More people have heard of something called vehicle miles traveled, and the ability to say your vehicle--I don't care what kind of vehicle it is, but we know how many miles that vehicle travels on a road, highway or bridge in the course of a year. There is fee that is attached to that. Some people are uncomfortable with that because it has implications on privacy. I can understand that. In Oregon they are trying to figure it out. They have got about 5,000 vehicles--at least--in their system. They are sort of--I like to say States are laboratories of democracy. In this case, Oregon is trying to be the laboratory. I believe California is looking at being another laboratory to figure out we make something like vehicle miles traveled work in a State. Oregon is good-sized state, and California is a very big State. If they can do that, then we will learn from them, not just at the State level but perhaps at the Federal level as well. I think we will be funding projects--not just now but in the future, 20 years from now--through tooling. When I travel back to my native State of West Virginia, I go through West Virginia and I pay tolls. When I was a little kid and they first built the turnpike, we would have to stop and find change--whatever--stop every 5 or 10 miles. You don't do that anymore. We don't do that anymore in Delaware either, because we have--in Delaware and I think in West Virginia--highway- speed E-ZPass. It is an express E-ZPass. You go through, and it is charged to your credit card that you have already established when you establish your E-ZPass plan. Also, we now have the technology that even if folks don't have an E- ZPass--in some tolling operations around the country, a person drives through in their vehicle, car, truck, van, whatever the system--when you go through the toll plaza, they don't collect a toll. They have a highly accurate camera with the ability to take pictures of the vehicle and great pictures of your license plates, and then they send a bill to the owner of that vehicle. So you don't even have to have high-speed E- ZPass. But a combination of those two, systems like E-ZPass and systems like the one I just described where people drive through with no E- ZPass or a similar system, but they actually get billed for it later on. They do not get billed and fined; they just get billed for it. If you don't pay it, then I am sure something will happen. But I think 20 years from now we will have something that looks a lot like that. My guess is we will also have user fees, but not everybody likes tolling. As it turns out, Oregon has been working on road user charge, also known as vehicle miles traveled. They have been working on it for 10 years, and they have got 5,000 people in the plan. So this is not going to happen in 5 years or 10 years, but maybe 20 years for both a combination of tolling and vehicle miles traveled. There is another idea out there that is used in some places around the country. It is called 3P or P3. When I first heard that, I thought they were talking about P-3 airplanes. I spent a lot of years of my life as a naval flight officer in P-3 aircraft. I used to command them, but they were not talking about airplanes when they were talking about P3. They were talking about public-private partnerships. We have some pretty good examples of where that is working. We can learn from those in different States. I think that can be part of the future. It ought to be. Put the three of them together, is that a comprehensive plan? Not entirely, but it is pretty good approach. It is a heck of a lot better than what we have been doing: pension smoothing, increasing fees for TSA. Instead of improving aviation safety, we put the money in the transportation trust fund. Raising Customs fees--instead of putting the money in ways to make our borders most robust and so forth, we put some of that money in the transportation trust fund. We sell oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve--I think probably at a bad time to sell it, when the price is really low. They say: Buy low, sell high. Well, if we are going to sell petroleum out of the petroleum reserve--the price of oil is about as low right now as it has been in a long, long time. I am told that--I don't know if it was last week or the week before-- there are 10,000 gasoline stations across the country where they are selling gasoline for less than $2 a gallon. I don't know what they are charging in West Virginia, but I filled up my Chrysler Town and Country minivan, which has 403,000 miles on it, and I paid $2.15 a gallon. There are some places in Delaware where people are paying less and in neighboring New Jersey where they are paying less. But right now, it does not make much sense to sell oil out of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. There are some people who want to and who want to use that money to go into the transportation trust fund. I think that is foolish. We have to be smarter than that. I have another chart I want us to take a look at. I want to thank ``Vanna White'' here for putting up these charts. I will pay for that later. This chart talks about legislation--it is kind of ironic. That is S. 1994. I mentioned earlier how the last time we raised the Federal gasoline and diesel tax or fee was in 1993 when we raised it to 18 cents for gas and about 23, 24 cents for diesel. They have been there for 22 years. One of the things I have done is introduce legislation, and I have done so with Dick Durbin, who used to serve on the Bowles-Simpson Commission--remember the Bowles-Simpson Commission. I thought it was a great approach to figure out how to seriously address our Nation's deficit in a variety of ways. One of the ways that Bowles-Simpson said we should address our deficit situation--I will say our budget deficits are down--topped out, I think, in 2009 at $1.4 trillion. This year we are down about $400 billion. Is that an improvement? Yes, it is. Do we have some ways to go? We sure do. What Bowles-Simpson suggested is that we raise the gas or diesel tax at the Federal level by a penny each quarter, a penny every 3 months for 15 quarters. So effectively you would be raising the gas or diesel tax by 3 or 4 cents a year for 4 years and index it going forward. [[Page S6928]] What Senator Durbin and I have introduced is actually something quite similar to that, which a majority of the Bowles-Simpson Commission voted for. It is called the Traffic Relief Act. What it calls for is an annual 4 cent gas increase in gas and diesel. That would be for a total of about 4 years--4 cents a year for 4 years. After that, we would index those user fees, those taxes, to the rate of inflation. The rate of inflation is pretty low lately, so they would not go up very much if the rate of inflation stays where it is. If the rate of inflation rears its head again, then that would be different. A fellow who was a member of my staff back in Wilmington, DE--when we introduced this bill, the price for gas at a station in the neighborhood where his family buys gas--in the space of 2 days, the price of gas either went up or went down by 13 cents. It went up in 2 days, 13 cents. As we know, the price of oil moves up and down all of the time. My own belief is--and I have heard this from a lot of people--there are a lot of days or a lot of weeks where the price of gas or diesel goes up a lot more than 4 cents. Right now our world is not literally awash in oil but certainly figuratively awash in oil. One of the reasons the price at the pump for gas and diesel is so low--as I said earlier, a couple of weeks ago there were 10,000 gas stations across the country selling gas for less than two bucks a gallon. One of the reasons it is so low is because the United States is producing a lot more than we have for some time, and so are a bunch of other countries, including the OPEC nations. With the approval of the Iran agreement, as the Iranians comply with the agreement--my hope is that they will comply in spirit and in letter, and then as a result of that, they will be in a position to begin selling. They have only been selling some of their oil products to customers, including I think India, maybe Japan, China, but they will be able to sell more products. A world that is already awash in oil is going to find that Iran, which I think has the fourth greatest oil reserves in the world, is going to be back in the market and selling their own products. I believe that will keep the prices from rising anytime soon. And I think there is reason to believe that the price at the pump, which is already quite low, might even go down further. Time will tell. I have one last poster board here I wish to look at for just a moment. Our legislation--this is a typo here. It says that it restores $240 billion for the highway trust fund. It is not $240 billion, it is $220 billion. Still, compared to what? Compared to nothing. Compared to doing nothing, it is a whole lot. If we had a status quo, any kind of a status quo increase--a highway bill or a transportation bill--we would use maybe half of that. So what we are talking about is double, just getting by, And we have such a backlog of work to do, that it doesn't make sense just to push enough money to these projects to get by. This would provide roughly twice that amount of money and would maybe not raise our GDP by 1.5 percent, but it would sure raise it. It may not put 1.8 million people to work over the next year, but it would put a lot of people to work and people who like to do these jobs. The money would fully fund the Federal highway and transit programs in our country. It would increase investments in upgrades and in repairs as well. It would do it in a way that doesn't drop a huge burden on users of these products--gasoline and diesel--all in one fell swoop. It is like 4 cents a year over 4 years. After 4 years, there will be a 16-cent increase. People say: Well, what is that in terms of practical impact? What does that actually mean for somebody? I am told that it is actually--I don't drink a lot of coffee, but my friends who do get a small coffee over in the Dirksen Building across the street. They pay $1.70, and if they get a medium-sized coffee, it is like $2.50, and a really big one is maybe a little bit over $3. This is not really fancy coffee but just a regular cup of coffee with cream and sugar, and the price is maybe $2 or $3. Literally for the price of a cup of coffee a week, for those of us who use roads, highways, bridges, who buy gas, who buy diesel, we could have a much better transportation system. This isn't $10 a week or $20 a week or $30 a week. That increase over 4 years--4 cents a year for 4 years--without the data for the average driver, that is about a cup of coffee a week. Is that too much to pay for roads, highways, bridges, and a good transit system? I don't think so. There is an interest in offsetting some of these increases with a regressive tax, but there is an interest in offsetting some of that by making some tweaks like Michigan is going to do with their State earned-income tax credit with a Republican Governor and Republican legislature. I think there is maybe a lesson or something we can do there to help address the regressive nature of this tax. I close by saying I come to this floor from time to time and I mention one of the things I love to do. I don't know if you ever do this, Madam President, but I love to ask people who have been married a long time ``What is the secret for being married for a long time?'' I have done it for years. I have asked this question of hundreds of people who are older folks who have been married 30 years, 40 years, 50 years, 60 years, 70 years. I ask them ``What is the secret?'' I get hilarious answers. I get some that are very poignant and others are just plain memorable for a lot of reasons. But the best answer I have ever gotten is there are two C's. What are the two C's? Communicate and compromise. That is not only the secret for a vibrant marriage between two people, it is also the secret for a vibrant democracy, to communicate and compromise. I would add a third C, and that is to collaborate. What the American people said to us last November--whether they are Republicans, Democrats, or Independents--is that they want us to communicate, they want us to compromise, and they want us to collaborate, and we need to do that. One idea I have not mentioned here bears mentioning. It was an idea that was endorsed last year by the administration and was endorsed last year by the immediate past chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, with whom our President served, Dave Camp. He retired earlier this year as a Congressman from Michigan, a very good person. What they proposed is international tax reform. What both Chairman Camp at the time and the administration said is that there are about $2 trillion in overseas profits of American companies. They are just keeping it over there and they are not that anxious to bring it back because they don't want to have to pay--I don't know--35 percent, 33 percent, 32 percent, 29 percent. They are looking for a lower tax break and then to bring it back when it makes sense. The administration and Dave Camp said: Let's deem it repatriated. The Treasury said: All right. You have money over there, American companies. Bring it back. It is going to be taxed at about 10 percent. That was the proposal. The administration said: American companies that have money over there, we want you to bring it back. You won't be taxed at 35 percent or 25 percent, but you will be taxed at about 14 percent. That is an idea, and it is an interesting idea. It doesn't solve the problem forever. It provides one-time money--quite a bit of it--for roads, bridges, rail, and for airports as well. It doesn't solve the problem permanently, but it surely gives us a lot of money. Not every company likes that idea, and not everybody who serves here likes that idea, but it is a serious idea, and it is one that deserves a lot of consideration, and I hope we will do that. Let me just say this. At the end of the day, if we come to the end of this calendar year--when we run out of money yet again for roads, highways, and bridges and we say ``Well, what are we going to do now?''--we will have not just the States I pointed out here in yellow and red that are bailing on projects, delaying and stopping them in some cases, we will have a lot more yellow and a whole lot more red on the map I had up earlier. What do we do about it? Do we just do what we have done for 5 years and kick the can down the road yet again and look for cats and dogs and wherever we can find a few bucks and sort of throw them at the problem for a while, not make a real committed effort? Frankly, we are not giving the voters in this country any reason to feel encouraged about our courage. I hope we don't do that. [[Page S6929]] If at the end of the day we don't do some kind of international tax reform, good ideas such as expanding tolling, vehicle miles traveled, and public-private partnerships--those are all good ideas, and I hope we grow them all. We are not going to have them all in place in the kind of scope we need by the end of this year. If we find ourselves at a time and place where we run out of money, where the States are looking to us and we are running out of money at the Federal level--and the price of gas is two bucks a gallon at gas stations across America--my hope is people will say: You know, for the price of a cup of coffee, I could have good roads, highways, bridges, and transit systems again. For the price of a cup of coffee a week, I could have that. Forty cents a week, maybe. Maybe that is not a bad deal for their family or for our country. I want people to think about that. In the weeks to come, I am going to be talking a lot about this proposal. My hope is that as time goes buy, people will say--like my dad used to say in West Virginia when my sister and I were little kids growing up and they were in West Virginia--my dad used to say to my sister and me after we had done yet another boneheaded stunt: Just use some common sense. He said that a lot. He did not say it that nicely. But I think this may be an opportunity for us to use some of that common sense here, and I know he would approve, and at the end of the day, so would the voters of America. There are a number of States that have actually done what I am talking about. They have raised their user fees, and in some cases they have phased them in over a couple of years. It is interesting what happened in the elections last year where the State legislators had voted to do that, where they raised the user fees in order to would pay for roads, highways, and bridges. Interestingly enough, the legislators who voted for that--Republicans--didn't get thrown out of office. Ninety-five percent of them were reelected. They won their primaries, they won their general elections, and they were reelected. The Democrats who voted for those modest user fees increases didn't get thrown out of office either. In the States that raised the money locally to make the improvements that were needed in transportation, 90 percent of the Democrats won their primaries and they won their general elections. They were reelected. People want us to make hard choices here. They don't want us to continue to kid them or fool them; they want us to do the real thing. They want us to work together. They want us to get things done. They want us to strengthen our economic recovery, and this is not a bad way to do that. With that, I see a great American from New Mexico has joined us. He is somebody who has worked with the Senator from Louisiana and the Senator who was just here before, Mr. Inhofe, the chairman of the EPW Committee, to try to find a good way for us to strengthen the economic recovery and at the same time to further clean our air, promote public health, and do good things for our public environment. I wish to say to Tom Udall how proud I am to be his colleague and how much I appreciate his leadership position on a very important issue, an environmental law that hasn't been updated in almost 40 years and, frankly, doesn't work. It has never worked, and we need to do something about it. Under his leadership, along with our other two colleagues, my hope is that we will. I look forward to what he has to say. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico. TSCA Mr. UDALL. Madam President, thank you very much for the recognition. I wish to say to Senator Carper about TSCA that we have been working on--you were one of the early Senators who really cared about this issue. You were involved with it, and you helped it develop. Over time, we did a marvelous thing in terms of improving what Senator Frank Lautenberg had put on the table, bipartisan--he developed a lot of Republican and Democratic support--and you were a key player all the way through. So we know--we think at this point, you and I believe--and we do a lot of visiting around on both sides of the aisle--that this is ready to go. We now have I think 53 cosponsors. We are developing more cosponsors every day, and we don't think there is any real hostility toward the bill in terms of wanting amendments that aren't relevant. That is a key factor for us, and both sides need to focus on that. I would like to express my appreciation to you for what you have done on TSCA to help blend it into and make it into a bipartisan product. We have been trying--you know, it has been very busy with the Pope in town, with the sequester facing us and the shutdown and things such as that. We have been trying to get onto the floor to talk about this, and I think we are going to continue to do that in the future. But it is tremendously important that this gets some floor time now, and I know you have been working on that with me. Do you see this as a product that is better than current law? I mean, my sense is it is much better than the current law. Mr. CARPER. If I could respond to my friend, I have a friend who-- when you ask him ``How are you doing?'' he says ``Compared to what?'' And when we talk about the legislation initially introduced by Senator Lautenberg, Senator Vitter, and now coauthored by you, Senator Vitter, and Senator Inhofe, with input from a number of us, I always say: Well, compared to what? The idea here is to ensure that the EPA does its due diligence on toxic substances in this country. And there are thousands or tens of thousands of chemicals--you know better than I do--that exist in our environment--in our air, our ground, in water--tens of thousands. Are they all toxic? No. But my recollection--correct me if I am wrong in this, but I think that out of those thousands, tens of thousands, I believe the EPA in the last 38 years has actually done their due diligence on really fewer than 200, maybe even fewer than 10 when you get down to it, maybe even just 5. And you say: How long has this bill been around, this law been around? Thirty-eight years. And they have now finished work on five highly toxic substances? If we can't do better than that, we ought to quit, and this is not the time to quit. It is sort of like football. You take the kickoff, and you are in your own territory and you start marching down the field. You get into the other team's territory, get down to the 20-yard line, and you are in the red zone--not in the end zone, but you are in the red zone. I think with your leadership and that of our colleagues, we are in the red zone. We need to bring this onto the floor with 53 cosponsors equally divided between Democrats and Republicans. There is a lot of interest in the House, and I think there is support from the administration. We ought to get this done. Thank you. Mr. UDALL. Madam President, it bears repeating. Senator Carper is very modest, and he is a humble man, but he has done a lot to help bring us to this point. I think he is one of the Senators here who work the best across the aisle, and that is what has happened. We have had a lot of Senators who have wanted to work across the aisle on this bill. As Senator Carper knows, on the Environment and Public Works Committee, he was joined by Senator Booker, Senator Whitehouse, and Senator Merkley in terms of helping to mark up the bill and make it a better product. When the Senator talks about going across the finish line, with 53 cosponsors about evenly divided between Democrat and Republican--I think it is almost exactly even--that sends a signal to our majority leader that this has tremendous support in both caucuses. I believe the Presiding Officer here is on the bill. So everybody standing on the Senate floor right now is on what is a good, bipartisan product. So we are going to work very carefully in the next couple of days to see that attention is brought to this, and hopefully we will have an opportunity to have a debate with amendments and then meet with the House. The House, as Senator Carper knows, has already passed a piece of legislation, I think 378 to 1--1 person in the House opposing it. So we have a bill that is alive and ready to go, and we need to get it out [[Page S6930]] of the Senate so we can conference it with the House and get it to the President's desk for his signature. I don't know if the Senator has any other thoughts on what is the best way to move forward. I mean, obviously we have to be bipartisan, but at this particular point, is it the Senator's sense we are ready to go, from everything he has seen from the Environment and Public Works Committee and these other Senators in various places? Is it ready to go? Mr. CARPER. If I may respond to my colleague's question, I don't care if the majority leader is a Republican or a Democrat--they are always trying to figure out how do we have time on the calendar to get this stuff done. They are always looking at ways. And one of the best ways to ensure legislation actually fits into a reasonably small period of time is to line up bipartisan support. I tell my colleague, I have been here in the Senate for a while, and this is almost a picture-book way to pass legislation: Work it up through the grassroots--Democratic Lautenberg and Republican Vitter and now with your role and others. There are not many bills in the Senate that have 26 or 27 Democrats and an equal number of Republicans. Has everything been worked out? No. Is there a need for amendments? Yes. Is there a need for a filibuster? No. We should bring it to the floor. I think we should go to the majority leader and visit with him early and often and continue to remind him. And those who believe in this, whether they happen to be on the environmental side or happen to be folks in the health care arena or maybe on the manufacturing side--and we thank those who have helped us draft this--we ask for them not to be silent about it but to urge not just us but the leadership to find time--a couple of days--to bring this bill to the floor and just get it done. With that, I say to my colleague and the Presiding Officer, if I put down my microphone and pack up my bag, I can have dinner with my wife in the First State of Delaware, and that is my goal. So I will bid you adieu. Mr. UDALL. I thank the Senator. I wish you Godspeed on that train headed to Wilmington because you have a wonderful wife. Mr. CARPER. Well, it is not the last train to Clarksville, but it is the next train to Wilmington. Mr. UDALL. And let me say again that not only on TSCA, as Senator Carper held, we were going to have speeches earlier in the week, but we were unable, with some of the scheduling issues and everything, to get down here and talk as a group. We had Senator Whitehouse, who was going to come down, and Senator Merkley was going to come down, as well as several of the key members of the Environment and Public Works Committee who played such a big role in terms of moving this bill forward. The person who really kicked this off was Senator Frank Lautenberg. What a star in terms of bipartisanship. I remember working with him when I was on the Environment and Public Works Committee for a long period of time on a very substantive piece of legislation. It was so good, we couldn't find much bipartisanship on it, and he understood that. It got out of the committee. It wasn't ready for prime time here on the floor, and so what we ended up doing was saying we need to go back to square one. Senator Lautenberg took that very seriously. He met with Senator Vitter. Senator Manchin played a role in that, and Senator Manchin was one of the ones who were going to come to the floor to talk, and he played a role in getting them together. As a result, a bipartisan bill came out in the last Congress. That has continued now for almost 2\1/2\ years, and it is a very good product. Madam President, the American people want a government that works, not one that shuts down to send a message. They want a Congress that moves the Nation forward, not one that grinds to a halt. They want a responsible budget that supports working families and strengthens our economy and creates jobs. These should be our priorities, not an attack on women's health care. I understand some people have strong views about a woman's right to choose that are different from mine. There are strong differences of opinion on many important issues in this Senate and in the Congress-- health care, energy, climate change, foreign policy. We could make a very long list. I read an insightful quote the other day from my good friend Republican Senator Lamar Alexander. Senator Alexander said: ``If we had a shutdown every time we had a dispute over a contentious issue, the government would never open.'' I think that is a very wise observation. We do have many differences, but, most importantly, we must have the broader national interest in mind. The clock is ticking. Funding runs out in just a few days. We need a clean continuing resolution, and we need it now--a temporary funding bill just to keep the lights on. Have we forgotten what happened 2 years ago? The people of my home State of New Mexico have not forgotten. We were badly hurt by the shutdown then, and we would be badly hurt by a shutdown now. In Los Alamos and Sandia, our two DOE labs are working on modernizing aging nuclear weapons systems to keep them safe and secure. It is foolish to cause unnecessary disruption to projects of this significance where there is no margin for error. Each of these labs employs thousands of people, many of them scientists at the top of their field. Why would we threaten their paychecks and the important national security work they are doing? We have three Air Force bases in New Mexico--Cannon, Kirtland, and Holloman--all serving a variety of unique national security missions for our country. White Sands Missile Range, unlike any facility in the country, provides critical research and testing for future technologies. Shutdowns and sequestration send a terrible message to the men and women at these facilities. It limits their effectiveness and harms the economies in nearby communities, such as Clovis, Albuquerque, Alamogordo, and Dona Ana County. Shutdowns mean lost jobs and lost revenue, all in the face of a struggling economy. We cannot afford another government shutdown, and we cannot afford a return to sequester cuts. These are bad choices. These are self-inflicted wounds. A clean CR will keep the government open, but we need a long-term cure. We need a bipartisan budget agreement--one that makes smart investments and meets the real needs of American families. The people of my State work hard. Many are still struggling. The economy of New Mexico has not yet recovered completely from the recession. We know New Mexicans want us to come together and push for a stronger recovery. New Mexicans are eager for solutions, and they are tired of these political games that threaten jobs and weaken our economy. Yet here we are once again facing a manufactured crisis. We all know that in fiscal year 2016, which begins next week, the Murray-Ryan budget deal will expire and we will be left with a return to sequestration. As ranking member of the interior subcommittee on the Committee on Appropriations, I would like to talk about that today because the impacts of the funding levels required by the Budget Control Act are clear and they are very destructive. Just look at the Senate Interior appropriations bill reported out of the committee in June. To stay within the spending limits we faced under sequestration, it slashes more than $2 billion from the President's budget request. That means it doesn't provide enough funding for basic water infrastructure or to protect our public lands or to fulfill our trust responsibility to American Indians and Alaska Natives. I know my chairman, Senator Murkowski, did the very best she could with the allocation she was given, but here is the reality: The Budget Control Act caps don't meet the needs of our Nation. They fail critical programs. They fail our communities in New Mexico and nationwide. Our Nation faces an infrastructure crisis. Yet the Senate bill cuts grants to States for water and sewer infrastructure by more than $500 million below fiscal year 2015 levels. Actions have consequences, and here are the consequences of the Senate bill: Some 230 communities will not have their water projects funded, 14,000 construction jobs will not be created, and [[Page S6931]] $1 billion in matching and leveraged funds from State partners will be lost. The Senate bill also shortchanges the National Park Service with $318 million less than the President requested. That means 1,000 fewer park rangers. That means $150 million less to maintain our national parks even though the Service will celebrate its centennial in 2016 and will host a record number of visitors at national parks nationwide. We have 15 national parks in New Mexico, including our newest national park, the Valles Caldera National Preserve. These parks and other public lands in my State are critical not only for conservation but for our economy. A shutdown would be a disaster; sequestration is just a slower moving disaster. Carlsbad Caverns National Park, Bandelier National Monument, Tent Rocks National Monument, Bosque Del Apache Wildlife Refuge, and many other sites are key economic assets. These sites help grow jobs, they help communities grow, and they are great conservation assets in communities across the country. We cannot keep asking them to do more and more on less. Yet, without a sensible budget, that is exactly where we are headed in New Mexico and across the Nation. The Senate Interior appropriations bill also cuts more than $300 million from the President's request for the Indian Health Service. We have a solemn trust responsibility to Native Americans, and we are failing. Again, these are not just numbers. The impact is very real and very painful. It means the Indian Health Service will fund 20,000 fewer doctor visits in 2016 and nearly 1,000 fewer hospital stays. It means falling further behind. We need a responsible budget to meet our obligation to the Indian Health Service and other tribal programs, such as housing, school construction, Indian education. All of those are being hurt by this sequestration budget. We cannot continue being shortsighted. We can't keep shortchanging programs that make a real difference in the lives of all Americans. This includes art and cultural programs, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and funding for our national forests and wildlife refuges. And the list goes on and on. The time is now, and we are running out of time. We are on the wrong train, on the wrong track, and going nowhere. Fortunately, there is a solution. Let's pass a clean CR, and let's work together to pass a budget that actually meets the needs of our Nation, with sensible funding levels for defense and nondefense programs alike. Before I wrap up my remarks, I wish to call attention to another deadline that is fast approaching. The authorization for the Land and Water Conservation Fund will expire on September 30 if this Congress doesn't act. Recently, I was one of 53 Members who called on the leadership of this Chamber to pass an extension of the law, and I want to reiterate that call today. The Land and Water Conservation Fund just celebrated its 50th birthday. It enjoys strong bipartisan support because the idea behind it is so simple and so powerful. When this Nation develops one natural resource--our oil and gas reserves--we invest some of the proceeds in other critical conservation priorities. For five decades now, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has protected our national parks, forests, and other public lands. It helps ensure hunting, fishing, and recreational access, and it improves and expands our local parks and recreation facilities. The program has been a tremendous success and has had a tremendous impact on my State, from urban refuges--such as the Valle de Oro--to wide open preserves such as the Valles Caldera. It provides crucial funding to preserve open spaces, strengthen the economy, and enhance our way of life. LWCF allows us to leverage today's resources to protect vital lands and waters for future generations. Allowing the law to expire breaks that compact. It doesn't make any sense, and it doesn't have to happen. We shouldn't let the Land and Water Conservation Fund expire, even for a single day. I call on this Chamber to act swiftly to permanently authorize this important program and ensure that it is fully funded. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, those of us who believe in protecting innocent and precious life may have lost a vote today, but we are steadily winning a larger argument--a critical argument that goes to the heart of who we want to be as a society. We can feel momentum for life on the rise just as we see extremism on the other side increasing. By placing their allegiance with the far left instead of women, Democrats are making a losing bet they will come to regret over the long term. Today, however, we must grapple with the challenges of the present. Democrats' insistence on blocking the strategy pursued today means we have to consider the options now before us. The reality is that the government will shut down next week if Congress does not act. The president of Right to Life said to those of us who believe in protecting life: There are two different roads we can take. One is to insist that no more money go to Planned Parenthood and cause a government shutdown (which won't result in actually defunding Planned Parenthood). The other is to take a slightly longer- term approach, taking advantage of the fact that we have the attention of the country as probably never before. . . . Every well-informed pro-lifer wants to defund Planned Parenthood. I want to defund Planned Parenthood. There are wonderful pro-life men and women in Congress who want to defund Planned Parenthood. And, certainly National Right to Life wants to defund Planned Parenthood. The difference here is in strategy. This is not the end of this debate or this discussion. I urge colleagues to join me in supporting the legislation I am about to file which would ensure that the government remains open. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",package_114_55.csv,177942,177942,178016,"[congressional record volume 161, number 138 (thursday, september 24, 2015)] [senate] [pages s6910-s6931] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] hire more heroes act of 2015 the presiding officer. under the previous order, the senate will resume consideration of h.j. res. 61, which the clerk will report. the legislative clerk read as follows: a joint resolution (h.j. res. 61) amending the internal revenue code of 1986 to exempt employees with health coverage under tricare or the veterans administration from being taken into account for purposes of determining the employers to which the employer mandate applies under the patient protection and affordable care act. pending: mcconnell (for cochran) amendment no. 2669, making continuing appropriations for the fiscal year ending september 30, 2016. mcconnell amendment no. 2670 (to amendment no. 2669), to change the enactment date. mcconnell amendment no. 2671 (to amendment no. 2670), of a perfecting nature. mcconnell amendment no. 2672 (to the language proposed to be stricken by amendment no. 2669), to change the enactment date. mcconnell amendment no. 2673 (to amendment no. 2672), of a perfecting nature. mcconnell motion to commit the joint resolution to the committee on appropriations, with instructions, mcconnell amendment no. 2674, to change the enactment date. mcconnell amendment no. 2675 (to (the instructions) amendment no. 2674), of a perfecting nature. mcconnell amendment no. 2676 (to amendment no. 2675), of a perfecting nature. the presiding officer. under the previous order, the time until 2 p.m. will be equally divided between the leaders or their designees. the senator from utah. remembering elder richard g. scott mr. lee. mr. president, i rise today to pay tribute to elder richard g. scott, a member of the quorum of the twelve apostles of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints, who passed away september 22, 2015, at the age of 86. richard g. scott had the razor-sharp mind of an engineer, fused with the tender softness of a disciple's soul. a graduate of george washington university in mechanical engineering, who did post-graduate training in nuclear engineering, he had a brilliant mind with an uncanny capacity for formulas, projections, and calculations. yet he became known throughout the world for an enormous heart with an equally uncanny capacity to love and to have empathy for people from every walk of life. elder scott's gentle voice invited all who had lost their way, who had given up hope or had wandered far to come home, home to the faith, family, and community that would bring them real peace and lasting, genuine joy. countless individuals around the world heard his invitation to come home and rightly felt that he was talking directly to them. ever in search of the one who was lost--elder scott's words and witness of jesus christ served as the lower lights upon the shore to gently guide many a wanderer home. elder scott had an extraordinary depth of empathy, particularly for those who silently suffered and anxiously sought for relief, redemption, and renewal in the midst of life's storms. he, himself, was a man acquainted with grief, having lost two young children and later his wife jeanene to untimely deaths. he also seemed to intimately understand the feelings of deep discouragement, overwhelming uncertainty, as well as the crushing avalanche of personal inadequacy that can descend upon the human soul during difficult days and trying times. yet he continually stood as a beacon of hope to those who struggled because he knew with an absolute certainty to what source we should look for strength and security during such days and at such times. his complete love for and belief in the divine potential of each and every soul led him to speak plainly, powerfully, and often with tender, heartfelt, personal feelings. he urged the struggling as well as the faithful to cast aside any behavior, habit or belief that weighed them down or kept them from living up to their full potential. members of the lds church all around the world often felt, as they watched him speak, that he was not only speaking specifically to them but also that he was looking straight into their souls. in truth, he was just speaking with such love, empathy, and genuine compassion that he empowered his listeners to look into their own hearts and see what their savior saw in them. elder scott saw people not for where they were currently positioned on the road of life but for the potential each person had to do, be, and become more. he once declared: ``we become what we want to be by consistently being what we want to become each day.'' elder scott's vision extended far beyond the struggles of mortality; he focused on raising our sights to higher things, grander places, and more noble thoughts. [[page s6911]] the role of the family as the bulwark of society was paramount in his life and teachings. elder scott often expressed his belief in the unparalleled power and influence that a man and a woman, equally yoked as husband and wife, could have on children and communities. he taught that in marriage oneness is not sameness and of the vital importance of valuing our differences. to illustrate, he once declared: ``i may not know what it means to be a woman, but i do know what it means to be taught by one and to love one with all my heart and all my soul.'' his love for his wife jeanene was legendary and was forever sprinkled into his sermons. i take comfort in knowing that after nearly 20 years, elder scott has gone to that heavenly home he so often pointed to and is once again united with jeanene. one of elder scott's colleagues described him as a clever teacher. his formula for teaching was not of the engineering variety but rather followed a pattern described in a hymn by lorin wheelwright entitled ``help me teach with inspiration,'' which says: help me teach with inspiration; grant this blessing, lord, i pray. help me lift a soul's ambition to a higher, nobler way. help me reach a friend in darkness; help me guide him thru the night. help me show thy path to glory by the spirit's holy light. help me find thy lambs who wander; help me bring them to thy keep. teach me, lord, to be a shepherd; father, help me feed thy sheep. elder richard g. scott was indeed an inspired teacher, a leader, and lifter of people. his amazing mind and compassionate soul enabled him to help engineer a path for all of us to return home. mr. flake. will the senator yield? mr. lee. i yield to the senator. mr. flake. mr. president, i just wish to second what has been said about elder scott and appreciate the senator from arizona--or utah, taking the time to say it. one of my fondest memories of being in congress was at one point showing elder scott around a bit of the capitol. he knew it well. he had been here before, but it was my privilege and honor to be with him at that time. it has been my privilege and honor over many years to hear him at general conference and other venues exhorting people to follow the example of christ and to love their families, love their wives. to see him pass now after such dedicated service for so long, it is truly wonderful for him to be reunited with his wife and for his family to reflect on a life of service. i thank the senator for his comments and wished to add my own. i yield back. mr. lee. mr. president, i thank my distinguished colleague from arizona for his kind remarks regarding elder scott. i would also remark, just briefly, that my late father, himself an arizonan, would be pleased to hear me referred to as a senator from arizona, given that i was born there. the presiding officer. the senator from washington. mrs. murray. mr. president, i think many of us today have been struck with a serious case of deja vu because once again, with a government shutdown looming, some republicans continue to pander to their base with a political show vote instead of working with democrats to prevent a budget crisis. once again, it is women's health that is being used as a tea party political football, with republicans attempting to cut off women's access to care, and once again workers and families across our country are watching congress and wondering whether their elected officials can do the absolute bare minimum. the government shutdown that republicans pushed us into in 2013 did nothing to help them repeal the affordable care act, but it did have real consequences for families and communities we represent. workers didn't know when they would get their next paycheck. businesses felt the sting of fewer customers. families across the country lost even more trust that elected officials in washington, dc, could get anything done. in my home state of washington, thousands of employees at joint base lewis-mcchord were sent home with no return in sight. startups couldn't get small business loans, national parks such as mount rainier shut down. it kept families away from true national treasures and customers away from small businesses that rely on their tourism. after all of that, i had hoped republicans would learn their lesson, especially because once that economy-rattling exercise in futility came to an end, i was proud to work with the republican budget chairman, paul ryan, to do what we shouldn't have needed a shutdown to get done-- negotiate a 2-year bipartisan deal that prevented another government shutdown. it restored critical investments in priorities such as education, research, and defense jobs and showed our families that government can get something done when both sides are willing to come to the table and compromise. that deal was an important reminder that governing by crisis simply does not work. unfortunately, now it seems that some of my republican colleagues have forgotten that, because instead of working across the aisle on another bipartisan budget deal, as democrats have pushed them to do for months, some republicans are once again using a looming fiscal deadline as an opportunity to pander to their base, no matter what that means for our workers and families who are wondering whether government will still be running in a few days. since they clearly need another reminder, attacking women's health does not keep the government open and these shutdown threats will not work. it didn't work in 2011, when house republicans tried to defund planned parenthood in the budget at the very last minute. it didn't work in 2013, when extreme members of the gop were dead set on repealing obamacare, and they will not work today. i am going to be proud to vote against this partisan attempt to defund planned parenthood and take critical health care services away from millions of people. then i hope that finally republicans will remember what they should have learned last congress: accept that enough is enough and make sure that women, workers, families, and our economy are protected from a completely unnecessary crisis. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. coats. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. wasteful spending mr. coats. mr. president, since february i have been coming to the senate floor every week to talk about the waste of the week. back in 2010, when i made the decision to answer a call to run for the senate again, one of the primary reasons for my decision to go forward was my alarm over the plunge into debt and rising deficit that was taking place. at the time, the national debt of this country was a little over $10 trillion. it is alarming to note that as i stand here 5 years later, our debt has nearly doubled. it's over $18 trillion in just the 5 years i have been here. there were alarm bells ringing in 2010, and those alarm bells were saying that we cannot stay on this course, that it is going to come back to haunt us someday, that it will affect our economy, that it will affect our credit rating. someday the bill collector will be at the door of the taxpayer saying: you have to pay up big time or we are going to go into default. what took place going forward from that was a series of efforts--some of them very equally bipartisan by both republicans and democrats who were alarmed at where we were and wishing to come together to persuade the president to work with us and put us on a path toward fiscal responsibility. that work involved any number of proposals and iterations. we all remember the so-called gang of 6, the committee of 12, the joint committee on deficit reduction, and various others who had plans. it was the dominating issue of our time during the first couple of years of my return here in 2011 and 2012. after the election of 2012, when the president was reelected, at his own initiative he reached out to a few republicans--i was one of them-- and said: i am willing to sit down and work together to deal with this. this is a [[page s6912]] major issue affecting the future of our country, affecting our economy. i was encouraged that after the election and when no longer seeking any further office, the president would be willing to seriously work with us. we did serious work for several months. the president's top three appointees--the head of the office of management and budget, his chief of staff, and his political director--met with eight of us on a regular basis, both here in the capitol and at the white house. we had agreed we would not have any public meetings. we would not have staff. it would just be members and the president's designated individuals. we did not broadcast what we were doing because we knew it would become public and then political and therefore perhaps end up with the same fate all the other efforts had resulted in. we got to the end of that, and in the end, even though we made an extraordinary number of concessions to the president, even though we essentially had put together a package of items he himself had suggested in his budget plans that we could accomplish in slowing down the growth of government, the spending, and the deficits every year that were rolling out and plunging us into debt, we came up short. at that point, it became very clear to me that we were not going to be able to achieve a long-term plan for putting us on the road to good fiscal health. so i thought: ok, i am hearing from a lot of colleagues here in the senate but also from other outside sources saying that under sequester we just can't cut any more. we need more revenue to expand necessary spending projects in government. and while some essential functions that only government can do might need that type of attention, there is a range of things that you really have to question why they are on the books in the first place. a number of my colleagues--particularly former senator coburn--took this floor often--as i did, as well as others--to point out areas where not the republican party had decided, where not individuals representing our party had decided, but where nonpartisan agencies of the government--the general accounting office, the congressional budget office, the office of management and budget at the white house--had investigated and produced examples of spending that were either waste, fraud, or abuse, and had no legitimate qualification to stay on the books. so we started looking into this. thanks to senator coburn and others, we have come up with a number of things we could easily take off the books, easily use to pay for essential things, easily use to reduce our deficit spending, keep from going into debt, return money to the taxpayers, or however we wanted to do it. so we started to accumulate that, and our goal was to reach $100 billion to simply defy the myth going around that there is not a penny we can cut and that we have done all we can do. so over the 20-some times i have been on this floor, we have come up with a number of issues which could save the taxpayer money and certainly need to be addressed. our current total is now well over $100 billion, and today we are adding $10.5 billion to our $100 billion total. we are now at $116 billion. i said we would stop at $100 billion, but the examples keep rolling in, and so we are going to keep going every week. as long as this cycle of the senate is in session, i will come to the floor and label yet another example of waste. last month, when i was home in indiana, coming down from northwest indiana to our capital city of indianapolis on interstate 65 for the umpteenth time--as i drive from north to south or south to north on that road, i pass through wind farms of literally thousands of windmills. interestingly enough, and as i observed even this time, many of them are not turning. there are windmills--a few of them turning-- driven by the wind, but most of them are not turning. we have thousands of these, and it looks as if fewer than 100 or a comparable number are operating, and so i am wondering why and whether the taxpayer is getting a good deal on this. i want to give a little bit of history of how all this came to be put in place. back in the early 1990s--in fact, in 1992--the congress passed the energy policy act of 1992, which included the renewable electricity production tax credit, called the ptc. the point was that as we looked at alternative ways to produce electricity to reduce our dependence on oil and fossil fuels, there was a tax credit created for those using windmills to create power. it was designed to be claimed if the wind farm was actually making the power. earlier i said that many times i have come down that road and i have seen windmills that were idle. but the blades had to be turning and the electricity had to be being produced in order to receive that tax credit. at the time, because i thought we were overly dependent on middle eastern oil and that it was creating issues for us geopolitically and militarily and otherwise, i thought it would be good to have a stimulus here to support the creation of wind energy, to give us the ability to stand on our own and have less dependence on middle eastern oil. the main reason i supported it is because it was to start the process and incentivize diverse energy sources to get them off the ground. it was going to be a short-term boost to help these new energy sources become competitive. the original credit was designed under the law to last only 5\1/2\ years and then there would no longer be this credit. well, like any other credit, subsidy, or anything else passed here which provides taxpayer support for production of something, it never expires. few if any of them expire on the expiration date. so once again, once you get a law on the books, once you get a credit on the books, once you get a subsidy on the books, you can't get it off. since the time the original bill passed, the wind industry and its supporters have repeatedly come to congress and said: just give us a few more years and then wind will be competitive, without taxpayer subsidies. as a result, this 5\1/2\-year program, which started in 1992, has been extended multiple times. in 2013, nearly two decades after the time the subsidies expired, congress changed the rules so the facilities only have to begin construction before the expiration date to automatically qualify for a future 10-year subsidy, even before those windmills become operational. so if someone is just in the business of building windmills, as some of our major companies are, they are going to qualify for the subsidy. they are going to get the tax credit--whether or not the windmills are needed. they can just pour some concrete and start the building process, and they are going to qualify for the credit. the result is that more and more wind facilities are being constructed irrespective of the needs of the electricity grid or market demand. just last year, warren buffett, who is a smart investor, noted that wind isn't profitable without subsidies. he said: for example, on wind energy, we get a tax credit if we build a lot of wind farms. that's the only reason to build them. they don't make sense without the tax credit. so regardless of the demand, regardless of whether or not those windmills need to be turning and generating electricity, regardless of whether or not that electricity can be put into the grid--and, by the way, the cost of wind energy is three to four times the cost of fossil fuel energy--regardless of any of that, the tax credit is there. in 2014 congress retroactively extended the wind tax credit at the end of the year, and the general assumption here in congress is that the production tax credit will once again be extended at the end of this year. that is probably going to happen. according to an estimate from the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation, if we continue and extend this tax credit, this will add another $10.5 billion to our budget. clearly, it is way past time to end this seemingly never-ending subsidy. it is time to give the hardworking taxpayers savings, and it is time to stop wasteful spending. if we can prevent congress from just automatically extending this way beyond the original 5\1/2\ years, decades beyond, we can save the taxpayers $10.5 billion. so today i am adding to this chart and picture here $10.5 billion, which now totals $116 billion-plus in terms of money that falls under the category of waste, fraud, and abuse. my colleagues cannot come down to this floor and say we can't cut a penny more of any program and defend the numerous--now [[page s6913]] well more than 20--examples of what have been defined as waste, fraud, and abuse--not by me, not by the republican party, but by nonpartisan agencies of the federal government. there it is. stay tuned for next week's ``waste of the week.'' i yield the floor. ms. mikulski. mr. president, it is time give it our best to move america forward and give americans a fair shot. let's show the american people that we can work across the aisle and across the dome to get the job done. instead, here we are facing another shutdown showdown. there is no reason for there to be a government shutdown. republican leadership does not want a shutdown. democrats don't want a shutdown. there may be some drama, but we intend to keep the government open and avoid shutdown, slamdown politics. i hoped the senate had learned its lesson in october 2013, when republicans shut down government over the affordable care act, or this february 2015, when republicans threatened the department of homeland security with shutdown over immigration policy. senate democrats won't be threatened and bullied into accepting poison pill riders. serious policy issues like family planning and reproductive health deserve serious debate rather than becoming an ``add on'' rider to a funding bill. shutdowns are bad for everyone, jeopardizing family checkbooks, business bottom lines, and the federal checkbook. a shutdown makes it impossible for federal agencies to meet missions that serve the american people. a shutdown means furloughed federal employees and contractors; delayed tax returns; delayed small business loans; and delayed contracts. uncertainty slows economic growth and hurts the health and well-being of the entire nation. when the government was closed for 16 days in 2013, the shutdown hurt our growing economy, sacrificing 120,000 private sector jobs. billions of dollars of economic output was lost. we lost 6.6 million work days, about 850,000 federal employees were sent home. my home state was hit particularly hard. maryland is home to many federal agencies. it was not just the federal workers that got hurt. the baltimore sun wrote about jay angle, the owner of salsa grill, a peruvian restaurant in woodlawn outside the social security administration. every day, 4,700 workers go to work at social security, but only 500 were on the job during the shutdown. salsa grill counts on the social security workers as customers, but they were not there. there were stories like jay's all over the country. because of the 2013 shutdown, hundreds of patients could not enroll in clinical trials at the national institutes of health, nih, so their last chance for a miracle was delayed or denied. about 8,000 rural families had their home loan decisions delayed, pushing the american dream down the road. head start grantees in seven states closed, leaving 7,200 children at home and families searching for high quality child care. avoiding a shutdown is just the first step. we also need a new budget deal to cancel sequester. right now our budget caps spending, but it does not cap tax breaks for billionaires and corporations that send jobs overseas. americans are angry. they feel the rules are rigged against them and that those who write the rules don't care. but democrats do care. we believe the people deserve a government on their side. that is why we are fighting to make sure the american people have a government that works as hard as they do. we have three steps to meet that goal. first, no government shutdown. we need to pass a clean, short-term continuing funding resolution with no poison pill riders to keep the government funded and open for business for as short a time as possible. after all, a yearlong cr just locks in sequester. the cr will give us time to take the second step, negotiating a new budget agreement that cancels sequester and lifts the spending caps equally for defense and nondefense spending so we can protect our national security and give the american people a fair shot. after the new budget agreement is reached, we will take the third step, writing and enacting an omnibus spending bill. remember, the appropriations committee needs 30 days to get the job done once we have our topline. that is my plan to cancel sequester and put the american people first. why do we want to cancel sequester? sequester requires draconian cuts to critical programs that will have consequences for american families for a generation. sequester was supposed to be so arbitrary and unthinkable that it would drive congress to a budget deal. but gridlock, hammerlock, and deadlock kept that from happening. it was the reality of sequester that led congress to negotiate the murray-ryan budget deal that provided sequester relief for 2014 and 2015. now we have got deja vu. we need a new agreement to cancel sequester- level spending in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. the republican budget for fiscal year 2016 calls for spending at the sequester level of $1.017 trillion. the president's budget request asks for $74 billion more. that may sound like a big number, but it is hardly expensive. it is equal to the 2010 level--6 years ago. we must cancel sequester to give americans a fair shot by investing in our country and our people. sequester hurts national security. according to army chief of staff general raymond odierno, only 33 percent of our brigades are ready to fight. without sequester relief, the army will not be truly ready to fight until 2025. sequester keeps us from building and maintaining our physical infrastructure. funding to build roads, bridges, and transit creates jobs while easing peoples commutes to their jobs. sequester deepens our innovation deficit. funding for basic research is an investment in jobs today and jobs tomorrow. new ideas and discoveries lead to startups that rev up our economy and find new cures for deadly diseases. under spartan budgets, nih funding has not kept up with inflation. even the increases proposed under the republican spending caps fund nih by cutting education, college affordability, and labor protections. on the other hand, when we cancel sequester, we will invest in innovation and discovery without sacrificing other investments in our future. for example, the national science foundation would give 600 more grants supporting 7,500 scientists, students, teachers, and technicians. cancelling sequester means meeting compelling human needs. we can help make college affordable for families. right now, under sequester- level budgeting, republicans instead took $300 million from pell grants and eliminated first in the world grants to make college more affordable. under sequester-level appropriations bills, we can not keep our promises to our veterans. both the senate and the house republican bills underfund medical care at the veterans administration--by more than $600 million in the senate. that is enough money to provide medical coverage for 61,000 veterans. the house also cuts $580 million for building va health care facilities when there is a $10 billion maintenance backlog. it is clear that we need to end sequester. it is also clear that the shutdown was a disaster for everyone, not to be repeated. because without the resources to keep our government open, agencies can not serve the american people keeping us safe, healthy, educated, moving, and thriving. the bottom line is we need a new topline. we need a new budget deal to invest in america's safety and future. we need a short-term cr, free of poison pill riders, to get there--not another shutdown. mrs. feinstein. mr. president, i rise once again to speak against this callous, misguided effort to defund planned parenthood. this is a clear case of politics being put ahead of the country's best interests. this time the majority has tied this effort to the funding of the entire federal government--they are willing to shut down the government over this issue. that is preposterous. planned parenthood serves some of the most vulnerable women in our society. it cares for 2.7 million patients in the u.s.--5 million patients worldwide. ninety-seven percent of the services its 700 clinics provide are basic health care, including breast exams, cervical cancer screenings, testing for sexually [[page s6914]] transmitted diseases, and contraception. one in five women will use planned parenthood as their primary health care provider at some point in their lives. nationwide, 80 percent of planned parenthood patients make less than $18,000 per year. planned parenthood is often the only health care option for low- income women and women in rural communities. and yet here we are, facing another effort by republicans to block funding for this vital health care provider, an effort echoed and supported by republicans who are running for president. since this latest attack on planned parenthood began in july, i've received more than 25,000 calls and emails from women and men in california who support planned parenthood. while the details of the stories vary, they share the same theme: planned parenthood was there for them at a critical time in their lives. it was the only place they could go for health care when they were in college, earning minimum wage, or struggling to provide for their children and families. it was the only place where they felt safe and respected. it provided essential tests and screenings and allowed them to plan their families, which is critical to women's economic security over the course of their lives. here is one example from a constituent in san francisco. she said ``thirty-two years ago, i was broke, and planned parenthood was the only place that would give me birth control. i am now retired, and my life would be so different if they hadn't been there. this is so necessary for those who can't afford it.'' another constituent from alameda said, ``i'm calling your office for the first time because i want you to support planned parenthood. when i was a young woman, their medical services saved my life. i hope this phone call helps save them in return.'' to me, that is why this organization is so important to women in this country. not only does it provide health care, it gives women the ability to make a better future for themselves and their families. i also want to address the false claim put forward by those who are pushing to defund planned parenthood: they claim that planned parenthood patients would easily find another community clinic to go to for their health care. this is just not true. community health centers and clinics do great work, but if 2.7 million planned parenthood patients were suddenly without a doctor, they simply could not handle the sudden influx of new patients. the congressional budget office estimates that up to 650,000 planned parenthood patients would lose their access to health care. what's more, many community clinics don't provide the level of contraception care and other health care services provided by planned parenthood. in two-thirds of the counties where planned parenthood has a clinic, it serves half of the women eligible to receive family planning services under the title x program. in california, 13 of 58 counties would not have a single clinic to provide family planning services under the title x program without planned parenthood. that tells us what will happen if this funding is stripped--huge numbers of women across the country will have no place to go for vital health services. this isn't a matter of speculation. we've seen what happens when planned parenthood is defunded because it has happened at the state level. in 2012, texas defunded planned parenthood. to serve all the women who needed access to a doctor or nurse, the remaining community clinics would have had to increase the number of patients they saw by an average of 81 percent. in other words, they would have needed to accept almost a doubling of their existing number of patients. unsurprisingly, those clinics lacked the ability to do so. as a result, nearly 20,000 fewer women were served by the texas women's health program the following year, a 10 percent decline. the number of prescriptions for birth control was cut in half, meaning 100,000 fewer women were able to access affordable birth control. louisiana is another state trying to defund planned parenthood, and recently defended its actions in court. as part of its rationale, the state actually claimed that dentists and eye doctors are capable of providing women's health care services. let me repeat: louisiana officials claimed that women who receive breast exams, contraceptive counseling and prescriptions, and other medical services at planned parenthood could go to dentists and eye doctors instead. any woman knows that is just unrealistic. so make no mistake about it: if planned parenthood is defunded, many american women simply will not get the health care they need. the attacks on women's health don't stop at planned parenthood's door. the house of representatives recently proposed completely eliminating the title x program, which provides affordable family planning services to low-income women. title x is proven to reduce abortions by preventing unplanned pregnancies. let me repeat that: the house has proposed to eliminate a program that reduces abortions. of course, we also know that the house voted to repeal the affordable care act more than 50 times. here in the senate we've suffered through at least 30 similar votes. this law they want to repeal guarantees women basic preventive care like mammograms and cervical cancer screenings. it requires that prenatal care and labor and delivery are covered by insurance companies. it prevents women from being denied coverage or charged more because they're women. it's the greatest achievement for women's health in a generation; yet we wasted days and weeks on futile attempts to eliminate it. these attempts to deny women and their families access to basic health care, to defund planned parenthood, to eliminate funding for family planning services that reduce abortions, and to deny women the right to make their own reproductive decisions are appalling. planned parenthood has been under constant attack since its founding in 1916. its founder, margaret sanger, was thrown in jail for providing birth control to women. the proponents of defunding planned parenthood have been engaged in this assault for years. the group behind this latest effort, the center for medical progress, has long-standing ties to the anti-choice movement. it is currently under investigation for possible criminal activity. the individuals who obtained the footage used false identification to represent a fake medical company. the videos, which are presented to the public as the full, unedited videos, have been analyzed by forensics experts at fusion gps. and the truth is, they are not the full, unedited videos. content is missing, and numerous edits have been made even to the so-called full footage videos. many members of congress have requested the full videos. those requests have gone unanswered. so the point is, this is part of a sustained assault on an essential health care provider for millions of american women. i also want to reiterate the real-life consequences of the rhetoric that's been directed at planned parenthood and its staff. i talked about this when i spoke on this subject in july. i strongly believe that the rhetoric directed at planned parenthood sends a message that it is ``ok'' to intimidate its staff and patients. it is not. a few weeks ago, a planned parenthood health center in washington state was severely damaged when an arsonist lit it on fire. thankfully, no one was hurt. but i would hope that we'd learn from this event, and opponents of planned parenthood would think about the ramifications of their words. this is dangerous territory. in closing, we must remember that the attacks on planned parenthood aren't about improving women's health. they are about taking away women's rights, choices, and access to the doctors and nurses they know and trust. and quite frankly, their efforts will only jeopardize women's health by removing the only source of health care many women have available. i've seen great gains for women during my lifetime, including more education, greater workplace freedom, and the right to decide what happens to our own bodies. i simply will not stand by and watch our advances slip away. we are standing up for planned parenthood because we stand up for women. i urge a ``no'' vote. let's defeat this bill and move on so we can fund the government and address many other critical issues. [[page s6915]] thank you, mr. president. mr. cardin. mr. president, i am in strong opposition to the substitute amendment to h.j. res. 61 imposing a moratorium on federal funding for planned parenthood clinics and their affiliates unless they stop providing abortions. let's be clear about one thing: the effort to defund planned parenthood is not about federal funding for abortions. since 1977, it has been well established under the hyde amendment that federal funding cannot be used for abortions, except in very narrow circumstances where the life of the mother is endangered or in cases of rape or incest. the impetus for this amendment stems from the recent release of surreptitiously recorded and heavily edited videos that falsely portray planned parenthood's participation in legal fetal tissue donation programs and the subsequent attempts to defund planned parenthood on the basis of that intrinsically dishonest campaign. it is not the first time anti-choice advocates have deliberately misrepresented planned parenthood. i remember when a senator stood on the floor of the u.s. senate 4 years ago and claimed that abortions are ``well over 90 percent of what planned parenthood does''. and then his press spokesperson had to acknowledge that what he said ``wasn't intended as a factual statement''. how much of what we are hearing and seeing now isn't ``intended as a factual statement''? senators certainly are entitled to their sincerely held positions on abortion and contraception, but i think we ought to refrain from saying things we know aren't true, especially on the floor of the united states senate. the attack on planned parenthood, if successful, would have a devastating impact on women and families across this country, especially lower income women and their families. planned parenthood health centers are an integral part of our safety net health care system, providing high quality, affordable health care services to 2.7 million patients per year. every year, planned parenthood physicians and nurses provide family planning counseling and contraception to 2.1 million women, perform nearly 400,000 screenings for cervical cancer and nearly 500,000 breast exams, and provide nearly 4.5 million tests and treatments for sexually transmitted infections, including hiv. banning federal funding for planned parenthood would put millions of women at risk of having no place to go for basic, preventive health care. for many women, family planning clinics such as planned parenthood provide the only basic health care they receive. in fact, 6 in 10 women who access care through a family planning health center consider it their main source of health care. more than half of planned parenthood health centers are located in rural areas, health professional shortage areas, or medically underserved areas, putting women living in those areas at particular risk of losing access to health care services. it isn't just planned parenthood that is under attack; it is also the one out of every five women in this country who has relied on planned parenthood for health care at some point in her lifetime. earlier this week, i also voted against invoking cloture on another assault on women's reproductive health--h.r. 36, an unconstitutional attempt to impose a nationwide ban on abortions when the ``postfertilization age'' of the fetus is determined to 20 weeks or greater, with extremely limited exceptions. more than 40 years ago, in its landmark roe v. wade decision, the supreme court made it clear that women in this country have a constitutional right to abortion services and that no legislature may ban abortion prior to viability, which is exactly what h.r. 36 attempts to do. previous attempts to impose previability bans on abortion have been repeatedly struck down by the courts, and last year, the supreme court refused to review a ninth circuit court of appeals decision permanently blocking arizona's 20- week ban. nevertheless, anti-choice advocates continue their relentless efforts to undermine women's reproductive rights and health in any and every way possible. the cloture votes on h.r. 36 and today's amendment to defund planned parenthood are simply the latest attempts. in addition to imposing an unconstitutional previability ban on abortion, h.r. 36 threatens doctors with criminal penalties, including up to 5 years in prison, for attempting or performing an abortion in violation of the bill's onerous restrictions, which is clearly intended to intimidate and discourage doctors from providing abortion care. the bill also puts the health of pregnant women at risk by allowing an exception to the 20-week ban only in the very narrow circumstance where an abortion is necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman. therefore, under h.r. 36, a pregnant woman who develops a serious medical condition or complication after 20 weeks would be barred from terminating her pregnancy, no matter how serious the risk to her health, unless the abortion is deemed necessary to prevent the woman's death. in addition, h.r. 36 would not allow an exception in the heart- wrenching situation in which a severe fetal anomaly is discovered late in a woman's pregnancy, despite the fact that these conditions are often only detectable around 20 weeks. h.r. 36 also lacks a reasonable exception to the 20-week ban for victims of rape and incest. adult women who have been raped would be required to report the assault to law enforcement or undergo compulsory medical treatment or counseling at least 48 hours prior to receiving an abortion, meaning that the rape survivor must have at least two appointments with two different providers in order to access the care she needs. h.r. 36's treatment of minors who have survived rape or incest is even more extreme. for minors who have been the victim of rape or incest, h.r. 36 would require proof that the crime was reported to law enforcement or the appropriate government agency in order to qualify for an exception to the 20-week ban. these extremely narrow exceptions completely ignore the fact that the majority of sexual assault survivors do not or are not able to report their assaults to law enforcement for a variety of compelling reasons. the centers for disease control and prevention--cdc--estimate that only 35 percent of sexual assaults or rapes were reported to the police in 2010. it is simply unconscionable to subject survivors of rape and incest to these burdensome and unnecessary requirements in order to receive the care they need. we are 6 days away from a government shutdown; yet we have spent most of this week on misguided attempts to ban legal abortions and defund planned parenthood--and to link the planned parenthood issue to whether the federal government will remain open for business--even as it has been obvious to everyone that such attempts would fail. a government shutdown is a completely avoidable crisis, and using floor time this time to attack women's health care and reproductive rights instead of negotiating a bipartisan plan to fund the government is both unacceptable and irresponsible. the american people deserve better. they deserve a budget that supports a strong national defense and growing economy, not the threat of another government shutdown. i urge my colleagues to join with me in opposing these latest attacks on women's reproductive rights and access to high quality, comprehensive health care services. recognition of the majority leader the presiding officer. the majority leader is recognized. his holiness pope francis mr. mcconnell. mr. president, i know i speak for the entire senate when i say it was a privilege to welcome the pope to the capitol this morning. for the thousands who gathered on the capitol lawn, it was an experience they are unlikely to ever forget. a quiet nod, a soft smile, a simple wave--the gestures may have been small, but their meaning ran deep, captured forever in the hearts of the faithful and the hopeful. as we turn back to the work of governing, many will interpret his words in many ways. the media certainly has. but we can also hear him as simply expressing his faith. and we all appreciate his closing remarks: god bless america. mr. president, it is no surprise that members of the senate have differences on issues. that is normal, healthy even. but even if our democratic colleagues may not agree with us on every [[page s6916]] issue, let us agree that the scandal surrounding planned parenthood is deeply, deeply unsettling. let us agree that it makes sense to at least place a scandal-plagued political organization on leave without pay and then use that money to fund women's health care as congress investigates these serious allegations. let us also agree that it is time for our democratic colleagues to finally allow the senate to fund the government, just as we have worked hard to do all year long. here is the view the new senate took from the beginning. the best way to fund the government is to pass a budget, and then to fund it. that may be a different approach from previous years, but it is the approach we chose to pursue when we came to office. we didn't think it was right that the senate hadn't passed a budget in 6 years or that the senate's appropriations committee hadn't passed the 12 bills necessary to fund the government in 6 years. so we changed that. the appropriations process got off to a great start. there was often a spirit of bipartisanship inside that committee. consider that nearly all of the 12 funding bills passed with bipartisan support. more than half attracted the support of over 70 percent of democrats. we saw our democratic colleagues use phrases such as ``win-win-win'' or declare the appropriations legislation would ``do right by'' their particular state as they issued press releases praising the bills that they voted for. it was great to see that bipartisan action. i was hopeful that our democratic colleagues would actually join with us on the senate floor to debate and pass the legislation they had praised in committee. but no, they took a different path. i regret that democratic leadership determined a crisis would be necessary to advance a policy aim of growing the government, and that our colleagues decided accordingly to block every single funding bill-- every single one--almost all of which had been supported by a significant number of democrats in committee. so we have been forced to pursue a continuing resolution as a result. it would be much better to simply finish the appropriations process we worked so hard to advance. but if our colleagues continue to block the senate from doing so, the senate is left with very few options. it may be regrettable, but that is the reality we now face. the bill before us would help get things back on track. it would ensure the government remains funded and open. it would adhere to the bipartisan spending level already agreed to by both parties. it would also allow our democratic colleagues to join us in standing up for women's health instead of a political organization mired in scandal. for 1 year, the legislation would redirect $235 million in planned parenthood funding to women's health instead, strengthening health centers that provide critically needed community care. i wish our colleagues hadn't pursued a strategy of blocking government funding. that strategy may have succeeded in bringing the country to this point, but there is no reason to continue blocking every attempt to fund the government or to protect political allies mired in scandal. so i am calling on colleagues across the aisle to join us in standing against a shutdown. i am calling on them to join us in standing up for women's health instead. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the time following the vote until 6 p.m. be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees; further, that all time during quorum calls until 6 p.m. be charged equally between both sides. the presiding officer. is there objection? without objection, it is so

the previous order, the time until 6 p.m. will be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees. the majority whip is recognized. his holiness pope francis mr. cornyn. mr. president, today has certainly been a historic day in washington, dc. with the arrival of his holiness pope francis this week, washington has been flooded with the faithful who were eager to mark his first visit to the united states. i know my colleagues and i are grateful we were able to host him at a joint meeting of congress, and we were all in awe of his incredible stamina given his schedule-- something we are not unfamiliar with. as head of the catholic church, pope francis leads a diverse community of believers. catholics in the united states make up about one-fifth of the population in the united states and also in my home state of texas. in fact, catholic priests from spain were some of our earliest settlers in texas, and one of the dozens of missions established by the catholic church early in the 18th century in texas was mission san antonio de valero, what would later be called the alamo. it was a privilege to welcome pope francis this morning and to hear his remarks. i am told he was the first pontiff ever to address a joint meeting of congress. cardinal daniel dinardo it was also my honor to host a friend of mine, cardinal daniel dinardo, who accepted my invitation to join me today to hear pope francis. cardinal dinardo is the archbishop of galveston-houston, home to more than 1 million catholics--the largest number of the 15 dioceses in texas. i have had the honor of knowing cardinal dinardo for a number of years, and i am grateful to him for his unwavering commitment to life and for his extreme compassion in both a pastoral and spiritual sense as well as a practical one. we saw that in action recently when historic flooding devastated many of the communities in the houston area. during that time, cardinal dinardo was quick to ensure that catholic charities would provide some relief to those in need. there is no doubt that his leadership will continue to serve not only the catholic community in the galveston-houston area well but also all of us in texas. mr. president, on another matter, earlier today democrats blocked a measure that would fund the u.s. government but redirect federal money that currently goes to planned parenthood to go for women's health care at community health centers. actually, there are many more community [[page s6918]] health centers in texas than there are planned parenthood facilities. earlier this week i outlined how the democrats, while earlier calling for regular order in this chamber, have delivered on their promise to block legislation from moving forward that would fund vital parts of our government, such as the men and women in uniform who defend us. this is in spite of the fact that earlier this year, as i believe the majority leader mentioned, members of the appropriations committee actually did the work we were elected to do. we passed a budget and then in a bipartisan way passed appropriations bills out of the appropriations committee. but because they have chosen to filibuster all of these appropriations bills, we find ourselves with unneeded and unnecessary drama when it comes to funding the federal government-- hence the vote on monday for closing off debate on a continuing resolution to fund the government through december 11, 2015. unfortunately, even our uniformed military has been taken hostage to this strategy, which has created unnecessary drama, as i said, and created some real hardship. so as we approach the looming fiscal deadline of next wednesday at midnight, it is important to remember how we got here. while democrats filibustered legislation that would have removed all federal funding for planned parenthood, this fight--the fight for the sanctity of life pope francis talked about this morning--is far from over. we are going to continue the four different investigations of planned parenthood's practices and pursue legislation that would protect the fundamental right to life of the unborn. protecting the sanctity of life is an ongoing mission, and it does not end with this one vote. i yield the floor. mr. leahy. mr. president here we are again: with just 6 days until the federal government has to close its doors, we find ourselves faced with another manufactured crisis. two years ago, it was defunding the affordable care act. congress has voted nearly 60 times on that so far, all of which failed. in the meantime, more than 17 million americans who had no health insurance have obtained health insurance. four years ago, it was the same issue republicans are pushing today: defunding an organization that provides health care to millions of women across this country. with the vote to defund planned parenthood now behind us--for the second time in as many months--it is time to move forward to pass a clean, short-term continuing resolution and get to work addressing the real challenge before us: ending sequestration. we've said it before, and it bears repeating: sequestration was never supposed to become the status quo. its cuts are so extreme and so draconian that imposing it will hurt programs across the board, impacting every american. sequestration neglects police and fire departments, national parks, highways and bridges, airports, public health and education; and abandons promises made to our veterans and men and women in uniform. allowing sequester-level spending bills to become law for the next fiscal year, which the president has rightly said he will not do, would be an abdication of our sworn responsibilities as members of congress. we must pass a clean, continuing resolution; we must negotiate a new deal to end sequestration, and we must pass appropriations bills that reflect the urgent needs of our country, not a political score card. last weekend, my wife, marcelle, and i were fortunate to join hundreds of vermont women at the 19th annual women's economic opportunity conference in randolph, vt. i have sponsored this conference each year in an effort to help vermont women of all ages and generations take advantage of the economic opportunities available to them. from emerging entrepreneurs or those transitioning their careers, thousands of participants have been drawn to the conference over its nearly two decade history. sequestration puts at risk the ability of small businesses to access loans and counseling from the federal government, which helps spur and strengthen our economy. sequestration will cut critical workforce investment programs that help young workers, dislocated workers, and veterans find permanent employment. sequestration reverses the progress we have made in recent years to restore our economy and create jobs. the economic harm of sequestration is, of course, not all that is at stake. as senators in both parties have pointed out, sequestration hurts our national security and the readiness of our armed forces. sequestration hurts our roads, our infrastructure, and our public transit systems and will deeply impact our affordable housing supply. sequestration makes maintaining our commitment to our veterans, including a generation of disabled veterans of the iraq and afghanistan wars, nearly impossible. what's more, to meet the requirements of sequestration, we are poised to rob from such vital needs as job training programs and preschool development grants. the bottom line is this: sequestration was never intended to happen. but relying on budget gimmicks, as the senate's defense spending bill does, while nearly zeroing out critical programs for low-income americans, as the senate's transportation and housing bill does, creates more problems. republican leaders have waited too long to come to the table to negotiate relief from sequester-level spending caps. by passing this clean, short-term continuing resolution, we can get to work now--immediately--to negotiate a new deal that builds on the 2013 murray-ryan deal and keep the doors of our government open. we have now had the pointless debate over defunding planned parenthood. let's move on. let's not manufacture another crisis that puts millions of jobs on the line and hurts americans in every state of this country. we were elected to represent our constituents. the voice from vermonters is clear: it is time to get our work done. mr. cornyn. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. reed. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. reed. mr. president, i rise today to join my colleagues in support of a clean, short-term continuing resolution--or, as we say, a cr--to temporarily fund the government without controversial policy riders. after the vote we just had, i hope we can move to such a measure. even some republican leaders have acknowledged that this previous vote was a show vote designed to appease, but to fail. it is part of a troubling pattern that has been emerging over many months of avoiding meaningful, bipartisan talks to fix the budget and waiting until the last moment to deal with issues everyone knows must be addressed. we have an obligation to the american people to keep their government working. it is one of the most basic responsibilities we have as members of congress. a clean cr at this juncture fulfills this obligation, keeping the government open for a few more weeks while we work on a plan to eliminate the sequester-level budget caps for defense and nondefense programs. i wish we could have begun work on an overall agreement earlier in the year, as vice chairwoman mikulski and others strongly urged months ago, but at this late hour we should pass this short-term measure and move on to serious negotiations on budget caps for this year and beyond. shutting the government down now will not serve any useful purpose. what a shutdown will do is waste taxpayers' money and hurt the economy. indeed, the 2-week republican government shutdown in 2013 cost our economy billions of dollars. based on that experience, here is some of what we can expect if there is another forced government shutdown this year: the department of housing and urban development will have to furlough more than 95 percent of its workforce, impacting services to more than 60 field and regional offices nationwide. payments will be delayed to the roughly 3,000 local public housing authorities that manage the country's publicly assisted housing programs. in fact, this shifts the burden onto them, causing them to turn to local municipalities that are equally stressed in terms of their budgets. so there is no avoiding [[page s6919]] this pain--in fact, it will be multiplied if we shut down the government. thousands of home sales and mortgage-refinancing packages backed by the federal housing administration, the fha, will be put on standby. people who are ready to close, people who are ready to make a commitment to a home, people who are ready to keep this economy moving will be told: stand back; wait and see. cities, counties, and states will not be able to move forward with new community development block grant projects, preventing important local economic investment. this is a program which affects every community in this country, and it is something which is a very positive, constructive way to give local leaders the resources to fund the local initiatives the community desperately wants and needs. this is not big washington; this is local america getting a chance to see their projects put in place. the federal aviation administration will not be able to certify new aircraft, interrupting billions of dollars in sales. the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration will be forced to stop investigations and emergency response training. classrooms will be shuttered for 700 midshipmen at the u.s. merchant marine academy in kings point, ny. these are young men and women who are committing themselves to serve the nation either directly in the armed services of the united states or as members of our merchant fleet. they will basically be told to go home. financial support will stop for the maritime security program, the msp. this is an important public-private partnership that is critical to sustaining our troops serving overseas. these are just a few examples from two of the departments under my purview as the ranking member of the transportation, housing and urban development appropriations subcommittee. there are many other examples throughout the federal government that my colleagues are talking about today. knowing the results that shutdowns and these hardball tactics have brought before, it is hard to believe some still are willing to resort to budget brinksmanship again. i know many of my colleagues on the other side share my concern. i particularly wish to commend senator collins, who has been an excellent leader in chairing the thud subcommittee, for her support for a clean cr. she has done extraordinary work under very difficult and challenging circumstances. her support for a clean cr so that we can negotiate a longer term budget solution is indicative of the kind of forthright, thoughtful, and in some cases very courageous service she has rendered to maine and to the country. while we focus on the immediate showdown threat, let's remember the bigger threats we face in 2016. we are here because of the budget control act and its attendant sequester-level caps on discretionary spending. let's remember that these sequester-level caps were never intended to be implemented. at the time bca was enacted, the cuts were considered to be extreme--in fact, so extreme that congress would not ever let them happen, that they would embrace defense and nondefense, and that they would be an action-forcing mechanism--not an actuality of law but an action-forcing mechanism to cause us on a bipartisan basis to come up with long-term budget solutions. unfortunately, that solution did not materialize. over time, we had the very good work of senator murray and congressman paul ryan to come up with a 2-year suspension, but we are right back where we were, and these sequester caps are staring us right in the face. but today, rather than working together to tackle the sequester, we are on the verge of orchestrating another fiscal crisis. and it is not a crisis that will help the american people; rather, it will hinder the american people. and, indeed, it is ironic because members on both sides recognize the bca cap should be raised for both defense and nondefense appropriations. indeed, both the defense authorization and the defense appropriations bills carry bipartisan sense-of-the-senate language that says: ``sequestration relief must be accomplished for fiscal years 2016 and 2017.'' and, ``sequestration relief should include equal defense and nondefense relief.'' so you have a bipartisan consensus on these two committees that represent a significant number of our colleagues who are essentially saying: we have to end this. and they are saying it because they believe, as i do, that our national security rests not just upon adequate elements of the department of defense but adequate investment for all our federal programs. so beyond committing a clean, short-term funding bill, we must focus on eliminating these draconian spending caps imposed on us by the bca. we know these caps will cause real harm to programs across the federal government that our states and constituents rely on. these are not academic issues that could be dismissed as being some programs that are ineffective and less limiting. these are across-the- board cuts that hit all our constituents and hit them hard. indeed, months ago chairman mccain and i together wrote to urge the committee on the budget to include a higher baseline funding amount for the department of defense in the budget resolution. we were essentially asking them to ignore the bca caps and produce a budget that realistically recognizes the base needs of the department of defense-- not the one-time spending of oco contingency but routine spending that would be projected forth. senator mccain in particular worked in extraordinarily good faith to try to get such a provision included in the budget resolution, but he did not succeed. and, in response, the use of oco contingency funds was incorporated to skirt the budget caps. essentially, what the committee has done--the defense authorization committee--is it has taken the president's budget numbers, but moved money out of the base budget into oco, beyond the president's request. and what you are doing is creating this oco funding mechanism--in a sense, a gimmick, really--to cover the real cost--the ongoing cost, the routine continuing cost--of the department of defense. that is not good budgeting, and it is not good for defense either. because of this i was unable to support legislation on the floor for the defense authorization bill that in many other respects--virtually every other respect--was extremely well done and extremely thought out. again, i commend the chairman for all his efforts and those of my colleagues. i clearly disagree that using this oco funding arrangement--gimmick, sleight of hand, whatever you want to call it--is the way to proceed forward. relying on it essentially preempts defense from the budget control act and leaves everything else under those onerous caps. as i said, that not only does not adequately and realistically fund defense, but it seriously erodes national security because national security is something more than simply what the department of defense does. it is the department of state, the department of homeland security, and it is a myriad of other functions that will not see funding. in fact, they will see their funding begin to shrink dramatically. if we use this approach this year, with the argument that it is just a bridge to the day we finally get ourselves together, i think we are deluding ourselves. it would be much easier next year to put even more money into oco, to take programs that are traditionally funded through the base budget of the department of defense and say: well, we just don't have room. let's put it in oco. it becomes the gift that keeps on giving, and it will not provide the real resources and the certainty the department of defense needs over many years to plan for their operations. to stick things in 1-year funding is not to tell the department of defense: you can be confident that 2 or 3 years from now, when you are developing that new weapons system platform, the money will be there. it may, but again, it may not. we can't give them that insecurity. we have to give them a sense of certainty. now, this is a view that is shared not just by myself and some colleagues here on both sides of the aisle but by senior defense department officials. they have testified repeatedly before our committee that oco funding does not provide long-term budget certainty. they need that. and the [[page s6920]] troops--the men and women they lead--need that. in fact, it really just allows dod to plan for 1 year. and there are very few programs in the department of defense that are 1-year programs. a major weapons system is a multiyear development and then there is the production process. the strategy is not year by year. it is over several years at least. so this is not an efficient and effective way to run the organization. proper budgeting and planning in the department of defense requires at least 5 years. that is the standard. the standard measure is a 5-year program forecast, budget forecast, and we are telling them: well, this year you can have a bonanza of oco funds. next year could be more, could be less, could be much less. this is not the way to efficiently allocate resources for national security and to efficiently develop a strategy to counteract an increasing array of threats around the globe in many different dimensions in many different regions. if we go down this path, it will lead to instability for our troops, their families, and for our defense industrial base. they deserve certainty, not a year-to-year, perhaps- maybe, maybe-perhaps approach. we also need to recognize, as i have repeated before, that national security is not just the department of defense. other agencies are critical--the department of state, department of homeland security, department of justice, and department of treasury, which does all the terrorist financing sanctions. they have to trace funds flowing around the world to ensure they do not aid and assist terrorist activities or other maligning activities. they need resources too. taking this approach as it stands now, using this oco approach for defense and then letting everything else stay under bca, will not give these agencies the resources they need. i was struck a few days ago when general petraeus was here testifying that one of the critical areas of effort against isil is information warfare. they have proven to be extraordinarily adept at using social media, at communicating through the internet. one of the questions from my colleague--which was very thoughtful and fundamental--was this: is the state department doing enough to counteract--as one of our major foreign policy organizations--this information campaign by isil? the general sort of chuckled a bit, and then he said: let me tell you that when i was commanding, on active service, the state department had to come to me and essentially borrow $1 million from centcom funds so they could get in the ball game--to just get in the game in terms of information warfare: counteracting measures, public campaigns of information in countries throughout the globe, particularly in the middle east. that will be much worse if we proceed down this path, and we will not be enhancing our national security. if the isil message is unanswered, if they are able to attract adherents from around the globe because all they can really hear is this grotesque discussion of isil and what they propose, and there are no counterarguments, there is no countervailing points, we lose that information war. and that is not just a dod function. now, we have to make investments in both defense and nondefense. but as i said before, if we stick with these bca caps, our non-dod programs will suffer. in addition to that, the needs of the american people will suffer. we will not be able to invest in adequate transportation and water infrastructure. we won't be able to do things that provide adequate and decent housing for our citizens. under the budget caps we will lose jobs too. when the resources diminish, the need for workers diminishes, and that will happen. now, we have a situation, particularly where some of our most vulnerable americans would suffer grievously. here are a few examples. the elderly housing program has been cut in half since 2010, even when we know the united states population today is aging faster. every member of this senate has numerous elderly housing programs in their state. their low-income seniors rely on them. i would suspect they take some pride in the fact there is adequate housing--in some cases not enough, but at least some adequate housing. they will suffer. there are 7.7 million very low income renters in the united states. that means they pay more than 50 percent of their income in rent or live in substandard housing or both. if these budget caps go into effect, then the thud bill will not include meaningful funding for the affordable housing production program available to local governments. when we turn to public housing authorities, they are facing more than $3 billion in capital needs just to keep them repaired, just to make them places that are decent to live in, where people can have appropriate hallway lighting, they can have elevators that work, they can have plumbing systems that are adequate--the basics. we are not talking about building whirlpools, spas, and jacuzzis. this is just meeting basic requirements in maintenance and capital repairs. the level of funding pha's are faced with is the same level we provided in the late 1980s. that is going back about 30 years. thirty years ago, relatively speaking, we would be spending as much as we are now on simply maintaining public housing. these are real-world consequences. again, bca comes into play in terms of the impact on domestic programs. funding for public transit continues to fall even while transit ridership goes up. one of the success stories over the past few years is our public transit systems. our buses, our subway systems, our light rail systems are enjoying increased ridership. that is good for people to get to work, and it is good for our environment because of reduces the use of individual automobiles. but if our ridership goes up and the resources go down, we are going to see a system that gets less and less dependable, reliable, and effective, and we will lose not only a number of those riders but have incidents--as we have seen across the country--where there are significant safety concerns and significant disruptions. it has not been uncommon over the last several months here in washington to hear on the radio that a whole subway line has gone down because of a maintenance problem or something else, and that day's workforce doesn't get to the office for 3 or 4 or 5 hours. guess what. that costs a lot of private employers a great deal of money because the people aren't doing the work, and they probably would be paid. so essentially this impacts our economy, and it is multiplied. and it will be exponentially multiplied if we start cutting away the money, as suggested in the budget control act. it is now time to work together and to enact first a clean cr, which will give us the time to systematically and comprehensively address the issues that are staring us straight in the face because of the bca--the budget caps on defense and nondefense. it is time to be able to move-- as i believe the vast majority of my colleagues want to--the excess oco funding back into the regular budget of the department of defense as we raise the budget cap, and as we raise the budget cap for the department of defense, to recognize we have to raise the cap not only for other national security agencies to protect our country, but also for other agencies in order to invest in our economy, keep us productive, keep people employed, and also keep faith with the thousands and thousands of americans who have worked and now may need help. there are seniors in need of rental assistance. they need the support of a good transit system to get to work or, if they are a senior citizen, to get to a doctor's appointment. they are counting on us. so i hope all my colleagues can come together, forge an agreement, avoid a shutdown, and then do something more than just keep the lights on--invest across the board in our people and watch those investments multiply to a productive, successful economy and a more secure america. mr. president, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. cruz. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. [[page s6921]] unanimous consent request--s. res. 224 mr. cruz. mr. president, in 1975, russian physicist andrei sakharov was awarded a nobel prize for his public opposition to the totalitarian communism of the soviet union. he knew what he was talking about as he had spent decades working on the soviet nuclear weapons program, work he had originally thought was a patriotic duty that would ensure the balance of power with the united states but that he came to understand was in the service of a brutal, oppressive regime with aggressive intentions. the soviets prohibited sakharov from accepting the award in person, although his wife yelena bonner was abroad at the time. she accepted on his behalf and delivered his seminal speech, ``peace, progress, and human rights.'' in it, sakharov declared: i am convinced that international confidence, mutual understanding, disarmament, and international security are inconceivable without an open society with freedom of information, freedom of conscience, the right to publish, and the right to travel and choose the country in which one wishes to live. i am likewise convinced that freedom of conscience, together with other civil rights, provides the basis for scientific progress and constitutes a guarantee that scientific advances will not be used to despoil mankind, providing the basis for economic and social progress, which in turn is a political guarantee for the possibility of an effective defense of social rights. he recited the names of his fellow dissidents who were being persecuted by the soviets, but he called for peaceful reform, not a violent revolution, saying: we must today fight for every individual person separately against injustice and the violation of human rights. much of our future depends on this. in struggling to protect human rights we must, i am convinced, first and foremost act as protectors of the innocent victims of regimes installed in various countries, without demanding the destruction or total condemnation of these regimes. we need a pliant, pluralist, tolerant community, which selectively and tentatively can bring about a free undogmatic use of the experiences of all social systems. sakharov was relieved of all his scientific duties and, after denouncing the soviet invasion of afghanistan in 1980, was banished to gorky, 250 miles east of moscow on the volga river, to remove him from the public eye. his wife joined him in 1984, charged with anti-soviet slander, and was prohibited from traveling abroad for medical treatment. sakharov began a hunger strike in protest. soviet authorities detained and force-fed him. in solidarity, president ronald reagan--who was then initiating his historic negotiations with the soviets--proclaimed may 18, 1983, national andrei sakharov day, and the following year the united states congress passed a bipartisan measure renaming the mailing address of the soviet embassy from 1125 16th street to no. 1 andrei sakharov plaza. every piece of mail delivered to or sent from the embassy would thus bear the name of the courageous dissident the soviets were trying to silence. the following year, the soviet union allowed bonner to travel abroad for heart surgery, and the year after that, gorbachev allowed sakharov and his wife to return to moscow, although sakharov remained critical of the slow speed of gorbachev's reforms until his death in 1989--just 1 month after the fall of the berlin wall. the bravery of andrei sakharov was instrumental in bringing down a great and oppressive empire. armed only with the truth, he was able to expose to the world the reality of soviet communism, the futility of trying to placate or domesticate the regime, and the power of standing for human rights. today, we have a case before us that is eerily reminiscent of sakharov's legacy. dr. liu xiaobo, who was awarded the nobel peace prize in 2010, sits today in a chinese jail for the crime of subversion. a poet, author, and political scientist, dr. liu was in 1989 a visiting scholar at columbia university, but when the pro-democracy protests broke out in beijing in june of that year, he returned to china to aid the movement. he staged a hunger strike in tiananmen square in the midst of the historic student protests and insisted the protests would be nonviolent, even in the face of the violence threatened by the people's republic of china. the prc arrested liu for his involvement in the tiananmen square demonstration and sentenced him to 2 years in prison. in 1996, the party subjected him to 3 years of ``reeducation through labor'' for questioning the single-party system. in 2004, the prc cut liu's phone lines and internet connection after he published an essay criticizing the party's campaign to silence so- called subversive journalists and activists. in 2008, liu, along with over 350 chinese intellectuals and human rights advocates, penned ``charter 08,'' a manifesto modeled after the czech ``charter 77,'' an anti-communist manifesto written in 1977 by vaclav havel and others calling for human rights and political reforms in the soviet republics. dr. liu's ``charter 08'' made 19 specific demands of the prc, including abandoning one-party rule in favor of instituting a separation of powers composed of a legislative democracy and independent judiciary; abolition of the hukou housing system that has victimized poor and rural chinese for decades; and securing freedom of association, assembly, expression, and religion. ``charter 08'' was released on december 10, 2008. although the communist party quickly censored it, over 10,000 journalists, scholars, businessmen, and teachers have signed the document since 2008. two days prior to the release of ``charter 08''--on the eve of the 100-year anniversary of china's first constitution and the 30-year anniversary of beijing's democracy wall movement--the prc detained liu for his involvement in this charter. in june 2009, he was officially arrested and charged with ``inciting subversion of state power'' for his coauthorship of ``charter 08.'' after being detained for over a year, liu pled not guilty to ``inciting subversion of state power'' before the beijing no. 1 intermediate people's court on december 23, 2009. his defense was not allowed to present evidence, and on christmas day liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison with an additional 2 years' deprivation of all political rights. beijing high court rejected his appeal 2 months later. on october 2010, dr. liu xiaobo received the nobel peace prize for his leadership in writing and publishing ``charter 08.'' like sakharov, he could not attend in person but accepted in absentia, boldly declaring in his acceptance speech: hatred can rot away at a person's intelligence and conscience. enemy mentality will poison the spirit of a nation, incite cruel mortal struggles, destroy a society's tolerance and humanity, and hinder a nation's progress toward freedom and democracy. that is why i hope to be able to transcend my personal experiences as i look upon our nation's development and social change, to counter the regime's hostility with utmost goodwill, and to dispel hatred with love. the very moment the nobel commission awarded the peace prize to liu, his wife liu xia was taken into custody by the prc. she penned an open letter to chinese president xi jinping in june 2013 decrying her unjust arrest and detention: i have been under house arrest and have lost all my personal freedoms since october 2010. no one has told me any reasons for detaining me. i have thought about it over and over. perhaps in this country it's a ``crime'' for me to be ``liu xiaobo's wife.'' both liu xiaobo and liu xia remain in prison today. the opening paragraph of ``charter 08'' captures the entirety of liu xiaobo's lifework: having experienced a prolonged period of human rights disasters and challenging and tortuous struggles, the awakening chinese citizens are becoming increasingly aware that freedom, equality and human rights are universal values shared by all humankind, and that democracy, republicanism, and constitutional government make up the basic institutional framework of modern politics. a `modernization' bereft of these universal values and this basic political framework is a disastrous process that deprives people of their rights, rots away their humanity, and destroys their dignity. where is china headed in the 21st century? will it continue with this `modernization' under authoritarian rule, or will it endorse universal values, join the mainstream civilization, and build a democratic form of government? this is an unavoidable decision. dr. liu's enormous courage and willingness to voluntarily sacrifice not only his own freedom but also that of those most dear to him poses a challenge to the free world. will we be silent, eager to enjoy the economic benefits of cooperation with the prc? or will we put president xi on notice that [[page s6922]] for america, human rights are no longer off the table, and that we are listening to the truth about communist china. i believe that the freedom championed by dr. liu is possible for all the chinese people. i believe that from tiananmen square to taiwan, the evidence is clear that the chinese desire--and are capable of-- democracy. i believe that we have a moral responsibility to not marginalize dr. liu and his brave fellow dissidents but to make their plight central to all our dealings with the prc. for that reason, we should follow the example of ronald reagan. we should follow the example of standing up to oppression, standing up do the soviet union's oppression of andrei sakharov. for that reason, in solidarity with the chinese people engaged in a long and nonviolent struggle for basic human rights, i am asking my colleagues to join me in creating a new version of sakharov plaza by naming the street in front of the people's republic of china embassy in washington, dc, liu xiaobo plaza. this would be the street sign that the chinese ambassador would look at each day. this would be the address that every piece of correspondence going into the embassy and coming out of the embassy would have written on it, just as with the soviets when forced to recognize the bravery of sakharov. the prc officials will be forced to recognize the bravery of dr. liu and to acknowledge it dozens of times a day, day after day. i realize that this is an expedited request, but given the ongoing repression not only of the lius but of so many other voices for political and religious freedom in china and the imminent arrival of the chinese leader who is directly responsible for it, i hope that my colleagues will join me. i intend to propound a unanimous consent request, and it is my hope that all 100 senators will stand with me. but for the moment, i yield the floor. mr. cruz addressed the chair. the presiding officer (mrs. capito). the senator from texas. mr. cruz. madam president, for reasons that i just detailed to this chamber, reasons for which we should stand in bipartisan unanimity in support of nobel peace prize laureate dr. liu xiaobo and in support of human rights and dissidents across the world, that we should follow the successful pattern of sakharov plaza under ronald reagan, this should be an issue that brings us all together. accordingly, i ask unanimous consent that the homeland security and governmental affairs committee be discharged from further consideration of and that the senate now proceed to the consideration of s. res. 224. i ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table. the presiding officer. is there objection? the senator from california. mrs. feinstein. madam president, reserving the right to object, i would like to make an observation. the notice for this went out less than an hour ago. the consultations with others haven't been made. it was precipitously brought to the floor, and i can only infer that it has political implications, because the president of china is due to arrive here tomorrow and, therefore, this would be passed today, moved out of committee without a vote in front of the senate. i don't think that is the way we should do business in this senate. maybe people don't believe diplomacy makes a difference, but i do. i think there will be ample time for the president to speak with the president of china and for some of us to speak as well. this is, of course--the human rights, of course--a subject. but in the absence of that, i object. the presiding officer. objection is heard. the senator from texas. mr. cruz. madam president, i note that this is a sad day for this body. when standing up to the soviet union, democrats and republicans were able to come together in support of andrei sakharov, and it worked. it made a difference speaking up for human rights. the senior senator from california is correct that this was expedited, and she is correct as to why. as i said in this floor speech, the presence of president xi in this country is precisely the reason that we should stand in unanimity in support of human rights. it is what makes it timely until a few minutes ago, when we had been informed that there were no objections on the democratic side and republican side. it saddens me. i know there are many chinese americans in the state of california, there are many chinese americans in the state of texas, and across the country there are millions of americans who care for human rights. just this morning we sat on the floor of the house of representatives and listened to pope francis talk about putting aside petty partisan differences and coming together with a voice of compassion. dr. liu is in a chinese prison, and the senior senator from california is standing and objecting to recognizing this nobel laureate's bravery, is standing and objecting because presumably it would embarrass his communist captors. i, for one, think as americans we should not be troubled by embarrassing communist oppressors. i note, as the senior senator from california leaves the floor, that this is not an issue that is abstract to me. my family, like dr. liu, has been imprisoned by oppressive regimes. my father, as a teenager, was imprisoned and tortured in cuba. he had his nose broken. he had his teeth shattered. he lay in the blood and grime of a prison cell in cuba. my aunt, my tia sonia, was a few years later again imprisoned and tortured. this time by castro. my father by batista and my aunt by castro was imprisoned and tortured by a communist regime. it is a sad statement when the united states of america cannot stand up and say: you who are imprisoned unjustly, we stand with you. if any of us listened to a word pope francis said this morning, that is a word we should have heard--that we should be a voice of freedom, a clarion voice of freedom across this globe. what we saw on this senate floor saddens me greatly. i understand the democrats feel partisan loyalty to the white house, and this white house's secretary clinton said at the beginning of the administration that human rights are off the table. america no longer stands for human rights. we will coddle up with oppressors if they make cheap calculators to sell in our stores. i think they are values that transcend the mighty dollar, and it is entirely possible to deal with foreign countries and yet maintain our principles and speak with unanimity. a couple of years ago i had the opportunity to visit with natan sharansky, the famed soviet dissident. he and i visited in jerusalem. he talked to me about how, when he was in the soviet gulag, the prisoners would pass from cell to cell notes: did you hear what president reagan said--``evil empire,'' ``ash heap of history,'' ``tear down this wall''? the leadership of the united states of america--mind you, it wasn't partisan leadership; it was clear bipartisan leadership in america--shined a light to the dark of those prison cells. i pray today that dr. liu, in his prison cell, does not hear word that the democratic senators are unwilling to stand with him. that is heartbreaking at a level rarely seen. it is one thing for us to disagree on partisan matters. we can have disagreements over the appropriate rate of capital gains taxes. but for standing with an oppressed nobel peace prize laureate, for standing up to communist oppression, that should not be a partisan divide. the objection raised by the senior senator from california is deeply disappointing, and i intend to continue to press this issue because the voice of america, the voice for freedom that pope francis urged us to aspire to will not be extinguished. it is who we are that is essential to our character and to our integrity. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from connecticut. gun violence mr. murphy. madam president, over the course of the summer we have watched with horror as thousands more have died in syria and iraq, and the debate over what we should do about it has been omnipresent here in the senate and in the house. we have held hearings, appeared on television to tell our story of how we should respond, and talked about it on the floor of the [[page s6923]] senate and the house. similarly, we have watched the conflict continue to persist in eastern ukraine. although they have not had the same number of casualties as we have seen in syria and iraq, they have had similar death and destruction, and we have responded with a vigorous debate on the floor of the senate--again, hearings in committees, letters to the president, bipartisan pieces of legislation that have been proposed--about how the united states should seek to reduce the amount of casualties in a place like eastern ukraine, and we are also debating what our response should be in syria and iraq. what if i told you that this summer 4,000 people died in another conflict in which there was absolutely no debate here in the congress? what if i told you there were 4,000 people who died this summer in a conflict and not a single committee in the congress held a hearing on it? what if i told you there was a conflict this summer in which 4,000 people perished and not a single member of the majority party in the house or the senate has proposed any comprehensive way to deal with it? this chart shows the number of people on a daily, monthly, and annual basis who are killed by guns. on average, it is 86 a day, 26,000 a month, and 31,000 a year. this summer, while kids were out of school, over 4,000 people--just this summer--died across this country from gun violence. i come to the floor not as often as i would like but as often as i can to tell some of their stories because i kind of thought these numbers would be enough to persuade members of this body to do something--anything--to try to stem the scourge of gun violence in this body, but it hasn't, and so my hope is maybe by telling the stories of some of these individuals, it will hopefully make a difference. every day we add dozens of stories of young men and women--mostly young men and women--whose lives were cut short, whose greatness we were never able to see, whose potential was never realized because they were killed by a gun. this summer we have been gripped by mass shooting after mass shooting. cynthia hurd, tywanza sanders, sharonda singleton, myra thompson, ethel lance, susie jackson, daniel simmons, and depayne doctor, and clementa pinckney--we don't know all of those names, but we know about many of them because they were killed at a mass shooting in a church in south carolina. sgt carson holmquist, po2 randall smith, gysgt thomas sullivan, lcpl ``skip'' wells, and ssgt david wyatt--maybe you have heard their names because they were all killed at a shooting in tennessee at a chattanooga armed forces recruiting center. maybe you have heard of jillian johnson and mayci breaux, who were killed in a movie theater in lafayette, la, in july of this year. most people have now heard of allison parker and adam ward, who were gunned down on live tv just a few weeks ago in virginia. on each one of those days--june 17, a shooting in south carolina; july 16, a shooting in tennessee; july 24, a shooting in louisiana; and august 26, a shooting in virginia--there were dozens more people who died from gunshot wounds whom we never heard of, but they meant something to their families. to this day their loss is experienced deeply by those who knew them well. some of them were people who were close to those of us who serve in public service. matthew shlonsky was killed this summer in washington, dc. on august 15 he was heading to a going-away party, and he had just stepped out of a cab when he was shot outside of the shaw-howard metro station. he was the sixth gunshot victim in the shaw area in a little over a week. think about what it is like to live in a neighborhood in which there have been six shootings over the course of a week. think of the fear that breeds in those communities. we knew matthew because he was an intern for one of our colleagues. he was working as a consultant at deloitte, but he had served as a senate intern. he was an amazing kid by all accounts. he traveled the world, spoke two languages, and was a star hockey player. his future was absolutely limitless. but because this city is awash in guns--many of them illegal, many of them in the hands of criminals who get them because of giant, gaping holes in our background check system--matthew shlonsky is no longer with us. he is dead at the age of 23. how about the heartbreaking story of carey gabay, who was 43 years old. he was serving as an assistant counsel to new york governor andrew cuomo, and before that he had been counsel of the empire state development corporation. he died on september 16--just on the back end of the summer--after he was caught in the crossfire of a shooting in new york city. he was an innocent bystander when he was shot in the head while attending the pre-west indian american day parade festival with friends and family. he was the son of jamaican immigrants and grew up in public housing in the bronx. he had done amazingly well. he attended harvard university and harvard law school. he was working for the governor and trying to make a better life for others by trying to give opportunities to kids who grow up in the same circumstance as he did. a friend described him as ``an amazing human being who melded public service, professionalism, personal integrity with warmth and caring for everyone he knew.'' he was 43 years old when he was gunned down in broad daylight outside of a festival simply because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. this summer 4,000 people were killed by guns, and not a single public hearing has occurred in the u.s. senate to discuss a solution. there is not even mention of a debate happening anytime soon on the floor of the senate as to how we stop these episodes of mass slaughter. we are averaging more than one mass shooting in this country every single day this year. that is astounding. that is shocking. yet there is total, utter, absolute silence from the world's greatest deliberative body on what we should do about it. i am the last person to say there is any panacea coming from the congress on how to stem gun violence. we are never going to be able to eliminate these epidemic rates of gun violence just by one law or set of laws that are passed. but what is an absolute indictment of this place is that we don't even try. i have made this contention on the floor before, and i will make it again. i truly believe our silence on this has become complicity. we have become accomplices to these murders because by saying and doing nothing, we offer up a kind of quiet endorsement to people who exist in the fringes of their minds and who are thinking about contemplating violence, and the leaders of this country are doing absolutely nothing to seriously condemn or stop their destructive, malevolent behavior. our silence has become complicit. i hope that at some point over the course of the rest of this year, we can begin a conversation as to how we can turn these numbers back in the right direction. there is no other country in the industrialized world that even comes close to these numbers. i can offer a suggestion on where to start. if between now and december we can't come to a common understanding on our gun laws--i still don't understand why we can't just do that since 90 percent of americans support expansive background checks--let's start by fixing the mental health care system. i think there are a lot of reasons why adam lanza walked into sandy hook elementary school and killed 20 kids over 2 years ago. the child advocate in connecticut issued a damning report on his interactions with the mental health care system. his mother tried and tried and tried, but in the end she gave up and let him retreat into the isolation of his room, where he plotted these murders. that family and mother and young man ran into barrier after barrier and obstacle after obstacle trying to find a course of treatment for his very serious set of illnesses. what we know is that people with mental illness are much more likely to be the victims of gun violence than the perpetrators of it. there is no inherent connection between being mentally ill and being violent. there is no greater incidence of mental illness in the united states than anywhere else in the world. yet we have epidemic rates of gun violence. but i will certainly be the first to admit that if we fix our mental health care system, it will help lots of people who have no intersections with gun violence, and it will [[page s6924]] push these numbers downward because some of these people are committing these murders because they are not getting treatment for serious illnesses. senator cassidy and i--frankly, we don't agree on a lot because he is a conservative republican from the deep south, and i am a progressive democrat from the northeast--introduced a mental health reform measure which has broad bipartisan support and which would seek to break down these barriers in order to get care for the seriously mentally ill and try to get the parents more involved in the care, especially of young adults. it would increase the capacity in our mental health treatment system for both outpatient and inpatient care. maybe over the course of the rest of this year, at the very least we can make a dent in the massive shortfalls in our behavioral health care system. the families i have become so close with in sandy hook, ct, commanded me to come down to the floor every week or so and tell these stories, the voices of victims. they would like us to come together on a set of meaningful changes to our gun laws. they just don't understand why adam lanza was able to walk into the school with a gun that killed 20 little boys and girls in less than 5 minutes because of how powerful it was with the 30-round cartridges he was able to use. they don't want our inability to get action on gun laws to stop us from making other progress that would make the next adam lanza less likely. maybe we can do that. but we should do something. our silence is an embarrassment after this summer of mass shootings. these news reports should command us to action, but we, frankly, shouldn't have had to wait for the news reports of shootings in virginia or louisiana or south carolina because these numbers were just as true last year as they are this year. maybe there are more episodes of mass violence and mass shootings and headline-grabbing atrocities, but these numbers which reflect what is happening on the ground in new haven, ct; hartford, ct; boston, ma; chicago, il; and los angeles have been a reality for a long time, and we should have woken up long ago. but maybe over the course of this year we can make some progress so that moving forward there are a few less voices of victims to bring to the floor of the senate. i thank the presiding officer. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. ms. klobuchar. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. volkswagen ms. klobuchar. madam president, i rise to speak about recent revelations that volkswagen woefully deceived regulators and the general public to artificially lower emissions of its 2009 to 2015 volkswagen and audi diesel vehicles. these actions raise significant consumer, environmental, and public health concerns. according to the epa's notice of violation of the clean air act, volkswagen used a sophisticated software algorithm on certain vehicles that detected when vehicles were undergoing emissions testing. this software--referred to as a ``defeat device''--allows vehicles to meet emissions standards during testing, but under normal driving situations, these same vehicles emit nitrogen oxides up to 40 times the allowable emissions standards. this is unbelievable. i think we can imagine that such technology exists, but i don't think we ever thought that one of our major international car companies would be alleged to have used it. so far approximately 482,000 diesel vehicles sold in the united states and 11 million cars worldwide have been affected. a deliberate attempt like this by a company to mislead regulators and the general public is completely unacceptable. this raises serious questions that need answers: why did volkswagen, for more than a year, claim that the discrepancies in the emissions tests and the levels on the road were a technical error? who at volkswagen signed off on the defeat device? did executives at volkswagen know these actions were put into place to deliberately deceive regulators and the general public? does the epa have the necessary testing systems in place to detect such devices that trick the software? have other auto manufacturers of clean diesel vehicles been tampering with their software to get around emissions standards? how do we ensure that this never happens again? this is a matter of public trust. consumers were lied to and sold a product under false pretenses. those consumers who brought certain volkswagen jettas, beetles, passats, and certain audis with 2-liter diesel engines believed they were purchasing a vehicle that would provide premium fuel economy and performance while also meeting strict emissions standards. who wouldn't be enticed by these vehicles after they were named the ``green car of the year'' and ``eco-friendly car of the year'' by national publications? we now know these consumers were duped and that they will now have to bring their vehicles under compliance to meet federal emissions standards. volkswagen will likely pay for the repairs but what about the costs of reduced fuel economy and lower resale values? congress intentionally included strong enforceability elements into the clean air act statute. regulations promulgated under the clean air act aimed to protect human health and the environment by reducing nitrogen oxide and other pollutants. motor vehicles are the primary source of nitrogen oxide pollution from transportation. these highly reactive gases play a major role in atmospheric reactions that produce smog. that smog accelerates climate change and exacerbates respiratory diseases that harm human health, including asthma, which affects 23 million americans, including 6 million children. that is why we have emissions standards. it is not just some far-off number that is put into place; it is to protect children from getting asthma; it is to protect the world from heating up; it is to ensure that we protect our environment for generations to come. the clean air act requires automakers to certify to the epa that their vehicles will meet applicable federal emissions standards to control air pollution. through this process, volkswagen deceived regulators into believing these vehicles produced low emissions. vehicles with the defeat device emit anywhere from 5 to 40 times more nitrogen oxide than allowed by law while on the road. if we pick a number in the middle of the range--let's say 20 times as much--it would mean that volkswagen's fleet in the u.s. produces 46,657 more tons of harmful smog. changes to the epa's emissions standards testing process are needed as well. i have written to epa administrator gina mccarthy to express that concern. the epa needs to explain why their systems did not detect this deceptive software and what changes the agency will be making with their testing processes. i strongly urge the epa to establish robust safeguards to prevent automakers from gaming the system and prevent this from happening again. there must also be a full investigation into volkswagen's actions. the department of justice is conducting a criminal investigation into the company's actions, and i urge doj to leave no stone unturned in its investigation to determine how a company could have willfully deceived federal regulators and the general public. volkswagen must conduct a thorough and comprehensive public education campaign to ensure that all owners of these vehicles are made aware of the defect and are informed about where and when they can go to get their vehicle fixed. the department of transportation, which has expertise with vehicle recalls, should also play an active role. if we learned anything from the general motors and takata airbag recalls, it is that recalls need to be broad enough from the outset and cover affected vehicle models and years, the general public needs to know how and where to get their vehicle repaired, and automakers must have a system in place to make timely repairs with replacement parts that truly fix the problem. other agencies, such as the federal trade commission, should also take a serious look at how they can help in this process. [[page s6925]] as a member of both the senate commerce committee and the senate judiciary committee, i believe that consumers must be protected. i also believe volkswagen's competitors that actually follow the law should be able to play on an even playing field. other car companies that follow the law did the right thing. they put the right systems in place, and they should not be penalized because one car company did this. they should have been able to play on an even playing field. if there is an uneven playing field, it hurts american employees, it hurts american companies, and mostly it hurts american consumers. the actions by volkswagen to deliberately deceive consumers around the world about the emissions levels in their cars is fundamentally about a breach in trust. consumers thought they were getting the same product that was being advertised, when what they were getting was a product that met those standards only when it was tested, only for 1 day, and only for the time of the emissions testing. as federal agencies move forward with their investigation, it is critical that we get to the bottom of this to figure out how this happened, what the extent was, and if it is happening with any other automakers to ensure that what happened never happens again. thank you, madam president. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. inhofe. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. pilot's bill of rights 2 mr. inhofe. madam president, i wish to take advantage of an opportunity to bring up the subject that no one is talking about now. of course, right now everyone has been in the middle of the pope's visit and other things and what is happening with the iran bill and the votes we have. i wish to mention there is something else very significant going on right now, that we are in the middle of, and that is the pilot's bill of rights 2. to put it into perspective, 3 years ago last month we had the pilot's bill of rights 1, and it was one people were not aware of. there are only 617,000 pilots in america, so it is not one of these issues that gets an awful lot of attention. but the mere fact that those 617,000 people--many of them are single-issue people. a lot of people are not aware that prior to the passage of the pilot's bill of rights 3 years ago, there was just one area left within our system whereupon you are guilty until proven innocent. that is exactly what we corrected with that bill, just to refresh the memory of my colleagues. it gave the pilots who were accused of something the evidence that was used against them. i had a personal experience with it. it actually happened to me. i was never sensitive to that until such time as i experienced it myself. what we have right now is we are up to 64 cosponsors of the pilot's bill of rights 2. the major part of this bill is something that is out there that doesn't resolve anything. ten years ago, as kind of an experiment, we put in a sport pilot-eligible exemption so that the pilots of small aircraft would not have to have what they call a third- class medical. the result of this was that after a 10-year period, the medical safety experience of these pilots has been identical to those with medical certificates. a joint study was made following that by the aircraft owners and pilots association and by the eaa, the experimental aircraft association, of the 46,976 accidents over a 6-year period. of those, only 99 had a medical cause as a factor. that is less than one- quarter of 1 percent. of those 99, none would have been prevented by the current third-class medical. that shows that experiment worked and there is no reason to have a third-class medical. so people are aware that some changes have been made, i want to briefly outline the modifications that have been made. the modifications require three things for pilots to qualify for an exemption. the exemption we are talking about is the exemption from having to take a third-class medical exemption process every 2 years-- sometimes more extensive than that. first, pilots will have to complete an online medical education course. secondly, pilots have to maintain verification that they have been to a doctor at least once every 4 years and certify that they are receiving the care they need by a physician to treat any medical condition that warrants it. third, a pilot would have to complete a comprehensive medical review by the faa. that would be applied to a new pilot, so they establish a benchmark as to what a pilot's physical condition is. the pilot would be required to take an online medical course every 2 years. this gives the pilot access to information on medical issues that may not be covered by a doctor in a medical examination but that would have an impact on their physical condition to fly. for example, this course would make sure pilots are aware of impacts on interactions of over-the-counter and prescription medications and how these interactions could impact their flying capabilities. requiring pilots to take this course boosts aviation safety for the aviation community. secondly, pilots would need to complete an exam by their personal physician at least once every 4 years and include a proof of their doctor's visit in their logbooks. this resolves the problem most people are concerned about; that they would have to at least see a physician and be assured that they didn't have some condition they didn't have prior to that. furthermore, the pilots would be required to certify that they are under the care and treatment of a doctor for any medical condition that would warrant treatment. pilots would do this instead of visiting an aviation medical examiner every 2 years and sometimes even more frequently than that. with this modification, we are actually encouraging pilots to be honest about their health and seek treatment for it. right now pilots are incentivized to hide any medical condition from the faa, including by not seeking treatment for it, out of the fear that the pilot might lose his wings. we don't want that to happen. people who are not pilots do not realize how significant it is that you don't want to be taken out of the air, particularly for some reason that is not justified. pilots, like any individual, maintain stronger relationships with their personal physician, and this is a good thing that fosters an honest dialogue between pilots and doctors, which is something we should all want and something that is not there today. we want pilots to get the treatment they need. any medically treated pilot is safer than one who is not being treated. so for many pilots the most burdensome aspects of the faa controversy is simply the constant churn of submitting paperwork over and over, every 2 years or less, even when there has been no change in their medical status. this bill, as modified, gives pilots a break from the bureaucracy. the third requirement for pilots to receive the third-class medical exemption is to complete one faa medical review. so if a new pilot comes in, we need a benchmark--where is that pilot, what is his physical condition today--so as time goes by we can see how he might be changing. if someone does not have an existing medical certificate, such as new pilots who have never gone through an exam, they would have to do it before they fall into qualifying for the exemption. by the way, of the 617,000 pilots in america today, this is the one thing that concerns me more than anything else, which is to have to go back and go through the type of examination they are required to, now that we know the 10-year experiment of being exempt has worked. there is one caveat. if a pilot flying under the third-class medical exemption is diagnosed with a severe condition--let's talk about maybe a heart attack--then they need to go through the faa special issuance process to receive medical clearance to fly again. again, this would only be needed to be done one time. the ability of the faa to maintain a stranglehold on pilots will be gone. i am confident the changes will result in a safer flying environment. i want to reiterate that the pilot's bill of rights does not change the certification standard to obtain a pilot's certificate. all pilots still have to possess the pilot's certificate, pass the required practical tests and necessary check rides to [[page s6926]] demonstrate that they have the knowledge, skills, and ability to safely operate their plane. further, this bill does not change the fundamental responsibility of every pilot to self-certify their ability to fly each time they get into the cockpit of a plane. i am a pilot, and every time i get in a plane i make a conscious decision that i am fit to fly. everyone i know who is a pilot does the same thing. again, all of this is not necessary. when you go back and realize that over the 10 years of the experiment with a limited number of pilots there were no changes. there is no difference between those who have or have not had the pilot exams. with these changes, the third- class medical exemption and the pilot's bill of rights is enjoying a greater level of support from members of the senate. support from general aviation is strongly bipartisan. sixty-four of my colleagues are cosponsors of this legislation. half of those are democrats and half are republicans. groups representing general aviation in the community and in the pilot unions have declared their support for the bill. general aviation organizations, such as the aircraft owners and pilots association, the experimental pilots association, and the general aviation manufacturers association, support the bill. the national association of state aviation officials support the bill, the allied pilots association and the southwest pilots association, both unions which represent 23,000 pilots who fly for american airlines, u.s. airways, and southwest airlines, support the bill. pilots for netjets support the bill. the bill has strong bipartisan support. i urge all the members who support general aviation and all the economic activity of general aviation to be a part of this bill. one of the reasons i am doing this today is one of the two organizations--and i am not sure which one it is, it is either the aopa or the aa--is doing a major effort right now to encourage the pilot population out there to encourage their members of the senate to cosponsor this bill. again, we currently have 64 sponsors of the bill. i can't think of any reason we can't get everyone else. the same individuals who supported it 3 years ago should be there to support it. so i encourage those few members of the senate who are not sponsors to look at it very carefully. it may be 617,000 people are not a lot of people, but of the 617,000 people, most of them are single-issue people. so it would be very good to join in on this. this is something we now have demonstrated clearly is not going to incur any safety hazards and it is going to be a real godsend for pilots who don't want to go through this bureaucracy every 2 years or more frequently in some cases. the bill is out there, and it is one i feel very strongly that we ought to be able to work into our floor use probably in the next very short period of time. with that, i do yield the floor because my very good friend from delaware is here to say something profound. the presiding officer. the senator from delaware. transportation funding mr. carper. madam president, i don't know that i will say anything profound, but i appreciate the chairman of our committee saying that. madam president, and fellow native west virginian, i will show a map of the united states in just a minute, and there are some states that are delaying and some states that are cutting back on transportation projects. one of them is west virginia. one of them is delaware. i want to talk a little bit about that. before i do, i would like to go back in time 10 months to the election of last year. i am reminded of the message i heard from the electorate that came out of that election. to simplify it, there were three things they were trying to tell us. no. 1, they want us to work together; no. 2, they want us to get things done; and, no. 3, they want us to get things done that will actually strengthen our economic recovery. if you go back in time to the january--the week barack obama and joe biden were inaugurated as president and vice president, 628,000 people filed for unemployment insurance in that 1 week in january of 2009. any time that weekly number of people filing for unemployment insurance is over 400,000, we are losing jobs in this country and in the economy. last thursday we got a number from the department of labor. last week's number was about 265,000 who filed for unemployment. that was last week. there is a new number today--i am not sure what it was, but for the last 28 weeks that number of people filing for unemployment insurance has been under 300,000. i think that is the longest that we have been keeping track, where we had 28 consecutive weeks where fewer than 300,000 people in this country were applying for unemployment insurance. that number is way under 400,000, so we are adding jobs, and we are expecting to continue to add jobs in this country. there are still people looking for jobs in my state, there are in west virginia, and other states as well, but when you consider the unemployment rate was about 10 percent in the early part of 2009 and today it is a little over 5 percent, we are making progress, but we can make a lot more progress. one of the ways we can make progress is by dealing with our fiscal plan and not hold the nation's economy hostage with our inability to pass a spending plan. and god help us if we drop the ball on this again and have another shutdown. i sure hope we come to our senses and avoid doing that. my hope is that we will. one of the other ways we can strengthen our economic recovery--and it is right out there for us to seize and do--is to make sure that in a nation where roads, highways, bridges, and transit systems are deteriorating, where we need to make improvements and we need to build, frankly, new projects--new highways, bridges, roads and transit systems--at the very least we need to maintain the quality of what we have or improve the quality of road safety, surfaces, potholes, you name it. there is a lot of work to be done, and there are a lot of people who would like to do the work. the mckinsey global institute, an arm of the national consulting firm mckinsey, looked at what we could do for our growing gdp in this country if we fully funded a 6-year transportation plan, what we could do for an employment opportunity if we funded a 6-year transportation plan, and the numbers are remarkable--i think amazing. we were told that fully funding a 6-year transportation plan would grow our gdp by approximately 1.5 percent per year--not for 1 year but for the life of the transportation plan that we funded--probably 6 years at 1.5 percent a year. when you consider the gdp growth over the last couple years, even though it is better than it was, adding 1.5 percent of the gdp growth would help our economy grow in a robust way. we are told by mckinsey & company's study that a 6-year transportation plan robustly funded would put about 1.8 million people to work. a lot of folks would like to be building roads, highways, and transportation systems, and they don't have employment opportunities because we are not funding them. we are not funding them. let's take a quick look at this map if we could. the states that are gray are states, as far as we know, that are not planning to delay or cancel projects. they are not even considering delaying projects, but the states that are in red, including delaware over here, are states that have delayed or cancelled projects. the states that are in yellow, including west virginia, are states that are considering project delays. that is not good. i have not counted the number of states--it looks like seven--that are in red. those are the states that have delayed projects. more than that, probably 10, are considering doing that. why is it important for us to fully fund at the federal level--do our share for roads, highways, bridges, transit funding? it is because about half of the money that our states spend through their departments of transportation, half their money comes from federal user fees--largely federal user fees--primarily, not entirely, but primarily user fees on the sale of gasoline. it has been unchanged in 23 years--not since 1993--22 years. the user fee on diesel has been unchanged for some 22 years, right where we were. the price of everything else goes up. concrete goes up, asphalt goes up, steel goes up, and labor goes up. we have more energy-efficient vehicles. they are not using as much gas or [[page s6927]] diesel. that is a good thing, but it is also a bad thing for having funding for transportation projects. so i want to look at a map and would invite all of us to consider it. i don't anybody who says--any economist worth their salt--who does not say: fully funding a multi- year transportation plan, not for 6 months or 3 months, something like that, but fully funding it--robustly funding it for 6 years--will do great things for our economy. the reason we end up with job growth of something like 1.8 million people, according to mckinsey and company, is because the economy works far more efficiently if roads, highways, bridges are operating and working well. so i just want to share that and start off my remarks today. i have some numbers here that i would like to share. so far in 2015, this year, four states--arkansas, georgia, tennessee, and wyoming--have shelved some $805 million in projects due to the uncertainty over federal funds. again, the uncertainty is over roughly half the money that they are going to spend on roads, highways, and bridges. it comes from federal user fees, federal taxes. our transportation system--at least the way we fund it--has been broken since 2008. since that time, in the last 5 or 6 years, we have passed i think 12 short-term patches to the tune of nearly $74 billion. how do we pay for them? we pay for them with budget gimmicks. that is how we do it. and we pay for them with debt. when we issue debt, we borrow money. we sell treasury securities, and we sell them around the world. among the countries that buy them are china and the chinese people. we are then beholden to them as our creditors. it puts us in a situation that i do not find too comfortable. my guess is some of you don't either. there are better alternatives to fund our nation's transportation system. i only mentioned a couple of them. i feel as if i have not a magic wand but the ability to see into the future. twenty years from now, i think there is a pretty good chance that we will have figured out how to pay for roads, highways, bridges, and transit systems by figuring out how to make sure those folks who use transportation pay for it. one of the ways we are trying to do that--they have been trying to do that in oregon for almost 10 years. they have something called road user charge. some people have heard of that term. more people have heard of something called vehicle miles traveled, and the ability to say your vehicle--i don't care what kind of vehicle it is, but we know how many miles that vehicle travels on a road, highway or bridge in the course of a year. there is fee that is attached to that. some people are uncomfortable with that because it has implications on privacy. i can understand that. in oregon they are trying to figure it out. they have got about 5,000 vehicles--at least--in their system. they are sort of--i like to say states are laboratories of democracy. in this case, oregon is trying to be the laboratory. i believe california is looking at being another laboratory to figure out we make something like vehicle miles traveled work in a state. oregon is good-sized state, and california is a very big state. if they can do that, then we will learn from them, not just at the state level but perhaps at the federal level as well. i think we will be funding projects--not just now but in the future, 20 years from now--through tooling. when i travel back to my native state of west virginia, i go through west virginia and i pay tolls. when i was a little kid and they first built the turnpike, we would have to stop and find change--whatever--stop every 5 or 10 miles. you don't do that anymore. we don't do that anymore in delaware either, because we have--in delaware and i think in west virginia--highway- speed e-zpass. it is an express e-zpass. you go through, and it is charged to your credit card that you have already established when you establish your e-zpass plan. also, we now have the technology that even if folks don't have an e- zpass--in some tolling operations around the country, a person drives through in their vehicle, car, truck, van, whatever the system--when you go through the toll plaza, they don't collect a toll. they have a highly accurate camera with the ability to take pictures of the vehicle and great pictures of your license plates, and then they send a bill to the owner of that vehicle. so you don't even have to have high-speed e- zpass. but a combination of those two, systems like e-zpass and systems like the one i just described where people drive through with no e- zpass or a similar system, but they actually get billed for it later on. they do not get billed and fined; they just get billed for it. if you don't pay it, then i am sure something will happen. but i think 20 years from now we will have something that looks a lot like that. my guess is we will also have user fees, but not everybody likes tolling. as it turns out, oregon has been working on road user charge, also known as vehicle miles traveled. they have been working on it for 10 years, and they have got 5,000 people in the plan. so this is not going to happen in 5 years or 10 years, but maybe 20 years for both a combination of tolling and vehicle miles traveled. there is another idea out there that is used in some places around the country. it is called 3p or p3. when i first heard that, i thought they were talking about p-3 airplanes. i spent a lot of years of my life as a naval flight officer in p-3 aircraft. i used to command them, but they were not talking about airplanes when they were talking about p3. they were talking about public-private partnerships. we have some pretty good examples of where that is working. we can learn from those in different states. i think that can be part of the future. it ought to be. put the three of them together, is that a comprehensive plan? not entirely, but it is pretty good approach. it is a heck of a lot better than what we have been doing: pension smoothing, increasing fees for tsa. instead of improving aviation safety, we put the money in the transportation trust fund. raising customs fees--instead of putting the money in ways to make our borders most robust and so forth, we put some of that money in the transportation trust fund. we sell oil out of the strategic petroleum reserve--i think probably at a bad time to sell it, when the price is really low. they say: buy low, sell high. well, if we are going to sell petroleum out of the petroleum reserve--the price of oil is about as low right now as it has been in a long, long time. i am told that--i don't know if it was last week or the week before-- there are 10,000 gasoline stations across the country where they are selling gasoline for less than $2 a gallon. i don't know what they are charging in west virginia, but i filled up my chrysler town and country minivan, which has 403,000 miles on it, and i paid $2.15 a gallon. there are some places in delaware where people are paying less and in neighboring new jersey where they are paying less. but right now, it does not make much sense to sell oil out of our strategic petroleum reserve. there are some people who want to and who want to use that money to go into the transportation trust fund. i think that is foolish. we have to be smarter than that. i have another chart i want us to take a look at. i want to thank ``vanna white'' here for putting up these charts. i will pay for that later. this chart talks about legislation--it is kind of ironic. that is s. 1994. i mentioned earlier how the last time we raised the federal gasoline and diesel tax or fee was in 1993 when we raised it to 18 cents for gas and about 23, 24 cents for diesel. they have been there for 22 years. one of the things i have done is introduce legislation, and i have done so with dick durbin, who used to serve on the bowles-simpson commission--remember the bowles-simpson commission. i thought it was a great approach to figure out how to seriously address our nation's deficit in a variety of ways. one of the ways that bowles-simpson said we should address our deficit situation--i will say our budget deficits are down--topped out, i think, in 2009 at $1.4 trillion. this year we are down about $400 billion. is that an improvement? yes, it is. do we have some ways to go? we sure do. what bowles-simpson suggested is that we raise the gas or diesel tax at the federal level by a penny each quarter, a penny every 3 months for 15 quarters. so effectively you would be raising the gas or diesel tax by 3 or 4 cents a year for 4 years and index it going forward. [[page s6928]] what senator durbin and i have introduced is actually something quite similar to that, which a majority of the bowles-simpson commission voted for. it is called the traffic relief act. what it calls for is an annual 4 cent gas increase in gas and diesel. that would be for a total of about 4 years--4 cents a year for 4 years. after that, we would index those user fees, those taxes, to the rate of inflation. the rate of inflation is pretty low lately, so they would not go up very much if the rate of inflation stays where it is. if the rate of inflation rears its head again, then that would be different. a fellow who was a member of my staff back in wilmington, de--when we introduced this bill, the price for gas at a station in the neighborhood where his family buys gas--in the space of 2 days, the price of gas either went up or went down by 13 cents. it went up in 2 days, 13 cents. as we know, the price of oil moves up and down all of the time. my own belief is--and i have heard this from a lot of people--there are a lot of days or a lot of weeks where the price of gas or diesel goes up a lot more than 4 cents. right now our world is not literally awash in oil but certainly figuratively awash in oil. one of the reasons the price at the pump for gas and diesel is so low--as i said earlier, a couple of weeks ago there were 10,000 gas stations across the country selling gas for less than two bucks a gallon. one of the reasons it is so low is because the united states is producing a lot more than we have for some time, and so are a bunch of other countries, including the opec nations. with the approval of the iran agreement, as the iranians comply with the agreement--my hope is that they will comply in spirit and in letter, and then as a result of that, they will be in a position to begin selling. they have only been selling some of their oil products to customers, including i think india, maybe japan, china, but they will be able to sell more products. a world that is already awash in oil is going to find that iran, which i think has the fourth greatest oil reserves in the world, is going to be back in the market and selling their own products. i believe that will keep the prices from rising anytime soon. and i think there is reason to believe that the price at the pump, which is already quite low, might even go down further. time will tell. i have one last poster board here i wish to look at for just a moment. our legislation--this is a typo here. it says that it restores $240 billion for the highway trust fund. it is not $240 billion, it is $220 billion. still, compared to what? compared to nothing. compared to doing nothing, it is a whole lot. if we had a status quo, any kind of a status quo increase--a highway bill or a transportation bill--we would use maybe half of that. so what we are talking about is double, just getting by, and we have such a backlog of work to do, that it doesn't make sense just to push enough money to these projects to get by. this would provide roughly twice that amount of money and would maybe not raise our gdp by 1.5 percent, but it would sure raise it. it may not put 1.8 million people to work over the next year, but it would put a lot of people to work and people who like to do these jobs. the money would fully fund the federal highway and transit programs in our country. it would increase investments in upgrades and in repairs as well. it would do it in a way that doesn't drop a huge burden on users of these products--gasoline and diesel--all in one fell swoop. it is like 4 cents a year over 4 years. after 4 years, there will be a 16-cent increase. people say: well, what is that in terms of practical impact? what does that actually mean for somebody? i am told that it is actually--i don't drink a lot of coffee, but my friends who do get a small coffee over in the dirksen building across the street. they pay $1.70, and if they get a medium-sized coffee, it is like $2.50, and a really big one is maybe a little bit over $3. this is not really fancy coffee but just a regular cup of coffee with cream and sugar, and the price is maybe $2 or $3. literally for the price of a cup of coffee a week, for those of us who use roads, highways, bridges, who buy gas, who buy diesel, we could have a much better transportation system. this isn't $10 a week or $20 a week or $30 a week. that increase over 4 years--4 cents a year for 4 years--without the data for the average driver, that is about a cup of coffee a week. is that too much to pay for roads, highways, bridges, and a good transit system? i don't think so. there is an interest in offsetting some of these increases with a regressive tax, but there is an interest in offsetting some of that by making some tweaks like michigan is going to do with their state earned-income tax credit with a republican governor and republican legislature. i think there is maybe a lesson or something we can do there to help address the regressive nature of this tax. i close by saying i come to this floor from time to time and i mention one of the things i love to do. i don't know if you ever do this, madam president, but i love to ask people who have been married a long time ``what is the secret for being married for a long time?'' i have done it for years. i have asked this question of hundreds of people who are older folks who have been married 30 years, 40 years, 50 years, 60 years, 70 years. i ask them ``what is the secret?'' i get hilarious answers. i get some that are very poignant and others are just plain memorable for a lot of reasons. but the best answer i have ever gotten is there are two c's. what are the two c's? communicate and compromise. that is not only the secret for a vibrant marriage between two people, it is also the secret for a vibrant democracy, to communicate and compromise. i would add a third c, and that is to collaborate. what the american people said to us last november--whether they are republicans, democrats, or independents--is that they want us to communicate, they want us to compromise, and they want us to collaborate, and we need to do that. one idea i have not mentioned here bears mentioning. it was an idea that was endorsed last year by the administration and was endorsed last year by the immediate past chairman of the ways and means committee, with whom our president served, dave camp. he retired earlier this year as a congressman from michigan, a very good person. what they proposed is international tax reform. what both chairman camp at the time and the administration said is that there are about $2 trillion in overseas profits of american companies. they are just keeping it over there and they are not that anxious to bring it back because they don't want to have to pay--i don't know--35 percent, 33 percent, 32 percent, 29 percent. they are looking for a lower tax break and then to bring it back when it makes sense. the administration and dave camp said: let's deem it repatriated. the treasury said: all right. you have money over there, american companies. bring it back. it is going to be taxed at about 10 percent. that was the proposal. the administration said: american companies that have money over there, we want you to bring it back. you won't be taxed at 35 percent or 25 percent, but you will be taxed at about 14 percent. that is an idea, and it is an interesting idea. it doesn't solve the problem forever. it provides one-time money--quite a bit of it--for roads, bridges, rail, and for airports as well. it doesn't solve the problem permanently, but it surely gives us a lot of money. not every company likes that idea, and not everybody who serves here likes that idea, but it is a serious idea, and it is one that deserves a lot of consideration, and i hope we will do that. let me just say this. at the end of the day, if we come to the end of this calendar year--when we run out of money yet again for roads, highways, and bridges and we say ``well, what are we going to do now?''--we will have not just the states i pointed out here in yellow and red that are bailing on projects, delaying and stopping them in some cases, we will have a lot more yellow and a whole lot more red on the map i had up earlier. what do we do about it? do we just do what we have done for 5 years and kick the can down the road yet again and look for cats and dogs and wherever we can find a few bucks and sort of throw them at the problem for a while, not make a real committed effort? frankly, we are not giving the voters in this country any reason to feel encouraged about our courage. i hope we don't do that. [[page s6929]] if at the end of the day we don't do some kind of international tax reform, good ideas such as expanding tolling, vehicle miles traveled, and public-private partnerships--those are all good ideas, and i hope we grow them all. we are not going to have them all in place in the kind of scope we need by the end of this year. if we find ourselves at a time and place where we run out of money, where the states are looking to us and we are running out of money at the federal level--and the price of gas is two bucks a gallon at gas stations across america--my hope is people will say: you know, for the price of a cup of coffee, i could have good roads, highways, bridges, and transit systems again. for the price of a cup of coffee a week, i could have that. forty cents a week, maybe. maybe that is not a bad deal for their family or for our country. i want people to think about that. in the weeks to come, i am going to be talking a lot about this proposal. my hope is that as time goes buy, people will say--like my dad used to say in west virginia when my sister and i were little kids growing up and they were in west virginia--my dad used to say to my sister and me after we had done yet another boneheaded stunt: just use some common sense. he said that a lot. he did not say it that nicely. but i think this may be an opportunity for us to use some of that common sense here, and i know he would approve, and at the end of the day, so would the voters of america. there are a number of states that have actually done what i am talking about. they have raised their user fees, and in some cases they have phased them in over a couple of years. it is interesting what happened in the elections last year where the state legislators had voted to do that, where they raised the user fees in order to would pay for roads, highways, and bridges. interestingly enough, the legislators who voted for that--republicans--didn't get thrown out of office. ninety-five percent of them were reelected. they won their primaries, they won their general elections, and they were reelected. the democrats who voted for those modest user fees increases didn't get thrown out of office either. in the states that raised the money locally to make the improvements that were needed in transportation, 90 percent of the democrats won their primaries and they won their general elections. they were reelected. people want us to make hard choices here. they don't want us to continue to kid them or fool them; they want us to do the real thing. they want us to work together. they want us to get things done. they want us to strengthen our economic recovery, and this is not a bad way to do that. with that, i see a great american from new mexico has joined us. he is somebody who has worked with the senator from louisiana and the senator who was just here before, mr. inhofe, the chairman of the epw committee, to try to find a good way for us to strengthen the economic recovery and at the same time to further clean our air, promote public health, and do good things for our public environment. i wish to say to tom udall how proud i am to be his colleague and how much i appreciate his leadership position on a very important issue, an environmental law that hasn't been updated in almost 40 years and, frankly, doesn't work. it has never worked, and we need to do something about it. under his leadership, along with our other two colleagues, my hope is that we will. i look forward to what he has to say. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from new mexico. tsca mr. udall. madam president, thank you very much for the recognition. i wish to say to senator carper about tsca that we have been working on--you were one of the early senators who really cared about this issue. you were involved with it, and you helped it develop. over time, we did a marvelous thing in terms of improving what senator frank lautenberg had put on the table, bipartisan--he developed a lot of republican and democratic support--and you were a key player all the way through. so we know--we think at this point, you and i believe--and we do a lot of visiting around on both sides of the aisle--that this is ready to go. we now have i think 53 cosponsors. we are developing more cosponsors every day, and we don't think there is any real hostility toward the bill in terms of wanting amendments that aren't relevant. that is a key factor for us, and both sides need to focus on that. i would like to express my appreciation to you for what you have done on tsca to help blend it into and make it into a bipartisan product. we have been trying--you know, it has been very busy with the pope in town, with the sequester facing us and the shutdown and things such as that. we have been trying to get onto the floor to talk about this, and i think we are going to continue to do that in the future. but it is tremendously important that this gets some floor time now, and i know you have been working on that with me. do you see this as a product that is better than current law? i mean, my sense is it is much better than the current law. mr. carper. if i could respond to my friend, i have a friend who-- when you ask him ``how are you doing?'' he says ``compared to what?'' and when we talk about the legislation initially introduced by senator lautenberg, senator vitter, and now coauthored by you, senator vitter, and senator inhofe, with input from a number of us, i always say: well, compared to what? the idea here is to ensure that the epa does its due diligence on toxic substances in this country. and there are thousands or tens of thousands of chemicals--you know better than i do--that exist in our environment--in our air, our ground, in water--tens of thousands. are they all toxic? no. but my recollection--correct me if i am wrong in this, but i think that out of those thousands, tens of thousands, i believe the epa in the last 38 years has actually done their due diligence on really fewer than 200, maybe even fewer than 10 when you get down to it, maybe even just 5. and you say: how long has this bill been around, this law been around? thirty-eight years. and they have now finished work on five highly toxic substances? if we can't do better than that, we ought to quit, and this is not the time to quit. it is sort of like football. you take the kickoff, and you are in your own territory and you start marching down the field. you get into the other team's territory, get down to the 20-yard line, and you are in the red zone--not in the end zone, but you are in the red zone. i think with your leadership and that of our colleagues, we are in the red zone. we need to bring this onto the floor with 53 cosponsors equally divided between democrats and republicans. there is a lot of interest in the house, and i think there is support from the administration. we ought to get this done. thank you. mr. udall. madam president, it bears repeating. senator carper is very modest, and he is a humble man, but he has done a lot to help bring us to this point. i think he is one of the senators here who work the best across the aisle, and that is what has happened. we have had a lot of senators who have wanted to work across the aisle on this bill. as senator carper knows, on the environment and public works committee, he was joined by senator booker, senator whitehouse, and senator merkley in terms of helping to mark up the bill and make it a better product. when the senator talks about going across the finish line, with 53 cosponsors about evenly divided between democrat and republican--i think it is almost exactly even--that sends a signal to our majority leader that this has tremendous support in both caucuses. i believe the presiding officer here is on the bill. so everybody standing on the senate floor right now is on what is a good, bipartisan product. so we are going to work very carefully in the next couple of days to see that attention is brought to this, and hopefully we will have an opportunity to have a debate with amendments and then meet with the house. the house, as senator carper knows, has already passed a piece of legislation, i think 378 to 1--1 person in the house opposing it. so we have a bill that is alive and ready to go, and we need to get it out [[page s6930]] of the senate so we can conference it with the house and get it to the president's desk for his signature. i don't know if the senator has any other thoughts on what is the best way to move forward. i mean, obviously we have to be bipartisan, but at this particular point, is it the senator's sense we are ready to go, from everything he has seen from the environment and public works committee and these other senators in various places? is it ready to go? mr. carper. if i may respond to my colleague's question, i don't care if the majority leader is a republican or a democrat--they are always trying to figure out how do we have time on the calendar to get this stuff done. they are always looking at ways. and one of the best ways to ensure legislation actually fits into a reasonably small period of time is to line up bipartisan support. i tell my colleague, i have been here in the senate for a while, and this is almost a picture-book way to pass legislation: work it up through the grassroots--democratic lautenberg and republican vitter and now with your role and others. there are not many bills in the senate that have 26 or 27 democrats and an equal number of republicans. has everything been worked out? no. is there a need for amendments? yes. is there a need for a filibuster? no. we should bring it to the floor. i think we should go to the majority leader and visit with him early and often and continue to remind him. and those who believe in this, whether they happen to be on the environmental side or happen to be folks in the health care arena or maybe on the manufacturing side--and we thank those who have helped us draft this--we ask for them not to be silent about it but to urge not just us but the leadership to find time--a couple of days--to bring this bill to the floor and just get it done. with that, i say to my colleague and the presiding officer, if i put down my microphone and pack up my bag, i can have dinner with my wife in the first state of delaware, and that is my goal. so i will bid you adieu. mr. udall. i thank the senator. i wish you godspeed on that train headed to wilmington because you have a wonderful wife. mr. carper. well, it is not the last train to clarksville, but it is the next train to wilmington. mr. udall. and let me say again that not only on tsca, as senator carper held, we were going to have speeches earlier in the week, but we were unable, with some of the scheduling issues and everything, to get down here and talk as a group. we had senator whitehouse, who was going to come down, and senator merkley was going to come down, as well as several of the key members of the environment and public works committee who played such a big role in terms of moving this bill forward. the person who really kicked this off was senator frank lautenberg. what a star in terms of bipartisanship. i remember working with him when i was on the environment and public works committee for a long period of time on a very substantive piece of legislation. it was so good, we couldn't find much bipartisanship on it, and he understood that. it got out of the committee. it wasn't ready for prime time here on the floor, and so what we ended up doing was saying we need to go back to square one. senator lautenberg took that very seriously. he met with senator vitter. senator manchin played a role in that, and senator manchin was one of the ones who were going to come to the floor to talk, and he played a role in getting them together. as a result, a bipartisan bill came out in the last congress. that has continued now for almost 2\1/2\ years, and it is a very good product. madam president, the american people want a government that works, not one that shuts down to send a message. they want a congress that moves the nation forward, not one that grinds to a halt. they want a responsible budget that supports working families and strengthens our economy and creates jobs. these should be our priorities, not an attack on women's health care. i understand some people have strong views about a woman's right to choose that are different from mine. there are strong differences of opinion on many important issues in this senate and in the congress-- health care, energy, climate change, foreign policy. we could make a very long list. i read an insightful quote the other day from my good friend republican senator lamar alexander. senator alexander said: ``if we had a shutdown every time we had a dispute over a contentious issue, the government would never open.'' i think that is a very wise observation. we do have many differences, but, most importantly, we must have the broader national interest in mind. the clock is ticking. funding runs out in just a few days. we need a clean continuing resolution, and we need it now--a temporary funding bill just to keep the lights on. have we forgotten what happened 2 years ago? the people of my home state of new mexico have not forgotten. we were badly hurt by the shutdown then, and we would be badly hurt by a shutdown now. in los alamos and sandia, our two doe labs are working on modernizing aging nuclear weapons systems to keep them safe and secure. it is foolish to cause unnecessary disruption to projects of this significance where there is no margin for error. each of these labs employs thousands of people, many of them scientists at the top of their field. why would we threaten their paychecks and the important national security work they are doing? we have three air force bases in new mexico--cannon, kirtland, and holloman--all serving a variety of unique national security missions for our country. white sands missile range, unlike any facility in the country, provides critical research and testing for future technologies. shutdowns and sequestration send a terrible message to the men and women at these facilities. it limits their effectiveness and harms the economies in nearby communities, such as clovis, albuquerque, alamogordo, and dona ana county. shutdowns mean lost jobs and lost revenue, all in the face of a struggling economy. we cannot afford another government shutdown, and we cannot afford a return to sequester cuts. these are bad choices. these are self-inflicted wounds. a clean cr will keep the government open, but we need a long-term cure. we need a bipartisan budget agreement--one that makes smart investments and meets the real needs of american families. the people of my state work hard. many are still struggling. the economy of new mexico has not yet recovered completely from the recession. we know new mexicans want us to come together and push for a stronger recovery. new mexicans are eager for solutions, and they are tired of these political games that threaten jobs and weaken our economy. yet here we are once again facing a manufactured crisis. we all know that in fiscal year 2016, which begins next week, the murray-ryan budget deal will expire and we will be left with a return to sequestration. as ranking member of the interior subcommittee on the committee on appropriations, i would like to talk about that today because the impacts of the funding levels required by the budget control act are clear and they are very destructive. just look at the senate interior appropriations bill reported out of the committee in june. to stay within the spending limits we faced under sequestration, it slashes more than $2 billion from the president's budget request. that means it doesn't provide enough funding for basic water infrastructure or to protect our public lands or to fulfill our trust responsibility to american indians and alaska natives. i know my chairman, senator murkowski, did the very best she could with the allocation she was given, but here is the reality: the budget control act caps don't meet the needs of our nation. they fail critical programs. they fail our communities in new mexico and nationwide. our nation faces an infrastructure crisis. yet the senate bill cuts grants to states for water and sewer infrastructure by more than $500 million below fiscal year 2015 levels. actions have consequences, and here are the consequences of the senate bill: some 230 communities will not have their water projects funded, 14,000 construction jobs will not be created, and [[page s6931]] $1 billion in matching and leveraged funds from state partners will be lost. the senate bill also shortchanges the national park service with $318 million less than the president requested. that means 1,000 fewer park rangers. that means $150 million less to maintain our national parks even though the service will celebrate its centennial in 2016 and will host a record number of visitors at national parks nationwide. we have 15 national parks in new mexico, including our newest national park, the valles caldera national preserve. these parks and other public lands in my state are critical not only for conservation but for our economy. a shutdown would be a disaster; sequestration is just a slower moving disaster. carlsbad caverns national park, bandelier national monument, tent rocks national monument, bosque del apache wildlife refuge, and many other sites are key economic assets. these sites help grow jobs, they help communities grow, and they are great conservation assets in communities across the country. we cannot keep asking them to do more and more on less. yet, without a sensible budget, that is exactly where we are headed in new mexico and across the nation. the senate interior appropriations bill also cuts more than $300 million from the president's request for the indian health service. we have a solemn trust responsibility to native americans, and we are failing. again, these are not just numbers. the impact is very real and very painful. it means the indian health service will fund 20,000 fewer doctor visits in 2016 and nearly 1,000 fewer hospital stays. it means falling further behind. we need a responsible budget to meet our obligation to the indian health service and other tribal programs, such as housing, school construction, indian education. all of those are being hurt by this sequestration budget. we cannot continue being shortsighted. we can't keep shortchanging programs that make a real difference in the lives of all americans. this includes art and cultural programs, the land and water conservation fund, and funding for our national forests and wildlife refuges. and the list goes on and on. the time is now, and we are running out of time. we are on the wrong train, on the wrong track, and going nowhere. fortunately, there is a solution. let's pass a clean cr, and let's work together to pass a budget that actually meets the needs of our nation, with sensible funding levels for defense and nondefense programs alike. before i wrap up my remarks, i wish to call attention to another deadline that is fast approaching. the authorization for the land and water conservation fund will expire on september 30 if this congress doesn't act. recently, i was one of 53 members who called on the leadership of this chamber to pass an extension of the law, and i want to reiterate that call today. the land and water conservation fund just celebrated its 50th birthday. it enjoys strong bipartisan support because the idea behind it is so simple and so powerful. when this nation develops one natural resource--our oil and gas reserves--we invest some of the proceeds in other critical conservation priorities. for five decades now, the land and water conservation fund has protected our national parks, forests, and other public lands. it helps ensure hunting, fishing, and recreational access, and it improves and expands our local parks and recreation facilities. the program has been a tremendous success and has had a tremendous impact on my state, from urban refuges--such as the valle de oro--to wide open preserves such as the valles caldera. it provides crucial funding to preserve open spaces, strengthen the economy, and enhance our way of life. lwcf allows us to leverage today's resources to protect vital lands and waters for future generations. allowing the law to expire breaks that compact. it doesn't make any sense, and it doesn't have to happen. we shouldn't let the land and water conservation fund expire, even for a single day. i call on this chamber to act swiftly to permanently authorize this important program and ensure that it is fully funded. madam president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. mcconnell. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mr. sullivan). without objection, it is so ordered. mr. mcconnell. mr. president, those of us who believe in protecting innocent and precious life may have lost a vote today, but we are steadily winning a larger argument--a critical argument that goes to the heart of who we want to be as a society. we can feel momentum for life on the rise just as we see extremism on the other side increasing. by placing their allegiance with the far left instead of women, democrats are making a losing bet they will come to regret over the long term. today, however, we must grapple with the challenges of the present. democrats' insistence on blocking the strategy pursued today means we have to consider the options now before us. the reality is that the government will shut down next week if congress does not act. the president of right to life said to those of us who believe in protecting life: there are two different roads we can take. one is to insist that no more money go to planned parenthood and cause a government shutdown (which won't result in actually defunding planned parenthood). the other is to take a slightly longer- term approach, taking advantage of the fact that we have the attention of the country as probably never before. . . . every well-informed pro-lifer wants to defund planned parenthood. i want to defund planned parenthood. there are wonderful pro-life men and women in congress who want to defund planned parenthood. and, certainly national right to life wants to defund planned parenthood. the difference here is in strategy. this is not the end of this debate or this discussion. i urge colleagues to join me in supporting the legislation i am about to file which would ensure that the government remains open. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. mcconnell. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",177942

SCOTT Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the legacy of Elder Richard G. Scott, a man whose humble example and unwavering conviction had a deep and meaningful impact on my spiritual life. For nearly three decades, Elder Scott served as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. On Tuesday, he passed away from causes incident to age. Although millions mourn his death, we find peace in the knowledge that he is reunited with his beloved wife, Jeanene. As a missionary, a father, and an apostle, Elder Scott worked tirelessly and served selflessly. Many of us were inspired by his counsel, and even more were blessed by his kindness. He was a man of great faith and unbending principle, who in his own quiet way spent decades sharing the light of Christ with people throughout the world. Elder Scott's beginnings were as humble as his demeanor. When he was just a boy, his father taught him the virtues of manual labor, instilling in him the desire to craft, toy, and tinker with anything he could get his hands on. It was evident from an early age that Elder Scott would be a talented engineer, and he pursued that field of study when he enrolled in The George Washington University. To support himself through school, Elder Scott took odd jobs that gave him the chance to work with his hands. He spent summers fishing on lobster boats, logging in the forests of Utah, and repairing railroads for Union Pacific. While in college, he met Jeanene Watkins, the woman who would win his love and forever change his life. Quickly and effortlessly, Elder Scott fell for Jeanene, but before he could ask for her hand in marriage, she challenged him to serve a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Elder Scott's decision to embark on an LDS mission to Uruguay was the opening chapter in a long life of dedicated service. He returned from Uruguay with his faith refined and his testimony fortified. With this newfound conviction in Christ, Elder Scott married Jeanene in the Manti, UT, temple; and together they started a family. For Elder Scott, his family would be an anchor throughout a long and successful career as a nuclear engineer on the immediate staff of renowned U.S. Navy Admiral Hyman Rickover. For over a decade, Elder Scott served his Nation, but he was again called to serve God when he returned to South America as the President of the Argentina North Mission. As a missionary president, he directed all proselytizing and service efforts for hundreds of young volunteers. After returning from Argentina with his family, Elder Scott continued his ecclesiastical service, first, as a regional representative for the Church in both North and South America, and later, as a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy. In October 1988, he was ordained to be an apostle in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. As a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Elder Scott visited congregations of Latter-day Saints gathered throughout the world. He spoke fluent Portuguese and nearly impeccable Spanish. When possible, he took special care to address each congregation he visited in their native tongue. But there was always one language he spoke better than any other, the language of empathy. Elder Scott was no stranger to heartbreak. In fact, he came to know it very well. Two of his children preceded him in death, and his beloved wife, Jeanene, passed away in 1995. But amid tragedy, he found peace and healing through faith in Christ. Sadness sowed the seeds of compassion, and his capacity for empathy was boundless. When he spoke, he spoke as one who knew intimately well the sorrow that stems from suffering, but also the comfort that comes from healing. In all things, he communicated love. Whether through words of counsel or quiet acts of service, he radiated the goodness of God and shared it abundantly with others. Mr. President, I will be forever grateful for Elder Richard G. Scott--his life, his love, and his example. I will miss [[Page S6933]] Elder Scott dearly, as will all those who knew him. I send my deepest condolences to his family. May God comfort them in this time of grief, and may his love be with them always. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S6932-S6933] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING ELDER RICHARD G.

CREC-2015-09-24-pt1-PgS6933-2,CREC-2015-09-24,114,ENDING THE SCOURGE OF LANDMINES IN MOZAMBIQUE,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S6933] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ENDING THE SCOURGE OF LANDMINES IN MOZAMBIQUE Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week marked an important milestone in the campaign to rid the world of antipersonnel landmines. On September 17, Mozambique, where two decades ago an estimated 200,000 unexploded landmines were left over from a brutal 15-year civil war, became the first country with large-scale mine contamination to have all known minefields cleared. While accidents due to unknown mines and other unexploded ordnance in Mozambique will occasionally occur in the future as they still do in Europe 70 years after World War II, the number is a tiny fraction of what it once was, and it will continue to decline. The State Department recognized this milestone in a statement, which included the following: Since 1993, when Mozambique emerged from decades of conflict as one of the world's most landmine-affected nations, the United States has been proud to partner with the people of Mozambique, investing more than $55 million toward improving the safety and security of local communities though the U.S. Conventional Weapons Destruction program. Through that partnership--which includes the international donor community and humanitarian demining organizations--we have worked diligently to safely clear landmines and unexploded ordnance, prevent injuries through community outreach and education, and provide medical and social services to survivors of accidents involving these legacies of past conflicts. I have spoken many times in this Chamber about these indiscriminate weapons, which are triggered by the victim, whether a soldier or an unsuspecting child. They linger for days, weeks, years, and even decades after armed conflicts end. They destroy lives as well as livelihoods, making fields unworkable and roads impassable, crippling the economies of already impoverished communities. In recent years the United States has made important contributions to the worldwide eradication of landmines, and I have long supported funding for the State Department's humanitarian demining programs and for assistance for mine victims through the U.S. Agency for International Development's Leahy War Victims Fund, but the job is far from done. The painstaking work of HALO Trust and other dedicated organizations and individuals in Mozambique demonstrates what is possible. We used the Leahy War Victims Fund there, starting back in 1989, to provide artificial limbs, wheelchairs, and rehabilitation for victims of mines. Melissa Wells, our outstanding Ambassador to Mozambique at the time, was a strong supporter of that program. Thousands of people have regained their mobility as a result. My wife Marcelle, a registered nurse, traveled to Mozambique and visited some of them more than two decades ago. With this declaration, Mozambicans can live with far less fear of being maimed or killed while working in their fields, walking to school, or just stepping outside of their homes. This is a time to commend the people and Government of Mozambique and the courageous deminers, as well as those who have helped the victims of mines rebuild their lives. But as one who has worked to stop the use of landmines ever since my legislation to halt U.S. exports of these weapons was first enacted back in 1992, I must emphasize that landmines continue to threaten innocent people in many other countries. We have come a long way since 1994 when President Clinton, in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, called on all countries to rid the world of landmines.

Mr. President, last week marked an important milestone in the campaign to rid the world of antipersonnel landmines. On September 17, Mozambique, where two decades ago an estimated 200,000 unexploded landmines were left over from a brutal 15-year civil war, became the first country with large-scale mine contamination to have all known minefields cleared. While accidents due to unknown mines and other unexploded ordnance in Mozambique will occasionally occur in the future as they still do in Europe 70 years after World War II, the number is a tiny fraction of what it once was, and it will continue to decline. The State Department recognized this milestone in a statement, which included the following: Since 1993, when Mozambique emerged from decades of conflict as one of the world's most landmine-affected nations, the United States has been proud to partner with the people of Mozambique, investing more than $55 million toward improving the safety and security of local communities though the U.S. Conventional Weapons Destruction program. Through that partnership--which includes the international donor community and humanitarian demining organizations--we have worked diligently to safely clear landmines and unexploded ordnance, prevent injuries through community outreach and education, and provide medical and social services to survivors of accidents involving these legacies of past conflicts. I have spoken many times in this Chamber about these indiscriminate weapons, which are triggered by the victim, whether a soldier or an unsuspecting child. They linger for days, weeks, years, and even decades after armed conflicts end. They destroy lives as well as livelihoods, making fields unworkable and roads impassable, crippling the economies of already impoverished communities. In recent years the United States has made important contributions to the worldwide eradication of landmines, and I have long supported funding for the State Department's humanitarian demining programs and for assistance for mine victims through the U.S. Agency for International Development's Leahy War Victims Fund, but the job is far from done. The painstaking work of HALO Trust and other dedicated organizations and individuals in Mozambique demonstrates what is possible. We used the Leahy War Victims Fund there, starting back in 1989, to provide artificial limbs, wheelchairs, and rehabilitation for victims of mines. Melissa Wells, our outstanding Ambassador to Mozambique at the time, was a strong supporter of that program. Thousands of people have regained their mobility as a result. My wife Marcelle, a registered nurse, traveled to Mozambique and visited some of them more than two decades ago. With this declaration, Mozambicans can live with far less fear of being maimed or killed while working in their fields, walking to school, or just stepping outside of their homes. This is a time to commend the people and Government of Mozambique and the courageous deminers, as well as those who have helped the victims of mines rebuild their lives. But as one who has worked to stop the use of landmines ever since my legislation to halt U.S. exports of these weapons was first enacted back in 1992, I must emphasize that landmines continue to threaten innocent people in many other countries. We have come a long way since 1994 when President Clinton, in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, called on all countries to rid the world of landmines.

CREC-2015-09-24-pt1-PgS6933-4,CREC-2015-09-24,114,REQUIRING A REGIONAL STRATEGY TO ADDRESS THE THREAT POSED BY BOKO HARAM,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S6933-S6934] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REQUIRING A REGIONAL STRATEGY TO ADDRESS THE THREAT POSED BY BOKO HARAM Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I wish to praise Senate passage earlier this week of legislation I authored, S. 1632, to help combat the threat posed by the Boko Haram terrorist group. I am hopeful that our colleagues in the House will pass the bill quickly so that it can go to the President's desk for signature. Boko Haram is a notorious terrorist organization. Less well known, however, is what the name means: ``Western education is forbidden.'' This descriptive moniker helps explain the organization's determination to terrorize young girls who seek an education--girls who seek nothing more than a better life and a path to independence. Following the horrific kidnapping of 276 girls more than a year ago, Boko Haram has continued to commit barbaric acts of violence against civilians. According to the Congressional Research Service, Boko Haram may have killed more than 11,000 people, with more than 5,500 people killed in 2014 alone. Boko Haram has also pledged allegiance to ISIS, a fellow terrorist organization, in an attempt to further their reach and increase their ability to intimidate the citizens of Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, and Niger. We cannot sit idly by while Boko Haram continues to terrorize women, girls, and religious minorities in these African nations. Last year, in response to the kidnapping of the schoolgirls, I worked with Senator Barbara Mikulski and garnered the support of all 20 women Senators in urging Secretary of State John Kerry to seek Boko Haram's addition to the United Nations al-Qaeda Sanctions List. Following this letter, the United Nations Security Council voted to subject Boko Haram to a complete asset freeze, travel ban, and arms embargo. This year, I am again leading a bipartisan legislative effort to address the threats posed by Boko Haram. Specifically, my bipartisan bill, which now awaits consideration in the House of Representatives, calls on the U.S. Departments of State and Defense and their relevant partners to work together in creating a 5-year strategy to [[Page S6934]] counter these increasing threats. Cosponsored by 18 of my Senate colleagues, this bill also signals a renewed congressional commitment to combatting Boko Haram and bolstering U.S. efforts throughout the region. While I am pleased that this legislation and previous efforts continue to move us forward in the fight against Boko Haram, more must be done. I will continue to work with my colleagues to create and enact legislation aimed at countering the violence and terror spread by Boko Haram. We have a window of opportunity to change the course of the fight against this intensifying terrorist threat, and we must seize the opportunity. We must also ensure that the United States, as a world leader, is providing the assistance necessary to make this strategy successful. We must never forget that the girls of Nigeria were targeted simply because they chose to pursue an education. We must send a message to women and girls around the world that their safety and well-being matters, that everyone deserves the opportunity to seek an education. We must also send a clear message to Boko Haram that their appalling acts of violence have no place in this world. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S6933-S6934] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REQUIRING A REGIONAL STRATEGY TO ADDRESS THE THREAT POSED BY BOKO HARAM Ms. COLLINS.

Dear Senator Toomey: The National Child Support Enforcement Association (NCSEA) is pleased to support your bill, the Child Support Assistance Act of 2015. Your bill will make even more efficient and effective the collection and distribution of child support payments to the custodial family. The targeted language of the measure strikes a provision of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) which requires a child support agency to provide 10-day notice by certified or registered mail to the non-custodial parent (NCP) to advise him or her that a consumer report will be requested to verify income and location of employment. The custodial and non-custodial parent both continue to have a full range of opportunities throughout the legal process to contest and correct information, including information provided by a consumer report. This technical change affecting only child support will further streamline the administration of the program to ensure that payments are made to the family as quickly as possible. As you know, the House Financial Services Committee passed a companion bill (H.R. 2091) earlier this year by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 56-2. As your bill moves through the legislative process, we stand ready to work with you to ensure its enactment into law, including providing additional comments from our members if questions arise about the effect of the bill's language and impact.

Mr. President, today I would like to recognize Anupam Kher, an Indian actor who has inspired many through a legacy of theater and film spanning more than three decades. Anupam Kher is one of India's most prominent theatre and film personalities. His contributions to Hindi and English-language film and culture are tremendous, and his exceptional career as an actor, producer, teacher, and author will serve as an inspiration for generations to come. Born in 1955 in Himachal Pradesh, India, Anupam had a modest upbringing. After graduating from the D.A.V. School, in Shimla, Anupam attended the National School of Drama, to which he would later return as director. He was chair of Central Board of Film Certification from 2003-2004, after which the Government of India awarded him the prestigious Padma Shri for his contributions to Indian cinema. Anupam has appeared in over 100 plays and over 450 films, and he is considered one of the greatest actors of contemporary cinema. In addition to his dramatic work, Anupam is an active voice for change, and he regularly speaks out against corruption and inequality. The United Nations recently recognized his efforts, honoring him as a ``Champion of Gender Equality'' for his work on their HeForShe campaign. In 2010, he was appointed as the goodwill ambassador of the Pratham Education Foundation, which strives to improve children's education in India. It is inspiring to see an actor dedicate his time and celebrity to promote social change. It is an honor to serve a State with one of the largest Indian American diasporas in the country, and we were thrilled to host a talent such as Anupam Kher, whose career has made an indelible impression across the globe. Anupam's commitment to the arts is unwavering, and his myriad contributions to theatrical arts are a testament to his dedication to his craft. Anupam has touched countless lives and has changed the way the world views Bollywood and India. His work is worthy of the highest commendation. I hope my colleagues will join me in celebrating Anupam Kher's continued success. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S6934] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING ANUPAM KHER Mr. BOOKER.

Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to Conway, NH, a town in Carroll County that is celebrating the 250th anniversary of its founding. I am delighted to join citizens across the Granite State in recognizing this historic occasion. Conway is located within the Mount Washington Valley and sits in the shadow of the 2,369 foot Black Cap Mountain. The town is encompassed by the Saco River watershed, including both the Swift and Saco Rivers, and holds portions of the White Mountain National Forest to the north and west. Conway consists of the villages of Conway, North Conway, Center Conway, Redstone, Kearsarge, and Intervale and was first chartered in 1765 by Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth. The town was eventually settled by Joshua Heath, Benjamin Dolloff, and Ebenezer Burbank and is named for British Secretary of State for the Southern Department Henry Seymour Conway. Secretary Conway is often remembered for his opposition to the Stamp Act, thereby in favor of moderate taxation policies for the colonies. Cathedral Ledge, Echo Lake State Park, and a portion of the Kancamagus Highway are all located in Conway, offering some of most scenic vistas in the State. From atop the ledge, you can look over the town and the surrounding mountains and rivers that make up the valley. ``The Kanc,'' as many locals call it, has the honor of being the highest mountain pass in the Eastern United States with the crest of the road sitting high at 2,855 feet and stretching for 32 miles from Conway to the neighboring town of Lincoln. Conway is one of the premier tourist destinations in New Hampshire. Every year, the town hosts thousands of visitors who travel north to enjoy the outdoor activities, dining, shopping, and culture of the Mount Washington Valley. Conway is home to hundreds of locally owned businesses, each with its own unique style and flavor. In a single day, a visitor could ride into the mountains aboard the historic Conway Scenic Railroad, canoe down the meandering Saco River, zip-line at the Cranmore Mountain Adventure Park, or virtually visit the home of the ``world's worst weather'' at the Mount Washington Observatory Museum. And during the winter months, Conway provides ample opportunity for downhill and cross-country skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, and both ice skating and climbing. On behalf of all Granite Staters, I am pleased to offer my congratulations to the citizens of Conway on reaching this special milestone, and I thank them for their many contributions to the life and spirit of the State of New Hampshire. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S6934] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS ______ CONWAY, NEW HAMPSHIRE Ms. AYOTTE.

Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate CW2 Roger Capps on receiving the Defense of Freedom Medal, honoring his service and sacrifice while working in Afghanistan. It gives me great pleasure to see a member of the Nevada family being recognized with this prestigious medal. In April of 2013, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Capps, then a traditional lieutenant colonel, was transporting military equipment across Afghanistan for Columbia Helicopters. During the trip, he was struck by an insurgent-shot bullet that had entered the helicopter by a rare opening in the bulletproof flooring, ultimately shattering his femur and pelvis. Though he will not receive a Purple Heart because he was working as a civilian that day, he will receive this unique Defense of Freedom Medal presented to civilian employees who are killed or wounded while working in support of the Department of Defense. His service remains invaluable to this great Nation. Even after this difficult day, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Capps maintained a positive spirit. While recovering from his injuries, he reassessed his military future, ultimately opting to utilize his piloting skills. In May, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Capps resigned his commission and transferred to the warrant officer corps. He now serves our Nation flying Chinook helicopters for the Army Guard. I extend my deepest gratitude to Chief Warrant Officer 2 Capps for his bravery in serving the United States of America. His unwavering commitment to serving our Nation demonstrates his genuine selfless character and love for his country. His actions represent only the greatest of Nevada's values, including dedication, courage, and a spirit to persevere in the most difficult times. As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I recognize that Congress has a responsibility not only to honor these brave individuals who serve our Nation but also to ensure they are cared for when they return home. I remain committed to upholding this promise for our veterans and servicemembers in Nevada and throughout the Nation. Chief Warrant Officer 2 Capps' sacrifice warrants only the greatest respect and care in return. Throughout his tenure, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Capps has demonstrated unparalleled bravery and positivity. I am both humbled and honored by his service and am proud to call him a fellow Nevadan. Today I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Chief Warrant Officer 2 Capps on his much-deserved accolade and wish him well in all of his future endeavors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S6935] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING CHIEF WARRANT OFFICER 2 ROGER CAPPS Mr. HELLER.

It gives me great pleasure to see a member of the Nevada family being recognized with this prestigious medal. In April of 2013, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Capps, then a traditional lieutenant colonel, was transporting military equipment across Afghanistan for Columbia Helicopters. During the trip, he was struck by an insurgent-shot bullet that had entered the helicopter by a rare opening in the bulletproof flooring, ultimately shattering his femur and pelvis. Though he will not receive a Purple Heart because he was working as a civilian that day, he will receive this unique Defense of Freedom Medal presented to civilian employees who are killed or wounded while working in support of the Department of Defense. His service remains invaluable to this great Nation. Even after this difficult day, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Capps maintained a positive spirit. While recovering from his injuries, he reassessed his military future, ultimately opting to utilize his piloting skills. In May, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Capps resigned his commission and transferred to the warrant officer corps. He now serves our Nation flying Chinook helicopters for the Army Guard. I extend my deepest gratitude to Chief Warrant Officer 2 Capps for his bravery in serving the United States of America. His unwavering commitment to serving our Nation demonstrates his genuine selfless character and love for his country. His actions represent only the greatest of Nevada's values, including dedication, courage, and a spirit to persevere in the most difficult times. As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I recognize that Congress has a responsibility not only to honor these brave individuals who serve our Nation but also to ensure they are cared for when they return home. I remain committed to upholding this promise for our veterans and servicemembers in Nevada and throughout the Nation. Chief Warrant Officer 2 Capps' sacrifice warrants only the greatest respect and care in return. Throughout his tenure, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Capps has demonstrated unparalleled bravery and positivity. I am both humbled and honored by his service and am proud to call him a fellow Nevadan. Today I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Chief Warrant Officer 2 Capps on his much-deserved accolade and wish him well in all of his future endeavors. ____________________",package_114_55.csv,2789,2789,2863,"[congressional record volume 161, number 138 (thursday, september 24, 2015)] [senate] [page s6935] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] congratulating chief warrant officer 2 roger capps mr. heller. mr. president, today i wish to congratulate cw2 roger capps on receiving the defense of freedom medal, honoring his service and sacrifice while working in afghanistan. it gives me great pleasure to see a member of the nevada family being recognized with this prestigious medal. in april of 2013, chief warrant officer 2 capps, then a traditional lieutenant colonel, was transporting military equipment across afghanistan for columbia helicopters. during the trip, he was struck by an insurgent-shot bullet that had entered the helicopter by a rare opening in the bulletproof flooring, ultimately shattering his femur and pelvis. though he will not receive a purple heart because he was working as a civilian that day, he will receive this unique defense of freedom medal presented to civilian employees who are killed or wounded while working in support of the department of defense. his service remains invaluable to this great nation. even after this difficult day, chief warrant officer 2 capps maintained a positive spirit. while recovering from his injuries, he reassessed his military future, ultimately opting to utilize his piloting skills. in may, chief warrant officer 2 capps resigned his commission and transferred to the warrant officer corps. he now serves our nation flying chinook helicopters for the army guard. i extend my deepest gratitude to chief warrant officer 2 capps for his bravery in serving the united states of america. his unwavering commitment to serving our nation demonstrates his genuine selfless character and love for his country. his actions represent only the greatest of nevada's values, including dedication, courage, and a spirit to persevere in the most difficult times. as a member of the senate veterans' affairs committee, i recognize that congress has a responsibility not only to honor these brave individuals who serve our nation but also to ensure they are cared for when they return home. i remain committed to upholding this promise for our veterans and servicemembers in nevada and throughout the nation. chief warrant officer 2 capps' sacrifice warrants only the greatest respect and care in return. throughout his tenure, chief warrant officer 2 capps has demonstrated unparalleled bravery and positivity. i am both humbled and honored by his service and am proud to call him a fellow nevadan. today i ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating chief warrant officer 2 capps on his much-deserved accolade and wish him well in all of his future endeavors. ____________________",2789

Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of Waldo De Castroverde, a prominent Nevadan whose legacy lives on through the work of his sons. I send my gratitude to Mr. De Castroverde's family as they continue to serve Las Vegas' Hispanic community. Mr. De Castroverde was a true patriot of Cuba, fighting to bring his country some of our Nation's most important values--freedom and democracy. In 1961, he was a paratrooper and one of 1,400 Cuban exiles who participated in the Bay of Pigs invasion in an attempt to bring greater sovereignty to Cuba, which ultimately led to his imprisonment. After being captured, Mr. De Castroverde was selected on multiple occasions to serve on a commission sent to the United States to negotiate the release of those who participated in the invasion. Two years later, Mr. De Castroverde was freed and moved to the United States with his wife. Upon arriving to the United States, Mr. De Castroverde and his wife moved to Miami where he taught history at a local high school. In 1978, he moved with his family to Reno, where he worked rigorously to shape a bright future for himself and his family of four children. He worked as a blackjack dealer during the day and he attended law school at night. Fifteen years later, he moved to Las Vegas and started his own practice in immigration and criminal law. In 2005, he was joined by his two sons, Alex and Orlando, forming the De Castroverde Law Group, which has served as an incredible resource to Las Vegas's Hispanic community. While we were saddened by the passing of this great Nevadan in 2014, he will always be remembered as an inspiring advocate of liberty and as a role model to Las Vegas's Hispanic community. I am honored to commend him and his family for their work throughout Las Vegas. Today, I join citizens across our State in celebrating the life of an extraordinary Nevadan, Waldo De Castroverde. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S6935] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING WALDO DE CASTROVERDE Mr. HELLER.

Whereas the European Union has agreed to resettle 120,000 of the refugees who have reached frontline European nations-- an important first step in implementing a comprehensive European refugee policy; Whereas the Governments of Germany and Sweden, among others, have shown great generosity towards Syrian refugees; Whereas the United States Government remains the largest contributor to the humanitarian effort in Syria; Whereas the United States Government will accept at least 10,000 Syrian refugees next year, marking a significant increase from the approximately 1,500 admitted since the conflict began; and Whereas the United States Government should continue to rigorously employ its existing robust and thorough screening process for refugees to effectively mitigate any potential security threats: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate-- (1) recognizes the scale and complexity of the Syrian refugee crisis and the need for the international community to work together to provide resources and capacity to aid refugees; (2) recognizes the generosity and humanitarian commitment of Syria's neighbors who have worked to absorb the vast majority of refugees, as well as the European nations who have made commitments to share in the refugee resettlement effort; (3) welcomes the President's decision to admit at least 10,000 Syrian refugees in 2016, and to increase the overall number of refugees received by the United States to 85,000 in 2016 and 100,000 in 2017, as an important continuation of United States humanitarian efforts; and (4) recognizes that the refugee crisis is a symptom of the broader conflict in Syria, the persecution of persons based on identity groups, including Christians, Yezidis, Turkmen, and Kurds, and instability in the Middle East and North Africa, and that efforts to resolve those challenges are a necessary component of any plan to address the refugee crisis. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S6941] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SENATE RESOLUTION 268--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE SYRIAN REFUGEE CRISIS Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Markey, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Udall, and Mr. Murphy) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations: S.

KEITH ELLISON of minnesota in the house of representatives Friday, September 18, 2015 Mr. ELLISON. Madam Speaker, today, I would like to talk about the Republican effort to defund Planned Parenthood and restrict access to health care services. Planned Parenthood is an invaluable resource for working Americans across the country. In my home state of Minnesota, Planned Parenthood operates 18 clinics, an online health center, and serves over 54,000 people every year. If funding for Planned Parenthood is eliminated--as my Republican colleagues are demanding--the consequences would be devastating. The elimination of Planned Parenthood's services would mean that millions of women and men would lose access to primary care services, contraceptive services, breast and cervical cancer screenings, and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. These families--especially those in rural and high poverty areas--would have nowhere else to go. My colleagues who support defunding Planned Parenthood say that working families could go elsewhere to receive care. This claim is false. Community Health Centers and other clinics that serve low-income Americans would not be able to provide care for all of the patients that would flood their offices should Planned Parenthood lose their federal funding. Not only would defunding Planned Parenthood create barriers to accessing care, but it would limit the ability of women to achieve economic security. A recent Guttmacher Institute study showed that access to contraception helped women complete their education, keep or get a job, and take better care of their families. For example, the children of mothers who had access to contraception have higher family incomes and college completion rates. Moreover, research also shows that access to birth control contributed in a 30 percent rise in the number of women in skilled careers between 1970 and 1990. The positive effects of widespread access to reproductive and primary care services for women, families and Americans is immeasurable. Unfortunately, the recent attacks on Planned Parenthood are nothing new. This is just another attack on working families and low-income women. In 1976, Congress passed the Hyde Amendment which restricts the use of federal funds for abortion. This policy directly harms the wellbeing and safety of low-income women, and limits their personal autonomy. It is a policy I strongly oppose. Three decades later, Republican talking points about Planned Parenthood ignore the very real impact defunding the organization will have on every day Americans-- both on a large economic scale, and on the personal health and autonomy of Americans. It is a reminder that my Republican colleagues in Congress do not trust women to make decisions that are best for them. That must change. We must trust women to do what is best for their bodies and their families. Republican tactics also ignore the consequences of shutting down the government simply to make an ideological point. Putting the wellbeing of millions working Americans on the line is unacceptable. Supporting policies that restrict women's--specifically low-income women's--personal autonomy is unacceptable. That is why I support the Planned Parenthood and the working families it serves. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1339] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD ACT OF 2015 ______ speech of HON.

A recent Guttmacher Institute study showed that access to contraception helped women complete their education, keep or get a job, and take better care of their families. For example, the children of mothers who had access to contraception have higher family incomes and college completion rates. Moreover, research also shows that access to birth control contributed in a 30 percent rise in the number of women in skilled careers between 1970 and 1990. The positive effects of widespread access to reproductive and primary care services for women, families and Americans is immeasurable. Unfortunately, the recent attacks on Planned Parenthood are nothing new. This is just another attack on working families and low-income women. In 1976, Congress passed the Hyde Amendment which restricts the use of federal funds for abortion. This policy directly harms the wellbeing and safety of low-income women, and limits their personal autonomy. It is a policy I strongly oppose. Three decades later, Republican talking points about Planned Parenthood ignore the very real impact defunding the organization will have on every day Americans-- both on a large economic scale, and on the personal health and autonomy of Americans. It is a reminder that my Republican colleagues in Congress do not trust women to make decisions that are best for them. That must change. We must trust women to do what is best for their bodies and their families. Republican tactics also ignore the consequences of shutting down the government simply to make an ideological point. Putting the wellbeing of millions working Americans on the line is unacceptable. Supporting policies that restrict women's--specifically low-income women's--personal autonomy is unacceptable. That is why I support the Planned Parenthood and the working families it serves. ____________________",package_114_55.csv,3562,3562,3636,"[congressional record volume 161, number 138 (thursday, september 24, 2015)] [extensions of remarks] [page e1339] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] defund planned parenthood act of 2015 ______ speech of hon. keith ellison of minnesota in the house of representatives friday, september 18, 2015 mr. ellison. madam speaker, today, i would like to talk about the republican effort to defund planned parenthood and restrict access to health care services. planned parenthood is an invaluable resource for working americans across the country. in my home state of minnesota, planned parenthood operates 18 clinics, an online health center, and serves over 54,000 people every year. if funding for planned parenthood is eliminated--as my republican colleagues are demanding--the consequences would be devastating. the elimination of planned parenthood's services would mean that millions of women and men would lose access to primary care services, contraceptive services, breast and cervical cancer screenings, and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases. these families--especially those in rural and high poverty areas--would have nowhere else to go. my colleagues who support defunding planned parenthood say that working families could go elsewhere to receive care. this claim is false. community health centers and other clinics that serve low-income americans would not be able to provide care for all of the patients that would flood their offices should planned parenthood lose their federal funding. not only would defunding planned parenthood create barriers to accessing care, but it would limit the ability of women to achieve economic security. a recent guttmacher institute study showed that access to contraception helped women complete their education, keep or get a job, and take better care of their families. for example, the children of mothers who had access to contraception have higher family incomes and college completion rates. moreover, research also shows that access to birth control contributed in a 30 percent rise in the number of women in skilled careers between 1970 and 1990. the positive effects of widespread access to reproductive and primary care services for women, families and americans is immeasurable. unfortunately, the recent attacks on planned parenthood are nothing new. this is just another attack on working families and low-income women. in 1976, congress passed the hyde amendment which restricts the use of federal funds for abortion. this policy directly harms the wellbeing and safety of low-income women, and limits their personal autonomy. it is a policy i strongly oppose. three decades later, republican talking points about planned parenthood ignore the very real impact defunding the organization will have on every day americans-- both on a large economic scale, and on the personal health and autonomy of americans. it is a reminder that my republican colleagues in congress do not trust women to make decisions that are best for them. that must change. we must trust women to do what is best for their bodies and their families. republican tactics also ignore the consequences of shutting down the government simply to make an ideological point. putting the wellbeing of millions working americans on the line is unacceptable. supporting policies that restrict women's--specifically low-income women's--personal autonomy is unacceptable. that is why i support the planned parenthood and the working families it serves. ____________________",3562

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an Ohio institution that has made scientific and technological strides that have had an impact on every single one of our lives. The Glenn H. Brown Liquid Crystal Institute at Kent State University in Kent, Ohio celebrates its 50th anniversary this month after decades of scientific advancement in the development of liquid crystal technology that is used in devices like flat screen TVs and mobile devices. The Kent State University Board of Trustees authorized the creation of the Liquid Crystal Institute in 1965, subsequently garnering grants from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and agencies of the U.S. defense sector. Glenn Brown, a Chemistry professor at the University since 1961, served as the Institute's director until his retirement in 1983. Under the direction of Director Dr. Hiroshi Yokoyama, the Institute continues its tradition of scientific excellence. [[Page E1340]] Innovations that grew from scientific endeavors at the Liquid Crystal Institute have fundamentally changed our modern life, like the invention of the twisted nematic cell, the heart of modern Liquid Crystal Displays. On Kent State University's campus, the Liquid Crystal and Materials Sciences building houses more than 25 individual labs and rooms for prototype development of new liquid crystal displays. There, the Institute is conducting groundbreaking research in advanced photonics, sensors, bio- and medical molecular devices, and materials for new energy applications. Recently, a team of scientists working with the Liquid Crystal Institute developed a heat-sensitive fabric to help diabetics detect harmful inflammation and infections. So this month we celebrate 50 years of innovation and research at the Liquid Crystal Institute of Kent State University and I know my colleagues join me in recognizing the importance of this great Ohio institution. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1339-E1340] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING KENT STATE UNIVERSITY'S LIQUID CRYSTAL INSTITUTE'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY ______ HON.

JEFF MILLER of florida in the house of representatives Thursday, September 24, 2015 Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it is with both profound sadness and deep gratitude that I rise to pay tribute to a fallen decorated American hero. On Friday, August 7, 2015, First Sergeant Peter Andrew McKenna Jr. of the 1st Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group, located in Florida's First Congressional District, tragically lost his life during an attack on a NATO facility in Kabul, Afghanistan. First Sergeant McKenna, now laid to rest in Rhode Island, was only 35 years old, but lived a lifetime marked by and full of service. Born to Peter and Carol McKenna of Bristol, Rhode Island, 1SG McKenna graduated from Mt. Hope High School in 1998. Upon his graduation, he followed his family's example of service, began his career as an Army infantryman, and then passed the grueling Special Forces qualifying course and earned his Green Beret in 2002. Upon completion of the Q-Course, he was assigned to the 7th Special Forces Group, now based at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, as communications sergeant. During his selfless service, 1SG McKenna participated in six combat deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan while serving our Nation with the utmost distinction throughout his 17-year career. Among his many awards and accolades are the Bronze Star with Valor, Army Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Combat Infantry Badge, Master Parachutist Badge, Master Free Fall Badge, and the Special Forces Tab. He, however, was not only a consummate leader and selfless warrior in his professional life, but his personal life as well. He was recently recognized for having traveled the furthest distance to be at the 2015 Bristol Fourth Of July Celebration. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of a humble and grateful Nation, I thank Andrew's family, for the love, counsel, guidance, and support given to him, which helped make him the hero he became. His life stands as a testament that freedom is not free, and to that end, his legacy will echo in time as an example of the ultimate sacrifice. My wife, Vicki, joins me in praying that God be with his daughter Rebecca, parents Peter and Carol, and the rest of his family and friends during this time of great mourning, and may God continue to bless the United States of America. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1340] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE SERVICE AND SELFLESS SACRIFICE OF FIRST SERGEANT PETER ANDREW McKENNA JR., UNITED STATES ARMY SPECIAL FORCES ______ HON.

Upon his graduation, he followed his family's example of service, began his career as an Army infantryman, and then passed the grueling Special Forces qualifying course and earned his Green Beret in 2002. Upon completion of the Q-Course, he was assigned to the 7th Special Forces Group, now based at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, as communications sergeant. During his selfless service, 1SG McKenna participated in six combat deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan while serving our Nation with the utmost distinction throughout his 17-year career. Among his many awards and accolades are the Bronze Star with Valor, Army Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Iraq Campaign Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Combat Infantry Badge, Master Parachutist Badge, Master Free Fall Badge, and the Special Forces Tab. He, however, was not only a consummate leader and selfless warrior in his professional life, but his personal life as well. He was recently recognized for having traveled the furthest distance to be at the 2015 Bristol Fourth Of July Celebration. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of a humble and grateful Nation, I thank Andrew's family, for the love, counsel, guidance, and support given to him, which helped make him the hero he became. His life stands as a testament that freedom is not free, and to that end, his legacy will echo in time as an example of the ultimate sacrifice. My wife, Vicki, joins me in praying that God be with his daughter Rebecca, parents Peter and Carol, and the rest of his family and friends during this time of great mourning, and may God continue to bless the United States of America. ____________________",package_114_55.csv,2846,2846,2920,"[congressional record volume 161, number 138 (thursday, september 24, 2015)] [extensions of remarks] [page e1340] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] honoring the service and selfless sacrifice of first sergeant peter andrew mckenna jr., united states army special forces ______ hon. jeff miller of florida in the house of representatives thursday, september 24, 2015 mr. miller of florida. mr. speaker, it is with both profound sadness and deep gratitude that i rise to pay tribute to a fallen decorated american hero. on friday, august 7, 2015, first sergeant peter andrew mckenna jr. of the 1st battalion, 7th special forces group, located in florida's first congressional district, tragically lost his life during an attack on a nato facility in kabul, afghanistan. first sergeant mckenna, now laid to rest in rhode island, was only 35 years old, but lived a lifetime marked by and full of service. born to peter and carol mckenna of bristol, rhode island, 1sg mckenna graduated from mt. hope high school in 1998. upon his graduation, he followed his family's example of service, began his career as an army infantryman, and then passed the grueling special forces qualifying course and earned his green beret in 2002. upon completion of the q-course, he was assigned to the 7th special forces group, now based at eglin air force base in florida, as communications sergeant. during his selfless service, 1sg mckenna participated in six combat deployments to both iraq and afghanistan while serving our nation with the utmost distinction throughout his 17-year career. among his many awards and accolades are the bronze star with valor, army commendation medal, army achievement medal, national defense service medal, iraq campaign medal, afghanistan campaign medal, global war on terrorism expeditionary medal, global war on terrorism service medal, army combat infantry badge, master parachutist badge, master free fall badge, and the special forces tab. he, however, was not only a consummate leader and selfless warrior in his professional life, but his personal life as well. he was recently recognized for having traveled the furthest distance to be at the 2015 bristol fourth of july celebration. mr. speaker, on behalf of a humble and grateful nation, i thank andrew's family, for the love, counsel, guidance, and support given to him, which helped make him the hero he became. his life stands as a testament that freedom is not free, and to that end, his legacy will echo in time as an example of the ultimate sacrifice. my wife, vicki, joins me in praying that god be with his daughter rebecca, parents peter and carol, and the rest of his family and friends during this time of great mourning, and may god continue to bless the united states of america. ____________________",2846

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Felicia Gaston, who, since founding Performing Stars of Marin 25 years ago, has endeavored to give low-income and at-risk children in the North Bay access to the arts. For two and a half decades, Ms. Gaston has worked tirelessly to help more than 1,300 young people in Marin City and San Rafael ``reach for the stars'' through performance, giving them an outlet for creativity and pushing them to develop discipline, self- reliance, and self-esteem in their early years and beyond. Born in Atlanta, Georgia, Ms. Gaston moved to California with her family as a teenager, later relocating to the Bay Area in college. She founded Performing Stars in 1990 to give local children access to opportunities she never had. As a black child in the South, Ms. Gaston encountered segregation and discrimination, which prevented her from taking classes at her local ballet school. By providing opportunities for young people to dance, perform, and express themselves through art regardless of skin color or socioeconomic background, her leadership and tenacity has helped other children avoid the struggle she faced. Performing Stars has impacted hundreds of students and thousands of family members, classmates, and friends. Participants receive access to scholarships for arts programs, opportunities for performance, group trips to local arts events, and life skills workshops. More than that, they become part of the outstanding Performing Stars community that Ms. Gaston has created. Mr. Speaker, it is fitting that we honor and thank Felicia Gaston for her many years of dedicated service in improving young lives in our community.

JACKIE SPEIER of california in the house of representatives Thursday, September 24, 2015 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in sadness to recognize the passing of one of East Palo Alto's guiding spirits. Estella Mavis Knox, known as Mavis, passed from this earth on August 11, 2015. She had a profound impact upon the community in which she lived for five decades. Mavis Knox was born on January 15, 1939 in Durant, Mississippi. From this small town of 2,500 in America's segregated south, Mavis eventually settled in East Palo Alto, California, a remarkable community in my district, also a small town, set amidst the larger San Francisco Bay Area with all of its diversity, vibrancy and social activism. Mavis raised her three children as a single mother and still found the time and energy, at the age of 31, to earn a bachelor's degree in sociology from San Jose State University. She would later complete her master's at San Jose State. Mr. Speaker and members, this single mother, through her personal example and standards, also inspired her children to attend two historically black colleges: Morehouse and Tuskegee. Nairobi College opened in East Palo Alto in 1969. Mavis was an early administrator. A [[Page E1341]] staunch, lifelong advocate of education, she was instrumental in founding this innovative and highly successful community college tailored to address the multiple academic, social and service needs of the East Palo Alto community. The college began with 120 students and grew to 200 within a few years. One year before its founding, Dr. Martin Luther King had been killed. As the war in Vietnam raged and several American cities went up in flames, Mavis Knox joined with visionary leaders to offer an alternative to fires burning within and without: the light and hope of a quality college education. Her love of education would distinguish Mavis Knox in years to come, and her community leadership was built upon this bedrock commitment. Mavis began her career with San Mateo County in 1982 and retired in 2005 after spending much of her county career in Children and Family Services as a social worker and supervisor. When she supervised the Long Term Placement unit she was the driving force in enhancing the Independent Living Skills program and the Moving On ceremony. Mavis was elected to the Ravenswood City School District Board of Trustees and served the community from that position for 12 years during the 1970s and early 1980s. This was a time of tremendous change in the district, with historic segregation and its legacy being challenged regularly. Newspaper reports of the time indicate that students and parents demanded equality of opportunity, and they demanded that the district overcome the impacts of decades of racial segregation. Mavis Knox was a vocal advocate for equality. This required hiring staff that would set high standards and be held accountable to the community. Press reports from that time indicate that such routine decisions as hiring a superintendent were sometimes contentious, but the stakes were also high. While she demanded accountability by the staff to the community, Mavis Knox also held herself accountable. She successfully advocated for better school financing, and strongly urged the community to unite in creating a first-rate system. Mr. Speaker and members, Mavis Knox was a dedicated member, committee chair, and leader in the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, earning the Bertha Pitts Campbell Award in 2011, the Chapter's highest honor for outstanding service to the sorority and community. Among other distinguished community service, she served as Foreman of the Grand Jury of San Mateo County and charter board member of the East Palo Alto Girls' Club of the Mid-Peninsula. She was a prolific fund raiser for at-risk youth. She is survived by her son Anthony D. Jones, daughter Brenda Destiny Knox, brother Ronald Knox, grandchildren, great grandchildren, nieces, nephews, cousins and friends. A leading advocate for social justice has now passed from our midst. In our sorrow, it is important to note that the lessons she taught by example will offer guidance and comfort for years to come. Ultimately, this is the greatest gift to us all of Mavis Knox, a mother, educator, community advocate, and an outstanding American. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1340-E1341] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF ESTELLA MAVIS KNOX ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker and members, Mavis Knox was a dedicated member, committee chair, and leader in the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, earning the Bertha Pitts Campbell Award in 2011, the Chapter's highest honor for outstanding service to the sorority and community. Among other distinguished community service, she served as Foreman of the Grand Jury of San Mateo County and charter board member of the East Palo Alto Girls' Club of the Mid-Peninsula. She was a prolific fund raiser for at-risk youth. She is survived by her son Anthony D. Jones, daughter Brenda Destiny Knox, brother Ronald Knox, grandchildren, great grandchildren, nieces, nephews, cousins and friends. A leading advocate for social justice has now passed from our midst. In our sorrow, it is important to note that the lessons she taught by example will offer guidance and comfort for years to come. Ultimately, this is the greatest gift to us all of Mavis Knox, a mother, educator, community advocate, and an outstanding American. ____________________",package_114_55.csv,4592,4592,4666,"[congressional record volume 161, number 138 (thursday, september 24, 2015)] [extensions of remarks] [pages e1340-e1341] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] in recognition of estella mavis knox ______ hon. jackie speier of california in the house of representatives thursday, september 24, 2015 ms. speier. mr. speaker, i rise today in sadness to recognize the passing of one of east palo alto's guiding spirits. estella mavis knox, known as mavis, passed from this earth on august 11, 2015. she had a profound impact upon the community in which she lived for five decades. mavis knox was born on january 15, 1939 in durant, mississippi. from this small town of 2,500 in america's segregated south, mavis eventually settled in east palo alto, california, a remarkable community in my district, also a small town, set amidst the larger san francisco bay area with all of its diversity, vibrancy and social activism. mavis raised her three children as a single mother and still found the time and energy, at the age of 31, to earn a bachelor's degree in sociology from san jose state university. she would later complete her master's at san jose state. mr. speaker and members, this single mother, through her personal example and standards, also inspired her children to attend two historically black colleges: morehouse and tuskegee. nairobi college opened in east palo alto in 1969. mavis was an early administrator. a [[page e1341]] staunch, lifelong advocate of education, she was instrumental in founding this innovative and highly successful community college tailored to address the multiple academic, social and service needs of the east palo alto community. the college began with 120 students and grew to 200 within a few years. one year before its founding, dr. martin luther king had been killed. as the war in vietnam raged and several american cities went up in flames, mavis knox joined with visionary leaders to offer an alternative to fires burning within and without: the light and hope of a quality college education. her love of education would distinguish mavis knox in years to come, and her community leadership was built upon this bedrock commitment. mavis began her career with san mateo county in 1982 and retired in 2005 after spending much of her county career in children and family services as a social worker and supervisor. when she supervised the long term placement unit she was the driving force in enhancing the independent living skills program and the moving on ceremony. mavis was elected to the ravenswood city school district board of trustees and served the community from that position for 12 years during the 1970s and early 1980s. this was a time of tremendous change in the district, with historic segregation and its legacy being challenged regularly. newspaper reports of the time indicate that students and parents demanded equality of opportunity, and they demanded that the district overcome the impacts of decades of racial segregation. mavis knox was a vocal advocate for equality. this required hiring staff that would set high standards and be held accountable to the community. press reports from that time indicate that such routine decisions as hiring a superintendent were sometimes contentious, but the stakes were also high. while she demanded accountability by the staff to the community, mavis knox also held herself accountable. she successfully advocated for better school financing, and strongly urged the community to unite in creating a first-rate system. mr. speaker and members, mavis knox was a dedicated member, committee chair, and leader in the delta sigma theta sorority, earning the bertha pitts campbell award in 2011, the chapter's highest honor for outstanding service to the sorority and community. among other distinguished community service, she served as foreman of the grand jury of san mateo county and charter board member of the east palo alto girls' club of the mid-peninsula. she was a prolific fund raiser for at-risk youth. she is survived by her son anthony d. jones, daughter brenda destiny knox, brother ronald knox, grandchildren, great grandchildren, nieces, nephews, cousins and friends. a leading advocate for social justice has now passed from our midst. in our sorrow, it is important to note that the lessons she taught by example will offer guidance and comfort for years to come. ultimately, this is the greatest gift to us all of mavis knox, a mother, educator, community advocate, and an outstanding american. ____________________",4592

SAM FARR of california in the house of representatives Thursday, September 24, 2015 Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of myself and my California colleagues, Rep. Anna Eshoo, Rep. Janice Hahn, Rep. Jared Huffman, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, Rep. Mike Thompson and Rep. Juan Vargas, to welcome His Holiness Pope Francis to Washington and to celebrate his actions yesterday in canonizing Father Junipero Serra. Yesterday we were all witness to a sacred ceremony validating the holiness of Father Serra as a leader of the Catholic faith in early California. But Father Serra is also a major historical figure in California's settlement and expansion. As important as his contribution to the faith is, his effort to unify and connect north and south California laid the groundwork for the state it came to be. As most people know, Father Serra is responsible for establishing the first 9 of what would eventually be 21 missions up and down the coast of California all the way from San Diego in the south to north of San Francisco. In today's world, those 21 missions are tantamount to social media. They represented a network of community and connectedness that brought order to a wilderness and established common links between myriad towns and villages. Those missions were so important to the framework of community, commerce and government that eventually coalesced into a state, that every school child in California must construct a mission diorama in the 4th grade as part of his/her history lesson. The majority of those missions still stand today and are still vibrant centers of faith and community. They also serve as strong tourist attractions and bring to life the story of California's early settlers to millions of visitors every year. So pivotal was Father Serra to the rise and prosperity of California that the state elected to have his statue exhibited here in Statuary Hall of the U.S. Capitol. Father Serra's presence is especially felt strongly in Carmel, California where he established his headquarters and actively administered the expansion of the Catholic faith in California. From here he also helped manage relations between local peoples and Spanish government officials in Mexico as well as with the local military officers who commanded the nearby presidio in Monterey. Father Serra is buried at the mission in Carmel and neighbors of the mission, city residents and all who visit the mission venerate his beneficence to the people and the state. During Pope Francis' visit to Washington this week my California colleagues and I were happy to welcome a good number of Californians to the city to celebrate the Pope's visit and Father Serra's canonization. In particular I was proud to have nearly 100 constituents from the Carmel area come to town to honor our ``home-town saint.'' Among the distinguished visitors was Bishop Richard Garcia, Bishop of the Diocese of Monterey and his predecessor, Bishop Sylvester Ryan. I was pleased that they could be with us as for this momentous occasion. Mr. Speaker, I believe the House was moved this week by the Pope's visit and his actions regarding Father Serra. I am sure the House joins me in thanking the Pope for his leadership, his holy presence and his blessing of Father Junipero Serra. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1341] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF SAINT JUNIPERO SERRA ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember and honor the life of William C. ``Bill'' Luoma, a native of Warren, Ohio, who passed away on the 17th of August, 2015 at his daughter's home, surrounded by his loving family. Born in Warren, Ohio on April 11, 1939, to Wilmar and Maxine Luoma Bill lived a full life of service in the United States military and as a Union leader in the steel industry. After living in Tucson, Arizona as a child, Bill enlisted in the U.S. Air Force at the age of 18 and attended Amarillo AFB Jet Engine School in Amarillo, Texas. Bill also served two years with the United States Marine Corps before starting a 30 year career with Republic Steel Corporation. Bill exemplified the life of a workman's ally by serving as a Worker's Compensation representative and later in retirement as President of the Steelworkers Organization of Active Retirees, Chapter 1-28-5. A [[Page E1343]] leader in the Union community, he helped organize rallies in Washington, DC fighting for workers' rights, Medicare, and Social Security, and in 2004 spoke on senior health issues at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston, Massachusetts. Bill is remembered by his loving family as a passionate story and joke teller with interests in bowling, painting, drawing, antiques, and furniture refinishing. His excellent memory for Geography and History was accompanied by a love and passion for his Finnish background. As a member of the Catholic Church, Bill attended the services of Father Gusper at St. Stephens Church in Niles, Ohio. Bill was preceded in death by his parents, as well as his sister, Judy Dennison, son, Timothy Luoma, and grandson, Isaiah Luoma.

ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Thursday, September 24, 2015 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute the long and distinguished career of Marjorie Ann Browne, a native Washingtonian and servant of Congress in the area of foreign affairs. On October 10, 2015, Ms. Browne will retire after a remarkable 55 years of faithful service to the legislative branch as an international relations specialist in the Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division of the Congressional Research Service (CRS). Marjorie Browne graduated from the University of Rochester in 1960 with a B.A. in history. After working for a few summers as a typist at the State Department, Marjorie joined the Library of Congress on October 10, 1960, in the office of the deputy director of the Legislative Reference Service (LRS), as CRS was known prior to 1970. In 1962, she was promoted to a reference assistant and moved to the Foreign Affairs Division of LRS. After working closely with analysts who specialized in international organizations and international law, Marjorie was converted to an analyst in 1971. She became increasingly involved in multiple issues related to the United Nations. Ms. Browne has served as a specialist on the United Nations and international organizations for Congress, producing numerous reports, committee prints, and individualized responses to congressional inquiries for several decades. Over the years, she has mentored scores of colleagues and has always sought to assist others in their work. Highlights of Marjorie Browne's long career include her attendance intermittently from 1973 to 1982 at meetings of the U.N. Conference on the Law of the Sea in New York and her attendance in the 1980s at the National War College in Ft. McNair, D.C. More recently, during a congressional visit to the United Nations, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon recognized her service during his remarks to the visiting delegation. For a long stretch of her career at CRS, Ms. Browne worked actively in the Congressional Research Employees Association (CREA), including during the time period when CRS staff moved from the Jefferson Building to the then-new Madison Building in 1980, and on CREA's health and safety committee. In 2010, the Library of Congress honored Marjorie for 50 years of service. Marjorie Browne leaves behind multiple legacies: distinguished public service over half a century, an indefatigable commitment to fulfilling the mission of CRS and the work of Congress, and an extraordinary career that has served as a role model for many. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives to join me in expressing our deepest gratitude and appreciation to Marjorie Ann Browne on the occasion of her retirement for 55 years of service to Congress and our nation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1343] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO MARJORIE ANN BROWNE ______ HON.

Over the past 46 years, Ebenezer Ministries has gained a membership of over 1,000 members. Leading the Ministries today is the Bishop Urundi B. Knox. Pastor Knox became pastor on the third Sunday of September, 1994. Since Pastor Knox has been serving Ebenezer, the church has gained over 200 members. In 1999, the congregation agreed to change the name from Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church to Ebenezer Ministries. After taking on the new name, fresh outreach programs were implemented. These programs included the Elderly Ministries, Abused & Battered Women Ministry, Prison Ministry, Street Ministry, and the largest, the Take Back the City Crusade. Other programs included the CK Travelers for senior citizens, Save Our Sons mentoring program, Daughters of Destiny mentoring program, a Motorcycle Ministry, a health Ministry, a Marriage Ministry, a Junior Deacon Board, and an outdoor concert series, ``Gospel Under the Sun''. Under Pastor Knox, many leaders of the church have been cultivated. Thirty members received their calling in to the ministry, 21 deacons have been ordained, and seven licensed ministers have joined Ebenezer. Pastor Knox was one of the First African American Ministers in Flint to value women in a traditionally male dominated field, licensing 23 female ministers.

JOHN KATKO of new york in the house of representatives Thursday, September 24, 2015 Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 50th anniversary of the Samuel Irving Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York. The creation of the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications began in 1964 with the support of Samuel Irving Newhouse, who had a vision to build a communications school where ``the best and the brightest'' would come to study. The S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications is widely regarded as one of the nation's leading school of communications. The Newhouse School has gained this reputation over the past fifty years due to its wide embrace of virtually every known form of information dissemination--including print and broadcast journalism, social media and online communication, advertising and public relations, as well as photography and film. The roots of the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications are founded in Syracuse University's former School of Journalism. In 1934 the School of Journalism was founded at Syracuse University and has developed into a nationally renowned educational institution. In 1964 the first of three buildings, ``Newhouse 1,'' was opened and dedicated by President Lyndon B. Johnson. In 1971 the School of Journalism merged with the Department of Television and Radio and was re-named the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. I am proud to recognize the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University and congratulate the School on the achievement of its 50th anniversary. I am confident that the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University will continue to grow and educate talented, rising professionals in public communications and it is my honor to congratulate the Newhouse School on behalf of the entire Central New York Community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1342] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SAMUEL IRVING NEWHOUSE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS AT SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY ______ HON.

JOHN KATKO of new york in the house of representatives Thursday, September 24, 2015 Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 50th anniversary of the Samuel Irving Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York. The creation of the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications began in 1964 with the support of Samuel Irving Newhouse, who had a vision to build a communications school where ``the best and the brightest'' would come to study. The S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications is widely regarded as one of the nation's leading school of communications. The Newhouse School has gained this reputation over the past fifty years due to its wide embrace of virtually every known form of information dissemination--including print and broadcast journalism, social media and online communication, advertising and public relations, as well as photography and film. The roots of the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications are founded in Syracuse University's former School of Journalism. In 1934 the School of Journalism was founded at Syracuse University and has developed into a nationally renowned educational institution. In 1964 the first of three buildings, ``Newhouse 1,'' was opened and dedicated by President Lyndon B. Johnson. In 1971 the School of Journalism merged with the Department of Television and Radio and was re-named the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. I am proud to recognize the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University and congratulate the School on the achievement of its 50th anniversary. I am confident that the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University will continue to grow and educate talented, rising professionals in public communications and it is my honor to congratulate the Newhouse School on behalf of the entire Central New York Community. ____________________",package_114_55.csv,2273,2273,2347,"[congressional record volume 161, number 138 (thursday, september 24, 2015)] [extensions of remarks] [page e1342] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] recognizing the 50th anniversary of the samuel irving newhouse school of public communications at syracuse university ______ hon. john katko of new york in the house of representatives thursday, september 24, 2015 mr. katko. mr. speaker, i rise today to recognize the 50th anniversary of the samuel irving newhouse school of public communications at syracuse university in syracuse, new york. the creation of the s.i. newhouse school of public communications began in 1964 with the support of samuel irving newhouse, who had a vision to build a communications school where ``the best and the brightest'' would come to study. the s.i. newhouse school of public communications is widely regarded as one of the nation's leading school of communications. the newhouse school has gained this reputation over the past fifty years due to its wide embrace of virtually every known form of information dissemination--including print and broadcast journalism, social media and online communication, advertising and public relations, as well as photography and film. the roots of the s.i. newhouse school of public communications are founded in syracuse university's former school of journalism. in 1934 the school of journalism was founded at syracuse university and has developed into a nationally renowned educational institution. in 1964 the first of three buildings, ``newhouse 1,'' was opened and dedicated by president lyndon b. johnson. in 1971 the school of journalism merged with the department of television and radio and was re-named the s.i. newhouse school of public communications. i am proud to recognize the s.i. newhouse school of public communications at syracuse university and congratulate the school on the achievement of its 50th anniversary. i am confident that the s.i. newhouse school of public communications at syracuse university will continue to grow and educate talented, rising professionals in public communications and it is my honor to congratulate the newhouse school on behalf of the entire central new york community. ____________________",2273
CREC-2015-09-24-pt1-PgE1343-4,CREC-2015-09-24,114,IN RECOGNITION OF THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PACIFICA FOG FEST,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1343-E1344] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PACIFICA FOG FEST ______ HON. JACKIE SPEIER of california in the house of representatives Thursday, September 24, 2015 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the 30th anniversary of a California coastal tradition that now entertains 60,000 people over a weekend in September. The Pacifica Fog Fest is a community celebration filled with sun, fun, food, contests and music. In three decades it has grown from six community groups working booths to 49 community organizations working in food and beverage booths and behind the scenes to produce Fog Fest. Fog Fest perfectly reflects the personality of Pacificans: a sense of humor with a healthy dose of whimsy, the appreciation of the outdoors, the joy of life, and the commitment to give back. Locals know that fog in September is almost an oxymoron, but you don't have to go very far to hear the stereotypical ``It's always foggy in Pacifica!'' In fact, that is how the festival was christened. In 1986, a city council-appointed citizens committee was charged with creating a plan to increase commercial development in Pacifica. A subcommittee came up with the idea to attract tourists with a unique festival. Every time subcommittee member Jean Headley wore her ``I Love Pacifica'' pin in San Francisco, people would snidely say [[Page E1344]] ``Why do you love Pacifica? It's always so foggy!'' It was time to dispel this myth, poke fun at Pacifica's weather and hold the festival on a weekend that was almost guaranteed to be sunny and hot. A new committee consisting of representatives from the city council, the Pacifica Tribune, the Chamber of Commerce, city staff and volunteers developed the idea further and eventually took its recommendation to the full city council. Not without controversy, the council voted 3-2 to create the Pacifica Coast Fog Fest on the last full weekend in September. The City of Pacifica, with the help of a professional festival planner, produced the first Fog Fest. The only fog to be found was fog made by a rented fog machine. Some 30,000 visitors walked Palmetto Avenue, watched the Discover Pacifica parade, shopped at 100 arts and craft booths, listened to live music, sampled clam chowder, jambalaya and Fog Dogs, and sipped wine, beer and Fog Cutters. They also participated in a surfcasting contest, a Family Fun Fest, a God and Goddess of the Fog contest, a 7K beach run, a fog photo contest, an ocean kayak race and the Councours D'Pacifica. Thanks to the creativity and hard work of the original steering committee the first Fog Fest was a success and a new tradition was born. The city continued to produce Fog Fest until 1993 when it authorized a newly founded non-profit to take over. Pacifica Festivals Inc. (PFI) produced the event for the next seven years and kept many of the existing traditions such as the Discover Pacifica Parade, the Friday night Fandango at the Sanchez Adobe, Family Fun Fest, Classic Car show, the Fog Jog on Sunday morning and the beautiful Pacifica Historical Society photo display. KRQR Radio began broadcasting from the event bringing it to the entire Bay Area. In 1992, the Human Fog Horn contest had its debut. And of course the food and arts and craft booths continued to offer local delicacies and treasures. In 2000, the Fog Fest Organizing Group (FFOG), a group of community minded residents, took on the leadership of the festival. Through tireless fundraising efforts the board members have spurred remarkable growth of sponsorships of Fog Fest. Today it features over 200 arts and crafts booths, three stages with live music, the Discover Pacifica parade and marching band competition on Saturday morning, the Family Fun Fest, the Great Sand Sculpture, Surf Art Experience, Fog Jog and Stride and many contests and games for every age. In addition to offering family entertainment, Fog Fest has a conscience and is socially responsible. FFOG instituted a ``Go Green Campaign'' and in partnership with Recology of the Coast recycles anything that's recyclable. It created a ``Gift to Pacifica Fund'' in 2001 and has given a special gift to the community every year since then. For example, it purchased the original painting featured on the 2004 Fog Fest poster and today it hangs in the Community Center. It donated a bench that sits in the Rotary plaza at the Center for the Performing Arts. For the last 30 years, almost $900,000 in proceeds from Fog Fest were given back to the community. While Pacifica's signature event keeps growing and evolving with the times, some things haven't changed: Fog Fest is a celebration of sun, sand, surf and the mythical mist. Fog Cutters will always be the cocktail of choice. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives to rise with me to honor the 30th anniversary of the Pacifica Coast Fog Fest that lasts only one sunny weekend in September, but benefits the community all year around. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1343-E1344] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PACIFICA FOG FEST ______ HON.

Having lived through the Great [[Page E1345]] Depression and World War II, Marie was taught how to take care of and make do with what you have and to share with others, whether it be feast or famine. Marie has applied that life lesson throughout her entire life. Whereas, whenever Marie has come across anyone in trouble, she has not turned her back but done what she could. She has fed countless children over the years and offered safe shelter to those who needed it. She has humbly and quietly opened her home and heart to strangers. Whereas, as a skilled baker, Marie's locally renowned home baked pies have generated thousands of dollars for local charity in Glenn and Colusa counties. Marie's most famous pie sold at auction for $4,000. The Buyer then sold the slices and collected an additional $1,000 for a grand total of $5,000 that a local family desperately needed for medical bills. When Marie discovered that the Buyer did not keep a piece of pie for himself, she baked him another. Whereas, Marie, at 94 years old, is truly an amazing woman and has yet to decline a baking request for a worthy cause. Resolved, that I Congressman John Garamendi of California's Third Congressional District, do hereby recognize and celebrate the accomplishments of Marie Spooner. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1344-E1345] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING MARIE SPOONER ______ HON.

ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Thursday, September 24, 2015 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me in congratulating PYXERA Global, headquartered in Washington, D.C., on its 25th anniversary, and for its work to improve lives and build capacity of individuals and institutions around the world. On January 1, 1990, President George H.W. Bush announced the formation of the Citizens Democracy Corps (CDC), created by executive order after the fall of the Berlin Wall. A New Vision for Global Engagement was launched. Americans wanted to help in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to strengthen the foundations of free society. CDC sent American business professionals who volunteered their expertise to support the transition to a market economy and promote international understanding. The Corporate Assistance Program established an innovative approach wherein United States corporations provided free technical and business assistance to enterprises and institutions. These programs had a lasting and positive impact in Eastern Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union. In 1991, the Citizens Volunteer Program was launched. This program sent advisors to work with local municipal governments, nonprofits, and institutions of higher education. In 1995, CDC launched its first Local Content Development program in Russia, in which small and medium enterprises gained the capabilities to supply the rapidly expanding oil and gas industry, creating new jobs and mutually profitable, sustainable enterprises. The Enterprise and Economic Development Program was created, operating out of key cities to support local business development. In 2000, the MBA Enterprise Corps joined the organization, and in 2002 the name changed to Citizens Development Corps, and later, CDC Development Solutions (CDS) with the inclusion of MBAs Without Borders. A landmark pro bono program for corporate employees was pioneered by IBM with CDS in 2008 with teams in Romania, Ghana, and Tanzania. The IBM Corporate Service Corps became a new model of global leadership development and corporate social responsibility. Following the publication of the Harvard Case Study, IBM: The Corporate Service Corps, CDS hosted the First International Corporate Volunteerism Conference, and IBM, USAID, and CDC Development Solutions formed the Center for Excellence in International Corporate Volunteerism. Today, more than 30 major companies send employees into underserved communities to build capability and capacity through skills-based volunteerism. In 2012, the U.S. Center for Citizen Diplomacy (USCCD) became part of CDS, and with their expanded mission, the organization adopted a new name in 2013, PYXERA Global. Today, PYXERA Global takes pride in the solutions that have inspired, enriched, and endured for a quarter century in more than 90 countries. They continue to facilitate groundbreaking partnerships between the public, private, and social sectors in dozens of countries, reinventing international development through purposeful global engagement to address the world's most pressing challenges. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives to join me in celebrating the 25th anniversary of PYXERA Global and its work enriching lives and livelihoods inclusively and sustainably. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1345] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PYXERA GLOBAL'S 25TH ANNIVERSARY ______ HON.

STENY H. HOYER of maryland in the house of representatives Thursday, September 24, 2015 Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, on September 26, 2015, people throughout Maryland and the Fifth District will celebrate the 125th anniversary of the founding of the Naval Support Facility Indian Head and the unique role it has played in strengthening our national security and growing the local community. The facility traces its beginnings to Assistant Naval Constructor Robert Brooke Dashiell, a graduate of the Naval Academy in Annapolis who was dispatched by the Bureau of Ordnance to build a testing ground to support America's growing naval power at the turn of the century. Opened in 1890 as the Naval Proving Ground, NSF Indian Head was the Navy's first installation in Southern Maryland, beginning a long tradition in the region. Throughout its history, NSF Indian Head has been the site of development and testing for some of the most important weapons in the Navy's arsenal. Some of the world's most powerful rockets were created there, along with technologies used in pilots' ejection seats and life-saving armor. Today, NSF Indian Head is home to several Navy tenants, including the Indian Head Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center; the Marine Corps Chemical, Biological Incident Response Force; the Joint Interoperability Test Center; and the Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division. The work these tenants carry out at NSF Indian Head is critical to helping our seamen and Marines conduct their missions around the world and to ensuring their safety as they do so. I've been proud to visit NSF Indian Head many times over the more than two decades I have represented the installation and meet with those who serve there--as well as to support robust funding in Congress for the Navy to continue doing great work at NSF Indian Head. For 125 years, residents of the Town of Indian Head and of Charles County have been extraordinary in their support for the men and women stationed at NSF Indian Head. Since the early part of the twentieth century, the town has grown up around the base, and communities across Charles County have benefitted from the economic activity that NSF Indian Head generates by employing some of our nation's top energetic scientists and engineers. NSF Indian Head continues to be important not only to our national security but as one of the largest employers in Charles County and Southern Maryland. I join in congratulating the men and women of NSF Indian Head on the facility's 125th anniversary and look forward to continuing to work with the Indian Head community to make sure the base has every resource it needs to carry out its work, which is so critical to our national defense. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1345] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING THE 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF NAVAL SUPPORT FACILITY INDIAN HEAD ______ HON.

STENY H. HOYER of maryland in the house of representatives Thursday, September 24, 2015 Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, on September 26, 2015, people throughout Maryland and the Fifth District will celebrate the 125th anniversary of the founding of the Naval Support Facility Indian Head and the unique role it has played in strengthening our national security and growing the local community. The facility traces its beginnings to Assistant Naval Constructor Robert Brooke Dashiell, a graduate of the Naval Academy in Annapolis who was dispatched by the Bureau of Ordnance to build a testing ground to support America's growing naval power at the turn of the century. Opened in 1890 as the Naval Proving Ground, NSF Indian Head was the Navy's first installation in Southern Maryland, beginning a long tradition in the region. Throughout its history, NSF Indian Head has been the site of development and testing for some of the most important weapons in the Navy's arsenal. Some of the world's most powerful rockets were created there, along with technologies used in pilots' ejection seats and life-saving armor. Today, NSF Indian Head is home to several Navy tenants, including the Indian Head Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center; the Marine Corps Chemical, Biological Incident Response Force; the Joint Interoperability Test Center; and the Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division. The work these tenants carry out at NSF Indian Head is critical to helping our seamen and Marines conduct their missions around the world and to ensuring their safety as they do so. I've been proud to visit NSF Indian Head many times over the more than two decades I have represented the installation and meet with those who serve there--as well as to support robust funding in Congress for the Navy to continue doing great work at NSF Indian Head. For 125 years, residents of the Town of Indian Head and of Charles County have been extraordinary in their support for the men and women stationed at NSF Indian Head. Since the early part of the twentieth century, the town has grown up around the base, and communities across Charles County have benefitted from the economic activity that NSF Indian Head generates by employing some of our nation's top energetic scientists and engineers. NSF Indian Head continues to be important not only to our national security but as one of the largest employers in Charles County and Southern Maryland. I join in congratulating the men and women of NSF Indian Head on the facility's 125th anniversary and look forward to continuing to work with the Indian Head community to make sure the base has every resource it needs to carry out its work, which is so critical to our national defense. ____________________",package_114_55.csv,3040,3040,3114,"[congressional record volume 161, number 138 (thursday, september 24, 2015)] [extensions of remarks] [page e1345] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] celebrating the 125th anniversary of naval support facility indian head ______ hon. steny h. hoyer of maryland in the house of representatives thursday, september 24, 2015 mr. hoyer. mr. speaker, on september 26, 2015, people throughout maryland and the fifth district will celebrate the 125th anniversary of the founding of the naval support facility indian head and the unique role it has played in strengthening our national security and growing the local community. the facility traces its beginnings to assistant naval constructor robert brooke dashiell, a graduate of the naval academy in annapolis who was dispatched by the bureau of ordnance to build a testing ground to support america's growing naval power at the turn of the century. opened in 1890 as the naval proving ground, nsf indian head was the navy's first installation in southern maryland, beginning a long tradition in the region. throughout its history, nsf indian head has been the site of development and testing for some of the most important weapons in the navy's arsenal. some of the world's most powerful rockets were created there, along with technologies used in pilots' ejection seats and life-saving armor. today, nsf indian head is home to several navy tenants, including the indian head division of the naval surface warfare center; the marine corps chemical, biological incident response force; the joint interoperability test center; and the naval explosive ordnance disposal technology division. the work these tenants carry out at nsf indian head is critical to helping our seamen and marines conduct their missions around the world and to ensuring their safety as they do so. i've been proud to visit nsf indian head many times over the more than two decades i have represented the installation and meet with those who serve there--as well as to support robust funding in congress for the navy to continue doing great work at nsf indian head. for 125 years, residents of the town of indian head and of charles county have been extraordinary in their support for the men and women stationed at nsf indian head. since the early part of the twentieth century, the town has grown up around the base, and communities across charles county have benefitted from the economic activity that nsf indian head generates by employing some of our nation's top energetic scientists and engineers. nsf indian head continues to be important not only to our national security but as one of the largest employers in charles county and southern maryland. i join in congratulating the men and women of nsf indian head on the facility's 125th anniversary and look forward to continuing to work with the indian head community to make sure the base has every resource it needs to carry out its work, which is so critical to our national defense. ____________________",3040

ZIMMERMAN ______ HON. STENY H. HOYER of maryland in the house of representatives Thursday, September 24, 2015 Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the career of U.S. Capitol Police Detective William J. Zimmerman, who is retiring in October after thirty-two years with the force. Since 1987, Det. Zimmerman has served with the Threat Assessment Section, the division responsible for investigating threats made against Members of Congress, their families, or others who receive special protection under the law. Det. Zimmerman currently serves as the Senior Investigator, playing a lead role in identifying threats and keeping Members of Congress safe as they serve this nation. When an individual or group contacts a Member's office in a suspicious way, it is up to Threat Assessment Section investigators like Det. Zimmerman to assess whether a danger is present. As a longtime veteran of the process, Det. Zimmerman has helped establish threat assessment and management programs for other law enforcement services across the United States and in the United Kingdom as well. He has conducted training for House and Senate staff on security awareness and spoken at conferences around the country to share best practices. Det. Zimmerman served as the first President of the Washington D.C. chapter of the Association of Threat Assessment Professionals and holds that position today. In 2004, he became the inaugural recipient of the Association's distinguished Meritorious Service Award for his work and leadership in the field. The U.S. Capitol Police play an extraordinarily important and often- overlooked role in the functioning of our nation's democracy. Without the safe and secure space they provide, lawmakers would be unable to conduct the American people's work and carry out our functions under the Constitution. All of us who serve in Congress hold the U.S. Capitol Police and its personnel in high esteem, and we are grateful for those who put on its uniform every day. I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking Det. William J. Zimmerman for his more-than three decades of service to the U.S. Capitol Police, to the Congress of the United States, and to our nation. I wish him all the best in his retirement. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1344] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING THE CAREER OF U.S. CAPITOL POLICE DETECTIVE WILLIAM J.

A retirement celebration in honor of President Reeves was held on Wednesday, September 23, 2015 at 6:00 p.m. at the John M. Pope Industrial Technology Center on the campus in Americus, Georgia. [[Page E1346]] A native of Thomaston, Georgia, Mr. Reeves worked in the sales industry prior to his career at South Georgia Technical College. He arrived at the College in 1973 and worked in multiple capacities as an instructor, supervisor, and Vice President of Economic Development. While serving as an instructor, he taught accounting, business, and business psychology. His loyalty and performance spoke volumes, resulting in Mr. Reeves' ultimately being appointed to serve as President of South Georgia Technical College in 2004. Under his leadership, the college has expanded to offer more than 150 associate degrees and increased enrollment exponentially, reaching the high mark of 4,000 students by 2011. His ambitions extended beyond improving the academic credentials of the school.

He also oversaw the planting of more than 500 stately live oak trees in order to beautify the campus. Combining his educational background with his acute business savvy, President Reeves has cultivated business partnerships with industrial titans, including Georgia Power, John Deere, and Kauffman Tire. All this was done with an eye toward providing students with prime opportunities to delve into the corporate world. He has also played a vital role in arranging scholarships for students by partnering with other colleges such as Georgia Southwestern State University in Americus, Georgia to form a scholarship foundation. President Reeves has been recognized and commended time and time again for his service to his community. He was named as ``Boy Scout Distinguished Leader of the Year'' and ``Americus and Sumter County Volunteer of the Year,'' among many other accolades. In addition, President Reeves will be the first sitting technical college president to be granted the distinction of ``President Emeritus.'' Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing an esteemed educator and principled leader, President Gary Lamar ``Sparky'' Reeves.

CREC-2015-09-24-pt1-PgE1346,CREC-2015-09-24,114,COMMEMORATING NATIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION DAY,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1346] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMEMORATING NATIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION DAY ______ HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Thursday, September 24, 2015 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate National Voter Registration Day, which, since 2012, has been observed annually on September 22 and is intended to increase awareness of voter registration opportunities, promote civic engagement, and celebrate democracy. National Voter Registration Day, which started in 2012 was designed to create an annual moment when the entire nation focuses on registering Americans to exercise their most basic right--the right to vote. In his address to the nation before signing the Voting Rights Act of 1965, President Lyndon Baines Johnson said: Presidents and Congresses, laws and lawsuits can open the doors to the polling places and open the doors to the wondrous rewards which await the wise use of the ballot. But only the individual . . ., and others who have been denied the right to vote, can really walk through those doors, and can use that right, and can transform the vote into an instrument of justice and fulfillment. In other words, political empowerment-- and the justice, opportunity, inclusion, and fulfillment it provides--comes not from the right to vote but in the exercise of that right. And that means it is the civic obligation of every citizen to vote in every election, state and local as well as federal. But before one can exercise the right to vote, he or she must first register. Mr. Speaker, everyday approximately 12,000 Americans turn 18 and by 2016, more than 8 million young people will be eligible to vote. This cohort, better known as the Millennial Generation, comprises approximately one-third of the voting age population. The 93 million member Millennial Generation is the largest in the history of the United States, surpassing the post-World War II Baby Boomers. The Millennial Generation also is the most diverse because nearly half of all Millennials (43%) come from communities of color. Mr. Speaker, next year, in 2016, and for the first time ever, persons of color and young people have the potential of comprising more than half of the electorate, which means that we could have the most diverse national electorate in history. Young people are the future of the nation so it is only right that they become more active and engaged in the process of electing the leaders who will make the decisions that shape the nation's future. And that means taking the first step of registering to vote. And that is why we observe National Voter Registration Day; to increase awareness among all Americans, but especially young people, of the importance and mechanics of registering to vote. In every Presidential election since the 1964, the voter turnout rate for persons aged 18-29 has lagged behind all other age groups. For example, in 2012 almost half (42%) of such persons were not registered to vote and 2014, a whopping 51% were unregistered. And only 23% of eligible voters 18-29 actually voted in 2014. Although these registration and turnout rates are low, we should not assume that the millennial generation is apathetic or disinterested in the public affairs of the nation. It is significant that in 2014, 87 percent of Millennials made a local, national, or global difference by donating money or volunteering time with a charitable or social change organization. But Millennials are facing challenges unknown to the Baby Boomers; they are the first generation in modern history to face higher levels of unemployment and lower levels of wealth and personal income at the same stage of their lives. Yet, this generation has also observed that positive change can result from sound public policy and that it makes a difference which officials are elected to make those policy decisions. For example, economic policy decisions made during the past six years has led to a reduction in unemployment rates from a high of 9.8% in 2009 to a low of 5.1%, and the creation of more than 8.3 million private sector jobs. Additionally, during the last six years we have witnessed policies and actions promoting and enhancing equality, diversity, tolerance, and inclusion advocated, championed, and implemented by persons elected by voters. But it must be remembered that progress and positive change happens by choice, not by chance. In a democratic form of government, participation is rewarded in the form of responsiveness from elected representatives; conversely, the interests of non-participators sadly are all too often neglected or ignored. And it is important that we observe National Voter Registration Day so that everyone is educated and empowered with the tools to make their preferences known, their interests considered, and their voices count. As President Johnson said: The vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which imprison men because they are different from other men.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Thursday, September 24, 2015 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate National Voter Registration Day, which, since 2012, has been observed annually on September 22 and is intended to increase awareness of voter registration opportunities, promote civic engagement, and celebrate democracy. National Voter Registration Day, which started in 2012 was designed to create an annual moment when the entire nation focuses on registering Americans to exercise their most basic right--the right to vote. In his address to the nation before signing the Voting Rights Act of 1965, President Lyndon Baines Johnson said: Presidents and Congresses, laws and lawsuits can open the doors to the polling places and open the doors to the wondrous rewards which await the wise use of the ballot. But only the individual . . ., and others who have been denied the right to vote, can really walk through those doors, and can use that right, and can transform the vote into an instrument of justice and fulfillment. In other words, political empowerment-- and the justice, opportunity, inclusion, and fulfillment it provides--comes not from the right to vote but in the exercise of that right. And that means it is the civic obligation of every citizen to vote in every election, state and local as well as federal. But before one can exercise the right to vote, he or she must first register. Mr. Speaker, everyday approximately 12,000 Americans turn 18 and by 2016, more than 8 million young people will be eligible to vote. This cohort, better known as the Millennial Generation, comprises approximately one-third of the voting age population. The 93 million member Millennial Generation is the largest in the history of the United States, surpassing the post-World War II Baby Boomers. The Millennial Generation also is the most diverse because nearly half of all Millennials (43%) come from communities of color. Mr. Speaker, next year, in 2016, and for the first time ever, persons of color and young people have the potential of comprising more than half of the electorate, which means that we could have the most diverse national electorate in history. Young people are the future of the nation so it is only right that they become more active and engaged in the process of electing the leaders who will make the decisions that shape the nation's future. And that means taking the first step of registering to vote. And that is why we observe National Voter Registration Day; to increase awareness among all Americans, but especially young people, of the importance and mechanics of registering to vote. In every Presidential election since the 1964, the voter turnout rate for persons aged 18-29 has lagged behind all other age groups. For example, in 2012 almost half (42%) of such persons were not registered to vote and 2014, a whopping 51% were unregistered. And only 23% of eligible voters 18-29 actually voted in 2014. Although these registration and turnout rates are low, we should not assume that the millennial generation is apathetic or disinterested in the public affairs of the nation. It is significant that in 2014, 87 percent of Millennials made a local, national, or global difference by donating money or volunteering time with a charitable or social change organization. But Millennials are facing challenges unknown to the Baby Boomers; they are the first generation in modern history to face higher levels of unemployment and lower levels of wealth and personal income at the same stage of their lives. Yet, this generation has also observed that positive change can result from sound public policy and that it makes a difference which officials are elected to make those policy decisions. For example, economic policy decisions made during the past six years has led to a reduction in unemployment rates from a high of 9.8% in 2009 to a low of 5.1%, and the creation of more than 8.3 million private sector jobs. Additionally, during the last six years we have witnessed policies and actions promoting and enhancing equality, diversity, tolerance, and inclusion advocated, championed, and implemented by persons elected by voters. But it must be remembered that progress and positive change happens by choice, not by chance. In a democratic form of government, participation is rewarded in the form of responsiveness from elected representatives; conversely, the interests of non-participators sadly are all too often neglected or ignored. And it is important that we observe National Voter Registration Day so that everyone is educated and empowered with the tools to make their preferences known, their interests considered, and their voices count. As President Johnson said: The vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which imprison men because they are different from other men. In 2008, 6 million Americans did not exercise that power because they missed a registration deadline or did not know how to register to vote. Mr. Speaker, our nation works best when all voices and all interests are fairly considered and that can only happen if all, or nearly all, eligible persons register and vote in elections.

BARBARA LEE of california in the house of representatives Thursday, September 24, 2015 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mr. Peter Van Kleef. Known by many in the Bay Area as the owner of Cafe Van Kleef, located on Telegraph Avenue in Oakland's Uptown neighborhood, Peter has left an undeniable mark on the city of Oakland as a trailblazer in the resurgence of Oakland's downtown area. With his passing on September 8, 2015, we honor his life's work and lasting legacy. The Van Kleef family immigrated to Oakland in 1956 from Rotterdam, Holland. A world traveler, Peter spent many years in countries such as France, Morocco, and Thailand. He also spent a few years teaching English in Japan. When he returned to California after his time overseas, Peter opened up the Rio Theatre in Rodeo, CA. He returned to Oakland in the early 2000's to open Cafe Van Kleef. This successful venture led many to call Peter a pioneer as he opened his cafe in Oakland's Uptown neighborhood despite many who doubted about the area's potential. Cafe Van Kleef has since become a captivating social hub in the downtown Oakland community. Peter was known by his patrons and friends as a man with a story to tell, as much of the artwork he displayed at his establishment came partnered with a riveting account of its journey to Cafe Van Kleef. His innovative and welcoming spirit led him to make rooted friendships in Oakland and the greater San Francisco Bay Area. Peter was an adventurous spirit and pioneer businessman, but above all, he was a loving husband, brother and uncle. He is survived by his wife Cindy Reeves, his siblings Ron, Gerda, Marja, and Florence, and five nieces and nephews. Peter will forever be remembered as an Uptown Oakland trailblazer, an art enthusiast, a world traveler and a man with many beautiful experiences to share. Today, California's 13th Congressional District salutes the life of an outstanding individual and pioneer, Peter Van Kleef. His contributions have truly impacted the Oakland business community as well as the lives of his family, friends, and patrons. I join all of Mr. Van Kleef's loved ones in celebrating his incredible accomplishments and offer my most sincere condolences. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1347] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING PETER VAN KLEEF ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the work of Norma Montna a lifetime advocate for persons with disabilities, and one of my district's 2015 Woman of the year. Whereas, on the Twenty-Second Day of September, of the Year Two Thousand and Fifteen, Norma Montna was recognized as a 2015 Woman of the year. Whereas, Norma Montna married her high school sweetheart Larry and in 1961, gave birth to their only child, Butchie. Butchie was born with Down's Syndrome and is the inspiration behind Norma's lifelong mission to help others with disabilities. Her work includes offering peer support to families of children with special needs and active board membership with many of the agencies that provide educational and support services such as Easter Seals, Special Olympics, Yuba Sutter Mercy Guild, Kiwanis Family House, Gateway Project, Sutter County Board of Education, CA State Area Board for Developmentally Disabled, and Yuba Sutter Association for the Retarded. Whereas, in 1979, a community pool offering therapeutic warm water therapy for those with disabilities at no cost was established in memory of Butchie Montna. Butchie's Pool is unique and the only pool of its kind in the Yuba-Sutter area. The pool today serves a large number of area Seniors suffering from age-related disabling conditions at minimal cost and provides relief to over 1,500 individuals annually. Whereas, Norma, who still serves on the pool's Board of Directors, has poured her heart and soul into keeping this haven of love, fun, and physical support open and alive for 40 years. Whereas, ``The pool was an idea we thought of after we lost Butchie, because he loved the water. He'd have been here every day,'' explains Norma, who fondly refers to former friends of Butchie's who still attend the pool as her `kids'.

PLAZA TRAIN TERMINAL ______ HON. MARCY KAPTUR of ohio in the house of representatives Thursday, September 24, 2015 Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 65th anniversary of Toledo's unique train station. Toledo's Union Terminal, now known as the Martin Luther King, Jr. Plaza, celebrated its 65th year serving America's rail system on September 22, 2015. Toledo's station is the busiest rail station in Ohio. It opened with fanfare just south of downtown Toledo in 1950. Envisioned as the presentation of the city to the world, Toledo's train terminal was a modern design creatively utilizing the glass which put Toledo on the world stage. As the 20th Century dawned, Toledoans clamored for a modern station with a look toward the future, even cheering when the city's train depot caught fire in 1930. However, it would be decades before the 1886 Victorian structure would be replaced. Following WWII railroads again turned toward infrastructure improvements, including the Toledo station. As Amtrak describes in its Great American Stations, ``Upon its opening in September 1950, Toledo Union Station was hailed in the New York Times as the ``$5,000,000 Dream of 40 Years,'' and a week of events was planned to celebrate the new building. Admiral Chester Nimitz, commander-in-chief of the combined American forces in the Pacific during World War II, was invited as the principal speaker. Events included a ``Youngster's Day,'' a city-wide tea party, and ``Glass Day'' during which the city's glass manufacturers unveiled a Vitrolite (an opaque, pigmented glass then manufactured by the local Libby Owens Ford Company) mural in the building. The highlight of the festivities was the opening day parade where a model of the old Union Depot was set on fire. ``The station which rose along Emerald Ave from 1947 to 1950 was unabashedly modern, incorporating restrained Art Deco lines and large expanses of glass block in reference to the city's main industry. Commentators expounded upon the variety of glass used in the building, including plate glass, glass block, double-glazed and tempered glass. Soon enough, the press referred to the station as the `Palace of Glass.' '' In 1995 the Toledo-Lucas County Port Authority purchased Union Terminal from Conrail, [[Page E1348]] which has succeeded New York Central. With the help of significant federal investment augmented by a partnership from state and private sources, the station underwent a major renovation and was renamed Central Union Plaza. Amtrak's history notes that ``The Port Authority worked with the State Historic Preservation Office and the Northwest Ohio Historic Preservation Council in order to maintain the building's essential historic design features remained intact.'' Because ``City funding stipulated that one percent of project monies had to be used on public art, the Port Authority worked with the Arts Commission of Greater Toledo to add contemporary sculptures to the grounds to enhance its function as a vital piece of the public realm.'' In 2001, the station was renamed in honor of eminent civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. It now serves as a modern train station through which more than 63,000 travelers pass each year. It will soon add bus service as it grows into a greater multimodal transportation hub linking rail and bus, as well as proximity to waterborne vessels. Historically, the Toledo passenger rail center has anchored northwest Ohio along the well-established east-west Chicago-Cleveland freight and passenger rail route so vital to the economy of the region and northern Ohio. Meeting the needs of the future for this region will require the recognition that modernization of this rail corridor is essential to future commerce including separation of freight and passenger service to make both more efficient. I am honored this week to join with the community of Toledo, Ohio in celebrating the anniversary of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Plaza, a jewel in our city born of an era when trains were a modern marvel of transportation and traveling toward a future which meets the needs of travels in the 21st Century and beyond. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1347-E1348] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING TOLEDO'S MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

'' in 1995 the toledo-lucas county port authority purchased union terminal from conrail, [[page e1348]] which has succeeded new york central. with the help of significant federal investment augmented by a partnership from state and private sources, the station underwent a major renovation and was renamed central union plaza. amtrak's history notes that ``the port authority worked with the state historic preservation office and the northwest ohio historic preservation council in order to maintain the building's essential historic design features remained intact.'' because ``city funding stipulated that one percent of project monies had to be used on public art, the port authority worked with the arts commission of greater toledo to add contemporary sculptures to the grounds to enhance its function as a vital piece of the public realm.'' in 2001, the station was renamed in honor of eminent civil rights leader martin luther king, jr. it now serves as a modern train station through which more than 63,000 travelers pass each year. it will soon add bus service as it grows into a greater multimodal transportation hub linking rail and bus, as well as proximity to waterborne vessels. historically, the toledo passenger rail center has anchored northwest ohio along the well-established east-west chicago-cleveland freight and passenger rail route so vital to the economy of the region and northern ohio. meeting the needs of the future for this region will require the recognition that modernization of this rail corridor is essential to future commerce including separation of freight and passenger service to make both more efficient. i am honored this week to join with the community of toledo, ohio in celebrating the anniversary of the martin luther king, jr. plaza, a jewel in our city born of an era when trains were a modern marvel of transportation and traveling toward a future which meets the needs of travels in the 21st century and beyond. ____________________",4430

Dr. Allison has invented a completely new way to strike cancer. He has found a way to unlock the shackles of an immune system, freeing T cells to fight tumor cells. This discovery opens up brand new and very effective ways to treat cancer. A drug developed from this research was the first to increase survival of patients with late-stage melanoma and produced previously unheard of survival rates of up to 10 years. The drug, marketed as Yervoy, was approved by the FDA in 2001 and has been used to treat 59,000 people. In addition, during his time leading the immunology department at MD Anderson, Dr. Allison has established a cancer immunotherapy platform. This platform, a combination of expertise and infrastructure, brings together scientists and clinicians to better understand and advance cancer immunotherapy. This prestigious award honoring major achievements in basic science, clinical research, and public service around the world is rightly bestowed on Dr. Allison, as he has paved the way to extend the survival of current cancer patients and ultimately cure some types of cancer.

SHEILA JACKSON LEE of texas in the house of representatives Thursday, September 24, 2015 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the constituents of the Eighteenth Congressional District, I rise to express joy and appreciation on the occasion of the historic visit to the United States by His Holiness, Pope Francis. I am deeply honored to have participated in the historic arrival ceremony at the White House welcoming His Holiness, the spiritual leader of 70 million Catholic Americans and 1.2 billion Catholics worldwide. I wish to thank President Obama for his gracious welcoming remarks on behalf of the American people which conveyed to Pope Francis and the world what is best about our nation. I especially appreciate Pope Francis's message of hope, healing, and reconciliation which inspires us all to do more ``to care for the least of these,'' to be good stewards of the earth, and to work for peace. Mr. Speaker, the messages of President Obama and Pope Francis affirm the value and good works performed daily by Catholic organizations and charities in the United States, including those in my congressional district represented by the many advocates for social justice who accepted by invitation and made the pilgrimage from Houston to Washington, D.C. to bear witness to this historic and joyful occasion. I am pleased that my office was able to extend invitations to many organizations and Galveston-Houston Archdiocese churches from my congressional district to come to Washington, D.C. to salute His Holiness. Among them are the Immaculate Conception Catholic Church, St. Francis Assisi Catholic Church, St. Monica Catholic Church, Our Mother of Mercy Catholic Church, Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church, and a number of Houston's Wounded Warriors. I am also pleased that Deacon Sam Dunning, the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston's Director of the Office of Justice and Peace, was able to join me in celebrating the pontiff's visit, as were students and staff from St. Pius X High School, members of the Idbo Catholic Community, and World Harvest Outreach. In his moving remarks today, Pope Francis reminded us that ``the Creator does not abandon us'' and that we ``still have time to make the change needed to bring about a sustainable and integral development.'' Mr. Speaker, every day in communities across America and around the world, Catholic organizations and agencies can be found doing the Lord's work of caring for the poor, the sick, the needy, the aged, the helpless, the lost and hopeless. We see the fruits of this work in the sanctuary found by women fleeing from domestic violence, in the reunification of families separated by natural disasters, in the shelter found by a homeless wounded warrior suffering from PTSD, and the love and support given the child of undocumented immigrants who seek only the chance to make a better life for themselves and their family in a land that has always been the most welcoming nation on earth. Mr. Speaker, the good works of the Catholic Church are on display daily in my congressional district where agencies and organizations supported by Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Galveston/Houston take to heart the biblical injunction that we are our brother's keeper. Ten years ago, for example, Hurricane Katrina forced thousands of people to flee New Orleans and relocate to Houston. Among these persons were an adoption specialist for Catholic Charities in New Orleans, one of the birthmothers she was working with, and the adoptive family the birthmothers had just chosen for her baby. With phone lines down and no communication between them, the adoption was sure to fall through, but somehow they found each other in Houston and the adoption was put back on track. The Lord works in mysterious ways indeed. The day following the flood that struck the Houston area this past Memorial Day, staff members of Catholic Charities of the Galveston- Houston Archdiocese were out in the field assessing the needs of their senior citizen clients, one of whom was 74-year old Minthia Terry. Ms. Terry survived the flood but her house was severely damaged; thanks to Catholic Charities her damaged house was restored and she is able to live safe and secure in the home she worked so hard to acquire. The Lotus Project is a program of Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston that helps homeless female veterans rebuild their lives. I am thankful for the Lotus Project, and so is a woman named Yolanda. Yolanda served her country honorably in the Armed Forces but her three-year tour of duty left her with emotional scars that still affect her today. She was a victim of verbal abuse by an officer, which escalated to physical violence, and then to sexual assault. After reporting the abuse, violence and assault she had suffered, she underwent psychological counseling and was subsequently honorably discharged. But the emotional and psychic scars resulting from her traumatic experience did not disappear after her separation from the military. To combat them and cope with the pressure of caring for her two young sons, Yolanda turned to drugs and alcohol, and committed offenses that landed her in prison. During her third stint in prison, Yolanda renewed her relationship with God and dedicated herself to a new life, but she needed help to get there. When the Lotus Project helped her get an apartment under her own name, she cried; then with the help and support of the Lotus Project she went about the business of furthering her education so she can support her family and be a positive role model for her children. Mr. Speaker, a woman named Esmerelda was living in a rapidly deteriorating situation. When she became a victim of domestic violence, she knew she had to leave. But because her immigration paperwork was not in order, she did not believe it would be [[Page E1350]] safe to turn to law enforcement authorities for help. Thankfully, she was able to turn to Catholic Charities who helped her secure safe housing, assisted her in applying for an adjustment of her immigration status, and helped her secure employment at a full-time job that support her and her daughter. These are but a few of the countless miracles of hope and healing that Catholic organizations and agencies work every day and which demonstrate, as the Talmud teaches, that ``whosoever saves a life, it is considered as if he saved an entire world.'' Mr. Speaker, I am hopeful that Members of Congress will receive the hopeful message of the first pontiff to address a joint session of the Congress of the United States with open hearts and in a spirit of goodwill. If we do this, I am confident we will be able to come together and find the common ground necessary to address the real problems and concerns of the American people such as fixing our broken immigration system, making college affordable, reducing the economic disparities, and reforming the criminal justice system. In the hopeful message of Pope Francis, we are shown the way to grace. Mr. Speaker, all Americans are honored by the visit to the United States of Pope Francis, an amazing servant of humanity and an inspiration to people the world over. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1349-E1350] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WELCOMING HIS HOLINESS, POPE FRANCIS, TO THE UNITED STATES AND EMBRACING HIS MESSAGE OF HOPE, HEALING, AND RECONCILIATION ______ HON.

EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of texas in the house of representatives Thursday, September 24, 2015 Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the Dallas Coalition for Hunger Solutions for hosting their Fourth Annual Dallas Hunger Summit. As the Chair of the Dallas Coalition for Hunger Solutions, I hold a strong passion for helping the families in my district overcome the obstacles and challenges they face. I'm very pleased to again be working with the Coalition to organize this important event. The theme of this year's Summit is Roots, Growth and Harvest. [[Page E1349]] First, we explore the roots of hunger and renew our commitment to tackling this urgent problem. Hunger and food insecurity are obstacles that no family, no child, and no senior should have to confront. More than 477,000 people in Dallas County are food insecure, including over 172,000 children. In Congress, I have been a steadfast supporter of anti-hunger programs. I cannot over-emphasize the importance of preserving nutrition programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Often, I remind my colleagues that 95% of SNAP funding goes directly to families to purchase food. For many of these at-risk populations, SNAP is the sole form of income assistance they receive and is a powerful anecdote to extreme poverty. Tens of millions of people rely on federal nutrition programs to feed their families and help make ends meet. When we know that nutrition programs not only help struggling families, but also generate economic activity, we must support these assistance programs. At last year's Summit, we came together to learn, share about our successes and challenge ourselves to do more. This past year we have seen a fantastic growth in partnerships as many of you lent your time, passion and expertise to the work of the Coalition and its five Action Teams. I'm glad to share just a few of the great things that have been accomplished this year. First, the Child Hunger Action Team continued to partner with DISD to expand the number of schools that served suppers during afterschool programs--growing participation from 28 in 2013 to over 160 today. Second, the Faith Community Action Team organized 15 congregations and ministries to jointly provide vegetable gardens to 190 families across the County, many of them growing their own food for the very first time. Third, the Senior Hunger Action Team has begun implementing collaborative pilot initiatives to increase the number of seniors with access to SNAP benefits and to increase participation in senior congregate meal programs. This is vital as we owe it to our seniors to make sure they have the food they need to be healthy. Fourth, the Urban Agriculture Action Team achieved a great victory in spurring the City of Dallas to amend zoning ordinances to allow sales from urban gardens, which will both increase access to healthy food, and spur jobs and economic development. Lastly, the Neighborhood Organizing Action Team successfully launched a new, resident-led community organization called Empowering Oak Cliff, which is engaging community members in southern Oak Cliff in leading a holistic campaign for neighborhood revitalization, including ensuring that the many seniors in the community have access to healthy food. Thanks so much to all of you that have been part of making these achievements possible. It is amazing what can be accomplished when we work together. Thank you to all of the participants and especially to the Dallas Coalition for Hunger Solutions for your commitment to this cause. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1348-E1349] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE DALLAS COALITION FOR HUNGER SOLUTIONS ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the work of Paula Emigh a retired teacher, and one of my district's 2015 Woman of the year. Whereas, on the Twenty-Second Day of September, of the Year Two Thousand and Fifteen, Paula Emigh was recognized as a 2015 Woman of the year. Whereas, Paula Emigh was born and raised in Solano County, graduating from Dixon High School. As a student, Paula was very involved in school activities and believes that her experiences as a student led her to consider a career in teaching. When Paula was an undergraduate at the University of California, Santa Barbara, she had an internship at a special education center in the area, where she was first exposed to teaching children with special needs. This experience convinced her that her future was in special education. Whereas, after graduating, Paula began a substitute position in Woodland which eventually led to over 30 years as a special education teacher. She was an integral team member in the development of the BEST program at Freeman Elementary School, helping to create a positive school climate for staff, students, and families. Because of the incredible work she has done with staff on disability awareness, Paula was named Woodland Joint Unified School District's 2014 Educator of the Year. Whereas, in all ways imaginable, Paula credits her career as being a team effort. Throughout her years teaching, Paula worked cooperatively with many paraprofessionals, parents, and families. Together they were able to prioritize and strategize plans to allow the students to grow beyond previous expectations.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today alongside my colleagues, Representative Costa and Representative Valadao, to recognize the life and valued service of Dr. Charles ``Charlie'' Allen Waters, Jr., a distinguished military veteran and community advocate who passed away on September 3, 2015 in Fresno, California. Dr. Waters was born on September 17, 1932 in Norfolk, Virginia. He was the son of Naval Officer Charles Allen Waters, Sr. Charlie served in the United States Marine Corps (USMC) from 1951 to 1958 and fought in the Korean War from 1951 to 1952. Charlie received many medals and awards for his honorable service in Korea, most recently the Korean Ambassador for Peace Medal. For the past few decades, Charlie made an immeasurable impact in Fresno and the greater San Joaquin Valley by serving on numerous boards, commissions, and foundations supporting veterans, and the community as a whole. The opening of the Fresno Veterans Home was due in large part to his invaluable and tireless efforts. Dr. Waters served as President of the Central California Veterans Home Support Foundation (CCVHSF), was Past Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps League Detachment 14, and Commander of American Legion Post 4, in addition to his many unofficial contributions to other local organizations. A diligent champion of Fresno veterans, Dr. Waters once said, ``I have a great affinity for anyone who would go into service and volunteer their life. So, whatever I can do for my comrades, I do.'' These words speak to his deep commitment to service and his inexhaustible altruism. Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that we ask our colleagues in the House of Representatives to honor the life of Dr. Charlie Waters.

A small group of investors, called the Langhorne Improvement Company, purchased 800 acres--attracted by the open, country setting and the nearby Boundbrook Railroad. The newly founded borough was named for the area's first landowners, the Langhornes'. Government and community leaders of this thriving, small borough cherish their history and remain dedicated to maintaining a quiet community nestled in the bustle of Lower Bucks County. The borough is home to the former Langhorne Manor School, a one-room schoolhouse listed, in 2008, on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1959, it was sold and converted to the borough hall, which is the present-day seat of government.

CREC-2015-09-24-pt1-PgE1351-2,CREC-2015-09-24,114,RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF OUR LADY QUEEN OF THE MOST HOLY ROSARY CATHEDRAL,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1351] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF OUR LADY QUEEN OF THE MOST HOLY ROSARY CATHEDRAL ______ HON. MARCY KAPTUR of ohio in the house of representatives Thursday, September 24, 2015 Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the centennial anniversary of Our Lady Queen of the Most Holy Rosary Cathedral in Toledo, Ohio. The parish and Toledo Diocese celebrated this milestone on August 28, 2015. According to diocesan records, the Cathedral Chapel Parish was established on March 7, 1915, with the Most Reverend Bishop Joseph Schrembs named as pastor. Previous to that date, from the time the Diocese was established in April of 1910, St. Francis de Sales Church served as the cathedral. Shortly thereafter, land was purchased nearby on Collingwood Avenue and a Chancery, residence and school were built on the property in the ensuing years with completion in early 1915. Originally sponsoring both grade school and high school, the parish school soon grew too big. In 1920, Central Catholic High School was established, with most of its students coming from the Cathedral School. After a storm delivered substantial damage to the building in 1920, it was determined a new church would be built. The plans were developed in 1922. Its original architect and the man who would complete his design envisioned a cathedral such as those built in Europe's Middle Ages and mirrored aspects of the cathedral in Toledo, Ohio's sister city of Toledo, Spain. Thus, Toledo's Catholic Cathedral is unique: there is no other cathedral in the Plateresque style quite like Toledo's. Plateresque is a romantic style developed in 16th Century Spain and Toledo's cathedral combined the Plateresque style with Romanesque and Saracan architecture for a structure that stands alone in style and beauty. The Cathedral is truly an architectural wonder and treasure. Soaring above its Spanish style roof are twin towers Peter and Paul. Our Lady is carved out of a single block of limestone and is above the doorway. A window above the statue of Our Lady illustrates scenes from her life. The window was made possible by the pennies donated from the children in the Diocese. Other statuary depicting biblical scenes surround. The sanctuary features beautiful frescoes, murals and mosaics depicting stories and people from the Bible, the life of the Holy Family and the history of the church. The Cathedral is home to a grand pipe organ which was the culmination of the career of its creator, the famed Ernest Skinner. The pipe organ's sister resides in the Peristyle concert hall at the Toledo Museum of Art, home of the Toledo Symphony. The Cathedral's cornerstone was laid on Sunday June 27, 1926. Sufficiently completed to begin services, the building was opened in 1931. Work on the structure continued until completion in 1940. A joyous two day celebration and consecration was finally held on October 1 and 2, 1940. The Cathedral parish and school grew through the 1960s, but as Toledo's population moved to the suburbs and new parishes were established, the central city Cathedral parish and school saw a decline in families enrolled. Beginning in 1976, the Cathedral was to undergo extensive renovations to comply with the changes to the Mass brought by Vatican II. The renovations did not detract from the original design and the church was rededicated on September 18, 1979. In 2000, restoration was completed to remove the decades from the interior of the church and restore it to its early brilliance. The spiritual home of Toledo area Catholics, the cathedral serves as the mother church of the Diocese's parishes. Though its home parish is smaller now, Catholics from throughout the city and its suburbs see the Cathedral as their own, celebrating Baptisms, First Communions, Confirmations, Marriages and Requiem Masses. Priests are ordained at the Cathedral and special Masses are celebrated through the year. In tradition harkening back to the days they were part of the original parish school, the students of Central Catholic High School walk in procession for a yearly Mass. Though soaring vaulted ceilings, beautiful works of art, statuary, bell towers, giant wood doors and marble floors and ancient pews on which thousands have gathered over the years to celebrate Mass make the Cathedral a grand and glorious house of worship, at the same time it is intimate and peaceful. The faithful can always hear that ``still, small voice'' even among the grandeur. More important than the structure, though, are the people. We reflect on the early founders, those whose hopes, dreams and labors brought forth our stunning Cathedral, and in the present day we stand in solidarity with them. I was pleased to join in the celebration recognizing 100 years of faith in Our Lady Queen of the Most Holy Rosary Cathedral. Through our cherished Cathedral, we are one. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1351] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF OUR LADY QUEEN OF THE MOST HOLY ROSARY CATHEDRAL ______ HON.

After a storm delivered substantial damage to the building in 1920, it was determined a new church would be built. The plans were developed in 1922. Its original architect and the man who would complete his design envisioned a cathedral such as those built in Europe's Middle Ages and mirrored aspects of the cathedral in Toledo, Ohio's sister city of Toledo, Spain. Thus, Toledo's Catholic Cathedral is unique: there is no other cathedral in the Plateresque style quite like Toledo's. Plateresque is a romantic style developed in 16th Century Spain and Toledo's cathedral combined the Plateresque style with Romanesque and Saracan architecture for a structure that stands alone in style and beauty. The Cathedral is truly an architectural wonder and treasure. Soaring above its Spanish style roof are twin towers Peter and Paul. Our Lady is carved out of a single block of limestone and is above the doorway. A window above the statue of Our Lady illustrates scenes from her life. The window was made possible by the pennies donated from the children in the Diocese. Other statuary depicting biblical scenes surround. The sanctuary features beautiful frescoes, murals and mosaics depicting stories and people from the Bible, the life of the Holy Family and the history of the church. The Cathedral is home to a grand pipe organ which was the culmination of the career of its creator, the famed Ernest Skinner. The pipe organ's sister resides in the Peristyle concert hall at the Toledo Museum of Art, home of the Toledo Symphony. The Cathedral's cornerstone was laid on Sunday June 27, 1926. Sufficiently completed to begin services, the building was opened in 1931. Work on the structure continued until completion in 1940. A joyous two day celebration and consecration was finally held on October 1 and 2, 1940. The Cathedral parish and school grew through the 1960s, but as Toledo's population moved to the suburbs and new parishes were established, the central city Cathedral parish and school saw a decline in families enrolled. Beginning in 1976, the Cathedral was to undergo extensive renovations to comply with the changes to the Mass brought by Vatican II. The renovations did not detract from the original design and the church was rededicated on September 18, 1979. In 2000, restoration was completed to remove the decades from the interior of the church and restore it to its early brilliance. The spiritual home of Toledo area Catholics, the cathedral serves as the mother church of the Diocese's parishes. Though its home parish is smaller now, Catholics from throughout the city and its suburbs see the Cathedral as their own, celebrating Baptisms, First Communions, Confirmations, Marriages and Requiem Masses. Priests are ordained at the Cathedral and special Masses are celebrated through the year. In tradition harkening back to the days they were part of the original parish school, the students of Central Catholic High School walk in procession for a yearly Mass. Though soaring vaulted ceilings, beautiful works of art, statuary, bell towers, giant wood doors and marble floors and ancient pews on which thousands have gathered over the years to celebrate Mass make the Cathedral a grand and glorious house of worship, at the same time it is intimate and peaceful. The faithful can always hear that ``still, small voice'' even among the grandeur. More important than the structure, though, are the people. We reflect on the early founders, those whose hopes, dreams and labors brought forth our stunning Cathedral, and in the present day we stand in solidarity with them. I was pleased to join in the celebration recognizing 100 years of faith in Our Lady Queen of the Most Holy Rosary Cathedral. Through our cherished Cathedral, we are one. ____________________",package_114_55.csv,5082,5082,5156,"[congressional record volume 161, number 138 (thursday, september 24, 2015)] [extensions of

CREC-2015-09-24-pt1-PgE1352-5,CREC-2015-09-24,114,INTRODUCTION OF THE UNIVERSAL PREKINDERGARTEN AND EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION ACT OF 2015,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1352-E1353] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE UNIVERSAL PREKINDERGARTEN AND EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION ACT OF 2015 ______ HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Thursday, September 24, 2015 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce a bill similar to a bill I have introduced in four previous Congresses, the Universal Prekindergarten and Early Childhood Education Act of 2015 (Universal Pre-K), to begin the process of providing universal prekindergarten education in public and public charter schools in states that have or plan to phase in or are phasing in prekindergarten education for three- and four-year-old children. The Obama administration and the District of Columbia have made considerable strides since I first introduced this bill, but today's bill is still needed to fill a hole in the ``No Child Left Behind Act,'' which addresses elementary and secondary education but ignores the prekindergarten years, the most critical years for children's brain development. My bill also seeks a breakthrough in public education by providing the initial funding for states to encourage local school districts to add prekindergarten for children at three or four years of age, as kindergarten programs were for five-year-olds, which are now routinely available in public schools. The bill would eliminate some of the major shortcomings of unevenly available ``day care'' and, importantly, would take advantage of the safe facilities required in public schools. Unless early education becomes a necessary part of a child's education, it almost surely will continue to be unavailable to the majority of families with children. My bill provides federal funds to states, which must be matched by at least 20 percent of state funds, to establish or expand universal, voluntary prekindergarten in public and public charter schools for three- and four-year-olds, regardless of income. The classes, which would be full-day and run throughout the entire school year, must be taught by teachers who possess equivalent or similar qualifications to those in other grades in the school. The funds would supplement, not supplant, other federal funds for early childhood education. The unique money-saving aspect of my bill is that it uses the existing public school infrastructure and trained teachers to make early childhood education available to all, and save billions of dollars in its implementation. The success of Head Start and other prekindergarten programs, combined with new scientific evidence concerning the importance of brain development in early childhood, virtually mandate the expansion of early childhood education to all children today. However, early learning programs have been available only to the affluent, who can afford them, and to low-income families in programs such as Head Start, which would be unaffected by my bill. My bill provides a practical way to gradually move to universal, public preschool education for the majority of families The goal of the bill is to afford the benefits of early childhood education to the great majority of the American working poor, lower-middle-class and middle-class families, most of whom have been left out of this essential education for their children. We cannot afford to continue to allow the most fertile years for childhood development to pass, only to later wonder why Johnny can't read. The bill responds both to the great needs of parents who seek early childhood education, as well as to today's brain science, which shows that a child's brain development begins much earlier than had been previously understood. Considering the staggering cost of day care, the inaccessibility of early childhood education, and the opportunity that early education offers to improve a child's chances of success, schooling for three- and four-year-olds is overdue. The absence of viable options for working families demands our immediate attention. My bill reflects what jurisdictions throughout the nation increasingly are trying to accomplish. The District of Columbia, for example, has achieved an extensive integration of early childhood education as part of a larger effort to improve the D.C. public schools. A recent report highlighted the economic benefits of early childhood education, emphasizing its role in expanding job opportunities and in decreasing the amount of money spent on programs to address teen pregnancy, crime, and the like. I strongly urge my colleagues to support the legislation.

CREC-2015-09-24-pt1-PgE1353,CREC-2015-09-24,114,TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN JOSEPH OGLE,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1353] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN JOSEPH OGLE ______ HON. MIKE BOST of illinois in the house of representatives Thursday, September 24, 2015 Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of a great American from my home state of Illinois, Captain Joseph Ogle. Joseph Ogle was born in 1737, raised in Frederick County, Maryland and lived near what is now Wheeling, West Virginia by 1770. Later, he was one of the first to take up the standard and volunteer in the fight for our nation's freedom and independence in the Revolutionary War. Captain Ogle's military career was long and proud. From the earliest days of the Revolution, he served, fighting in the Upper Ohio Valley. Most notably, Captain Ogle served as a Commander of Fort Henry, defending that Fort during two brutal attacks--one in 1777 and a second in 1782. But the pioneer spirit burned strongly in Captain Ogle. After the Revolutionary War, he set out for the West, buoyed by the promise of independence and the opportunity for self-determination. Captain Ogle arrived in Illinois in April, 1785, settling in what is now Monroe County. In 1802, he moved to Ridge Prairie near what is now O'Fallon, in St. Clair County, where he remained until his death in 1821--at 84 years of age. From the First Methodist Church in Shiloh, which he founded in 1807 and which is still in use today--to the Palmier Cemetery, established on property donated by Captain Ogle as a cemetery for early pioneers-- to Ogle County, Illinois, which bears his name, the mark Captain Ogle left on the region cannot be exaggerated. But perhaps Captain Ogle's greatest legacy is that of his family. A father of nine children, Captain Ogle's descendants, many of whom still live in St. Clair and Monroe Counties, Illinois, number in the thousands and have carried on the patriotism and pioneer spirit as their birthright. It is for these reasons, and more, that a new monument will be dedicated to Captain Ogle in Shiloh, Illinois. The dedication of this new monument is due to the ongoing efforts of his descendants in the Ogle & Ogles Family Association, along with the support of the Belleville Illinois Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, and the Louis and the Clark Chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution. We are all indebted to the service, the spirit, and the resilience of pioneers like Captain Ogle and his fellow New Americans. These men and women helped lay the foundation on which America was built. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in recognition of this great American and Illinoisan. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1353] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN JOSEPH OGLE ______ HON.

In 1802, he moved to Ridge Prairie near what is now O'Fallon, in St. Clair County, where he remained until his death in 1821--at 84 years of age. From the First Methodist Church in Shiloh, which he founded in 1807 and which is still in use today--to the Palmier Cemetery, established on property donated by Captain Ogle as a cemetery for early pioneers-- to Ogle County, Illinois, which bears his name, the mark Captain Ogle left on the region cannot be exaggerated. But perhaps Captain Ogle's greatest legacy is that of his family. A father of nine children, Captain Ogle's descendants, many of whom still live in St. Clair and Monroe Counties, Illinois, number in the thousands and have carried on the patriotism and pioneer spirit as their birthright. It is for these reasons, and more, that a new monument will be dedicated to Captain Ogle in Shiloh, Illinois. The dedication of this new monument is due to the ongoing efforts of his descendants in the Ogle & Ogles Family Association, along with the support of the Belleville Illinois Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, and the Louis and the Clark Chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution. We are all indebted to the service, the spirit, and the resilience of pioneers like Captain Ogle and his fellow New Americans. These men and women helped lay the foundation on which America was built. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in recognition of this great American and Illinoisan. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1353] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN JOSEPH OGLE ______ HON. MIKE BOST of illinois in the house of representatives Thursday, September 24, 2015 Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of a great American from my home state of Illinois, Captain Joseph Ogle. Joseph Ogle was born in 1737, raised in Frederick County, Maryland and lived near what is now Wheeling, West Virginia by 1770. Later, he was one of the first to take up the standard and volunteer in the fight for our nation's freedom and independence in the Revolutionary War. Captain Ogle's military career was long and proud. From the earliest days of the Revolution, he served, fighting in the Upper Ohio Valley. Most notably, Captain Ogle served as a Commander of Fort Henry, defending that Fort during two brutal attacks--one in 1777 and a second in 1782. But the pioneer spirit burned strongly in Captain Ogle. After the Revolutionary War, he set out for the West, buoyed by the promise of independence and the opportunity for self-determination. Captain Ogle arrived in Illinois in April, 1785, settling in what is now Monroe County.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the work of Toni Scully a leader in agriculture, an Advocate for Fair Farm Labor, and one of my district's 2015 Woman of the year. Whereas, on the Twenty-Second Day of September, of the Year Two Thousand and Fifteen, Toni Scully was recognized as a 2015 Woman of the year. Whereas, a resident of Lake County for over 40 years, Toni shares in the ownership and management of Scully Packing Company which packs, stores, ships, and markets pears grown by Lake, Sacramento Delta, and Mendocino County families. Whereas, Toni is a strong advocate for the pear industry and farm labor reform. In 1996 following a revision in the Child Labor Code that would have prevented local teens from working during the pear season, Toni was the driving force behind pulling local leaders and the state senate to pass a bill that allowed Lake County teens to continue to work the harvest. This bill continues to be renewed annually today. Whereas, Toni cares deeply for her farm workers and their families as evidenced by her continuous efforts to educate and work with local, state, and federal policy makers. In 2006, Toni made the front page of the New York Times when Lake County and farming communities across California were experiencing severe labor shortages during harvest. A proponent of a reformed Guest Worker program to improve the health and safety of migrant workers, Toni worked with U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein in an attempt to pass the AgJobs bill. Whereas, Toni continues to advocate for a fair farm labor law that will provide agricultural employers with the stable, legal labor force they need while providing farm workers with the health and safety they deserve.

Kathy started her career in 1984 at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Washington. She later joined the Science Applications International Corporation as business manager for energy and the environment. In 2001, Kathy commenced a career working at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). Working tirelessly with passion and drive, she quickly worked her way up the ranks, serving as business manager for a number of departments before being named Chief Financial Officer in 2012. She was described by those who knew and worked with her as a very special person and a great friend. Her loss is grieved by her colleagues at LLNL, including principally by her husband, Jeff Baker, also an employee at the lab. Kathy, a Washington State University graduate, met her husband, Jeff, when they were both attending the university. He sat behind her in calculus class, where their friendship quickly turned into a lifetime commitment towards one another. In the words of her husband, Kathy was the most wonderful, caring person anyone had ever met. In the words of her colleagues, she was seen as a member of their family.

Whereas, Joanne Ellis is the Executive Director of the Yuba Sutter Gleaners Food Bank and Thrift Store. The Yuba Sutter Gleaners Food Bank is the only all-volunteer Food Bank in California. In addition to coordinating food distributions at 22 sites, scheduling volunteers and arranging for deliveries, Joanne manages the Emergency Drought Box program authorized by Governor Jerry Brown to distribute among individuals most affected by the drought such as agricultural workers. Whereas, Joanne took the initiative to implement a successful pilot program called `Food for Thought' at Park Avenue School in Yuba City. The program aims to minimize child hunger over the weekends when children and families do not have access to the National School Lunch program. It offers students the opportunity to take fresh local fruits and vegetables and whole grain breads home to prepare and eat over the weekend. With Park Avenue Elementary School containing the highest poverty levels in the district, the program has been very well- received. Whereas, Joanne is a member of the Lions Club and Yuba-Sutter United Way.

DORIS O. MATSUI of california in the house of representatives Thursday, September 24, 2015 Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the opening of the California Northstate University College of Medicine (CNUCOM). CNUCOM was created by a group of doctors, academics and medical professionals in order to train a new generation of doctors. CNUCOM welcomed their first full class of 60 medical students on September 8, 2015 and this weekend the school is celebrating their opening. CNUCOM is meeting a great need of both the Sacramento region and the State of California by increasing the number of medical students trained in the state. By training at least sixty new medical students each year, CNUCOM is helping address the drastic shortage of physicians that our nation is facing. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, our nation faces a shortfall of over 130,000 physicians by 2025. Almost half of Californians live in an area where primary care doctors are in short supply and far too many California counties have less than the recommended ratio of 60 to 80 primary care physicians per 100,000 residents. CNUCOM will be training the next generation of medical students by utilizing an integrated approach that focuses on basic science and an understanding of how the human body's systems work, what goes wrong and what patients need to do to stay healthy. Their rigorous curriculum will include two years of classroom study, which will then be followed by clinical rotations at local hospitals, doctors' offices and clinics. It is clear that CNUCOM is providing a cost effective, quality education while also building community partnerships to address clinical training needs and increasing access to high quality medical care in the Sacramento region. Mr. Speaker, as the California Northstate University College of Medicine opens their doors and welcomes their first class, I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring their excellent work in the Sacramento region. I am confident that the CNUCOM will be producing the next generation of doctors and acting as a model for a quality medical education for many years to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1355] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE OPENING OF CALIFORNIA NORTHSTATE UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE ______ HON.

CNUCOM welcomed their first full class of 60 medical students on September 8, 2015 and this weekend the school is celebrating their opening. CNUCOM is meeting a great need of both the Sacramento region and the State of California by increasing the number of medical students trained in the state. By training at least sixty new medical students each year, CNUCOM is helping address the drastic shortage of physicians that our nation is facing. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, our nation faces a shortfall of over 130,000 physicians by 2025. Almost half of Californians live in an area where primary care doctors are in short supply and far too many California counties have less than the recommended ratio of 60 to 80 primary care physicians per 100,000 residents. CNUCOM will be training the next generation of medical students by utilizing an integrated approach that focuses on basic science and an understanding of how the human body's systems work, what goes wrong and what patients need to do to stay healthy. Their rigorous curriculum will include two years of classroom study, which will then be followed by clinical rotations at local hospitals, doctors' offices and clinics. It is clear that CNUCOM is providing a cost effective, quality education while also building community partnerships to address clinical training needs and increasing access to high quality medical care in the Sacramento region. Mr. Speaker, as the California Northstate University College of Medicine opens their doors and welcomes their first class, I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring their excellent work in the Sacramento region. I am confident that the CNUCOM will be producing the next generation of doctors and acting as a model for a quality medical education for many years to come. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1355] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE OPENING OF CALIFORNIA NORTHSTATE UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE ______ HON.

PETE SESSIONS of texas in the house of representatives Thursday, September 24, 2015 Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I am going to leave research to the researchers, and history to the historians and address myself to another, and even more basic aspect, of the issue before you. I am satisfied that when you review the historical data that is being presented here today, you will agree that there is no room for doubt where Uncle Sam Wilson lived and where he died and where he lies buried--in an all but forgotten grave. Troy's claim to Uncle Sam is beyond dispute. But there is another and, as I said, an even more fundamental aspect to this issue. It might be expressed in the unspoken question which, I am sure, has suggested itself to some, if not all, of the members of this committee. You may well ask: With Congress laboring to resolve the most complex issues, which reflect the crises which face our nation at home and abroad, why all this fuss about Uncle Sam? I should like to try to answer that question. There was a time when our country passed immeasurable advantages over the rising tide of world Communism. We had technology, we had the production know-how, we had the most advantageous tools of peace--yes, and the most advanced tools of war, including the atomic and hydrogen bombs. But our ascendancy in all these fields has, little by little, been erased or at best reduced. And, as we pause from time to time, to assess the progress of the never-ending struggle for survival which we call the ``Cold War'', we would do well to ask ourselves, bluntly and realistically: What do we have today that Communism does not have? It may be difficult to find a satisfying answer to this question in the areas of purely material progress. Nor is it surprising that Communism, the expression of materialistic philosophy, should be strong in material advantages. But there is a heartening answer to our question when we go a step beyond the purely material aspects of the struggle, into the spiritual aspects which, after all, in the long run, will resolve and decide the issue. What do we have that Communism does not have? We have our American heritage--a heritage that is reflected in our history, in our tradition, in every detail of the great success story that is the story of America. When Mr. Khrushchev shakes his fist and points to his rockets and his space ships and his legions parading in Red Square, we can stand before the world and point to our American heritage--to our history and our institutions and our principles. And it seems to me, that the nations of the world and the people of the world, faced with a choice, will know which way to go. When Mr. Khrushchev shouts, ``Look what we got,'' we can reply, ``Look what we ARE.'' And since the Cold War is, in great measure, a struggle for men's minds--a war of propaganda, if you will--one of the most important responsibilities we have is to project the American image in every corner of the world. Gentleman, we have that image ready-made. It's Uncle Sam--that kindly, serious, honest old gentleman in his striped suit and tall hat. In the minds of millions here and abroad, he stands for all the virtues and qualities that are wrapped up in the American dream--honor, initiative, industry, opportunity, freedom, respect for the rights of others, and, above all, regard for the dignity of the individual. It's all there in that picture. And it's worth more in the world struggle than all Mr. Khrushchev's space ships and rockets and nuclear bombs. But here is the point we must not overlook. What makes the image of Uncle Sam important and vital and compelling, is that Uncle Sam is real. And the world needs to know he is real. The world must be told that he is not a fictitious, shoddy trademark after the manner of an American advertising campaign. He is no cartoonist's whimsy. He is no Madison Avenue gimmick. Uncle Sam really lived. And from what we know of him, he embodied many, if not all of the qualities and virtues, that make us proud of our American heritage. Not only is Uncle Sam a real, flesh-and-blood American, he is particularly representative of the things that have made America great--initiative, industry, business acumen, Yankee resourcefulness. Going even a step further, when you consider how the term ``Uncle Sam'' was coined, you find an eloquent representation of the partnership between private enterprise and military effort in one of the most critical moments of our history--the same sort of partnership that made America mighty and respected--yes, and in the councils of the ungodly, feared. We, in America today, know something about how advertising and propaganda works. We know how difficult it is to sell an idea; any intangible idea or concept, until we clothe it in some image people can see and touch. Well, the people of the world know Uncle Sam. And the better they know him, the more they will respect and love him. And in accepting him, they will be embracing all the principles that go to make up the good life. Our own people too, need to know Uncle Sam better. Every nation needs its heroes, needs the inspiration and pride that come from a healthy respect for its historical figures. From Uncle Sam, we all can get a deeper appreciation of the American way. I have just one more point to make and it goes to the heart of all that is being said here today. Never--I say it again, gentlemen--never forget that Uncle Sam is real. Let us not go off waving the picture and leaving the substance behind. Let us never forget that Uncle Sam had a last name too--and that name was Wilson. Let us never forget that Uncle Sam lived among us and worked among us and, when his time came, died among us. And need I suggest, gentlemen, that his resting place should command the attention and respect of the nation he has come to symbolize. Too long has Uncle Sam Wilson slept, almost unknown and unnoticed, on that grassy hillside overlooking the Hudson River. Of course we in Troy--whose forebears knew and worked with Samuel Wilson--we in Troy are proud of Uncle Sam. We have marked his grave modestly and have done what we could to make him better known. We feel that, in this effort, we have been doing what the American people would want to do, would insist upon doing, if they knew the story as we know it. And now we come, gentlemen, to the halls of Congress to ask you as the representatives of the American people to discharge a debt that is long overdue. Across the nation, we have federal installations of all kinds--among them, navy yards and arsenals and forts and missile bases and atomic testing sites--so many of them grim monuments to the unhappy aspects of our national existence. We have too few monuments to the more inspiring side. We ask you to add another to the roll. We ask that you create, if you will, a Shrine of Americanism at the grave of the man who has become-- after the Stars and Stripes--America's greatest symbol. The military installations are necessary indeed, if only to help us stay alive. But the final, inevitable victory in the great world struggle will be won by the ideals and principles--ideals and principles that are loftier than the highest space shot and more powerful than the most destructive bomb. [[Page E1356]] I feel sure, gentlemen, that we can say without fear of challenge, that America will always be the leader of all nations in armed might, indeed in any field of material or productive ingenuity. Communism, the greatest threat to mankind, leaves no room for sentiment of nostalgia. Sentiment and nostalgia breed individualism. Individualism is a quality of Freedom. Here is where we need our Uncle Sam. Uncle Sam is the breathtaking feeling of pride that goes with the beat of the military band and the marching men. Uncle Sam is the quiver in the lip as the picture of Surabachi flashes before our mind. Uncle Sam is the invisible resident of the tombs of the known and unknown dead in our wars. Gentlemen, I can assure you, we have no selfish interest in our quest for recognition of this great America. We ask only, that you accept from us, this treasure that lies buried in a modest grave in Troy, New York. Recognize it, as it so richly deserves, and give it to all our people. That is the message Uncle Sam has for us today. That is the message that will be reflected at the shrine for Americanism over his grave in Troy, New York. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1355-E1356] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] UNCLE SAM ______ HON.

ships and his legions parading in red square, we can stand before the world and point to our american heritage--to our history and our institutions and our principles. and it seems to me, that the nations of the world and the people of the world, faced with a choice, will know which way to go. when mr. khrushchev shouts, ``look what we got,'' we can reply, ``look what we are.'' and since the cold war is, in great measure, a struggle for men's minds--a war of propaganda, if you will--one of the most important responsibilities we have is to project the american image in every corner of the world. gentleman, we have that image ready-made. it's uncle sam--that kindly, serious, honest old gentleman in his striped suit and tall hat. in the minds of millions here and abroad, he stands for all the virtues and qualities that are wrapped up in the american dream--honor, initiative, industry, opportunity, freedom, respect for the rights of others, and, above all, regard for the dignity of the individual. it's all there in that picture. and it's worth more in the world struggle than all mr. khrushchev's space ships and rockets and nuclear bombs. but here is the point we must not overlook. what makes the image of uncle sam important and vital and compelling, is that uncle sam is real. and the world needs to know he is real. the world must be told that he is not a fictitious, shoddy trademark after the manner of an american advertising campaign. he is no cartoonist's whimsy. he is no madison avenue gimmick. uncle sam really lived. and from what we know of him, he embodied many, if not all of the qualities and virtues, that make us proud of our american heritage. not only is uncle sam a real, flesh-and-blood american, he is particularly representative of the things that have made america great--initiative, industry, business acumen, yankee resourcefulness. going even a step further, when you consider how the term ``uncle sam'' was coined, you find an eloquent representation of the partnership between private enterprise and military effort in one of the most critical moments of our history--the same sort of partnership that made america mighty and respected--yes, and in the councils of the ungodly, feared. we, in america today, know something about how advertising and propaganda works. we know how difficult it is to sell an idea; any intangible idea or concept, until we clothe it in some image people can see and touch. well, the people of the world know uncle sam. and the better they know him, the more they will respect and love him. and in accepting him, they will be embracing all the principles that go to make up the good life. our own people too, need to know uncle sam better. every nation needs its heroes, needs the inspiration and pride that come from a healthy respect for its historical figures. from uncle sam, we all can get a deeper appreciation of the american way. i have just one more point to make and it goes to the heart of all that is being said here today. never--i say it again, gentlemen--never forget that uncle sam is real. let us not go off waving the picture and leaving the substance behind. let us never forget that uncle sam had a last name too--and that name was wilson. let us never forget that uncle sam lived among us and worked among us and, when his time came, died among us. and need i suggest, gentlemen, that his resting place should command the attention and respect of the nation he has come to symbolize. too long has uncle sam wilson slept, almost unknown and unnoticed, on that grassy hillside overlooking the hudson river. of course we in troy--whose forebears knew and worked with samuel wilson--we in troy are proud of uncle sam. we have marked his grave modestly and have done what we could to make him better known. we feel that, in this effort, we have been doing what the american people would want to do, would insist upon doing, if they knew the story as we know it. and now we come, gentlemen, to the halls of congress to ask you as the representatives of the american people to discharge a debt that is long overdue. across the nation, we have federal installations of all kinds--among them, navy yards and arsenals and forts and missile bases and atomic testing sites--so many of them grim monuments to the unhappy aspects of our national existence. we have too few monuments to the more inspiring side. we ask you to add another to the roll. we ask that you create, if you will, a shrine of americanism at the grave of the man who has become-- after the stars and stripes--america's greatest symbol. the military installations are necessary indeed, if only to help us stay alive. but the final, inevitable victory in the great world struggle will be won by the ideals and principles--ideals and principles that are loftier than the highest space shot and more powerful than the most destructive bomb. [[page e1356]] i feel sure, gentlemen, that we can say without fear of challenge, that america will always be the leader of all nations in armed might, indeed in any field of material or productive ingenuity. communism, the greatest threat to mankind, leaves no room for sentiment of nostalgia. sentiment and nostalgia breed individualism. individualism is a quality of freedom. here is where we need our uncle sam. uncle sam is the breathtaking feeling of pride that goes with the beat of the military band and the marching men. uncle sam is the quiver in the lip as the picture of surabachi flashes before our mind. uncle sam is the invisible resident of the tombs of the known and unknown dead in our wars. gentlemen, i can assure you, we have no selfish interest in our quest for recognition of this great america. we ask only, that you accept from us, this treasure that lies buried in a modest grave in troy, new york. recognize it, as it so richly deserves, and give it to all our people. that is the message uncle sam has for us today. that is the message that will be reflected at the shrine for americanism over his grave in troy, new york. ____________________",8668

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize MillerCoors, which is celebrating the 160th anniversary of Miller Brewing Company throughout the month of September at its Milwaukee Brewery in Wisconsin. Miller Brewing has been an important part of the Milwaukee community for 160 years. In honor of its 160th anniversary, the brewery is inviting members of the community to celebrate Miller memories and has been hosting special events throughout the month. After settling in Milwaukee with a special brewer's yeast and an ambition to brew ``confoundedly good beers,'' Frederick J. Miller founded the Miller Brewing Company in 1855. Miller Brewing continues that legacy today through MillerCoors, a family of breweries that includes many of the world's most talented brewmasters who brew beers with high-quality and often local ingredients while holding themselves to the industry's highest standards. Today, MillerCoors and Miller Brewing are vital to Wisconsin's economy and to the U.S. economy as a whole, supporting more than 8,000 jobs nationwide. Frederick Miller knew firsthand the value of civic leadership and sustainable business practices, and these traditions continue today. Miller Brewing and MillerCoors remain deeply rooted in the communities in which they brew and sell beer by supporting local charities, remaining committed to responsible consumption, and working to reduce water and energy usage and waste in the brewing process. I am proud of MillerCoors for their contributions to the economy in Wisconsin and throughout the U.S. Their 160th anniversary is worthy of our special recognition. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 138 (Thursday, September 24, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1356] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING THE 160TH ANNIVERSARY OF MILLER BREWING COMPANY ______ HON.
