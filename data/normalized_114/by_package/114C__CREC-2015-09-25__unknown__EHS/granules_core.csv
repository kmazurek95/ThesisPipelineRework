Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, reflecting on Pope Francis' historic engagement with us here in the House yesterday, he opened with gratefulness for our freedom. We know we have that freedom because of the brave that our respective homelands have blessed us with. He spoke of the responsibility that we, as leaders, are to help grow a nation and the freedom with it. Freedom is essential in that success. Pope Francis said it is for all Americans--not just its representatives in this room and others like it--to help sustain society with action and the service attitude of organizations that are truly helpful for those truly in need. Through faith, not its misuse or extremism, but with humility, with that attitude of service, we are a better people. But it requires religious freedom, a cornerstone of our Nation's founding, indeed, important enough to be articulated and underlined in the First Amendment of our Bill of Rights. With that amendment, it has brought us peace and prosperity and helped the USA to be a beacon of hope and service to the world. Hand in hand with that religious freedom goes the respect of innocent life and preserving the family. As Pope Francis closed his remarks on the legacy for our youth, these ideals of life and family are the spirit we can all endeavor to pass to our youth, their future of a great land filled with freedoms and opportunity, that comes with all of us at that service.

The lead agency may adopt such an environmental document, if it is prepared under State laws and procedures only upon making a favorable determination on such environmental document pursuant to paragraph (2)(A). ``(e) Participating Agencies.-- ``(1) In general.--The lead agency shall be responsible for inviting and designating participating agencies in accordance with this subsection. The lead agency shall provide the invitation or notice of the designation in writing. ``(2) Federal participating agencies.--Any Federal agency that is required to adopt the environmental document of the lead agency for a project shall be designated as a participating agency and shall collaborate on the preparation of the environmental document, unless the Federal agency informs the lead agency, in writing, by a time specified by the lead agency in the designation of the Federal agency that the Federal agency-- ``(A) has no jurisdiction or authority with respect to the project; ``(B) has no expertise or information relevant to the project; and ``(C) does not intend to submit comments on the project. ``(3) Invitation.--The lead agency shall identify, as early as practicable in the environmental review for a project, any agencies other than an agency described in paragraph (2) that may have an interest in the project, including, where appropriate, Governors of affected States, and heads of appropriate tribal and local (including county) governments, and shall invite such identified agencies and officials to become participating agencies in the environmental review for the project. The invitation shall set a deadline of 30 days for responses to be submitted, which may only be extended by the lead agency for good cause shown. Any agency that fails to respond prior to the deadline shall be deemed to have declined the invitation. ``(4) Effect of declining participating agency invitation.--Any agency that declines a designation or invitation by the lead agency to be a participating agency shall be precluded from submitting comments on any document prepared under NEPA for that project or taking any measures to oppose, based on the environmental review, any permit, license, or approval related to that project. ``(5) Effect of designation.--Designation as a participating agency under this subsection does not imply that the participating agency-- ``(A) supports a proposed project; or ``(B) has any jurisdiction over, or special expertise with respect to evaluation of, the project. ``(6) Cooperating agency.--A participating agency may also be designated by a lead agency as a `cooperating agency' under the regulations contained in part 1500 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on January 1, 2011. Designation as a cooperating agency shall have no effect on designation as participating agency. No agency that is not a participating agency may be designated as a cooperating agency. ``(7) Concurrent reviews.--Each Federal agency shall-- ``(A) carry out obligations of the Federal agency under other applicable law concurrently and in conjunction with the review required under NEPA; and ``(B) in accordance with the rules made by the Council on Environmental Quality pursuant to subsection (n)(1), make and carry out such rules, policies, and procedures as may be reasonably necessary to enable the agency to ensure completion of the environmental review and environmental decisionmaking process in a timely, coordinated, and environmentally responsible manner. ``(8) Comments.--Each participating agency shall limit its comments on a project to areas that are within the authority and expertise of such participating agency. Each participating agency shall identify in such comments the statutory authority of the participating agency pertaining to the subject matter of its comments.

[[Page H6234]] ``(B) Only feasible alternatives evaluated.--Where a project is being constructed, managed, funded, or undertaken by a project sponsor that is not a Federal agency, Federal agencies shall only be required to evaluate alternatives that the project sponsor could feasibly undertake, consistent with the purpose of and the need for the project, including alternatives that can be undertaken by the project sponsor and that are technically and economically feasible. ``(3) Methodologies.-- ``(A) In general.--The lead agency shall determine, in collaboration with cooperating agencies at appropriate times during the environmental review, the methodologies to be used and the level of detail required in the analysis of each alternative for a project. The lead agency shall include in the environmental document a description of the methodologies used and how the methodologies were selected. ``(B) No evaluation of inappropriate alternatives.--When a lead agency determines that an alternative does not meet the purpose and need for a project, that alternative is not required to be evaluated in detail in an environmental document. ``(4) Preferred alternative.--At the discretion of the lead agency, the preferred alternative for a project, after being identified, may be developed to a higher level of detail than other alternatives in order to facilitate the development of mitigation measures or concurrent compliance with other applicable laws if the lead agency determines that the development of such higher level of detail will not prevent the lead agency from making an impartial decision as to whether to accept another alternative which is being considered in the environmental review. ``(5) Employment analysis.--The evaluation of each alternative in an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment shall identify the potential effects of the alternative on employment, including potential short- term and long-term employment increases and reductions and shifts in employment. ``(h) Coordination and Scheduling.-- ``(1) Coordination plan.-- ``(A) In general.--The lead agency shall establish and implement a plan for coordinating public and agency participation in and comment on the environmental review for a project or category of projects to facilitate the expeditious resolution of the environmental review. ``(B) Schedule.-- ``(i) In general.--The lead agency shall establish as part of the coordination plan for a project, after consultation with each participating agency and, where applicable, the project sponsor, a schedule for completion of the environmental review. The schedule shall include deadlines, consistent with subsection (i), for decisions under any other Federal laws (including the issuance or denial of a permit or license) relating to the project that is covered by the schedule. ``(ii) Factors for consideration.--In establishing the schedule, the lead agency shall consider factors such as-- ``(I) the responsibilities of participating agencies under applicable laws;

Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, this amendment makes numerous technical and other minor wording changes to the bill. Together, these revisions clarify that the bill does not authorize duplicative agency review proceedings, does not require duplicative project notification and initiation of agency review procedures, and does not allow permitting decisions to be challenged in court by parties who did not first present their arguments in the administrative proceedings that produced the challenged permit. The amendment constitutes an agreement reached between the Judiciary Committee and the other committee of jurisdiction, the Natural Resources Committee. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim time in opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed to the amendment. The CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Arizona? There was no objection. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5 minutes. =========================== NOTE =========================== September 25, 2015, on page H6236, the following appeared: There was no objection. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, the The online version should be corrected to read: There was no objection. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, the ========================= END NOTE ========================= Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, the manager's amendment has been categorized as a technical amendment. We are told the amendment is designed to clarify the bill, which is being sold as the answer to our Nation's economic woes. The bill is supposed to streamline government environmental reviews, and this amendment is supposed to streamline the underlying bill. Unfortunately, the only thing that is being streamlined here are the facts about NEPA. Mr. Chairman, the facts are not in the Republicans' favor. For more than 40 years, NEPA has ensured that federally funded projects are carried out in a transparent and cost-effective manner, while fostering public participation in the decisionmaking process and minimizing impacts to the environment. In fact, NEPA often provides the only forum for citizens to engage in major Federal actions that affect our health, well-being, and the environment. NEPA saves millions of dollars and is a tool for environmental justice. NEPA gave the confederated Salish and Kootenai tribal governments and citizen groups an opportunity to engage in the design of U.S. 93 in western Montana, resulting in a project that successfully addressed safety, environmental, family farming, and cultural concerns. {time} 0915 NEPA's success stories, where the process saves money and improves the quality of life for people impacted by Federal decisions, go on and on. My Republican colleagues tend to streamline these stories so we never get a chance to hear them. Here are some facts my Republican colleagues might have missed during their streamlining: 95 percent of all NEPA analyses are completed through categorical exclusion, which generally requires only a few days. Less than 5 percent of NEPA actions require an environmental assessment, and less than 1 percent require a full EIS. Those projects that do require an EIS tend to be the largest, most complex. The delays that do occur are more likely the result of local opposition, a lack of funding, or changes in the project's scope. Agency data, interviews with agency officials, and available studies show that most NEPA analyses do not result in litigation; yet, the underlying bill seeks to restrict judicial review, and the manager's amendment would create a judicial bar to the courthouse doors before a party could seek judicial review. Typically, there have been fewer than 100 cases per year nationwide in the last decade even though the NEPA review process is applied to tens of thousands of government actions each year and tens of thousands more that are classified as exempt from review based on categorical exclusions. NEPA is not a barrier to development. It is a tool for better decision-making. The only reason to avoid NEPA or to weaken it is so that you can make decisions less carefully. This is the purpose of the legislation. Apparently, the bill itself was not drafted very carefully; so, we have a manager's amendment to fix all the errors. This manager's amendment is just more proof that my Republican colleagues should leave NEPA alone because their understanding of how it works and what it does is, unfortunately, too streamlined. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Lowenthal The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in House Report 114-261. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 14, line 11, insert after the period at the end the following: ``No alternative may be deemed feasible if the alternative does not adequately address risks associated with flooding, wildfire, and climate change.'' The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lowenthal) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. As my fellow Californian Ronald Reagan once said, ``There you go again.'' Attacks on NEPA have become almost a common, weekly occurrence in this Congress, and H.R. 348 is just the latest iteration. We should really call this bill the VAPID Act because it is tired, unimaginative, and a ploy to undermine one of our bedrock environmental laws: NEPA. My amendment would not fix all of this bill's problems, but it certainly would inject some small sense of fiscal responsibility into this legislation that seemingly has been designed for wasting taxpayers' money. Restricting the ability of the public to comment on proposed projects virtually guarantees more lawsuits and more hastily approved projects that [[Page H6237]] could turn into embarrassing boondoggles. Particularly in the face of climate change, we must take special care to ensure that the future value of projects is considered. This means thoroughly evaluating the risks associated with more frequent and intense wildfires as well as flooding caused by stronger storms and higher sea levels. Doing these reviews will not delay projects. As was pointed out by the ranking member, it is a fact that 95 percent of all NEPA analyses are completed through categorical exclusions, which generally require only a few days to process. Less than 5 percent require an environmental assessment, and less than 1 percent require a full environmental impact statement, or an EIS. Those projects that do require an EIS tend to be the largest and most complex, and delays that do occur are more likely the result of local opposition, a lack of funding, or changes in the project's scope, not due to NEPA. Making sure that roads aren't wiped out by a future storm surge or that activities in our national forests don't spark fires or that government-financed and -permitted actions are resilient to climate change is the least we can do to protect taxpayers and the environment. To do this, we need to keep NEPA strong, not weaken it by making government actions less transparent. The current NEPA process allows for the full consideration of the costs and the benefits of proposed actions and leads to environmentally and economically sound outcomes. I urge a ``yea'' vote on my amendment because the threats associated with climate change and related natural hazards are too great for this House to continue to ignore. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, by its terms, the amendment brands infeasible--and, thus, barred from further evaluation--project alternatives that do not appear at the outset of the review process to adequately address risks associated with flooding, wildfire, and climate change. With all due respect, that puts the cart before the horse. The bill is intended to allow the review of alternatives that are technically and economically feasible. It is entirely possible that, during the course of review, a technically and economically feasible alternative that appears initially to be inadequate to address these risks could, on further review, be found to be adequate or to be improved to be adequate. It might even ultimately be found to be the best alternative under review. Why should we prematurely end the evaluation of alternatives that could ultimately prove adequate with regard to these types of risks? This does not prevent the review process. What it does prevent is someone waiting to get in at the last moment, which has been 5 or 6 years later, to jam the system up in court, therefore crushing jobs and letting regulation run rampant. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I just want to comment that risks due to flooding, to stronger storms, to climate change are not putting the cart before the horse. I am simply asking that we don't waste taxpayers' money by not considering these risks. This is a fiscally sound amendment, and I urge an ``aye'' vote. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Lowenthal). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed. Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Grijalva The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in House Report 114-261. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 15, after line 21, insert the following: ``(6) Low-income and communities of color analysis.--The evaluation of each alternative in an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment shall identify the potential effects of the alternative on low-income communities and communities of color.''. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, is a 45-year-old law which stands, basically, for two things: that the Federal Government should consider alternatives before taking action that can impact people's lives and that the public should have the opportunity to comment on those alternatives before a final decision is made. House Republicans oppose both of these simple principles and so they attack NEPA time after time, year after year. The bill before us today is just a rerun of those attacks. My amendment, unfortunately, cannot fix this bill. In fact, my amendment is really just proof of what is so dangerous about the RAPID Act. Among the critical issues that can be addressed through our existing NEPA process is ensuring environmental justice. Bills like the one we are considering today seek to short-circuit that process; so, they seek to short-circuit environmental justice concerns. My amendment would put environmental justice considerations back in the process created by this legislation; but we would not even need this amendment if Republicans would just leave NEPA alone. Twenty-one years ago President Bill Clinton issued his executive order on environmental justice. After decades of hard work, struggle, some victories along the way, the promise of environmental justice for all communities remains unfulfilled. While environmental toxins and pollution know no class or race, low- income communities and communities of color bear a disproportionate share of adverse environmental consequences. Low-income communities and communities of color are routinely targeted to host facilities that have negative environmental impacts, such as landfills, refineries, chemical plants, freeways, and ports. Seventy-eight percent of African Americans live within 30 miles of a coal-fired power plant. Nearly one out of every two Latinos lives in the country's top 25 most ozone-polluted cities. For decades, these communities have been battling environmental injustices and have been seeking to build healthy, livable, and sustainable communities. NEPA recognizes that, when the public and Federal experts work together, better decisions are made. We have not solved the problem yet, but the solution is a more inclusive, more rigorous use of the NEPA process, not these constant, industry-friendly attacks on the law. Every person has the right to live, work, and play in a healthy and safe environment; yet, too often, the health of too many Americans is determined by their race, class, ZIP code, and street address. It is unfortunate and inefficient to have to come down here to protect these issues one by one for each and every Republican bill that is presented. The adoption of my amendment would keep H.R. 348 from destroying the progress we have made on issues for communities of color, but it doesn't solve the problem. A far better approach would be to drop H.R. 348 and to instead invest in making NEPA stronger and more inclusive than ever. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. [[Page H6238]] There was no objection. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, among those who suffer most unfairly from poor government decision-making are the communities the gentleman's amendment addresses. For example, growing research shows that the costs of new regulations often have regressive effects on those with lower incomes. When poor government decision-making occurs in the permit review process, similar unfair effects may occur. The gentleman's amendment guards against this by requiring agencies to identify and reveal the potential adverse effects of project alternatives on low-income communities and communities of color. Once identified and revealed, of course, any such effects may be avoided, minimized, or mitigated. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will be postponed. {time} 0930 Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Gallego The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in House Report 114-261. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Chair, I rise to offer an amendment. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 21, line 12, strike ``or''. Page 21, line 14, strike the period at the end and insert ``; or''. Page 21, after line 14, insert the following: ``(iii) a deadline extension is requested by an elected official of a State or locality, or a local tribal official.''. Page 22, line 8, strike ``or''.

Page 24, line 14, insert after ``cause,'' the following: ``, or the deadline was extended pursuant to the request of an elected official of a State or locality, or a local tribal official,''. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gallego) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer a commonsense amendment to the RAPID Act, a misguided bill that will disempower local leaders, including tribal leaders, and threaten the health and safety of our communities and their communities. As a member of the Natural Resources Committee, time and time again I have witnessed the Republican majority siding with big business and gutting bedrock environmental safeguards that for decades have protected our families and our natural heritage. My Republican friends claim that this bill is intended to protect the interest of our States and Native American tribes. Mr. Chair, we already have a law on the books for that purpose. It is called the National Environmental Policy Act, NEPA, and it works. At its heart, NEPA ensures that our government is accountable to the people. This critical law has protected the environment for more than 40 years without imposing arbitrary deadlines or limiting vital public input. It guarantees the public an opportunity to review and comment on actions proposed by the government, enabling important perspectives that would otherwise go unnoticed. In this way, NEPA can actually serve as a check on Big Government. Unfortunately, the RAPID Act promises the opposite, a deeply flawed process that would diminish the voice of State, local, and tribal communities. The RAPID Act will also establish a new regulatory framework that purposely overrides the NEPA review process, limiting public input and consequently undermining the quality and integrity of Federal agency decisions. Among its many dangerous provisions, the bill will also trigger the automatic approval of construction projects if agencies miss arbitrary deadlines, regardless of the complexity or hazard posed by such potential projects. Though the bill includes some extremely limited and narrow exceptions for these deadlines, as it is currently written, it fails to extend those deadlines for our local communities. My amendment would simply create a new good cause exception that would allow a deadline to be extended if a request is made from a local- or State-elected official or a local tribal leader. While my amendment does not fix all the problems in the underlying bill, it ensures that, if this bill should pass, our local and tribal leaders will continue to be empowered, as they are currently under NEPA. I support the goal of reducing red tape, but stripping away the ability of our local communities to have their voices heard is undemocratic and unacceptable. Mr. Chair, special interests don't need us to fight for them. Our communities do. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and to stand with our local and tribal leaders when it comes to projects in their own back yards that impact their homes, families, and business. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would allow agencies to escape the bill's streamlined permitting deadlines simply because an elected State or local official or a local tribal official asks for an extension. The amendment contains no requirement that a Federal agency find the compelling basis for an extension or even a significant basis or even any substantive basis at all. On the contrary, all that a recalcitrant Federal agency, a project opponent, or anyone else would need to defeat an efficient permitting decision is to find an elected State or local official or a local tribal official willing to put in an extension request for them. The potential for abuse of this proposed provision by those who only seek delay for delay's sake or who seek to kill worthy projects outright is obvious. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gallego). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will be postponed. Amendment No. 5 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in House Report 114-261. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 24, strike line 19 and all that follows through page 25, line 12. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I hope that we will find common ground on really responding to a great concern that I think all Americans should be concerned about. Although this bill is called the RAPID Act, were it to become law, in the present form, a permit or license for a project would be deemed approved if the reviewing agency does not issue the requested permit or license within 90 to 120 days. That is a short period of [[Page H6239]] time for complex regulatory structures that deal with complex industries. An industry that I represent in Houston, Texas, the energy industry, has complex needs and, as well, complex impacts and consequences if we do not deal with the agencies responsible, if the DOE, for example, does not do its due diligence. Now, let me say this, Mr. Chairman. These particular permits are done sooner than 90 to 120 days. But what this bill says is, if the agency is engaged in a very complex deliberative thought process, then, if they reach that deadline and they still have not finished, they are then, if you will, throwing to the side all of the safety issues and issues dealing with the protection of the American people under the bus. My amendment strikes the provision, deeming approved any project for which an agency does not meet the deadlines contained in the bill. I can appreciate some of the frustrations through the review process by the National Environmental Policy Act, but the cure is not this bill. If a Federal agency has failed to approve or disapprove a project or make the required finding, we are in trouble. Babies are in trouble with formula. Senior citizens are in trouble with various pharmaceuticals. They are in trouble. And then, if we run up against the deadline, there is no response. Second, frequently there are times when it is the case that the complexity of the issues, as I said, warrant us to do so. In other words, what this bill is saying is: To heck with reason and good judgment. We do not care. To heck with protecting the American people. We do not care. As I listened intently and intensely to the Pope's words yesterday, I offer this quote: Moses provided us with a good synthesis of your work. You are asked to protect--and speaking to us--by means of the law, the image, and likeness fashioned by God on every human face. This bill smacks in the face of that instruction. I believe that this amendment is worthy of passing. Mr. Chair, if H.R. 348, the so-called RAPID Act, were to become law in its present form, a permit or license for project would be ``deemed'' approved if the reviewing agency does not issue the requested permit or license within 90-120 days. My amendment strikes the provision deeming approved any project for which agency does not meet deadlines contained in the bill. Mr. Chairman, I can appreciate some of the frustrations expressed by many of our friends across the aisle when it comes to review process mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). But the cure they propose in H.R. 348 is an example of a medicine that is worse than the disease. Under H.R. 348, if a federal agency fails to approve or disapprove the project or make the required finding of the termination within the applicable deadline, which is either 90 days or 120 days, depending on the situation, then the project is automatically deemed approved by such agency. This creates a set of unintended consequences. First, as an agency is up against that deadline and legitimate work is yet to be completed, it is likely to disapprove the project simply because the issues have not been vetted. Second, frequently there are times when it is the case that the complexity of issues that need to be resolved necessitates a longer review period, rather than an arbitrary limit. So if H.R. 348 were to become law the most likely outcome is that federal agencies would be required to make decisions based on incomplete information, or information that may not be available within the stringent deadlines, and to deny applications that otherwise would have been approved, but for lack of sufficient review time. In other words, fewer projects would be approved, not more. Mr. Chairman, H.R. 348 ostensibly seeks to make a minor procedure adjustment to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). In reality, however, H.R. 348 would radically transform the NEPA review process, and not for the better either. For more than 40 years, NEPA has been the law of the land and has provided a remarkably effective framework for all types of projects (not just construction projects) that require federal approval pursuant to a federal law, such as the Clean Air Act. For these reasons, I urge all Members to support the Jackson Lee Amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, the American people desperately need new jobs. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, America's labor force participation rate remains mired among historic lows. Almost 94 million Americans who could work are outside the workforce. That is more than the population of all but 12 of the world's countries and more than every other country in the Western Hemisphere, except for Brazil and Mexico. We face this historically low rate not because Americans don't want to work, but because so many Americans have despaired of any hope of finding a new full-time job and have abandoned the workforce. The RAPID Act offers strong help to reverse this tragedy, restore the hope, and produce millions of new jobs. We must pass the bill, not weaken it, to provide these new high-wage jobs. The gentlewoman's amendment would weaken the bill in one of the worst possible ways. It would remove the clear consequences in the bill for agencies that refuse to follow the bill's deadlines. That consequence is to deem permits approved if agencies refuse to approve or deny them within those deadlines. Mr. Chairman, the bill provides 4\1/2\ years for agencies to complete their environmental reviews for new permit applications and reasonable and additional time for agencies to wrap up final permit approvals or denials after that; 4\1/2\ years is more time than it took the United States to fight and win World War II. If agencies can't wrap up their environmental reviews in that much time and then meet the bill's remaining deadlines, there is something terribly wrong with the agencies. The prospect of facing a default approval at the end of the substantial time the bill grants is an eminently reasonable way to assure that agencies will conduct full reviews and wrap their work up in time to make up or down decisions on their own. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. I reserve the balance of my time Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I am so glad my colleague mentioned the question of jobs. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 2 minutes remaining. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I am very glad my colleague mentioned jobs because none of us here are fighting against jobs. In fact, I happen to be supporting the full employment legislation that my good friend, Congressman John Conyers, has offered and I have joined. We are not here speaking against jobs. We are speaking for the American people. We are trying to explain the complexity of the permitting process. Whether it is for drilling, whether it is to deal with construction, whether it is to deal with complex environmental issues that have to be addressed impacting the American people or, for example, whether it is dealing with the Volkswagen company that saw fit to do the technology to undermine viable rules that the American automobile industry was complying with, definitely impacting jobs, I would have hoped that we would have had a process of permitting or a process of determining whether the Volkswagen company was violating these rules that were here to help the issue of pollution and other issues here, but also undermining the jobs of our own American companies. Let me say that the Jackson Lee amendment, in essence, is to suggest that there is a lot of complexity that my friends on the other side of the aisle with the RAPID Act--the very name of it suggests that we are throwing judgment to the wind. All we want to do is to move forward, even if they are ill. And we don't want the taxpayer dollars that have asked these workers in these agencies who have the expertise from the DOE, to the FDA and beyond-- Food and Drug Administration, Department of Energy--to protect us. I believe, Mr. Chairman, that my amendment, by eliminating the 90 to 120, deeming it approved in the midst [[Page H6240]] of a crisis when it is not fit to be approved, is an amendment that this body should pass. I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment because I am here to protect the American people and to do justly, as has been given to us in a wonderful message yesterday by Pope Francis. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining? The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 2\1/2\ minutes remaining. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chair, I want to just give a couple of examples of the timing factor that we are seeing that the agencies just are not executing properly. Cape Wind Project: For more than 12 years--12 years--they were waiting for permits to build an operation that would create jobs and renewable energy. 12 years. Orange County toll road in Orange County, California: There was a 12- year delay there as well. The project was extended tens of millions of dollars because of the delay there, and jobs were lost because of that. Charleston Harbor, Savannah Port dredging project: Again, there was a decade of delays in permitting because agencies are just sitting around, not taking the job responsibly. They never would survive in private industry if they operated under those conditions. So those are a few examples of the cost in dollars and cents and the jobs that are lost because of these agencies not performing their responsibilities. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas will be postponed. {time} 0945 Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mrs. Dingell The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in House Report 114-261. Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 25, line 4, insert before the period at the end the following: ``, unless the project would limit access to or opportunities for hunting or fishing, or impact a species listed as an endangered species or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.)''. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Michigan. Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA as we frequently shorthand it, is one of our bedrock conservation laws, and it has a simple premise: look before you leap. Its timelines are designed to provide transparency and public participation in government. H.R. 348 would move us in the opposite direction. My amendment would not fix all of the problems with this bill, but it would allow hunters, anglers, and wildlife enthusiasts to continue to enjoy the benefits that NEPA provides. Several recent stories help explain the benefits of NEPA, including the following: Recently, a plan to improve U.S. 23 in my home State of Michigan was modified to avoid the largest loss of wetlands in our State's history. Not only will this help improve the biodiversity of the region, but it will also preserve that habitat for migratory waterfowl prized by hunters. This land could have been lost and hunters would have had their access reduced if not for the robust comment process that NEPA provides. There are similar stories across the country. In 2013, changes to the Army Corps of Engineers' plan to increase storage capacity at the John Redmond Reservoir in Kansas were needed to protect prime deer and turkey hunting areas, as well as avoid the destruction of a local boat ramp providing fishermen access to the lake. In 2004, sportsmen's groups from across the country banded together during the NEPA review process and caused BLM to withdraw a proposal to allow oil and gas drilling along the Rocky Mountain Front in Montana. The list goes on and on, but the point is that none of these positive outcomes would have been achieved without a strong NEPA process that encourages public participation instead of limiting it. Furthermore, the habitats utilized by game and sports fishermen are the same as those utilized by endangered fish, wildlife, and plants. Destroying one destroys the other, which is why NEPA must allow for a thorough review of potential impacts to listed species. My amendment would ensure these protections will be preserved so hunters, fishermen, and American wildlife will continue to benefit from them. There is absolutely no legitimate reason to limit public oversight of taxpayer-funded projects. NEPA shines a light on proposed government actions and helps local citizens provide new information and ideas, improve projects, and ensure sustainable decisionmaking. It helps Federal authorities consider a range of alternatives, often resulting in lower costs to the public, something I am sure everyone here supports. NEPA is a quintessentially American, quintessentially small- government law. It reinforces the rights of people to hold their government accountable. A host of environmental groups have endorsed my amendment, but I am particularly pleased to have the support of Trout Unlimited, because my amendment would help protect the rights of anglers. If you hunt, you fish or have constituents who do, you should support a strong NEPA and vote for my amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, one of the linchpins of the RAPID Act is its set of provisions that: deem a permit approved if the permitting agency refuses to meet the bill's reasonable deadlines; and, prohibit a court from overturning a permit approval simply because the permit was deemed approved when deadlines expired before action was taken. If we do not include consequences like these in the bill, how will we ever ensure that recalcitrant, foot-dragging Federal agencies will achieve the bill's goal of streamlined permit decisions? The amendment, however, removes all consequences for agencies' foot- dragging so long as the projects at issue would either limit access to or opportunities for hunting or fishing or impact an endangered or threatened species. That is in the bill. The amendment's sponsor offers no sound reason to do this. The bill does not require projects with these kinds of impacts to be approved. It just requires that permitting decisions, up or down, be reached after, at most, 4\1/2\ years of environmental review. Surely that is enough time to review all kinds of projects, including those that limit access to or opportunities for hunting or fishing or impact endangered or threatened species. To make matters worse, the bill would allow agencies to drag their feet without consequences even if a project had a beneficial impact on an endangered or threatened species. Why should we allow delay for that? I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I want to quickly respond to the comments made by my colleague on the other side of the aisle. We often hear that NEPA is a scapegoat for projects being delayed, but as the GAO and others have found, outside issues, including the complexity of the project, local opposition and, most importantly, funding issues are almost always the cause of delays. If we adequately funded highway and infrastructure projects, we wouldn't be seeing so many delays the majority is [[Page H6241]] so concerned with. NEPA is a convenient excuse, but the facts simply don't support the claim that it is the root cause of projects being delayed. We should not be limiting the public's ability to comment on government decisions; but, instead, we should be enhancing them. This bill does the opposite. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and oppose the underlying bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, my colleague forgets to mention the fact that the lead Federal agency in this is responsible for maintaining a schedule, just like we do in private industry, just like we do in our own homes. That agency is responsible for going to the States and to the locals and other Federal agencies to make sure things are being done. Unfortunately, here in D.C., and sometimes at the State level, the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing, and this is making agencies responsible for that. It is just common sense. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Michigan will be postponed. Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Peters The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 printed in House Report 114-261. Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 27, strike line 11 and all that follows through page 28, line 4, and redesignate provisions accordingly. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentleman from California (Mr. Peters) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, before I entered public service, I practiced environmental law for 15 years in large firms, in a government office, and in my own firm. Through that experience, I learned firsthand of the frustration that many businesses and local governments face when they try to navigate overly complex and underly responsive permit processes. I also know from experience that time is money, and often a business seeking a permit is paying dearly to hold a property or to service a loan while it waits for that permit to be issued. That is why I have often said that for applicants, ``no'' is the second best answer. Tell us ``no'' or tell us how, but don't string us along. That is why I appreciate the spirit of the RAPID Act. I don't think it is the perfect answer. Frankly, I don't think it will become law. I am working on some other streamlining strategies that I think are superior and might have the bipartisan support that both would get them through this Chamber and the Senate and get them signed into law by President Obama. As I told my colleagues on the Committee on the Judiciary, I will vote for the RAPID Act if Congress adopts my amendment and does not pass restrictions on considering the role of greenhouse gasses and climate change on our environment. My amendment would simply eliminate subsection (k) of the bill, a section that explicitly prohibits any consideration of the social cost of carbon. For too long we have heard that we have to choose between a prosperous economy and a clean environment. San Diegans and people around the country know that is a false choice. We can and we must provide economic opportunity and clean air and clean water for future generations. That means providing businesses and communities with regulatory certainty to help them plan and invest in the future, and it also means that we use this streamlined process, with tight and reliable deadlines, to analyze the economic, environmental, and social costs of carbon dioxide emissions. As highlighted in former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg's bipartisan Risky Business report, accounting for the social cost of carbon and preparing for climate change is just smart business practice. The costs of carbon include financial losses from sea level rise. If we continue on our current path of carbon emissions, by 2050, between 66 and 106 billion dollars worth of existing coastal property will likely be below sea level nationwide. Eighty-seven percent of all Californians live in coastal counties, and 80 percent of the State's GDP is derived from those counties. Climate affects energy supply costs. Greenhouse gas-driven changes in temperature, catalyzed by burning fossil fuels, would require us to build new power generation facilities to help cool homes and businesses that Risky Business estimates will cost residential and commercial ratepayers as much as $12 billion a year. That is $12 billion that could be used by families to put their kids through school or buy a home, or by businesses to hire more employees. Climate affects the cost of national defense. In 2014, the Pentagon issued a report on the security risks associated with profound changes to global climate and the environment. The report found that climate change poses an immediate threat to national security. That will put additional upward pressure on our already-stressed defense budget. Climate affects agriculture, water supply, fire preparedness. In California, the largest agriculture producing State in the country, we are in the fourth year of what has been one of the worst droughts in recorded history. Communities across the State are facing water shortages. Dry conditions have extended our fire season to be nearly a year-round concern. Given the stakes associated with carbon emissions on coastal property, energy, defense, our food supply, fires, and our quality of life, shouldn't we at least understand the long-term costs associated with the project? This bill could hold the line on responsiveness and provide long-term certainty to businesses without burying our collective heads in the sand on the costs of carbon, one of the main environmental impacts this environmental law must confront. By stripping out subsection (k) and allowing us to consider the real costs of carbon on our economy, my amendment rejects the false choice between a prosperous economy and a healthy climate. We can and we must have both. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, the amendment seeks to strike the bill's prohibition against agency use in permitting reviews of the Obama administration's pronouncements on the social costs of carbon, but this prohibition was adopted last term for a very good reason. The administration's social cost of carbon estimate is junk science. To be specific, multiple commentators on the administration's findings about the social cost of carbon argue that carbon's social cost is an unknown quantity, that social cost of carbon analysts can get just about any result they desire by fiddling with nonvalidated climate parameters, made-up damage functions, and below-market discount rates, and that social cost of carbon analysis is computer-aided sophistry, its political function being to make renewable energy look like a bargain at any price and fossil energy look unaffordable, no matter how cheap. Junk science and sophistry has no place standing between hard-working Americans and new, high-paying jobs. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 30 seconds remaining. [[Page H6242]] Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I have two responses. One, this is not President Obama's agenda. This is the agenda of a bipartisan report, Risky Business, the Department of Defense, and a number of other people who have recognized this is a real problem we have to confront. Second, I would say to the gentleman: Let the science work itself out through the process. There is plenty of science that is questioned in the NEPA process. There is no other point at which this body has prevented a discussion of any content except here. Let the process work it out. I will be with you on your timelines. We will get businesses the certainty that they deserve. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. {time} 1000 Mr. MARINO. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith). Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania and fellow member of the Judiciary Committee for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment. The social cost of carbon is a flawed concept that should play no role in the environmental decisionmaking process. It is based on speculative formulas and has no basis in reality. Formulas can easily be manipulated to support any costly regulation. The social cost of carbon is a political tool the Obama administration uses to impose its extreme agenda on the American people. It is also another way that the administration tries to use secret science and data to justify questionable rulemaking. Speculating on the social cost of carbon should be restricted, not expanded. For these reasons, an agency should not use the social cost of carbon in its environmental review or in its environmental decisionmaking process. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Peters). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed. Amendment No. 8 Offered by Mr. Gosar The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 printed in House Report 114-261. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 28, line 1, insert after ``substantially related document,'' the following: ``the draft guidance entitled: `Revised Draft Guidance for Federal Departments and Agencies on Consideration of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the Effects of Climate change in NEPA Reviews' (79 Fed. Reg. 77801), or any successor thereto or substantially related document,''. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer a commonsense amendment that will protect American jobs and our economy by prohibiting Federal agencies from being forced to follow job-killing and unlawful draft guidance that sneakily seeks to implement Federal policies that pave the way for cap-and-trade-like mandates. Congress and the American people have repeatedly rejected cap-and- trade proposals pushed by this President and his Big Government allies. Knowing he can't lawfully enact a carbon dioxide tax plan, President Obama has chosen to circumvent Congress and is now seeking to address climate change by playing loose and getting creative with the Clean Air Act as well as through an unlawful guidance issued in December 2014. The underlying bill already prohibits Federal agencies from utilizing the social cost of carbon valuation. Furthermore, the social cost of carbon valuation was rejected four times by this very body last Congress. My simple, clarifying amendment adds to the Obama administration's revised draft guidance for greenhouse gas emissions and the effects of climate change that were issued by the White House in December 2014 to the definition for social cost of carbon in the bill. This straightforward amendment is common sense, as this deeply flawed guidance instructs agencies to include a controversial measurement of the social cost of carbon into their analyses and is the Obama administration's latest tool for attempting to implement this terrible new model that has consistently been rejected by the House. Roger Martella, a self-described lifelong environmentalist and career environmental lawyer, testified at the May 2015 House Natural Resources Committee hearing on the revised guidance and the flaws associated with the social cost of carbon model, stating: The `` `social cost of carbon' estimates suffer from a number of significant flaws that should exclude them from the NEPA process. ``First, projected costs of carbon emissions can be manipulated by changing key parameters such as timeframes, discount rates, and other values that have no relation to a given project undergoing review. As a result, applying social cost of carbon estimates can be used to promote pre-determined policy preferences rather than provide for a fair and objective evaluation of a specific proposed federal action. ``Second, OMB and the other federal agencies developed the draft Social Cost of Carbon estimates without any known peer review or opportunity for public comment during the development process. This process is antithetical to NEPA's central premise that informed agency decision making must be based on transparency and open dialogue with the public. ``Third, OMB's draft Social Cost of Carbon estimates are based primarily on global rather than domestic costs and benefits. This is particularly problematic for NEPA reviews because the Courts have established that agencies cannot consider transnational impacts in NEPA reviews. ``Fourth, there is still considerable uncertainty in many of the assumptions and data elements used to create the draft Social Cost of Carbon estimates, such as the damage functions and modeled time horizons. In light of the lack of transparency in the OMB's process, these concerns over accuracy are particularly problematic.'' Mr. Martella's testimony was spot on. Congress, not Washington bureaucrats at the behest of the President, should dictate our country's climate change policy. These sweeping new changes that are seeking to be implemented by the White House did not go through the normal regulatory process, and there was no public comment. Furthermore, the Obama administration has refused to answer pivotal questions about this guidance and even failed to send a witness to a May 2015 hearing on this matter. While the Obama administration acknowledged the draft guidance is not legally enforceable, you best believe that Federal agencies that received the 31-page revised guidance will treat this document like it was signed into law by the President. Unfortunately, this administration just doesn't get it and continues to try to circumvent Congress to impose an extremist agenda that is not based on the best available science. Worse yet, the model utilized to predict the social cost of carbon can easily be manipulated to arrive at any desired outcome. The House has rejected the social cost of carbon numerous times. I ask all those to join me once again in rejecting this flawed proposal and protecting jobs right here in America. I commend the chairman and the committee for their efforts on this legislation and for recognizing that the NEPA process is in desperate need of reform. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Michigan is recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Gosar amendment [[Page H6243]] because it would weaken a critical part of the National Environmental Policy Act. The Council on Environmental Quality recently issued draft guidance under NEPA detailing how Federal agencies should consider the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. This NEPA guidance is a commonsense and perfectly legal step toward reducing the Federal Government's contribution and vulnerability to global warming. It is smart planning that accounts for risk and will save taxpayers money, something I am sure that everyone here can support. Furthermore, the guidance will only increase NEPA's effectiveness as a tool for environmental justice, helping communities that cannot afford expensive lobbyists to protect their homes and values. Climate change is hitting low-income communities and communities of color the hardest. Instead of blocking progress, we should congratulate President Obama and CEQ on issuing this incredibly important and long overdue draft guidance to Federal agencies and urge them to issue a final version as soon as possible. And, for the record, my understanding is CEQ did have a witness at the hearing that was just referred to. This guidance makes clear that Federal agencies must factor greenhouse gas emissions and climate change into their decisions and will produce better, more informed and more efficient outcomes. Efforts to convince the American people we have nothing to do with climate change--or, as Pope Francis said in words the American people understood yesterday: air pollution--will not slow the pace of actual climate change, and it will harm our economy, public health, and national security. That is why this is a bad amendment. We urge you to vote against it. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOSAR. I yield myself the balance of my time. The Earth's climate has been changing since the beginning of time, and that is something that we can all agree on. MIT researchers recently reported that there was a massive extinction some 252 million years ago that coincided with a massive buildup of carbon dioxide. While the cause of the massive buildup is unknown, it is safe to say that man did not exist and he still can't explain it. You can take all the carbon-producing applications, whether it be oil, coal, or volcanic action, and they still can't get the models to predict. So we are leading the blind with the blind. I ask for all Members to vote for this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. DINGELL. I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, I would like to read an excerpt from Pope Francis' address to us yesterday that really stood out to me: ``I call for a courageous and responsible effort to redirect our steps, and to avert the most serious effects of the environmental deterioration caused by human activity. I am convinced that we can make a difference, and I have no doubt that the United States--and this Congress--have an important role to play.'' I take that call by our Pope very seriously. There are even reports today that China is going to announce a cap-and-trade program. By considering this bill and this amendment, Congress is not playing a constructive role. I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Gosar amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chair, I support the amendment. It is bad enough that agencies already take too much time to conclude construction permit reviews. It is even worse for them to draw out the process on the basis of junk science. And that is precisely what the Obama administration's pronouncements on the ``social sost of carbon'' appear to be. The Obama administration's current ``social cost of carbon'' estimate is plagued by defects including the lack of full scientific peer review, robust public comment, and full compliance with federal requirements for influential scientific assessments. Subsection (K) of the bill prohibits the use of the administration's ``technical update of the social cost of carbon for regulatory impact analysis under Executive Order No. 12866,'' as well as successors to it. The gentleman's amendment makes crystal clear that agencies also may not rely on administration ``guidance'' documents intended to facilitate agencies' use of the prohibited technical document. I urge my colleagues to suport the amendment. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will be postponed. Amendment No. 9 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 printed in House Report 114-261. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 31, beginning on line 4, strike ``subsection (p)'' and insert ``subsections (q) and (r)''. Page 31, line 17, insert after ``141).'' the following: ``(r) Exception for Certain Projects.--This subchapter does not apply in the case of any project that could be a potential target for a terrorist attack or that involves chemical facilities and other critical infrastructure.''. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, although we have been debating for a long period of time, let me say to my colleagues to remind them--and I see my good friend, Chairman Goodlatte, on the floor--that this legislation amends the National Environmental Policy Act with good intentions. However, what this bill will do is actually strip out critical input from Federal, State, local agencies, and the public, jeopardizing both the environment and public safety--let me repeat that--jeopardizing the American people, environment, and public safety. The bill sets new, tight deadlines for environmental review, permitting, and licensing decisions and simply, as I said earlier, throws wisdom and good judgment to the wind. I serve as a senior member on the Homeland Security Committee. And so I rise today with my amendment that improves the bill and helps to protect the homeland by carving a limiting exception for construction projects that could be potential targets for terrorist acts, such as chemical facilities, nuclear power plants, and other critical infrastructure. Let me offer the comments of the Congressional Budget Office. They have no basis for estimating the number of construction projects that could be expedited or the savings that would be realized in this bill. Of course, those who support it use that as their main Rock of Gibraltar, if you will, their main point of argument that this is a good bill. A good bill in the face of terrorism? Director Comey has indicated that he has determined that there are ongoing investigations of suspected terrorist cells operating in all 50 States. Yet, we want to expedite this process when it is determining issues dealing with our national security to a certain extent. This issue deals with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit said shall account for the potential environmental impacts of acts of terrorism in its environmental review process. {time} 1015 Are you going to rush them along? The NRC has also imposed stringent antiterrorism requirements on its licenses through 10 CFR section 73, which outlines security requirements for the physical protection of nuclear plants and materials. The Jackson Lee amendment covers nuclear power plants and, as well, chemical facilities to not rush the process to protect the American people. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. [[Page H6244]] Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. This amendment denies the benefit of the bill's permit streamlining provisions to any and all projects that could be terrorist targets or involve chemical facilities or other critical infrastructure. That includes projects that would help to protect those infrastructures and facilities from terrorist attacks or other adversities. Why would we want to delay permitting decisions on projects that would help to protect us? The bill, moreover, already provides up to 4\1/2\ years for agencies to complete their environmental reviews for new permit applications and reasonable additional time for agencies to wrap up final permit approvals or denials after that. As I have said before, if agencies can't wrap up their environmental reviews in that much time and then meet the bill's remaining deadlines, there is something terribly wrong with those agencies. Mr. Chairman, new projects, whether they be infrastructure projects that make a dam stronger or make a highway safer or make a nuclear facility less vulnerable to attack, are all important things to do, and we should do them with expedition, not take longer rather than shorter to get them done, because all the time that we are spinning our wheels with the permitting process that can take 20 years or more, we are more vulnerable during that time. Almost all new infrastructure projects are better than what they are replacing, and that should be our guiding principle. Get these things done expeditiously. It will make us safer. It will make us a better economy. It will create more jobs. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, how much time do we have remaining? The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 2\1/2\ minutes remaining. The gentleman from Virginia has 3 minutes remaining. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, quite the contrary to my good friend from Virginia, what this amendment does is protects the process of the NRC to fully review the potential impacts of terrorism on Federal construction projects involving nuclear facilities and chemical facilities as well. In addition, I think when we hear the names Chernobyl, Fukushima, and Three Mile Island, we understand the vast and devastating impact of such an incident that may be caused or driven by terrorism. I would not want to limit the NRC, which has been given court authority by law to investigate and provide an investigation, thorough investigation, on the impact on chemical and nuclear plants, and we have it restricted. It takes more than 4 years to build a nuclear facility. So are you suggesting that the facility, then, can go on and be built for 10, 20 years, and we shut off the NEPA that has the responsibilities for the American people? I don't think that is appropriate. Mr. Chairman, let me suggest that the American people from the Alaska Wilderness League, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Western Environmental Law Center are against this bill. I will place this into the Record. Mr. Chairman, the Executive Office of the President, Council on Environmental Quality is opposed to this bill, and I will insert this into the Record. I just want to mention that, of course, the President has issued a veto threat. Where this bill is going, I do not know. But the main thing I would like to say to my colleagues is: Can't we stand together united around the question of national security? My amendment specifically indicates that this issue of terrorism should be a simple carve-out, and I would ask you to do so. Let me also bring in the comments of the Pope as indicated yesterday: If politics must truly be at the service of the human person, it follows that it cannot be a slave to the economy and finance. Politics is, instead, an expression of our compelling need to live as one in order to build, as one, the greatest common good: that of a community which sacrifices particular interests in order to share, in justice and peace, its goods, its interests, and its social life. The interest of the American people is to accept the Jackson Lee amendment--to carve out an exception in this bill that is opposed by the President and all other aspects of goodwill people here dealing with the environment--to deal with this issue. Might I remind you, Mr. Chairman, of the Volkswagen scandal. If a more robust process had been in mind, 11 million owners of Volkswagens--and 400,000 in the United States--might be in a better place. This is a good amendment dealing with the safety and security of the American people. I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk; it is listed in the Rule as Jackson Lee 9. Many of us wear a number of hats with dual committee assignments; I am a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee and the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations. This perspective and these responsibilities have given me a special appreciation for the difficult and challenging times we live in and the importance of not taking precipitous actions that could put the security of our homeland at risk. Mr. Chair, if H.R. 348, the so-called RAPID Act, were to become law in its present form, a permit or license for project would be ``deemed'' approved if the reviewing agency does not issue the requested permit or license within 90-120 days. The Jackson Lee Amendment improves the bill and helps to protect the homeland by carving a limited exception for construction projects that could be potential targets for terrorist attacks such as chemical facilities, nuclear power plants, and other critical infrastructure. In particular, I think it is important to note that the FBI Director Comey recently indicated that there are ongoing investigations of suspected terrorist cells operating in all of the 50 states. All federal agencies are subject to the environmental decision making requirements under NEPA. This includes the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which the Circuit of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held ``shall account for the potential environmental impacts of acts of terrorism in its environmental review process.'' The NRC has also imposed stringent anti-terrorism requirements on its licenses pursuant to 10 C.F.R. Section 73, which outlines security requirements for the physical protection of nuclear plants and materials. A nuclear power plant is, a chemical facility covered by the Jackson Lee Amendment. Mr. Chair, we should not limit the ability of the NRC to fully review the potential impacts of terrorism on Federal construction projects involving nuclear facilities and chemical facilities, as would be the case were H.R. 348 to become law. Worse still, H.R. 348 would automatically deem construction projects approved even where the NRC needs more time to complete its review of the environmental risk and/or the potential vulnerability of a critical infrastructure facility to terrorist attack. The Jackson Lee Amendment ensures the rushed and dangerous approach to the NEPA approval process embodied in H.R. 348 does not adversely impact the security of the homeland from the risk of terrorist attacks on nuclear facilities or other critical infrastructure construction projects. In short, the Jackson Lee Amendment provided added protection to keep Americans safe. I urge support for the Jackson Lee Amendment. September 17, 2015. Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members and activists, we are writing to urge you to oppose H.R. 348, the misleadingly named ``Responsibly and Professionally Invigorating Development Act of 2015.'' Instead of improving the permitting process, the bill will severely undermine the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and, consequently, the quality and integrity of federal agency decisions. The National Environmental Policy Act plays a critical role in ensuring that projects are carried out in a transparent, collaborative, and responsible manner. NEPA simply requires federal agencies to assess the environmental, economic, and public health impacts of proposals, solicit the input of all affected stakeholders, and disclose their findings publicly before undertaking projects that may significantly affect the environment. Critically, NEPA recognizes that the public-- which includes industry, citizens, local and state governments, and business owners--can make important contributions by providing unique expertise. NEPA also [[Page H6245]] gives a voice to the most impacted and underrepresented, especially to the most vulnerable communities who usually have to bear the most burden of where federal projects are proposed in the first place. However, H.R. 348 strikes at these core purposes of NEPA by systematically prioritizing speed of decisions and project approval over the public interest. Studies on the causes of delay in the permitting process reveal that the primary cause of delay is not the NEPA process. Rather, as multiple studies by the Government Accountability Office and the Congressional Research Service have pointed out, the principal causes of delay in permitting rest outside the NEPA process entirely and are attributable to other factors such as lack of funding, project complexity, and local opposition to the project. The RAPID Act ignores the true causes of delay, and instead, focuses on institutionalizing dangerous ``reforms'' that restrict public input, limit review of the environmental and economic impacts of projects, and that create more, not less, bureaucracy. Provisions in the RAPID Act, such as the following, will create more delays in permitting, result in less flexibility in the process, and tilt the entire permitting process towards shareholder interest, not the public interest. For example, the bill: Places Arbitrary Limitations on Environmental Reviews-- Section 560(i) of the bill threatens to undermine NEPA's goal of informed decision-making and the agency's role of acting in the public interest. It sets arbitrary deadlines on environmental reviews of permits, licenses, or other applications--regardless of the possible economic, health, or environmental impacts. Consequently, it puts communities at risk by promoting rushed and faulty decisions. Limits Consideration of Alternatives--Section 560(g) strikes at what CEQ regulations describe as ``the heart of the NEPA process'' by restricting the range of reasonable alternatives to be considered by an agency. Creates Serious Conflicts of Interests--Section 560(c) blurs the distinct roles of private entities and agencies in agency decisions by allowing private project sponsors with stakes in the decision to prepare environmental review documents which creates inherent conflicts of interest and thus jeopardizes the integrity of the decision-making process. Leading to Unanticipated Delays--The bill forces stakeholders into court preemptively simply to preserve their right to judicial review. The bill also limits the public's judicial access to challenge and address faulty environmental reviews which in turn is likely to increase the controversy and the amount of litigation derived from the permitting process which in turn could add to project delays. Denies the Impacts of Climate Change--Section 560(k) of the bill prohibits any considerations of the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), which the EPA and other federal agencies use to estimate the economic damages associated with specific projects and their related carbon dioxide emissions. The tool is critical for the public to understand the true benefits and costs of a project. Ignoring climate change puts critical infrastructure, tax payer dollars, and local communities at risk. Provisions such as these and many more in the RAPID Act will only serve to increase delay and confusion around the environmental review process. We believe compromising the quality of environmental review and limiting the role of the public is the wrong approach. Far from being broken, the National Environmental Policy Act has proven its worth as an invaluable tool. It ensures that the public, developers, and agencies have a reliable template for consistent and fair proposal assessment for major projects that may impact federal resources. The RAPID Act contradicts and jeopardizes decades of experience gained from enacting this critical environmental law. Further, it tips the balance away from informed decisions and public oversight, jeopardizing the public's ability to participate in how public resources will be managed. Please oppose this unnecessary and overreaching piece of legislation and vote ``no'' on the RAPID Act.

Hon. Bob Goodlatte, Chairman, House Committee on the Judiciary. Hon. John Conyers, Jr., Ranking Member, House Committee on the Judiciary. Dear Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers: I am writing to you to provide the Council on Environmental Quality's (CEQ) views on H.R. 348, the ``Responsibly and Professionally Invigorating Development Act of 2015.'' Although the bill purports to streamline environmental reviews, we believe the legislation is deeply flawed and will undermine the environmental review process. If enacted, these changes could lead to more confusion and delay, interfere with public participation and transparency, and hamper economic growth. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) was signed into law by President Richard Nixon after passing Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support. NEPA ushered in a new era of citizen participation in government, and it required the government to elevate the consideration of the environmental effects of its proposed actions. It remains one of the cornerstones of our Nation's modern environmental protections. NEPA is as relevant and critical today as it was in 1970. NEPA focuses and informs decision makers, policy makers, and the public on alternatives and the tradeoffs involved in making decisions. Today, we take for granted that governmental decision making should be open and transparent, that government actions should be carefully thought out and their consequences explained, and that government should be accountable. Prior to the enactment of NEPA, this was not always the case. H.R. 348 would undo more than four decades of transparent, open, and accountable government decision making. The Administration believes that America's economic health and prosperity are tied to the productive and sustainable use of our environment, and the President has stressed these principles since his first day in office. NEPA remains a vital tool for the Nation as we work to protect our environment and public health and continue to grow our economy. The President also takes seriously the need for efficient permitting and decision making by Federal agencies. American taxpayers, communities and businesses deserve nothing less. However, we reject the notion that NEPA and other Federal environmental laws and regulations hinder job creation. For example, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has found that 96.5 percent of federally funded highway projects are approved under the least intensive, shortest and quickest layer of NEPA analysis, namely categorical exclusions (CEs). CEs can take as little as a few days to a few months to complete, not years, and are usually done concurrently with other aspects of the project review process so that the entire review process is completed quickly. Only 0.3 percent of FHWA projects require a full environmental impact statement (EIS), the most detailed study under NEPA. When there are project delays, they are typically caused by incomplete funding packages, project complexity, changes in project scope, local opposition, and low local priority, or compliance with other laws and requirements facilitated by the NEPA process, but rarely NEPA itself. An investigation by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) of the NEPA process in federally funded highway projects bore this same point out. Within the Administration, we have prioritized improving the environmental review process and continue to make advancements in this space that will improve interagency coordination and synchronization of reviews to increase decision-making speed; improve project siting and project quality; expand innovative mitigation approaches; and drive accountability and transparency through the expanded use of an online permitting dashboard. For example, under Executive Order 13604, the interagency infrastructure permitting steering committee established the permitting dashboard, which makes project schedules transparent to the public and is designed to improve the timeliness and environmental outcomes of the permitting process. This was followed by a Presidential Memorandum to Federal Agencies on May 17, 2013 to modernize Federal infrastructure review, permitting regulations, policies and procedures to significantly reduce the time it takes to permit infrastructure projects. In addition, CEQ has taken several steps to improve and make more efficient Federal agency decision making. This year, the Administration released an updated ``how- to'' handbook (also known as the Red Book), Synchronizing Environmental Reviews for Transportation and other Infrastructure Projects, to improve and modernize NEPA and other types of reviews, such as those required under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA), and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), by providing information to facilitate more widespread adoption of concurrent reviews. More synchronized reviews by Federal permitting agencies will lead to more effective and efficient environmental reviews and projects with reduced impacts to [[Page H6246]] the environment as well as savings of time and money. CEQ also initiated a NEPA Pilot Program in March 2011 to solicit ideas from Federal agencies and the public about innovative time- and cost-saving approaches to NEPA implementation. Under this process, CEQ is working to identify additional innovative approaches that reduce the time and costs required for effective implementation of its NEPA regulations. H.R. 348 would make a number of considerable changes to Federal agency regulatory review, permitting, and environmental analysis that undercut the core principles embodied in NEPA, including reasoned decision-making and public involvement. The legislation seeks to implement these changes to Federal agency decision making under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The passage of this legislation will lead to two sets of standards by which Federal agencies would be expected to comply, one for ``construction projects'' under the APA and one for all other Federal actions, such as rulemaking or planning, under NEPA. This would lead to confusion, delay, and inefficiency. Moreover, the legislation would direct agencies, upon the request of a project sponsor, to adopt State documents if the State laws and procedures provide environmental protection and opportunities for public involvement ``that are substantially equivalent to NEPA.'' In our view, it is difficult to determine whether a State statute is substantially equivalent to NEPA and the legislation contains no requirement for agencies to determine if the State documents are adequate for NEPA purposes. More importantly, the State document may have looked at a different purpose and need for the project, a different set of alternatives than the Federal agency would have looked at, and relied on different standards for analysis. The State, for example, may not have looked at the same factors that Federal agencies are required to consider, such as environmental justice and wetlands protection. Finally, no two State processes are alike, compounding confusion for projects that cross State lines. Thus, a Federal agency's reliance on State documents may lead to inconsistencies between Federal projects and agencies, different environmental goals and protections, confusion among the public, and unclear results for businesses and project applicants. The legislation also establishes arbitrary deadlines for the completion of NEPA analyses. Factors such as feasibility and engineering studies, non-Federal funding, conflicting priorities, local opposition, or applicant responsiveness are just a few examples of delays outside of the control of an agency. Arbitrary deadlines and provisions that automatically approve a project if the agency is unable to make a decision due to one of the factors described above will lead to increased litigation, more delays, and denied projects as agencies will have no choice but to deny a project if the review and analysis cannot be completed before the proposed deadlines. These comments illustrate a few of the many concerns we have with the legislation. The Administration would be happy to provide the Committee with a more thorough and exhaustive list of our substantive concerns with the legislation at the request of the Committee. In closing, when properly implemented, NEPA improves collaboration, consensus, accountability, and transparency surrounding government decision-making and actions. Our Nation's long-term prosperity depends upon our faithful stewardship of the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the land that supports and sustains us. Our country has been strengthened by the open, accountable, informed, and citizen- involved decision-making structure created by NEPA, and our economy has prospered. Sincerely, Christy Goldfuss, Managing Director, Council on Environmental Quality. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time to say to my colleague from Texas that this bill is about national security. The gentlewoman is right. We can all agree on the importance of national security and protecting our security, but making sure that when projects are planned they are implemented within a reasonable period of time. And we are talking about years--not days or weeks or even months--years for a permitting, years for examination to make sure that these are done carefully, but not decades, as happens now with a number of different projects that have been discussed over the last 2 days that, in their current state, without the kinds of repairs, without the kinds of increased improvements, without the kinds of additional safety and security protections that new projects bring online, we are more vulnerable, not less. I fear that the gentlewoman from Texas' amendment would do just that. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. GOODLATTE. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank my good friend for yielding to me. Maybe we can work together on this amendment because it is a simple carve-out. It should be narrow. It clarifies that the bill's provision does not apply to environmental reviews or permitting on other agencies' decisions that could deal with potential terrorist attack targets, such as chemical facilities and other critical infrastructure. I don't think that that is something that the gentleman and myself would disagree with and, particularly, the nuclear plants, which take a longer period of time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Reclaiming my time, I would say to the gentlewoman that the bill allows lots of time for each stage of the permitting process to cover and discover ways to make a project more secure, to make it safer, to improve it in a variety of different ways; and that the gentlewoman's amendment would harm the ability to do that, not help, because it would slow down the process under which we would have these new projects able to begin construction and then be completed. With that, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas will be postponed. Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Johnson of Georgia The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 printed in House Report 114-261. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Add, at the end of the bill, the following: (d) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act or the amendments made by this Act shall have the effect of changing or limiting any law or regulation that requires or provides for public comment or public participation in an agency decision making process. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, the purpose of this amendment is simple. It protects the right of the public to comment. This amendment reads: ``Nothing in this Act or the amendments made by this Act shall have the effect of changing or limiting any law or regulation that requires or provides for public comment or public participation in an agency decision making process.'' Now, yesterday, Mr. Chairman, the Pope, right here in this very room, called on each of us to pursue a common good, which he told us requires a courageous and responsible effort. And certainly, if we are going to protect the common good, it requires that we protect the right of the public to comment on projects that have an adverse impact on our precious environment, right there where they live. This amendment would restore the right of any member of the public to comment on construction projects that may have an environmental impact; and because of that, I don't expect any opposition to this amendment, Mr. Chairman. Like a number of well-respected environmental groups, I oppose H.R. 348, the so-called RAPID Act, which threatens public health and safety by putting a thumb on the scales of justice in favor of private sector businesses in the project approval process. It is yet another antiregulatory measure whose only design is to grease the wheels of the approval process of projects that are environmentally sensitive. Aside from creating duplicative and costly requirements that pertain to certain types of projects, the RAPID Act would also limit the right of the public to comment on these projects. This bill does that in two ways: first, by reducing opportunities for public input, and secondly, by fast-tracking [[Page H6247]] the approval process through arbitrary deadlines. Through an open, flexible, and timely process, NEPA empowers the public to weigh in on decisions. That means that the local farmer who owns land that would be affected by a Federal construction project-- let's say a nasty pipeline like Keystone--it ensures that that local farmer would have the ability and would stand on local footing with the construction industry and with the Federal Government. My amendment is vital to ensuring that the RAPID Act does not shut the public out of the process. I am sure that all minds agree that that is reasonable. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I do rise in opposition to this amendment. I do share, however, the interest of the gentleman from Georgia in promoting the common good, as mentioned by Pope Francis when he spoke in this Chamber yesterday. But the common good is people coming together to improve their lives by creating improved infrastructure for transportation, whether that is highways or mass transit, for delivering energy resources to places where that energy needs to be delivered, to improving the shipping lanes so that goods can be shipped to and from this country and within this country in ways that make it easier for consumers to receive the energy, the products, the transportation that they need and deserve. The RAPID Act will create jobs by ensuring that the Federal environmental review and permitting process works like it should. It will also make sure that these infrastructure projects that deliver the common good will do so in a reasonable period of time, so people won't have to wait 20 years, like we heard yesterday from the gentleman from Texas, about simply lowering the draft, the 8 feet lower, for ships to get up the waterway in east Texas to deliver goods and pick up goods from ports in that part of the country. Why 20 years to make a decision about dredging 8 feet from a waterway? The RAPID Act is drafted to make agencies operate efficiently and transparently. That is not happening in so many, many instances. But, it does not prevent citizens from participating in that process. In fact, the bill makes sure that agencies provide the public with reasonable public comment periods. It authorizes up to 60 days of public comment on Environmental Impact Statements, up to 30 days of comments on environmental assessments and other documents, and grants the lead agency authority to negotiate extensions or provide them on its own ``for good cause.'' {time} 1030 This is more than fair. By comparison, the National Environmental Policy Act, which has been cited many times on the other side of the aisle, only requires agencies to allow 45 days for public comment--not the 60 days provided in the RAPID Act--on draft environmental impact statements and 30 days for public comments on final environmental impact statements. The RAPID Act also reasonably requires that a person comment on an environmental document before challenging it in court and bring any suit within 6 months as opposed to 6 years. Opponents should not be able to delay a project indefinitely by playing ``hide the ball'' with agencies or by resting on their rights. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would like to respond. First, in the narrowed circumstances in which an agency may supplement an environmental impact statement under the bill, the lead agency ``may'' solicit comments from agencies and the public for not more than 30 days beginning on the date of the publication of the supplement. CEQ regulations require an agency to provide for a 45-day public review and comment period, although there is also a provision in the CEQ regulations that allows CEQ to approve alternative procedures for supplemental EISs if circumstances warrant a deviation from the normal process. Secondly, under the bill, each participating agency is to limit its comments on a project to areas within the authority and expertise of the agency and identify statutory authority for their comments. It specifically prohibits the lead agency from acting upon, responding to or including any document that is ``outside of the authority and expertise of the commenting participating agency.'' This is inconsistent with the CEQ regulations, which allow all agencies--whether local, tribal, State, or Federal--to comment on any substantive issue relative to the NEPA analysis, just as all members of the public should be able to do. So, finally, I would just point out that, if we are talking about efficiency and if we are talking about the common good, it does the public no good to cut out public comment from this process. If we can agree on that, then we can agree that this amendment is a good one. With that, I ask for its approval. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia will be postponed. The Committee will rise informally. The Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas) assumed the chair. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 139 (Friday, September 25, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6232-H6247] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RESPONSIBLY AND PROFESSIONALLY INVIGORATING DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2015 General Leave Mr. MARINO.

This subchapter will ensure that agencies administer the regulatory process in a manner that is efficient so that citizens are not burdened with regulatory excuses and time delays. ``(b) Definitions.--For purposes of this subchapter, the term-- ``(1) `agency' means any agency, department, or other unit of Federal, State, local, or Indian tribal government; ``(2) `category of projects' means 2 or more projects related by project type, potential environmental impacts, geographic location, or another similar project feature or characteristic; ``(3) `environmental assessment' means a concise public document for which a Federal agency is responsible that serves to-- ``(A) briefly provide sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact; ``(B) aid an agency's compliance with NEPA when no environmental impact statement is necessary; and ``(C) facilitate preparation of an environmental impact statement when one is necessary; ``(4) `environmental impact statement' means the detailed statement of significant environmental impacts required to be prepared under NEPA; ``(5) `environmental review' means the Federal agency procedures for preparing an environmental impact statement, environmental assessment, categorical exclusion, or other document under NEPA; ``(6) `environmental decisionmaking process' means the Federal agency procedures for undertaking and completion of any environmental permit, decision, approval, review, or study under any Federal law other than NEPA for a project subject to an environmental review; ``(7) `environmental document' means an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement, and includes any supplemental document or document prepared pursuant to a court order; [[Page H6233]] ``(8) `finding of no significant impact' means a document by a Federal agency briefly presenting the reasons why a project, not otherwise subject to a categorical exclusion, will not have a significant effect on the human environment and for which an environmental impact statement therefore will not be prepared; ``(9) `lead agency' means the Federal agency preparing or responsible for preparing the environmental document; ``(10) `NEPA' means the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.); ``(11) `project' means major Federal actions that are construction activities undertaken with Federal funds or that are construction activities that require approval by a permit or regulatory decision issued by a Federal agency; ``(12) `project sponsor' means the agency or other entity, including any private or public-private entity, that seeks approval for a project or is otherwise responsible for undertaking a project; and ``(13) `record of decision' means a document prepared by a lead agency under NEPA following an environmental impact statement that states the lead agency's decision, identifies the alternatives considered by the agency in reaching its decision and states whether all practicable means to avoid or minimize environmental harm from the alternative selected have been adopted, and if not, why they were not adopted. ``(c) Preparation of Environmental Documents.--Upon the request of the lead agency, the project sponsor shall be authorized to prepare any document for purposes of an environmental review required in support of any project or approval by the lead agency if the lead agency furnishes oversight in such preparation and independently evaluates such document and the document is approved and adopted by the lead agency prior to taking any action or making any approval based on such document. ``(d) Adoption and Use of Documents.-- ``(1) Documents prepared under nepa.-- ``(A) Not more than 1 environmental impact statement and 1 environmental assessment shall be prepared under NEPA for a project (except for supplemental environmental documents prepared under NEPA or environmental documents prepared pursuant to a court order), and, except as otherwise provided by law, the lead agency shall prepare the environmental impact statement or environmental assessment. After the lead agency issues a record of decision, no Federal agency responsible for making any approval for that project may rely on a document other than the environmental document prepared by the lead agency. ``(B) Upon the request of a project sponsor, a lead agency may adopt, use, or rely upon secondary and cumulative impact analyses included in any environmental document prepared under NEPA for projects in the same geographic area where the secondary and cumulative impact analyses provide information and data that pertains to the NEPA decision for the project under review. ``(2) State environmental documents; supplemental documents.-- ``(A) Upon the request of a project sponsor, a lead agency may adopt a document that has been prepared for a project under State laws and procedures as the environmental impact statement or environmental assessment for the project, provided that the State laws and procedures under which the document was prepared provide environmental protection and opportunities for public involvement that are substantially equivalent to NEPA. ``(B) An environmental document adopted under subparagraph (A) is deemed to satisfy the lead agency's obligation under NEPA to prepare an environmental impact statement or environmental assessment. ``(C) In the case of a document described in subparagraph (A), during the period after preparation of the document but before its adoption by the lead agency, the lead agency shall prepare and publish a supplement to that document if the lead agency determines that-- ``(i) a significant change has been made to the project that is relevant for purposes of environmental review of the project; or ``(ii) there have been significant changes in circumstances or availability of information relevant to the environmental review for the project. ``(D) If the agency prepares and publishes a supplemental document under subparagraph (C), the lead agency may solicit comments from agencies and the public on the supplemental document for a period of not more than 45 days beginning on the date of the publication of the supplement. ``(E) A lead agency shall issue its record of decision or finding of no significant impact, as appropriate, based upon the document adopted under subparagraph (A), and any supplements thereto. ``(3) Contemporaneous projects.--If the lead agency determines that there is a reasonable likelihood that the project will have similar environmental impacts as a similar project in geographical proximity to the project, and that similar project was subject to environmental review or similar State procedures within the 5-year period immediately preceding the date that the lead agency makes that determination, the lead agency may adopt the environmental document that resulted from that environmental review or similar State procedure. The lead agency may adopt such an environmental document, if it is prepared under State laws and procedures only upon making a favorable determination on such environmental document pursuant to paragraph (2)(A). ``(e) Participating Agencies.-- ``(1) In general.--The lead agency shall be responsible for inviting and designating participating agencies in accordance with this subsection. The lead agency shall provide the invitation or notice of the designation in writing. ``(2) Federal participating agencies.--Any Federal agency that is required to adopt the environmental document of the lead agency for a project shall be designated as a participating agency and shall collaborate on the preparation of the environmental document, unless the Federal agency informs the lead agency, in writing, by a time specified by the lead agency in the designation of the Federal agency that the Federal agency-- ``(A) has no jurisdiction or authority with respect to the project; ``(B) has no expertise or information relevant to the project; and ``(C) does not intend to submit comments on the project. ``(3) Invitation.--The lead agency shall identify, as early as practicable in the environmental review for a project, any agencies other than an agency described in paragraph (2) that may have an interest in the project, including, where appropriate, Governors of affected States, and heads of appropriate tribal and local (including county) governments, and shall invite such identified agencies and officials to become participating agencies in the environmental review for the project. The invitation shall set a deadline of 30 days for responses to be submitted, which may only be extended by the lead agency for good cause shown. Any agency that fails to respond prior to the deadline shall be deemed to have declined the invitation. ``(4) Effect of declining participating agency invitation.--Any agency that declines a designation or invitation by the lead agency to be a participating agency shall be precluded from submitting comments on any document prepared under NEPA for that project or taking any measures to oppose, based on the environmental review, any permit, license, or approval related to that project. ``(5) Effect of designation.--Designation as a participating agency under this subsection does not imply that the participating agency-- ``(A) supports a proposed project; or ``(B) has any jurisdiction over, or special expertise with respect to evaluation of, the project. ``(6) Cooperating agency.--A participating agency may also be designated by a lead agency as a `cooperating agency' under the regulations contained in part 1500 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on January 1, 2011. Designation as a cooperating agency shall have no effect on designation as participating agency. No agency that is not a participating agency may be designated as a cooperating agency. ``(7) Concurrent reviews.--Each Federal agency shall-- ``(A) carry out obligations of the Federal agency under other applicable law concurrently and in conjunction with the review required under NEPA; and ``(B) in accordance with the rules made by the Council on Environmental Quality pursuant to subsection (n)(1), make and carry out such rules, policies, and procedures as may be reasonably necessary to enable the agency to ensure completion of the environmental review and environmental decisionmaking process in a timely, coordinated, and environmentally responsible manner. ``(8) Comments.--Each participating agency shall limit its comments on a project to areas that are within the authority and expertise of such participating agency. Each participating agency shall identify in such comments the statutory authority of the participating agency pertaining to the subject matter of its comments.

[[Page H6234]] ``(B) Only feasible alternatives evaluated.--Where a project is being constructed, managed, funded, or undertaken by a project sponsor that is not a Federal agency, Federal agencies shall only be required to evaluate alternatives that the project sponsor could feasibly undertake, consistent with the purpose of and the need for the project, including alternatives that can be undertaken by the project sponsor and that are technically and economically feasible. ``(3) Methodologies.-- ``(A) In general.--The lead agency shall determine, in collaboration with cooperating agencies at appropriate times during the environmental review, the methodologies to be used and the level of detail required in the analysis of each alternative for a project. The lead agency shall include in the environmental document a description of the methodologies used and how the methodologies were selected. ``(B) No evaluation of inappropriate alternatives.--When a lead agency determines that an alternative does not meet the purpose and need for a project, that alternative is not required to be evaluated in detail in an environmental document. ``(4) Preferred alternative.--At the discretion of the lead agency, the preferred alternative for a project, after being identified, may be developed to a higher level of detail than other alternatives in order to facilitate the development of mitigation measures or concurrent compliance with other applicable laws if the lead agency determines that the development of such higher level of detail will not prevent the lead agency from making an impartial decision as to whether to accept another alternative which is being considered in the environmental review. ``(5) Employment analysis.--The evaluation of each alternative in an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment shall identify the potential effects of the alternative on employment, including potential short- term and long-term employment increases and reductions and shifts in employment. ``(h) Coordination and Scheduling.-- ``(1) Coordination plan.-- ``(A) In general.--The lead agency shall establish and implement a plan for coordinating public and agency participation in and comment on the environmental review for a project or category of projects to facilitate the expeditious resolution of the environmental review. ``(B) Schedule.-- ``(i) In general.--The lead agency shall establish as part of the coordination plan for a project, after consultation with each participating agency and, where applicable, the project sponsor, a schedule for completion of the environmental review. The schedule shall include deadlines, consistent with subsection (i), for decisions under any other Federal laws (including the issuance or denial of a permit or license) relating to the project that is covered by the schedule. ``(ii) Factors for consideration.--In establishing the schedule, the lead agency shall consider factors such as-- ``(I) the responsibilities of participating agencies under applicable laws; ``(II) resources available to the participating agencies; ``(III) overall size and complexity of the project; ``(IV) overall schedule for and cost of the project; ``(V) the sensitivity of the natural and historic resources that could be affected by the project; and ``(VI) the extent to which similar projects in geographic proximity were recently subject to environmental review or similar State procedures. ``(iii) Compliance with the schedule.-- ``(I) All participating agencies shall comply with the time periods established in the schedule or with any modified time periods, where the lead agency modifies the schedule pursuant to subparagraph (D). ``(II) The lead agency shall disregard and shall not respond to or include in any document prepared under NEPA, any comment or information submitted or any finding made by a participating agency that is outside of the time period established in the schedule or modification pursuant to subparagraph (D) for that agency's comment, submission or finding. ``(III) If a participating agency fails to object in writing to a lead agency decision, finding or request for concurrence within the time period established under law or by the lead agency, the agency shall be deemed to have concurred in the decision, finding or request. ``(C) Consistency with other time periods.--A schedule under subparagraph (B) shall be consistent with any other relevant time periods established under Federal law. ``(D) Modification.--The lead agency may-- ``(i) lengthen a schedule established under subparagraph (B) for good cause; and ``(ii) shorten a schedule only with the concurrence of the cooperating agencies. ``(E) Dissemination.--A copy of a schedule under subparagraph (B), and of any modifications to the schedule, shall be-- ``(i) provided within 15 days of completion or modification of such schedule to all participating agencies and to the project sponsor; and ``(ii) made available to the public. ``(F) Roles and responsibility of lead agency.--With respect to the environmental review for any project, the lead agency shall have authority and responsibility to take such actions as are necessary and proper, within the authority of the lead agency, to facilitate the expeditious resolution of the environmental review for the project. ``(i) Deadlines.--The following deadlines shall apply to any project subject to review under NEPA and any decision under any Federal law relating to such project (including the issuance or denial of a permit or license or any required finding): ``(1) Environmental review deadlines.--The lead agency shall complete the environmental review within the following deadlines: ``(A) Environmental impact statement projects.--For projects requiring preparation of an environmental impact statement-- ``(i) the lead agency shall issue an environmental impact statement within 2 years after the earlier of the date the lead agency receives the project initiation request or a Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement is published in the Federal Register;

Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, this amendment makes numerous technical and other minor wording changes to the bill. Together, these revisions clarify that the bill does not authorize duplicative agency review proceedings, does not require duplicative project notification and initiation of agency review procedures, and does not allow permitting decisions to be challenged in court by parties who did not first present their arguments in the administrative proceedings that produced the challenged permit. The amendment constitutes an agreement reached between the Judiciary Committee and the other committee of jurisdiction, the Natural Resources Committee. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim time in opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed to the amendment. The CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Arizona? There was no objection. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5 minutes. =========================== NOTE =========================== September 25, 2015, on page H6236, the following appeared: There was no objection. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, the The online version should be corrected to read: There was no objection. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, the ========================= END NOTE ========================= Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, the manager's amendment has been categorized as a technical amendment. We are told the amendment is designed to clarify the bill, which is being sold as the answer to our Nation's economic woes. The bill is supposed to streamline government environmental reviews, and this amendment is supposed to streamline the underlying bill. Unfortunately, the only thing that is being streamlined here are the facts about NEPA. Mr. Chairman, the facts are not in the Republicans' favor. For more than 40 years, NEPA has ensured that federally funded projects are carried out in a transparent and cost-effective manner, while fostering public participation in the decisionmaking process and minimizing impacts to the environment. In fact, NEPA often provides the only forum for citizens to engage in major Federal actions that affect our health, well-being, and the environment. NEPA saves millions of dollars and is a tool for environmental justice. NEPA gave the confederated Salish and Kootenai tribal governments and citizen groups an opportunity to engage in the design of U.S. 93 in western Montana, resulting in a project that successfully addressed safety, environmental, family farming, and cultural concerns. {time} 0915 NEPA's success stories, where the process saves money and improves the quality of life for people impacted by Federal decisions, go on and on. My Republican colleagues tend to streamline these stories so we never get a chance to hear them. Here are some facts my Republican colleagues might have missed during their streamlining: 95 percent of all NEPA analyses are completed through categorical exclusion, which generally requires only a few days. Less than 5 percent of NEPA actions require an environmental assessment, and less than 1 percent require a full EIS. Those projects that do require an EIS tend to be the largest, most complex. The delays that do occur are more likely the result of local opposition, a lack of funding, or changes in the project's scope. Agency data, interviews with agency officials, and available studies show that most NEPA analyses do not result in litigation; yet, the underlying bill seeks to restrict judicial review, and the manager's amendment would create a judicial bar to the courthouse doors before a party could seek judicial review. Typically, there have been fewer than 100 cases per year nationwide in the last decade even though the NEPA review process is applied to tens of thousands of government actions each year and tens of thousands more that are classified as exempt from review based on categorical exclusions. NEPA is not a barrier to development. It is a tool for better decision-making. The only reason to avoid NEPA or to weaken it is so that you can make decisions less carefully. This is the purpose of the legislation. Apparently, the bill itself was not drafted very carefully; so, we have a manager's amendment to fix all the errors. This manager's amendment is just more proof that my Republican colleagues should leave NEPA alone because their understanding of how it works and what it does is, unfortunately, too streamlined. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Lowenthal The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in House Report 114-261. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 14, line 11, insert after the period at the end the following: ``No alternative may be deemed feasible if the alternative does not adequately address risks associated with flooding, wildfire, and climate change.'' The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lowenthal) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. As my fellow Californian Ronald Reagan once said, ``There you go again.'' Attacks on NEPA have become almost a common, weekly occurrence in this Congress, and H.R. 348 is just the latest iteration. We should really call this bill the VAPID Act because it is tired, unimaginative, and a ploy to undermine one of our bedrock environmental laws: NEPA. My amendment would not fix all of this bill's problems, but it certainly would inject some small sense of fiscal responsibility into this legislation that seemingly has been designed for wasting taxpayers' money. Restricting the ability of the public to comment on proposed projects virtually guarantees more lawsuits and more hastily approved projects that [[Page H6237]] could turn into embarrassing boondoggles. Particularly in the face of climate change, we must take special care to ensure that the future value of projects is considered. This means thoroughly evaluating the risks associated with more frequent and intense wildfires as well as flooding caused by stronger storms and higher sea levels. Doing these reviews will not delay projects. As was pointed out by the ranking member, it is a fact that 95 percent of all NEPA analyses are completed through categorical exclusions, which generally require only a few days to process. Less than 5 percent require an environmental assessment, and less than 1 percent require a full environmental impact statement, or an EIS. Those projects that do require an EIS tend to be the largest and most complex, and delays that do occur are more likely the result of local opposition, a lack of funding, or changes in the project's scope, not due to NEPA. Making sure that roads aren't wiped out by a future storm surge or that activities in our national forests don't spark fires or that government-financed and -permitted actions are resilient to climate change is the least we can do to protect taxpayers and the environment. To do this, we need to keep NEPA strong, not weaken it by making government actions less transparent. The current NEPA process allows for the full consideration of the costs and the benefits of proposed actions and leads to environmentally and economically sound outcomes. I urge a ``yea'' vote on my amendment because the threats associated with climate change and related natural hazards are too great for this House to continue to ignore. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, by its terms, the amendment brands infeasible--and, thus, barred from further evaluation--project alternatives that do not appear at the outset of the review process to adequately address risks associated with flooding, wildfire, and climate change. With all due respect, that puts the cart before the horse. The bill is intended to allow the review of alternatives that are technically and economically feasible. It is entirely possible that, during the course of review, a technically and economically feasible alternative that appears initially to be inadequate to address these risks could, on further review, be found to be adequate or to be improved to be adequate. It might even ultimately be found to be the best alternative under review. Why should we prematurely end the evaluation of alternatives that could ultimately prove adequate with regard to these types of risks? This does not prevent the review process. What it does prevent is someone waiting to get in at the last moment, which has been 5 or 6 years later, to jam the system up in court, therefore crushing jobs and letting regulation run rampant. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I just want to comment that risks due to flooding, to stronger storms, to climate change are not putting the cart before the horse. I am simply asking that we don't waste taxpayers' money by not considering these risks. This is a fiscally sound amendment, and I urge an ``aye'' vote. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Lowenthal). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed. Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Grijalva The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in House Report 114-261. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 15, after line 21, insert the following: ``(6) Low-income and communities of color analysis.--The evaluation of each alternative in an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment shall identify the potential effects of the alternative on low-income communities and communities of color.''. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, is a 45-year-old law which stands, basically, for two things: that the Federal Government should consider alternatives before taking action that can impact people's lives and that the public should have the opportunity to comment on those alternatives before a final decision is made. House Republicans oppose both of these simple principles and so they attack NEPA time after time, year after year. The bill before us today is just a rerun of those attacks. My amendment, unfortunately, cannot fix this bill. In fact, my amendment is really just proof of what is so dangerous about the RAPID Act. Among the critical issues that can be addressed through our existing NEPA process is ensuring environmental justice. Bills like the one we are considering today seek to short-circuit that process; so, they seek to short-circuit environmental justice concerns. My amendment would put environmental justice considerations back in the process created by this legislation; but we would not even need this amendment if Republicans would just leave NEPA alone. Twenty-one years ago President Bill Clinton issued his executive order on environmental justice. After decades of hard work, struggle, some victories along the way, the promise of environmental justice for all communities remains unfulfilled. While environmental toxins and pollution know no class or race, low- income communities and communities of color bear a disproportionate share of adverse environmental consequences. Low-income communities and communities of color are routinely targeted to host facilities that have negative environmental impacts, such as landfills, refineries, chemical plants, freeways, and ports. Seventy-eight percent of African Americans live within 30 miles of a coal-fired power plant. Nearly one out of every two Latinos lives in the country's top 25 most ozone-polluted cities. For decades, these communities have been battling environmental injustices and have been seeking to build healthy, livable, and sustainable communities. NEPA recognizes that, when the public and Federal experts work together, better decisions are made. We have not solved the problem yet, but the solution is a more inclusive, more rigorous use of the NEPA process, not these constant, industry-friendly attacks on the law. Every person has the right to live, work, and play in a healthy and safe environment; yet, too often, the health of too many Americans is determined by their race, class, ZIP code, and street address. It is unfortunate and inefficient to have to come down here to protect these issues one by one for each and every Republican bill that is presented. The adoption of my amendment would keep H.R. 348 from destroying the progress we have made on issues for communities of color, but it doesn't solve the problem. A far better approach would be to drop H.R. 348 and to instead invest in making NEPA stronger and more inclusive than ever. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. [[Page H6238]] There was no objection. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, among those who suffer most unfairly from poor government decision-making are the communities the gentleman's amendment addresses. For example, growing research shows that the costs of new regulations often have regressive effects on those with lower incomes. When poor government decision-making occurs in the permit review process, similar unfair effects may occur. The gentleman's amendment guards against this by requiring agencies to identify and reveal the potential adverse effects of project alternatives on low-income communities and communities of color. Once identified and revealed, of course, any such effects may be avoided, minimized, or mitigated. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will be postponed. {time} 0930 Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Gallego The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in House Report 114-261. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Chair, I rise to offer an amendment. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 21, line 12, strike ``or''. Page 21, line 14, strike the period at the end and insert ``; or''. Page 21, after line 14, insert the following: ``(iii) a deadline extension is requested by an elected official of a State or locality, or a local tribal official.''. Page 22, line 8, strike ``or''.

Page 24, line 14, insert after ``cause,'' the following: ``, or the deadline was extended pursuant to the request of an elected official of a State or locality, or a local tribal official,''. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gallego) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer a commonsense amendment to the RAPID Act, a misguided bill that will disempower local leaders, including tribal leaders, and threaten the health and safety of our communities and their communities. As a member of the Natural Resources Committee, time and time again I have witnessed the Republican majority siding with big business and gutting bedrock environmental safeguards that for decades have protected our families and our natural heritage. My Republican friends claim that this bill is intended to protect the interest of our States and Native American tribes. Mr. Chair, we already have a law on the books for that purpose. It is called the National Environmental Policy Act, NEPA, and it works. At its heart, NEPA ensures that our government is accountable to the people. This critical law has protected the environment for more than 40 years without imposing arbitrary deadlines or limiting vital public input. It guarantees the public an opportunity to review and comment on actions proposed by the government, enabling important perspectives that would otherwise go unnoticed. In this way, NEPA can actually serve as a check on Big Government. Unfortunately, the RAPID Act promises the opposite, a deeply flawed process that would diminish the voice of State, local, and tribal communities. The RAPID Act will also establish a new regulatory framework that purposely overrides the NEPA review process, limiting public input and consequently undermining the quality and integrity of Federal agency decisions. Among its many dangerous provisions, the bill will also trigger the automatic approval of construction projects if agencies miss arbitrary deadlines, regardless of the complexity or hazard posed by such potential projects. Though the bill includes some extremely limited and narrow exceptions for these deadlines, as it is currently written, it fails to extend those deadlines for our local communities. My amendment would simply create a new good cause exception that would allow a deadline to be extended if a request is made from a local- or State-elected official or a local tribal leader. While my amendment does not fix all the problems in the underlying bill, it ensures that, if this bill should pass, our local and tribal leaders will continue to be empowered, as they are currently under NEPA. I support the goal of reducing red tape, but stripping away the ability of our local communities to have their voices heard is undemocratic and unacceptable. Mr. Chair, special interests don't need us to fight for them. Our communities do. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and to stand with our local and tribal leaders when it comes to projects in their own back yards that impact their homes, families, and business. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would allow agencies to escape the bill's streamlined permitting deadlines simply because an elected State or local official or a local tribal official asks for an extension. The amendment contains no requirement that a Federal agency find the compelling basis for an extension or even a significant basis or even any substantive basis at all. On the contrary, all that a recalcitrant Federal agency, a project opponent, or anyone else would need to defeat an efficient permitting decision is to find an elected State or local official or a local tribal official willing to put in an extension request for them. The potential for abuse of this proposed provision by those who only seek delay for delay's sake or who seek to kill worthy projects outright is obvious. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gallego). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will be postponed. Amendment No. 5 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in House Report 114-261. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 24, strike line 19 and all that follows through page 25, line 12. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I hope that we will find common ground on really responding to a great concern that I think all Americans should be concerned about. Although this bill is called the RAPID Act, were it to become law, in the present form, a permit or license for a project would be deemed approved if the reviewing agency does not issue the requested permit or license within 90 to 120 days. That is a short period of [[Page H6239]] time for complex regulatory structures that deal with complex industries. An industry that I represent in Houston, Texas, the energy industry, has complex needs and, as well, complex impacts and consequences if we do not deal with the agencies responsible, if the DOE, for example, does not do its due diligence. Now, let me say this, Mr. Chairman. These particular permits are done sooner than 90 to 120 days. But what this bill says is, if the agency is engaged in a very complex deliberative thought process, then, if they reach that deadline and they still have not finished, they are then, if you will, throwing to the side all of the safety issues and issues dealing with the protection of the American people under the bus. My amendment strikes the provision, deeming approved any project for which an agency does not meet the deadlines contained in the bill. I can appreciate some of the frustrations through the review process by the National Environmental Policy Act, but the cure is not this bill. If a Federal agency has failed to approve or disapprove a project or make the required finding, we are in trouble. Babies are in trouble with formula. Senior citizens are in trouble with various pharmaceuticals. They are in trouble. And then, if we run up against the deadline, there is no response. Second, frequently there are times when it is the case that the complexity of the issues, as I said, warrant us to do so. In other words, what this bill is saying is: To heck with reason and good judgment. We do not care. To heck with protecting the American people. We do not care. As I listened intently and intensely to the Pope's words yesterday, I offer this quote: Moses provided us with a good synthesis of your work. You are asked to protect--and speaking to us--by means of the law, the image, and likeness fashioned by God on every human face. This bill smacks in the face of that instruction. I believe that this amendment is worthy of passing. Mr. Chair, if H.R. 348, the so-called RAPID Act, were to become law in its present form, a permit or license for project would be ``deemed'' approved if the reviewing agency does not issue the requested permit or license within 90-120 days. My amendment strikes the provision deeming approved any project for which agency does not meet deadlines contained in the bill. Mr. Chairman, I can appreciate some of the frustrations expressed by many of our friends across the aisle when it comes to review process mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). But the cure they propose in H.R. 348 is an example of a medicine that is worse than the disease. Under H.R. 348, if a federal agency fails to approve or disapprove the project or make the required finding of the termination within the applicable deadline, which is either 90 days or 120 days, depending on the situation, then the project is automatically deemed approved by such agency. This creates a set of unintended consequences. First, as an agency is up against that deadline and legitimate work is yet to be completed, it is likely to disapprove the project simply because the issues have not been vetted. Second, frequently there are times when it is the case that the complexity of issues that need to be resolved necessitates a longer review period, rather than an arbitrary limit. So if H.R. 348 were to become law the most likely outcome is that federal agencies would be required to make decisions based on incomplete information, or information that may not be available within the stringent deadlines, and to deny applications that otherwise would have been approved, but for lack of sufficient review time. In other words, fewer projects would be approved, not more. Mr. Chairman, H.R. 348 ostensibly seeks to make a minor procedure adjustment to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). In reality, however, H.R. 348 would radically transform the NEPA review process, and not for the better either. For more than 40 years, NEPA has been the law of the land and has provided a remarkably effective framework for all types of projects (not just construction projects) that require federal approval pursuant to a federal law, such as the Clean Air Act. For these reasons, I urge all Members to support the Jackson Lee Amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, the American people desperately need new jobs. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, America's labor force participation rate remains mired among historic lows. Almost 94 million Americans who could work are outside the workforce. That is more than the population of all but 12 of the world's countries and more than every other country in the Western Hemisphere, except for Brazil and Mexico. We face this historically low rate not because Americans don't want to work, but because so many Americans have despaired of any hope of finding a new full-time job and have abandoned the workforce. The RAPID Act offers strong help to reverse this tragedy, restore the hope, and produce millions of new jobs. We must pass the bill, not weaken it, to provide these new high-wage jobs. The gentlewoman's amendment would weaken the bill in one of the worst possible ways. It would remove the clear consequences in the bill for agencies that refuse to follow the bill's deadlines. That consequence is to deem permits approved if agencies refuse to approve or deny them within those deadlines. Mr. Chairman, the bill provides 4\1/2\ years for agencies to complete their environmental reviews for new permit applications and reasonable and additional time for agencies to wrap up final permit approvals or denials after that; 4\1/2\ years is more time than it took the United States to fight and win World War II. If agencies can't wrap up their environmental reviews in that much time and then meet the bill's remaining deadlines, there is something terribly wrong with the agencies. The prospect of facing a default approval at the end of the substantial time the bill grants is an eminently reasonable way to assure that agencies will conduct full reviews and wrap their work up in time to make up or down decisions on their own. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. I reserve the balance of my time Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I am so glad my colleague mentioned the question of jobs. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 2 minutes remaining. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I am very glad my colleague mentioned jobs because none of us here are fighting against jobs. In fact, I happen to be supporting the full employment legislation that my good friend, Congressman John Conyers, has offered and I have joined. We are not here speaking against jobs. We are speaking for the American people. We are trying to explain the complexity of the permitting process. Whether it is for drilling, whether it is to deal with construction, whether it is to deal with complex environmental issues that have to be addressed impacting the American people or, for example, whether it is dealing with the Volkswagen company that saw fit to do the technology to undermine viable rules that the American automobile industry was complying with, definitely impacting jobs, I would have hoped that we would have had a process of permitting or a process of determining whether the Volkswagen company was violating these rules that were here to help the issue of pollution and other issues here, but also undermining the jobs of our own American companies. Let me say that the Jackson Lee amendment, in essence, is to suggest that there is a lot of complexity that my friends on the other side of the aisle with the RAPID Act--the very name of it suggests that we are throwing judgment to the wind. All we want to do is to move forward, even if they are ill. And we don't want the taxpayer dollars that have asked these workers in these agencies who have the expertise from the DOE, to the FDA and beyond-- Food and Drug Administration, Department of Energy--to protect us. I believe, Mr. Chairman, that my amendment, by eliminating the 90 to 120, deeming it approved in the midst [[Page H6240]] of a crisis when it is not fit to be approved, is an amendment that this body should pass. I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment because I am here to protect the American people and to do justly, as has been given to us in a wonderful message yesterday by Pope Francis. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining? The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 2\1/2\ minutes remaining. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chair, I want to just give a couple of examples of the timing factor that we are seeing that the agencies just are not executing properly. Cape Wind Project: For more than 12 years--12 years--they were waiting for permits to build an operation that would create jobs and renewable energy. 12 years. Orange County toll road in Orange County, California: There was a 12- year delay there as well. The project was extended tens of millions of dollars because of the delay there, and jobs were lost because of that. Charleston Harbor, Savannah Port dredging project: Again, there was a decade of delays in permitting because agencies are just sitting around, not taking the job responsibly. They never would survive in private industry if they operated under those conditions. So those are a few examples of the cost in dollars and cents and the jobs that are lost because of these agencies not performing their responsibilities. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas will be postponed. {time} 0945 Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mrs. Dingell The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in House Report 114-261. Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 25, line 4, insert before the period at the end the following: ``, unless the project would limit access to or opportunities for hunting or fishing, or impact a species listed as an endangered species or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.)''. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Michigan. Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA as we frequently shorthand it, is one of our bedrock conservation laws, and it has a simple premise: look before you leap. Its timelines are designed to provide transparency and public participation in government. H.R. 348 would move us in the opposite direction. My amendment would not fix all of the problems with this bill, but it would allow hunters, anglers, and wildlife enthusiasts to continue to enjoy the benefits that NEPA provides. Several recent stories help explain the benefits of NEPA, including the following: Recently, a plan to improve U.S. 23 in my home State of Michigan was modified to avoid the largest loss of wetlands in our State's history. Not only will this help improve the biodiversity of the region, but it will also preserve that habitat for migratory waterfowl prized by hunters. This land could have been lost and hunters would have had their access reduced if not for the robust comment process that NEPA provides. There are similar stories across the country. In 2013, changes to the Army Corps of Engineers' plan to increase storage capacity at the John Redmond Reservoir in Kansas were needed to protect prime deer and turkey hunting areas, as well as avoid the destruction of a local boat ramp providing fishermen access to the lake. In 2004, sportsmen's groups from across the country banded together during the NEPA review process and caused BLM to withdraw a proposal to allow oil and gas drilling along the Rocky Mountain Front in Montana. The list goes on and on, but the point is that none of these positive outcomes would have been achieved without a strong NEPA process that encourages public participation instead of limiting it. Furthermore, the habitats utilized by game and sports fishermen are the same as those utilized by endangered fish, wildlife, and plants. Destroying one destroys the other, which is why NEPA must allow for a thorough review of potential impacts to listed species. My amendment would ensure these protections will be preserved so hunters, fishermen, and American wildlife will continue to benefit from them. There is absolutely no legitimate reason to limit public oversight of taxpayer-funded projects. NEPA shines a light on proposed government actions and helps local citizens provide new information and ideas, improve projects, and ensure sustainable decisionmaking. It helps Federal authorities consider a range of alternatives, often resulting in lower costs to the public, something I am sure everyone here supports. NEPA is a quintessentially American, quintessentially small- government law. It reinforces the rights of people to hold their government accountable. A host of environmental groups have endorsed my amendment, but I am particularly pleased to have the support of Trout Unlimited, because my amendment would help protect the rights of anglers. If you hunt, you fish or have constituents who do, you should support a strong NEPA and vote for my amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, one of the linchpins of the RAPID Act is its set of provisions that: deem a permit approved if the permitting agency refuses to meet the bill's reasonable deadlines; and, prohibit a court from overturning a permit approval simply because the permit was deemed approved when deadlines expired before action was taken. If we do not include consequences like these in the bill, how will we ever ensure that recalcitrant, foot-dragging Federal agencies will achieve the bill's goal of streamlined permit decisions? The amendment, however, removes all consequences for agencies' foot- dragging so long as the projects at issue would either limit access to or opportunities for hunting or fishing or impact an endangered or threatened species. That is in the bill. The amendment's sponsor offers no sound reason to do this. The bill does not require projects with these kinds of impacts to be approved. It just requires that permitting decisions, up or down, be reached after, at most, 4\1/2\ years of environmental review. Surely that is enough time to review all kinds of projects, including those that limit access to or opportunities for hunting or fishing or impact endangered or threatened species. To make matters worse, the bill would allow agencies to drag their feet without consequences even if a project had a beneficial impact on an endangered or threatened species. Why should we allow delay for that? I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I want to quickly respond to the comments made by my colleague on the other side of the aisle. We often hear that NEPA is a scapegoat for projects being delayed, but as the GAO and others have found, outside issues, including the complexity of the project, local opposition and, most importantly, funding issues are almost always the cause of delays. If we adequately funded highway and infrastructure projects, we wouldn't be seeing so many delays the majority is [[Page H6241]] so concerned with. NEPA is a convenient excuse, but the facts simply don't support the claim that it is the root cause of projects being delayed. We should not be limiting the public's ability to comment on government decisions; but, instead, we should be enhancing them. This bill does the opposite. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and oppose the underlying bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, my colleague forgets to mention the fact that the lead Federal agency in this is responsible for maintaining a schedule, just like we do in private industry, just like we do in our own homes. That agency is responsible for going to the States and to the locals and other Federal agencies to make sure things are being done. Unfortunately, here in D.C., and sometimes at the State level, the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing, and this is making agencies responsible for that. It is just common sense. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Michigan will be postponed. Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Peters The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 printed in House Report 114-261. Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 27, strike line 11 and all that follows through page 28, line 4, and redesignate provisions accordingly. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentleman from California (Mr. Peters) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, before I entered public service, I practiced environmental law for 15 years in large firms, in a government office, and in my own firm. Through that experience, I learned firsthand of the frustration that many businesses and local governments face when they try to navigate overly complex and underly responsive permit processes. I also know from experience that time is money, and often a business seeking a permit is paying dearly to hold a property or to service a loan while it waits for that permit to be issued. That is why I have often said that for applicants, ``no'' is the second best answer. Tell us ``no'' or tell us how, but don't string us along. That is why I appreciate the spirit of the RAPID Act. I don't think it is the perfect answer. Frankly, I don't think it will become law. I am working on some other streamlining strategies that I think are superior and might have the bipartisan support that both would get them through this Chamber and the Senate and get them signed into law by President Obama. As I told my colleagues on the Committee on the Judiciary, I will vote for the RAPID Act if Congress adopts my amendment and does not pass restrictions on considering the role of greenhouse gasses and climate change on our environment. My amendment would simply eliminate subsection (k) of the bill, a section that explicitly prohibits any consideration of the social cost of carbon. For too long we have heard that we have to choose between a prosperous economy and a clean environment. San Diegans and people around the country know that is a false choice. We can and we must provide economic opportunity and clean air and clean water for future generations. That means providing businesses and communities with regulatory certainty to help them plan and invest in the future, and it also means that we use this streamlined process, with tight and reliable deadlines, to analyze the economic, environmental, and social costs of carbon dioxide emissions. As highlighted in former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg's bipartisan Risky Business report, accounting for the social cost of carbon and preparing for climate change is just smart business practice. The costs of carbon include financial losses from sea level rise. If we continue on our current path of carbon emissions, by 2050, between 66 and 106 billion dollars worth of existing coastal property will likely be below sea level nationwide. Eighty-seven percent of all Californians live in coastal counties, and 80 percent of the State's GDP is derived from those counties. Climate affects energy supply costs. Greenhouse gas-driven changes in temperature, catalyzed by burning fossil fuels, would require us to build new power generation facilities to help cool homes and businesses that Risky Business estimates will cost residential and commercial ratepayers as much as $12 billion a year. That is $12 billion that could be used by families to put their kids through school or buy a home, or by businesses to hire more employees. Climate affects the cost of national defense. In 2014, the Pentagon issued a report on the security risks associated with profound changes to global climate and the environment. The report found that climate change poses an immediate threat to national security. That will put additional upward pressure on our already-stressed defense budget. Climate affects agriculture, water supply, fire preparedness. In California, the largest agriculture producing State in the country, we are in the fourth year of what has been one of the worst droughts in recorded history. Communities across the State are facing water shortages. Dry conditions have extended our fire season to be nearly a year-round concern. Given the stakes associated with carbon emissions on coastal property, energy, defense, our food supply, fires, and our quality of life, shouldn't we at least understand the long-term costs associated with the project? This bill could hold the line on responsiveness and provide long-term certainty to businesses without burying our collective heads in the sand on the costs of carbon, one of the main environmental impacts this environmental law must confront. By stripping out subsection (k) and allowing us to consider the real costs of carbon on our economy, my amendment rejects the false choice between a prosperous economy and a healthy climate. We can and we must have both. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, the amendment seeks to strike the bill's prohibition against agency use in permitting reviews of the Obama administration's pronouncements on the social costs of carbon, but this prohibition was adopted last term for a very good reason. The administration's social cost of carbon estimate is junk science. To be specific, multiple commentators on the administration's findings about the social cost of carbon argue that carbon's social cost is an unknown quantity, that social cost of carbon analysts can get just about any result they desire by fiddling with nonvalidated climate parameters, made-up damage functions, and below-market discount rates, and that social cost of carbon analysis is computer-aided sophistry, its political function being to make renewable energy look like a bargain at any price and fossil energy look unaffordable, no matter how cheap. Junk science and sophistry has no place standing between hard-working Americans and new, high-paying jobs. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 30 seconds remaining. [[Page H6242]] Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I have two responses. One, this is not President Obama's agenda. This is the agenda of a bipartisan report, Risky Business, the Department of Defense, and a number of other people who have recognized this is a real problem we have to confront. Second, I would say to the gentleman: Let the science work itself out through the process. There is plenty of science that is questioned in the NEPA process. There is no other point at which this body has prevented a discussion of any content except here. Let the process work it out. I will be with you on your timelines. We will get businesses the certainty that they deserve. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. {time} 1000 Mr. MARINO. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith). Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania and fellow member of the Judiciary Committee for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment. The social cost of carbon is a flawed concept that should play no role in the environmental decisionmaking process. It is based on speculative formulas and has no basis in reality. Formulas can easily be manipulated to support any costly regulation. The social cost of carbon is a political tool the Obama administration uses to impose its extreme agenda on the American people. It is also another way that the administration tries to use secret science and data to justify questionable rulemaking. Speculating on the social cost of carbon should be restricted, not expanded. For these reasons, an agency should not use the social cost of carbon in its environmental review or in its environmental decisionmaking process. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Peters). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed. Amendment No. 8 Offered by Mr. Gosar The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 printed in House Report 114-261. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 28, line 1, insert after ``substantially related document,'' the following: ``the draft guidance entitled: `Revised Draft Guidance for Federal Departments and Agencies on Consideration of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the Effects of Climate change in NEPA Reviews' (79 Fed. Reg. 77801), or any successor thereto or substantially related document,''. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer a commonsense amendment that will protect American jobs and our economy by prohibiting Federal agencies from being forced to follow job-killing and unlawful draft guidance that sneakily seeks to implement Federal policies that pave the way for cap-and-trade-like mandates. Congress and the American people have repeatedly rejected cap-and- trade proposals pushed by this President and his Big Government allies. Knowing he can't lawfully enact a carbon dioxide tax plan, President Obama has chosen to circumvent Congress and is now seeking to address climate change by playing loose and getting creative with the Clean Air Act as well as through an unlawful guidance issued in December 2014. The underlying bill already prohibits Federal agencies from utilizing the social cost of carbon valuation. Furthermore, the social cost of carbon valuation was rejected four times by this very body last Congress. My simple, clarifying amendment adds to the Obama administration's revised draft guidance for greenhouse gas emissions and the effects of climate change that were issued by the White House in December 2014 to the definition for social cost of carbon in the bill. This straightforward amendment is common sense, as this deeply flawed guidance instructs agencies to include a controversial measurement of the social cost of carbon into their analyses and is the Obama administration's latest tool for attempting to implement this terrible new model that has consistently been rejected by the House. Roger Martella, a self-described lifelong environmentalist and career environmental lawyer, testified at the May 2015 House Natural Resources Committee hearing on the revised guidance and the flaws associated with the social cost of carbon model, stating: The `` `social cost of carbon' estimates suffer from a number of significant flaws that should exclude them from the NEPA process. ``First, projected costs of carbon emissions can be manipulated by changing key parameters such as timeframes, discount rates, and other values that have no relation to a given project undergoing review. As a result, applying social cost of carbon estimates can be used to promote pre-determined policy preferences rather than provide for a fair and objective evaluation of a specific proposed federal action. ``Second, OMB and the other federal agencies developed the draft Social Cost of Carbon estimates without any known peer review or opportunity for public comment during the development process. This process is antithetical to NEPA's central premise that informed agency decision making must be based on transparency and open dialogue with the public. ``Third, OMB's draft Social Cost of Carbon estimates are based primarily on global rather than domestic costs and benefits. This is particularly problematic for NEPA reviews because the Courts have established that agencies cannot consider transnational impacts in NEPA reviews. ``Fourth, there is still considerable uncertainty in many of the assumptions and data elements used to create the draft Social Cost of Carbon estimates, such as the damage functions and modeled time horizons. In light of the lack of transparency in the OMB's process, these concerns over accuracy are particularly problematic.'' Mr. Martella's testimony was spot on. Congress, not Washington bureaucrats at the behest of the President, should dictate our country's climate change policy. These sweeping new changes that are seeking to be implemented by the White House did not go through the normal regulatory process, and there was no public comment. Furthermore, the Obama administration has refused to answer pivotal questions about this guidance and even failed to send a witness to a May 2015 hearing on this matter. While the Obama administration acknowledged the draft guidance is not legally enforceable, you best believe that Federal agencies that received the 31-page revised guidance will treat this document like it was signed into law by the President. Unfortunately, this administration just doesn't get it and continues to try to circumvent Congress to impose an extremist agenda that is not based on the best available science. Worse yet, the model utilized to predict the social cost of carbon can easily be manipulated to arrive at any desired outcome. The House has rejected the social cost of carbon numerous times. I ask all those to join me once again in rejecting this flawed proposal and protecting jobs right here in America. I commend the chairman and the committee for their efforts on this legislation and for recognizing that the NEPA process is in desperate need of reform. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Michigan is recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Gosar amendment [[Page H6243]] because it would weaken a critical part of the National Environmental Policy Act. The Council on Environmental Quality recently issued draft guidance under NEPA detailing how Federal agencies should consider the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. This NEPA guidance is a commonsense and perfectly legal step toward reducing the Federal Government's contribution and vulnerability to global warming. It is smart planning that accounts for risk and will save taxpayers money, something I am sure that everyone here can support. Furthermore, the guidance will only increase NEPA's effectiveness as a tool for environmental justice, helping communities that cannot afford expensive lobbyists to protect their homes and values. Climate change is hitting low-income communities and communities of color the hardest. Instead of blocking progress, we should congratulate President Obama and CEQ on issuing this incredibly important and long overdue draft guidance to Federal agencies and urge them to issue a final version as soon as possible. And, for the record, my understanding is CEQ did have a witness at the hearing that was just referred to. This guidance makes clear that Federal agencies must factor greenhouse gas emissions and climate change into their decisions and will produce better, more informed and more efficient outcomes. Efforts to convince the American people we have nothing to do with climate change--or, as Pope Francis said in words the American people understood yesterday: air pollution--will not slow the pace of actual climate change, and it will harm our economy, public health, and national security. That is why this is a bad amendment. We urge you to vote against it. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOSAR. I yield myself the balance of my time. The Earth's climate has been changing since the beginning of time, and that is something that we can all agree on. MIT researchers recently reported that there was a massive extinction some 252 million years ago that coincided with a massive buildup of carbon dioxide. While the cause of the massive buildup is unknown, it is safe to say that man did not exist and he still can't explain it. You can take all the carbon-producing applications, whether it be oil, coal, or volcanic action, and they still can't get the models to predict. So we are leading the blind with the blind. I ask for all Members to vote for this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. DINGELL. I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, I would like to read an excerpt from Pope Francis' address to us yesterday that really stood out to me: ``I call for a courageous and responsible effort to redirect our steps, and to avert the most serious effects of the environmental deterioration caused by human activity. I am convinced that we can make a difference, and I have no doubt that the United States--and this Congress--have an important role to play.'' I take that call by our Pope very seriously. There are even reports today that China is going to announce a cap-and-trade program. By considering this bill and this amendment, Congress is not playing a constructive role. I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Gosar amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chair, I support the amendment. It is bad enough that agencies already take too much time to conclude construction permit reviews. It is even worse for them to draw out the process on the basis of junk science. And that is precisely what the Obama administration's pronouncements on the ``social sost of carbon'' appear to be. The Obama administration's current ``social cost of carbon'' estimate is plagued by defects including the lack of full scientific peer review, robust public comment, and full compliance with federal requirements for influential scientific assessments. Subsection (K) of the bill prohibits the use of the administration's ``technical update of the social cost of carbon for regulatory impact analysis under Executive Order No. 12866,'' as well as successors to it. The gentleman's amendment makes crystal clear that agencies also may not rely on administration ``guidance'' documents intended to facilitate agencies' use of the prohibited technical document. I urge my colleagues to suport the amendment. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will be postponed. Amendment No. 9 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 printed in House Report 114-261. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 31, beginning on line 4, strike ``subsection (p)'' and insert ``subsections (q) and (r)''. Page 31, line 17, insert after ``141).'' the following: ``(r) Exception for Certain Projects.--This subchapter does not apply in the case of any project that could be a potential target for a terrorist attack or that involves chemical facilities and other critical infrastructure.''. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, although we have been debating for a long period of time, let me say to my colleagues to remind them--and I see my good friend, Chairman Goodlatte, on the floor--that this legislation amends the National Environmental Policy Act with good intentions. However, what this bill will do is actually strip out critical input from Federal, State, local agencies, and the public, jeopardizing both the environment and public safety--let me repeat that--jeopardizing the American people, environment, and public safety. The bill sets new, tight deadlines for environmental review, permitting, and licensing decisions and simply, as I said earlier, throws wisdom and good judgment to the wind. I serve as a senior member on the Homeland Security Committee. And so I rise today with my amendment that improves the bill and helps to protect the homeland by carving a limiting exception for construction projects that could be potential targets for terrorist acts, such as chemical facilities, nuclear power plants, and other critical infrastructure. Let me offer the comments of the Congressional Budget Office. They have no basis for estimating the number of construction projects that could be expedited or the savings that would be realized in this bill. Of course, those who support it use that as their main Rock of Gibraltar, if you will, their main point of argument that this is a good bill. A good bill in the face of terrorism? Director Comey has indicated that he has determined that there are ongoing investigations of suspected terrorist cells operating in all 50 States. Yet, we want to expedite this process when it is determining issues dealing with our national security to a certain extent. This issue deals with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit said shall account for the potential environmental impacts of acts of terrorism in its environmental review process. {time} 1015 Are you going to rush them along? The NRC has also imposed stringent antiterrorism requirements on its licenses through 10 CFR section 73, which outlines security requirements for the physical protection of nuclear plants and materials. The Jackson Lee amendment covers nuclear power plants and, as well, chemical facilities to not rush the process to protect the American people. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. [[Page H6244]] Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. This amendment denies the benefit of the bill's permit streamlining provisions to any and all projects that could be terrorist targets or involve chemical facilities or other critical infrastructure. That includes projects that would help to protect those infrastructures and facilities from terrorist attacks or other adversities. Why would we want to delay permitting decisions on projects that would help to protect us? The bill, moreover, already provides up to 4\1/2\ years for agencies to complete their environmental reviews for new permit applications and reasonable additional time for agencies to wrap up final permit approvals or denials after that. As I have said before, if agencies can't wrap up their environmental reviews in that much time and then meet the bill's remaining deadlines, there is something terribly wrong with those agencies. Mr. Chairman, new projects, whether they be infrastructure projects that make a dam stronger or make a highway safer or make a nuclear facility less vulnerable to attack, are all important things to do, and we should do them with expedition, not take longer rather than shorter to get them done, because all the time that we are spinning our wheels with the permitting process that can take 20 years or more, we are more vulnerable during that time. Almost all new infrastructure projects are better than what they are replacing, and that should be our guiding principle. Get these things done expeditiously. It will make us safer. It will make us a better economy. It will create more jobs. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, how much time do we have remaining? The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 2\1/2\ minutes remaining. The gentleman from Virginia has 3 minutes remaining. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, quite the contrary to my good friend from Virginia, what this amendment does is protects the process of the NRC to fully review the potential impacts of terrorism on Federal construction projects involving nuclear facilities and chemical facilities as well. In addition, I think when we hear the names Chernobyl, Fukushima, and Three Mile Island, we understand the vast and devastating impact of such an incident that may be caused or driven by terrorism. I would not want to limit the NRC, which has been given court authority by law to investigate and provide an investigation, thorough investigation, on the impact on chemical and nuclear plants, and we have it restricted. It takes more than 4 years to build a nuclear facility. So are you suggesting that the facility, then, can go on and be built for 10, 20 years, and we shut off the NEPA that has the responsibilities for the American people? I don't think that is appropriate. Mr. Chairman, let me suggest that the American people from the Alaska Wilderness League, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Western Environmental Law Center are against this bill. I will place this into the Record. Mr. Chairman, the Executive Office of the President, Council on Environmental Quality is opposed to this bill, and I will insert this into the Record. I just want to mention that, of course, the President has issued a veto threat. Where this bill is going, I do not know. But the main thing I would like to say to my colleagues is: Can't we stand together united around the question of national security? My amendment specifically indicates that this issue of terrorism should be a simple carve-out, and I would ask you to do so. Let me also bring in the comments of the Pope as indicated yesterday: If politics must truly be at the service of the human person, it follows that it cannot be a slave to the economy and finance. Politics is, instead, an expression of our compelling need to live as one in order to build, as one, the greatest common good: that of a community which sacrifices particular interests in order to share, in justice and peace, its goods, its interests, and its social life. The interest of the American people is to accept the Jackson Lee amendment--to carve out an exception in this bill that is opposed by the President and all other aspects of goodwill people here dealing with the environment--to deal with this issue. Might I remind you, Mr. Chairman, of the Volkswagen scandal. If a more robust process had been in mind, 11 million owners of Volkswagens--and 400,000 in the United States--might be in a better place. This is a good amendment dealing with the safety and security of the American people. I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk; it is listed in the Rule as Jackson Lee 9. Many of us wear a number of hats with dual committee assignments; I am a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee and the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations. This perspective and these responsibilities have given me a special appreciation for the difficult and challenging times we live in and the importance of not taking precipitous actions that could put the security of our homeland at risk. Mr. Chair, if H.R. 348, the so-called RAPID Act, were to become law in its present form, a permit or license for project would be ``deemed'' approved if the reviewing agency does not issue the requested permit or license within 90-120 days. The Jackson Lee Amendment improves the bill and helps to protect the homeland by carving a limited exception for construction projects that could be potential targets for terrorist attacks such as chemical facilities, nuclear power plants, and other critical infrastructure. In particular, I think it is important to note that the FBI Director Comey recently indicated that there are ongoing investigations of suspected terrorist cells operating in all of the 50 states. All federal agencies are subject to the environmental decision making requirements under NEPA. This includes the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which the Circuit of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held ``shall account for the potential environmental impacts of acts of terrorism in its environmental review process.'' The NRC has also imposed stringent anti-terrorism requirements on its licenses pursuant to 10 C.F.R. Section 73, which outlines security requirements for the physical protection of nuclear plants and materials. A nuclear power plant is, a chemical facility covered by the Jackson Lee Amendment. Mr. Chair, we should not limit the ability of the NRC to fully review the potential impacts of terrorism on Federal construction projects involving nuclear facilities and chemical facilities, as would be the case were H.R. 348 to become law. Worse still, H.R. 348 would automatically deem construction projects approved even where the NRC needs more time to complete its review of the environmental risk and/or the potential vulnerability of a critical infrastructure facility to terrorist attack. The Jackson Lee Amendment ensures the rushed and dangerous approach to the NEPA approval process embodied in H.R. 348 does not adversely impact the security of the homeland from the risk of terrorist attacks on nuclear facilities or other critical infrastructure construction projects. In short, the Jackson Lee Amendment provided added protection to keep Americans safe. I urge support for the Jackson Lee Amendment. September 17, 2015. Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members and activists, we are writing to urge you to oppose H.R. 348, the misleadingly named ``Responsibly and Professionally Invigorating Development Act of 2015.'' Instead of improving the permitting process, the bill will severely undermine the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and, consequently, the quality and integrity of federal agency decisions. The National Environmental Policy Act plays a critical role in ensuring that projects are carried out in a transparent, collaborative, and responsible manner. NEPA simply requires federal agencies to assess the environmental, economic, and public health impacts of proposals, solicit the input of all affected stakeholders, and disclose their findings publicly before undertaking projects that may significantly affect the environment. Critically, NEPA recognizes that the public-- which includes industry, citizens, local and state governments, and business owners--can make important contributions by providing unique expertise. NEPA also [[Page H6245]] gives a voice to the most impacted and underrepresented, especially to the most vulnerable communities who usually have to bear the most burden of where federal projects are proposed in the first place. However, H.R. 348 strikes at these core purposes of NEPA by systematically prioritizing speed of decisions and project approval over the public interest. Studies on the causes of delay in the permitting process reveal that the primary cause of delay is not the NEPA process. Rather, as multiple studies by the Government Accountability Office and the Congressional Research Service have pointed out, the principal causes of delay in permitting rest outside the NEPA process entirely and are attributable to other factors such as lack of funding, project complexity, and local opposition to the project. The RAPID Act ignores the true causes of delay, and instead, focuses on institutionalizing dangerous ``reforms'' that restrict public input, limit review of the environmental and economic impacts of projects, and that create more, not less, bureaucracy. Provisions in the RAPID Act, such as the following, will create more delays in permitting, result in less flexibility in the process, and tilt the entire permitting process towards shareholder interest, not the public interest. For example, the bill: Places Arbitrary Limitations on Environmental Reviews-- Section 560(i) of the bill threatens to undermine NEPA's goal of informed decision-making and the agency's role of acting in the public interest. It sets arbitrary deadlines on environmental reviews of permits, licenses, or other applications--regardless of the possible economic, health, or environmental impacts. Consequently, it puts communities at risk by promoting rushed and faulty decisions. Limits Consideration of Alternatives--Section 560(g) strikes at what CEQ regulations describe as ``the heart of the NEPA process'' by restricting the range of reasonable alternatives to be considered by an agency. Creates Serious Conflicts of Interests--Section 560(c) blurs the distinct roles of private entities and agencies in agency decisions by allowing private project sponsors with stakes in the decision to prepare environmental review documents which creates inherent conflicts of interest and thus jeopardizes the integrity of the decision-making process. Leading to Unanticipated Delays--The bill forces stakeholders into court preemptively simply to preserve their right to judicial review. The bill also limits the public's judicial access to challenge and address faulty environmental reviews which in turn is likely to increase the controversy and the amount of litigation derived from the permitting process which in turn could add to project delays. Denies the Impacts of Climate Change--Section 560(k) of the bill prohibits any considerations of the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), which the EPA and other federal agencies use to estimate the economic damages associated with specific projects and their related carbon dioxide emissions. The tool is critical for the public to understand the true benefits and costs of a project. Ignoring climate change puts critical infrastructure, tax payer dollars, and local communities at risk. Provisions such as these and many more in the RAPID Act will only serve to increase delay and confusion around the environmental review process. We believe compromising the quality of environmental review and limiting the role of the public is the wrong approach. Far from being broken, the National Environmental Policy Act has proven its worth as an invaluable tool. It ensures that the public, developers, and agencies have a reliable template for consistent and fair proposal assessment for major projects that may impact federal resources. The RAPID Act contradicts and jeopardizes decades of experience gained from enacting this critical environmental law. Further, it tips the balance away from informed decisions and public oversight, jeopardizing the public's ability to participate in how public resources will be managed. Please oppose this unnecessary and overreaching piece of legislation and vote ``no'' on the RAPID Act.

Hon. Bob Goodlatte, Chairman, House Committee on the Judiciary. Hon. John Conyers, Jr., Ranking Member, House Committee on the Judiciary. Dear Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers: I am writing to you to provide the Council on Environmental Quality's (CEQ) views on H.R. 348, the ``Responsibly and Professionally Invigorating Development Act of 2015.'' Although the bill purports to streamline environmental reviews, we believe the legislation is deeply flawed and will undermine the environmental review process. If enacted, these changes could lead to more confusion and delay, interfere with public participation and transparency, and hamper economic growth. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) was signed into law by President Richard Nixon after passing Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support. NEPA ushered in a new era of citizen participation in government, and it required the government to elevate the consideration of the environmental effects of its proposed actions. It remains one of the cornerstones of our Nation's modern environmental protections. NEPA is as relevant and critical today as it was in 1970. NEPA focuses and informs decision makers, policy makers, and the public on alternatives and the tradeoffs involved in making decisions. Today, we take for granted that governmental decision making should be open and transparent, that government actions should be carefully thought out and their consequences explained, and that government should be accountable. Prior to the enactment of NEPA, this was not always the case. H.R. 348 would undo more than four decades of transparent, open, and accountable government decision making. The Administration believes that America's economic health and prosperity are tied to the productive and sustainable use of our environment, and the President has stressed these principles since his first day in office. NEPA remains a vital tool for the Nation as we work to protect our environment and public health and continue to grow our economy. The President also takes seriously the need for efficient permitting and decision making by Federal agencies. American taxpayers, communities and businesses deserve nothing less. However, we reject the notion that NEPA and other Federal environmental laws and regulations hinder job creation. For example, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has found that 96.5 percent of federally funded highway projects are approved under the least intensive, shortest and quickest layer of NEPA analysis, namely categorical exclusions (CEs). CEs can take as little as a few days to a few months to complete, not years, and are usually done concurrently with other aspects of the project review process so that the entire review process is completed quickly. Only 0.3 percent of FHWA projects require a full environmental impact statement (EIS), the most detailed study under NEPA. When there are project delays, they are typically caused by incomplete funding packages, project complexity, changes in project scope, local opposition, and low local priority, or compliance with other laws and requirements facilitated by the NEPA process, but rarely NEPA itself. An investigation by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) of the NEPA process in federally funded highway projects bore this same point out. Within the Administration, we have prioritized improving the environmental review process and continue to make advancements in this space that will improve interagency coordination and synchronization of reviews to increase decision-making speed; improve project siting and project quality; expand innovative mitigation approaches; and drive accountability and transparency through the expanded use of an online permitting dashboard. For example, under Executive Order 13604, the interagency infrastructure permitting steering committee established the permitting dashboard, which makes project schedules transparent to the public and is designed to improve the timeliness and environmental outcomes of the permitting process. This was followed by a Presidential Memorandum to Federal Agencies on May 17, 2013 to modernize Federal infrastructure review, permitting regulations, policies and procedures to significantly reduce the time it takes to permit infrastructure projects. In addition, CEQ has taken several steps to improve and make more efficient Federal agency decision making. This year, the Administration released an updated ``how- to'' handbook (also known as the Red Book), Synchronizing Environmental Reviews for Transportation and other Infrastructure Projects, to improve and modernize NEPA and other types of reviews, such as those required under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA), and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), by providing information to facilitate more widespread adoption of concurrent reviews. More synchronized reviews by Federal permitting agencies will lead to more effective and efficient environmental reviews and projects with reduced impacts to [[Page H6246]] the environment as well as savings of time and money. CEQ also initiated a NEPA Pilot Program in March 2011 to solicit ideas from Federal agencies and the public about innovative time- and cost-saving approaches to NEPA implementation. Under this process, CEQ is working to identify additional innovative approaches that reduce the time and costs required for effective implementation of its NEPA regulations. H.R. 348 would make a number of considerable changes to Federal agency regulatory review, permitting, and environmental analysis that undercut the core principles embodied in NEPA, including reasoned decision-making and public involvement. The legislation seeks to implement these changes to Federal agency decision making under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The passage of this legislation will lead to two sets of standards by which Federal agencies would be expected to comply, one for ``construction projects'' under the APA and one for all other Federal actions, such as rulemaking or planning, under NEPA. This would lead to confusion, delay, and inefficiency. Moreover, the legislation would direct agencies, upon the request of a project sponsor, to adopt State documents if the State laws and procedures provide environmental protection and opportunities for public involvement ``that are substantially equivalent to NEPA.'' In our view, it is difficult to determine whether a State statute is substantially equivalent to NEPA and the legislation contains no requirement for agencies to determine if the State documents are adequate for NEPA purposes. More importantly, the State document may have looked at a different purpose and need for the project, a different set of alternatives than the Federal agency would have looked at, and relied on different standards for analysis. The State, for example, may not have looked at the same factors that Federal agencies are required to consider, such as environmental justice and wetlands protection. Finally, no two State processes are alike, compounding confusion for projects that cross State lines. Thus, a Federal agency's reliance on State documents may lead to inconsistencies between Federal projects and agencies, different environmental goals and protections, confusion among the public, and unclear results for businesses and project applicants. The legislation also establishes arbitrary deadlines for the completion of NEPA analyses. Factors such as feasibility and engineering studies, non-Federal funding, conflicting priorities, local opposition, or applicant responsiveness are just a few examples of delays outside of the control of an agency. Arbitrary deadlines and provisions that automatically approve a project if the agency is unable to make a decision due to one of the factors described above will lead to increased litigation, more delays, and denied projects as agencies will have no choice but to deny a project if the review and analysis cannot be completed before the proposed deadlines. These comments illustrate a few of the many concerns we have with the legislation. The Administration would be happy to provide the Committee with a more thorough and exhaustive list of our substantive concerns with the legislation at the request of the Committee. In closing, when properly implemented, NEPA improves collaboration, consensus, accountability, and transparency surrounding government decision-making and actions. Our Nation's long-term prosperity depends upon our faithful stewardship of the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the land that supports and sustains us. Our country has been strengthened by the open, accountable, informed, and citizen- involved decision-making structure created by NEPA, and our economy has prospered. Sincerely, Christy Goldfuss, Managing Director, Council on Environmental Quality. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time to say to my colleague from Texas that this bill is about national security. The gentlewoman is right. We can all agree on the importance of national security and protecting our security, but making sure that when projects are planned they are implemented within a reasonable period of time. And we are talking about years--not days or weeks or even months--years for a permitting, years for examination to make sure that these are done carefully, but not decades, as happens now with a number of different projects that have been discussed over the last 2 days that, in their current state, without the kinds of repairs, without the kinds of increased improvements, without the kinds of additional safety and security protections that new projects bring online, we are more vulnerable, not less. I fear that the gentlewoman from Texas' amendment would do just that. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. GOODLATTE. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank my good friend for yielding to me. Maybe we can work together on this amendment because it is a simple carve-out. It should be narrow. It clarifies that the bill's provision does not apply to environmental reviews or permitting on other agencies' decisions that could deal with potential terrorist attack targets, such as chemical facilities and other critical infrastructure. I don't think that that is something that the gentleman and myself would disagree with and, particularly, the nuclear plants, which take a longer period of time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Reclaiming my time, I would say to the gentlewoman that the bill allows lots of time for each stage of the permitting process to cover and discover ways to make a project more secure, to make it safer, to improve it in a variety of different ways; and that the gentlewoman's amendment would harm the ability to do that, not help, because it would slow down the process under which we would have these new projects able to begin construction and then be completed. With that, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas will be postponed. Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Johnson of Georgia The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 printed in House Report 114-261. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Add, at the end of the bill, the following: (d) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act or the amendments made by this Act shall have the effect of changing or limiting any law or regulation that requires or provides for public comment or public participation in an agency decision making process. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, the purpose of this amendment is simple. It protects the right of the public to comment. This amendment reads: ``Nothing in this Act or the amendments made by this Act shall have the effect of changing or limiting any law or regulation that requires or provides for public comment or public participation in an agency decision making process.'' Now, yesterday, Mr. Chairman, the Pope, right here in this very room, called on each of us to pursue a common good, which he told us requires a courageous and responsible effort. And certainly, if we are going to protect the common good, it requires that we protect the right of the public to comment on projects that have an adverse impact on our precious environment, right there where they live. This amendment would restore the right of any member of the public to comment on construction projects that may have an environmental impact; and because of that, I don't expect any opposition to this amendment, Mr. Chairman. Like a number of well-respected environmental groups, I oppose H.R. 348, the so-called RAPID Act, which threatens public health and safety by putting a thumb on the scales of justice in favor of private sector businesses in the project approval process. It is yet another antiregulatory measure whose only design is to grease the wheels of the approval process of projects that are environmentally sensitive. Aside from creating duplicative and costly requirements that pertain to certain types of projects, the RAPID Act would also limit the right of the public to comment on these projects. This bill does that in two ways: first, by reducing opportunities for public input, and secondly, by fast-tracking [[Page H6247]] the approval process through arbitrary deadlines. Through an open, flexible, and timely process, NEPA empowers the public to weigh in on decisions. That means that the local farmer who owns land that would be affected by a Federal construction project-- let's say a nasty pipeline like Keystone--it ensures that that local farmer would have the ability and would stand on local footing with the construction industry and with the Federal Government. My amendment is vital to ensuring that the RAPID Act does not shut the public out of the process. I am sure that all minds agree that that is reasonable. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I do rise in opposition to this amendment. I do share, however, the interest of the gentleman from Georgia in promoting the common good, as mentioned by Pope Francis when he spoke in this Chamber yesterday. But the common good is people coming together to improve their lives by creating improved infrastructure for transportation, whether that is highways or mass transit, for delivering energy resources to places where that energy needs to be delivered, to improving the shipping lanes so that goods can be shipped to and from this country and within this country in ways that make it easier for consumers to receive the energy, the products, the transportation that they need and deserve. The RAPID Act will create jobs by ensuring that the Federal environmental review and permitting process works like it should. It will also make sure that these infrastructure projects that deliver the common good will do so in a reasonable period of time, so people won't have to wait 20 years, like we heard yesterday from the gentleman from Texas, about simply lowering the draft, the 8 feet lower, for ships to get up the waterway in east Texas to deliver goods and pick up goods from ports in that part of the country. Why 20 years to make a decision about dredging 8 feet from a waterway? The RAPID Act is drafted to make agencies operate efficiently and transparently. That is not happening in so many, many instances. But, it does not prevent citizens from participating in that process. In fact, the bill makes sure that agencies provide the public with reasonable public comment periods. It authorizes up to 60 days of public comment on Environmental Impact Statements, up to 30 days of comments on environmental assessments and other documents, and grants the lead agency authority to negotiate extensions or provide them on its own ``for good cause.'' {time} 1030 This is more than fair. By comparison, the National Environmental Policy Act, which has been cited many times on the other side of the aisle, only requires agencies to allow 45 days for public comment--not the 60 days provided in the RAPID Act--on draft environmental impact statements and 30 days for public comments on final environmental impact statements. The RAPID Act also reasonably requires that a person comment on an environmental document before challenging it in court and bring any suit within 6 months as opposed to 6 years. Opponents should not be able to delay a project indefinitely by playing ``hide the ball'' with agencies or by resting on their rights. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would like to respond. First, in the narrowed circumstances in which an agency may supplement an environmental impact statement under the bill, the lead agency ``may'' solicit comments from agencies and the public for not more than 30 days beginning on the date of the publication of the supplement. CEQ regulations require an agency to provide for a 45-day public review and comment period, although there is also a provision in the CEQ regulations that allows CEQ to approve alternative procedures for supplemental EISs if circumstances warrant a deviation from the normal process. Secondly, under the bill, each participating agency is to limit its comments on a project to areas within the authority and expertise of the agency and identify statutory authority for their comments. It specifically prohibits the lead agency from acting upon, responding to or including any document that is ``outside of the authority and expertise of the commenting participating agency.'' This is inconsistent with the CEQ regulations, which allow all agencies--whether local, tribal, State, or Federal--to comment on any substantive issue relative to the NEPA analysis, just as all members of the public should be able to do. So, finally, I would just point out that, if we are talking about efficiency and if we are talking about the common good, it does the public no good to cut out public comment from this process. If we can agree on that, then we can agree that this amendment is a good one. With that, I ask for its approval. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia will be postponed. The Committee will rise informally. The Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas) assumed the chair. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 139 (Friday, September 25, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 139 (Friday, September 25, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6232-H6247] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RESPONSIBLY AND PROFESSIONALLY INVIGORATING DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2015 General Leave Mr. MARINO.

COORDINATION OF AGENCY ADMINISTRATIVE OPERATIONS FOR EFFICIENT DECISIONMAKING. (a) In General.--Chapter 5 of part 1 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by inserting after subchapter II the following: ``SUBCHAPTER IIA--INTERAGENCY COORDINATION REGARDING PERMITTING ``Sec. 560. Coordination of agency administrative operations for efficient decisionmaking ``(a) Congressional Declaration of Purpose.--The purpose of this subchapter is to establish a framework and procedures to streamline, increase the efficiency of, and enhance coordination of agency administration of the regulatory review, environmental decisionmaking, and permitting process for projects undertaken, reviewed, or funded by Federal agencies. This subchapter will ensure that agencies administer the regulatory process in a manner that is efficient so that citizens are not burdened with regulatory excuses and time delays. ``(b) Definitions.--For purposes of this subchapter, the term-- ``(1) `agency' means any agency, department, or other unit of Federal, State, local, or Indian tribal government; ``(2) `category of projects' means 2 or more projects related by project type, potential environmental impacts, geographic location, or another similar project feature or characteristic; ``(3) `environmental assessment' means a concise public document for which a Federal agency is responsible that serves to-- ``(A) briefly provide sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact; ``(B) aid an agency's compliance with NEPA when no environmental impact statement is necessary; and ``(C) facilitate preparation of an environmental impact statement when one is necessary; ``(4) `environmental impact statement' means the detailed statement of significant environmental impacts required to be prepared under NEPA; ``(5) `environmental review' means the Federal agency procedures for preparing an environmental impact statement, environmental assessment, categorical exclusion, or other document under NEPA; ``(6) `environmental decisionmaking process' means the Federal agency procedures for undertaking and completion of any environmental permit, decision, approval, review, or study under any Federal law other than NEPA for a project subject to an environmental review; ``(7) `environmental document' means an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement, and includes any supplemental document or document prepared pursuant to a court order; [[Page H6233]] ``(8) `finding of no significant impact' means a document by a Federal agency briefly presenting the reasons why a project, not otherwise subject to a categorical exclusion, will not have a significant effect on the human environment and for which an environmental impact statement therefore will not be prepared; ``(9) `lead agency' means the Federal agency preparing or responsible for preparing the environmental document; ``(10) `NEPA' means the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.); ``(11) `project' means major Federal actions that are construction activities undertaken with Federal funds or that are construction activities that require approval by a permit or regulatory decision issued by a Federal agency; ``(12) `project sponsor' means the agency or other entity, including any private or public-private entity, that seeks approval for a project or is otherwise responsible for undertaking a project; and ``(13) `record of decision' means a document prepared by a lead agency under NEPA following an environmental impact statement that states the lead agency's decision, identifies the alternatives considered by the agency in reaching its decision and states whether all practicable means to avoid or minimize environmental harm from the alternative selected have been adopted, and if not, why they were not adopted. ``(c) Preparation of Environmental Documents.--Upon the request of the lead agency, the project sponsor shall be authorized to prepare any document for purposes of an environmental review required in support of any project or approval by the lead agency if the lead agency furnishes oversight in such preparation and independently evaluates such document and the document is approved and adopted by the lead agency prior to taking any action or making any approval based on such document. ``(d) Adoption and Use of Documents.-- ``(1) Documents prepared under nepa.-- ``(A) Not more than 1 environmental impact statement and 1 environmental assessment shall be prepared under NEPA for a project (except for supplemental environmental documents prepared under NEPA or environmental documents prepared pursuant to a court order), and, except as otherwise provided by law, the lead agency shall prepare the environmental impact statement or environmental assessment. After the lead agency issues a record of decision, no Federal agency responsible for making any approval for that project may rely on a document other than the environmental document prepared by the lead agency. ``(B) Upon the request of a project sponsor, a lead agency may adopt, use, or rely upon secondary and cumulative impact analyses included in any environmental document prepared under NEPA for projects in the same geographic area where the secondary and cumulative impact analyses provide information and data that pertains to the NEPA decision for the project under review. ``(2) State environmental documents; supplemental documents.-- ``(A) Upon the request of a project sponsor, a lead agency may adopt a document that has been prepared for a project under State laws and procedures as the environmental impact statement or environmental assessment for the project, provided that the State laws and procedures under which the document was prepared provide environmental protection and opportunities for public involvement that are substantially equivalent to NEPA. ``(B) An environmental document adopted under subparagraph (A) is deemed to satisfy the lead agency's obligation under NEPA to prepare an environmental impact statement or environmental assessment. ``(C) In the case of a document described in subparagraph (A), during the period after preparation of the document but before its adoption by the lead agency, the lead agency shall prepare and publish a supplement to that document if the lead agency determines that-- ``(i) a significant change has been made to the project that is relevant for purposes of environmental review of the project; or ``(ii) there have been significant changes in circumstances or availability of information relevant to the environmental review for the project. ``(D) If the agency prepares and publishes a supplemental document under subparagraph (C), the lead agency may solicit comments from agencies and the public on the supplemental document for a period of not more than 45 days beginning on the date of the publication of the supplement. ``(E) A lead agency shall issue its record of decision or finding of no significant impact, as appropriate, based upon the document adopted under subparagraph (A), and any supplements thereto. ``(3) Contemporaneous projects.--If the lead agency determines that there is a reasonable likelihood that the project will have similar environmental impacts as a similar project in geographical proximity to the project, and that similar project was subject to environmental review or similar State procedures within the 5-year period immediately preceding the date that the lead agency makes that determination, the lead agency may adopt the environmental document that resulted from that environmental review or similar State procedure. The lead agency may adopt such an environmental document, if it is prepared under State laws and procedures only upon making a favorable determination on such environmental document pursuant to paragraph (2)(A). ``(e) Participating Agencies.-- ``(1) In general.--The lead agency shall be responsible for inviting and designating participating agencies in accordance with this subsection. The lead agency shall provide the invitation or notice of the designation in writing. ``(2) Federal participating agencies.--Any Federal agency that is required to adopt the environmental document of the lead agency for a project shall be designated as a participating agency and shall collaborate on the preparation of the environmental document, unless the Federal agency informs the lead agency, in writing, by a time specified by the lead agency in the designation of the Federal agency that the Federal agency-- ``(A) has no jurisdiction or authority with respect to the project; ``(B) has no expertise or information relevant to the project; and ``(C) does not intend to submit comments on the project. ``(3) Invitation.--The lead agency shall identify, as early as practicable in the environmental review for a project, any agencies other than an agency described in paragraph (2) that may have an interest in the project, including, where appropriate, Governors of affected States, and heads of appropriate tribal and local (including county) governments, and shall invite such identified agencies and officials to become participating agencies in the environmental review for the project. The invitation shall set a deadline of 30 days for responses to be submitted, which may only be extended by the lead agency for good cause shown. Any agency that fails to respond prior to the deadline shall be deemed to have declined the invitation. ``(4) Effect of declining participating agency invitation.--Any agency that declines a designation or invitation by the lead agency to be a participating agency shall be precluded from submitting comments on any document prepared under NEPA for that project or taking any measures to oppose, based on the environmental review, any permit, license, or approval related to that project. ``(5) Effect of designation.--Designation as a participating agency under this subsection does not imply that the participating agency-- ``(A) supports a proposed project; or ``(B) has any jurisdiction over, or special expertise with respect to evaluation of, the project. ``(6) Cooperating agency.--A participating agency may also be designated by a lead agency as a `cooperating agency' under the regulations contained in part 1500 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on January 1, 2011. Designation as a cooperating agency shall have no effect on designation as participating agency. No agency that is not a participating agency may be designated as a cooperating agency. ``(7) Concurrent reviews.--Each Federal agency shall-- ``(A) carry out obligations of the Federal agency under other applicable law concurrently and in conjunction with the review required under NEPA; and ``(B) in accordance with the rules made by the Council on Environmental Quality pursuant to subsection (n)(1), make and carry out such rules, policies, and procedures as may be reasonably necessary to enable the agency to ensure completion of the environmental review and environmental decisionmaking process in a timely, coordinated, and environmentally responsible manner. ``(8) Comments.--Each participating agency shall limit its comments on a project to areas that are within the authority and expertise of such participating agency. Each participating agency shall identify in such comments the statutory authority of the participating agency pertaining to the subject matter of its comments. The lead agency shall not act upon, respond to or include in any document prepared under NEPA, any comment submitted by a participating agency that concerns matters that are outside of the authority and expertise of the commenting participating agency. ``(f) Project Initiation Request.-- ``(1) Notice.--A project sponsor shall provide the Federal agency responsible for undertaking a project with notice of the initiation of the project by providing a description of the proposed project, the general location of the proposed project, and a statement of any Federal approvals anticipated to be necessary for the proposed project, for the purpose of informing the Federal agency that the environmental review should be initiated. ``(2) Lead agency initiation.--The agency receiving a project initiation notice under paragraph (1) shall promptly identify the lead agency for the project, and the lead agency shall initiate the environmental review within a period of 45 days after receiving the notice required by paragraph (1) by inviting or designating agencies to become participating agencies, or, where the lead agency determines that no participating agencies are required for the project, by taking such other actions that are reasonable and necessary to initiate the environmental review. ``(g) Alternatives Analysis.-- ``(1) Participation.--As early as practicable during the environmental review, but no later than during scoping for a project requiring the preparation of an environmental impact statement, the lead agency shall provide an opportunity for involvement by cooperating agencies in determining the range of alternatives to be considered for a project. ``(2) Range of alternatives.--Following participation under paragraph (1), the lead agency shall determine the range of alternatives for consideration in any document which the lead agency is responsible for preparing for the project, subject to the following limitations: ``(A) No evaluation of certain alternatives.--No Federal agency shall evaluate any alternative that was identified but not carried forward for detailed evaluation in an environmental document or evaluated and not selected in any environmental document prepared under NEPA for the same project. [[Page H6234]] ``(B) Only feasible alternatives evaluated.--Where a project is being constructed, managed, funded, or undertaken by a project sponsor that is not a Federal agency, Federal agencies shall only be required to evaluate alternatives that the project sponsor could feasibly undertake, consistent with the purpose of and the need for the project, including alternatives that can be undertaken by the project sponsor and that are technically and economically feasible. ``(3) Methodologies.-- ``(A) In general.--The lead agency shall determine, in collaboration with cooperating agencies at appropriate times during the environmental review, the methodologies to be used and the level of detail required in the analysis of each alternative for a project. The lead agency shall include in the environmental document a description of the methodologies used and how the methodologies were selected. ``(B) No evaluation of inappropriate alternatives.--When a lead agency determines that an alternative does not meet the purpose and need for a project, that alternative is not required to be evaluated in detail in an environmental document. ``(4) Preferred alternative.--At the discretion of the lead agency, the preferred alternative for a project, after being identified, may be developed to a higher level of detail than other alternatives in order to facilitate the development of mitigation measures or concurrent compliance with other applicable laws if the lead agency determines that the development of such higher level of detail will not prevent the lead agency from making an impartial decision as to whether to accept another alternative which is being considered in the environmental review. ``(5) Employment analysis.--The evaluation of each alternative in an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment shall identify the potential effects of the alternative on employment, including potential short- term and long-term employment increases and reductions and shifts in employment. ``(h) Coordination and Scheduling.-- ``(1) Coordination plan.-- ``(A) In general.--The lead agency shall establish and implement a plan for coordinating public and agency participation in and comment on the environmental review for a project or category of projects to facilitate the expeditious resolution of the environmental review. ``(B) Schedule.-- ``(i) In general.--The lead agency shall establish as part of the coordination plan for a project, after consultation with each participating agency and, where applicable, the project sponsor, a schedule for completion of the environmental review. The schedule shall include deadlines, consistent with subsection (i), for decisions under any other Federal laws (including the issuance or denial of a permit or license) relating to the project that is covered by the schedule. ``(ii) Factors for consideration.--In establishing the schedule, the lead agency shall consider factors such as-- ``(I) the responsibilities of participating agencies under applicable laws; ``(II) resources available to the participating agencies; ``(III) overall size and complexity of the project; ``(IV) overall schedule for and cost of the project; ``(V) the sensitivity of the natural and historic resources that could be affected by the project; and ``(VI) the extent to which similar projects in geographic proximity were recently subject to environmental review or similar State procedures. ``(iii) Compliance with the schedule.-- ``(I) All participating agencies shall comply with the time periods established in the schedule or with any modified time periods, where the lead agency modifies the schedule pursuant to subparagraph (D). ``(II) The lead agency shall disregard and shall not respond to or include in any document prepared under NEPA, any comment or information submitted or any finding made by a participating agency that is outside of the time period established in the schedule or modification pursuant to subparagraph (D) for that agency's comment, submission or finding. ``(III) If a participating agency fails to object in writing to a lead agency decision, finding or request for concurrence within the time period established under law or by the lead agency, the agency shall be deemed to have concurred in the decision, finding or request. ``(C) Consistency with other time periods.--A schedule under subparagraph (B) shall be consistent with any other relevant time periods established under Federal law. ``(D) Modification.--The lead agency may-- ``(i) lengthen a schedule established under subparagraph (B) for good cause;

Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, this amendment makes numerous technical and other minor wording changes to the bill. Together, these revisions clarify that the bill does not authorize duplicative agency review proceedings, does not require duplicative project notification and initiation of agency review procedures, and does not allow permitting decisions to be challenged in court by parties who did not first present their arguments in the administrative proceedings that produced the challenged permit. The amendment constitutes an agreement reached between the Judiciary Committee and the other committee of jurisdiction, the Natural Resources Committee. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim time in opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed to the amendment. The CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Arizona? There was no objection. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5 minutes. =========================== NOTE =========================== September 25, 2015, on page H6236, the following appeared: There was no objection. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, the The online version should be corrected to read: There was no objection. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, the ========================= END NOTE ========================= Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, the manager's amendment has been categorized as a technical amendment. We are told the amendment is designed to clarify the bill, which is being sold as the answer to our Nation's economic woes. The bill is supposed to streamline government environmental reviews, and this amendment is supposed to streamline the underlying bill. Unfortunately, the only thing that is being streamlined here are the facts about NEPA. Mr. Chairman, the facts are not in the Republicans' favor. For more than 40 years, NEPA has ensured that federally funded projects are carried out in a transparent and cost-effective manner, while fostering public participation in the decisionmaking process and minimizing impacts to the environment. In fact, NEPA often provides the only forum for citizens to engage in major Federal actions that affect our health, well-being, and the environment. NEPA saves millions of dollars and is a tool for environmental justice. NEPA gave the confederated Salish and Kootenai tribal governments and citizen groups an opportunity to engage in the design of U.S. 93 in western Montana, resulting in a project that successfully addressed safety, environmental, family farming, and cultural concerns. {time} 0915 NEPA's success stories, where the process saves money and improves the quality of life for people impacted by Federal decisions, go on and on. My Republican colleagues tend to streamline these stories so we never get a chance to hear them. Here are some facts my Republican colleagues might have missed during their streamlining: 95 percent of all NEPA analyses are completed through categorical exclusion, which generally requires only a few days. Less than 5 percent of NEPA actions require an environmental assessment, and less than 1 percent require a full EIS. Those projects that do require an EIS tend to be the largest, most complex. The delays that do occur are more likely the result of local opposition, a lack of funding, or changes in the project's scope. Agency data, interviews with agency officials, and available studies show that most NEPA analyses do not result in litigation; yet, the underlying bill seeks to restrict judicial review, and the manager's amendment would create a judicial bar to the courthouse doors before a party could seek judicial review. Typically, there have been fewer than 100 cases per year nationwide in the last decade even though the NEPA review process is applied to tens of thousands of government actions each year and tens of thousands more that are classified as exempt from review based on categorical exclusions. NEPA is not a barrier to development. It is a tool for better decision-making. The only reason to avoid NEPA or to weaken it is so that you can make decisions less carefully. This is the purpose of the legislation. Apparently, the bill itself was not drafted very carefully; so, we have a manager's amendment to fix all the errors. This manager's amendment is just more proof that my Republican colleagues should leave NEPA alone because their understanding of how it works and what it does is, unfortunately, too streamlined. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Lowenthal The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in House Report 114-261. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 14, line 11, insert after the period at the end the following: ``No alternative may be deemed feasible if the alternative does not adequately address risks associated with flooding, wildfire, and climate change.'' The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lowenthal) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. As my fellow Californian Ronald Reagan once said, ``There you go again.'' Attacks on NEPA have become almost a common, weekly occurrence in this Congress, and H.R. 348 is just the latest iteration. We should really call this bill the VAPID Act because it is tired, unimaginative, and a ploy to undermine one of our bedrock environmental laws: NEPA. My amendment would not fix all of this bill's problems, but it certainly would inject some small sense of fiscal responsibility into this legislation that seemingly has been designed for wasting taxpayers' money. Restricting the ability of the public to comment on proposed projects virtually guarantees more lawsuits and more hastily approved projects that [[Page H6237]] could turn into embarrassing boondoggles. Particularly in the face of climate change, we must take special care to ensure that the future value of projects is considered. This means thoroughly evaluating the risks associated with more frequent and intense wildfires as well as flooding caused by stronger storms and higher sea levels. Doing these reviews will not delay projects. As was pointed out by the ranking member, it is a fact that 95 percent of all NEPA analyses are completed through categorical exclusions, which generally require only a few days to process. Less than 5 percent require an environmental assessment, and less than 1 percent require a full environmental impact statement, or an EIS. Those projects that do require an EIS tend to be the largest and most complex, and delays that do occur are more likely the result of local opposition, a lack of funding, or changes in the project's scope, not due to NEPA. Making sure that roads aren't wiped out by a future storm surge or that activities in our national forests don't spark fires or that government-financed and -permitted actions are resilient to climate change is the least we can do to protect taxpayers and the environment. To do this, we need to keep NEPA strong, not weaken it by making government actions less transparent. The current NEPA process allows for the full consideration of the costs and the benefits of proposed actions and leads to environmentally and economically sound outcomes. I urge a ``yea'' vote on my amendment because the threats associated with climate change and related natural hazards are too great for this House to continue to ignore. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, by its terms, the amendment brands infeasible--and, thus, barred from further evaluation--project alternatives that do not appear at the outset of the review process to adequately address risks associated with flooding, wildfire, and climate change. With all due respect, that puts the cart before the horse. The bill is intended to allow the review of alternatives that are technically and economically feasible. It is entirely possible that, during the course of review, a technically and economically feasible alternative that appears initially to be inadequate to address these risks could, on further review, be found to be adequate or to be improved to be adequate. It might even ultimately be found to be the best alternative under review. Why should we prematurely end the evaluation of alternatives that could ultimately prove adequate with regard to these types of risks? This does not prevent the review process. What it does prevent is someone waiting to get in at the last moment, which has been 5 or 6 years later, to jam the system up in court, therefore crushing jobs and letting regulation run rampant. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I just want to comment that risks due to flooding, to stronger storms, to climate change are not putting the cart before the horse. I am simply asking that we don't waste taxpayers' money by not considering these risks. This is a fiscally sound amendment, and I urge an ``aye'' vote. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Lowenthal). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed. Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Grijalva The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in House Report 114-261. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 15, after line 21, insert the following: ``(6) Low-income and communities of color analysis.--The evaluation of each alternative in an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment shall identify the potential effects of the alternative on low-income communities and communities of color.''. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, is a 45-year-old law which stands, basically, for two things: that the Federal Government should consider alternatives before taking action that can impact people's lives and that the public should have the opportunity to comment on those alternatives before a final decision is made. House Republicans oppose both of these simple principles and so they attack NEPA time after time, year after year. The bill before us today is just a rerun of those attacks. My amendment, unfortunately, cannot fix this bill. In fact, my amendment is really just proof of what is so dangerous about the RAPID Act. Among the critical issues that can be addressed through our existing NEPA process is ensuring environmental justice. Bills like the one we are considering today seek to short-circuit that process; so, they seek to short-circuit environmental justice concerns. My amendment would put environmental justice considerations back in the process created by this legislation; but we would not even need this amendment if Republicans would just leave NEPA alone. Twenty-one years ago President Bill Clinton issued his executive order on environmental justice. After decades of hard work, struggle, some victories along the way, the promise of environmental justice for all communities remains unfulfilled. While environmental toxins and pollution know no class or race, low- income communities and communities of color bear a disproportionate share of adverse environmental consequences. Low-income communities and communities of color are routinely targeted to host facilities that have negative environmental impacts, such as landfills, refineries, chemical plants, freeways, and ports. Seventy-eight percent of African Americans live within 30 miles of a coal-fired power plant. Nearly one out of every two Latinos lives in the country's top 25 most ozone-polluted cities. For decades, these communities have been battling environmental injustices and have been seeking to build healthy, livable, and sustainable communities. NEPA recognizes that, when the public and Federal experts work together, better decisions are made. We have not solved the problem yet, but the solution is a more inclusive, more rigorous use of the NEPA process, not these constant, industry-friendly attacks on the law. Every person has the right to live, work, and play in a healthy and safe environment; yet, too often, the health of too many Americans is determined by their race, class, ZIP code, and street address. It is unfortunate and inefficient to have to come down here to protect these issues one by one for each and every Republican bill that is presented. The adoption of my amendment would keep H.R. 348 from destroying the progress we have made on issues for communities of color, but it doesn't solve the problem. A far better approach would be to drop H.R. 348 and to instead invest in making NEPA stronger and more inclusive than ever. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment. The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. [[Page H6238]] There was no objection. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, among those who suffer most unfairly from poor government decision-making are the communities the gentleman's amendment addresses. For example, growing research shows that the costs of new regulations often have regressive effects on those with lower incomes. When poor government decision-making occurs in the permit review process, similar unfair effects may occur. The gentleman's amendment guards against this by requiring agencies to identify and reveal the potential adverse effects of project alternatives on low-income communities and communities of color. Once identified and revealed, of course, any such effects may be avoided, minimized, or mitigated. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will be postponed. {time} 0930 Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Gallego The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in House Report 114-261. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Chair, I rise to offer an amendment. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.

The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gallego) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer a commonsense amendment to the RAPID Act, a misguided bill that will disempower local leaders, including tribal leaders, and threaten the health and safety of our communities and their communities. As a member of the Natural Resources Committee, time and time again I have witnessed the Republican majority siding with big business and gutting bedrock environmental safeguards that for decades have protected our families and our natural heritage. My Republican friends claim that this bill is intended to protect the interest of our States and Native American tribes. Mr. Chair, we already have a law on the books for that purpose. It is called the National Environmental Policy Act, NEPA, and it works. At its heart, NEPA ensures that our government is accountable to the people. This critical law has protected the environment for more than 40 years without imposing arbitrary deadlines or limiting vital public input. It guarantees the public an opportunity to review and comment on actions proposed by the government, enabling important perspectives that would otherwise go unnoticed. In this way, NEPA can actually serve as a check on Big Government. Unfortunately, the RAPID Act promises the opposite, a deeply flawed process that would diminish the voice of State, local, and tribal communities. The RAPID Act will also establish a new regulatory framework that purposely overrides the NEPA review process, limiting public input and consequently undermining the quality and integrity of Federal agency decisions. Among its many dangerous provisions, the bill will also trigger the automatic approval of construction projects if agencies miss arbitrary deadlines, regardless of the complexity or hazard posed by such potential projects. Though the bill includes some extremely limited and narrow exceptions for these deadlines, as it is currently written, it fails to extend those deadlines for our local communities. My amendment would simply create a new good cause exception that would allow a deadline to be extended if a request is made from a local- or State-elected official or a local tribal leader. While my amendment does not fix all the problems in the underlying bill, it ensures that, if this bill should pass, our local and tribal leaders will continue to be empowered, as they are currently under NEPA. I support the goal of reducing red tape, but stripping away the ability of our local communities to have their voices heard is undemocratic and unacceptable. Mr. Chair, special interests don't need us to fight for them. Our communities do. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and to stand with our local and tribal leaders when it comes to projects in their own back yards that impact their homes, families, and business. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would allow agencies to escape the bill's streamlined permitting deadlines simply because an elected State or local official or a local tribal official asks for an extension. The amendment contains no requirement that a Federal agency find the compelling basis for an extension or even a significant basis or even any substantive basis at all. On the contrary, all that a recalcitrant Federal agency, a project opponent, or anyone else would need to defeat an efficient permitting decision is to find an elected State or local official or a local tribal official willing to put in an extension request for them. The potential for abuse of this proposed provision by those who only seek delay for delay's sake or who seek to kill worthy projects outright is obvious. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gallego). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will be postponed. Amendment No. 5 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in House Report 114-261. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 24, strike line 19 and all that follows through page 25, line 12. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I hope that we will find common ground on really responding to a great concern that I think all Americans should be concerned about. Although this bill is called the RAPID Act, were it to become law, in the present form, a permit or license for a project would be deemed approved if the reviewing agency does not issue the requested permit or license within 90 to 120 days. That is a short period of [[Page H6239]] time for complex regulatory structures that deal with complex industries. An industry that I represent in Houston, Texas, the energy industry, has complex needs and, as well, complex impacts and consequences if we do not deal with the agencies responsible, if the DOE, for example, does not do its due diligence. Now, let me say this, Mr. Chairman. These particular permits are done sooner than 90 to 120 days. But what this bill says is, if the agency is engaged in a very complex deliberative thought process, then, if they reach that deadline and they still have not finished, they are then, if you will, throwing to the side all of the safety issues and issues dealing with the protection of the American people under the bus. My amendment strikes the provision, deeming approved any project for which an agency does not meet the deadlines contained in the bill. I can appreciate some of the frustrations through the review process by the National Environmental Policy Act, but the cure is not this bill. If a Federal agency has failed to approve or disapprove a project or make the required finding, we are in trouble. Babies are in trouble with formula. Senior citizens are in trouble with various pharmaceuticals. They are in trouble. And then, if we run up against the deadline, there is no response. Second, frequently there are times when it is the case that the complexity of the issues, as I said, warrant us to do so. In other words, what this bill is saying is: To heck with reason and good judgment. We do not care. To heck with protecting the American people. We do not care. As I listened intently and intensely to the Pope's words yesterday, I offer this quote: Moses provided us with a good synthesis of your work. You are asked to protect--and speaking to us--by means of the law, the image, and likeness fashioned by God on every human face. This bill smacks in the face of that instruction. I believe that this amendment is worthy of passing. Mr. Chair, if H.R. 348, the so-called RAPID Act, were to become law in its present form, a permit or license for project would be ``deemed'' approved if the reviewing agency does not issue the requested permit or license within 90-120 days. My amendment strikes the provision deeming approved any project for which agency does not meet deadlines contained in the bill. Mr. Chairman, I can appreciate some of the frustrations expressed by many of our friends across the aisle when it comes to review process mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). But the cure they propose in H.R. 348 is an example of a medicine that is worse than the disease. Under H.R. 348, if a federal agency fails to approve or disapprove the project or make the required finding of the termination within the applicable deadline, which is either 90 days or 120 days, depending on the situation, then the project is automatically deemed approved by such agency. This creates a set of unintended consequences. First, as an agency is up against that deadline and legitimate work is yet to be completed, it is likely to disapprove the project simply because the issues have not been vetted. Second, frequently there are times when it is the case that the complexity of issues that need to be resolved necessitates a longer review period, rather than an arbitrary limit. So if H.R. 348 were to become law the most likely outcome is that federal agencies would be required to make decisions based on incomplete information, or information that may not be available within the stringent deadlines, and to deny applications that otherwise would have been approved, but for lack of sufficient review time. In other words, fewer projects would be approved, not more. Mr. Chairman, H.R. 348 ostensibly seeks to make a minor procedure adjustment to the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). In reality, however, H.R. 348 would radically transform the NEPA review process, and not for the better either. For more than 40 years, NEPA has been the law of the land and has provided a remarkably effective framework for all types of projects (not just construction projects) that require federal approval pursuant to a federal law, such as the Clean Air Act. For these reasons, I urge all Members to support the Jackson Lee Amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, the American people desperately need new jobs. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, America's labor force participation rate remains mired among historic lows. Almost 94 million Americans who could work are outside the workforce. That is more than the population of all but 12 of the world's countries and more than every other country in the Western Hemisphere, except for Brazil and Mexico. We face this historically low rate not because Americans don't want to work, but because so many Americans have despaired of any hope of finding a new full-time job and have abandoned the workforce. The RAPID Act offers strong help to reverse this tragedy, restore the hope, and produce millions of new jobs. We must pass the bill, not weaken it, to provide these new high-wage jobs. The gentlewoman's amendment would weaken the bill in one of the worst possible ways. It would remove the clear consequences in the bill for agencies that refuse to follow the bill's deadlines. That consequence is to deem permits approved if agencies refuse to approve or deny them within those deadlines. Mr. Chairman, the bill provides 4\1/2\ years for agencies to complete their environmental reviews for new permit applications and reasonable and additional time for agencies to wrap up final permit approvals or denials after that; 4\1/2\ years is more time than it took the United States to fight and win World War II. If agencies can't wrap up their environmental reviews in that much time and then meet the bill's remaining deadlines, there is something terribly wrong with the agencies. The prospect of facing a default approval at the end of the substantial time the bill grants is an eminently reasonable way to assure that agencies will conduct full reviews and wrap their work up in time to make up or down decisions on their own. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. I reserve the balance of my time Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I am so glad my colleague mentioned the question of jobs. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 2 minutes remaining. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I am very glad my colleague mentioned jobs because none of us here are fighting against jobs. In fact, I happen to be supporting the full employment legislation that my good friend, Congressman John Conyers, has offered and I have joined. We are not here speaking against jobs. We are speaking for the American people. We are trying to explain the complexity of the permitting process. Whether it is for drilling, whether it is to deal with construction, whether it is to deal with complex environmental issues that have to be addressed impacting the American people or, for example, whether it is dealing with the Volkswagen company that saw fit to do the technology to undermine viable rules that the American automobile industry was complying with, definitely impacting jobs, I would have hoped that we would have had a process of permitting or a process of determining whether the Volkswagen company was violating these rules that were here to help the issue of pollution and other issues here, but also undermining the jobs of our own American companies. Let me say that the Jackson Lee amendment, in essence, is to suggest that there is a lot of complexity that my friends on the other side of the aisle with the RAPID Act--the very name of it suggests that we are throwing judgment to the wind. All we want to do is to move forward, even if they are ill. And we don't want the taxpayer dollars that have asked these workers in these agencies who have the expertise from the DOE, to the FDA and beyond-- Food and Drug Administration, Department of Energy--to protect us. I believe, Mr. Chairman, that my amendment, by eliminating the 90 to 120, deeming it approved in the midst [[Page H6240]] of a crisis when it is not fit to be approved, is an amendment that this body should pass. I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment because I am here to protect the American people and to do justly, as has been given to us in a wonderful message yesterday by Pope Francis. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining? The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 2\1/2\ minutes remaining. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chair, I want to just give a couple of examples of the timing factor that we are seeing that the agencies just are not executing properly. Cape Wind Project: For more than 12 years--12 years--they were waiting for permits to build an operation that would create jobs and renewable energy. 12 years. Orange County toll road in Orange County, California: There was a 12- year delay there as well. The project was extended tens of millions of dollars because of the delay there, and jobs were lost because of that. Charleston Harbor, Savannah Port dredging project: Again, there was a decade of delays in permitting because agencies are just sitting around, not taking the job responsibly. They never would survive in private industry if they operated under those conditions. So those are a few examples of the cost in dollars and cents and the jobs that are lost because of these agencies not performing their responsibilities. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas will be postponed. {time} 0945 Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mrs. Dingell The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in House Report 114-261. Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 25, line 4, insert before the period at the end the following: ``, unless the project would limit access to or opportunities for hunting or fishing, or impact a species listed as an endangered species or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.)''. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Michigan. Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA as we frequently shorthand it, is one of our bedrock conservation laws, and it has a simple premise: look before you leap. Its timelines are designed to provide transparency and public participation in government. H.R. 348 would move us in the opposite direction. My amendment would not fix all of the problems with this bill, but it would allow hunters, anglers, and wildlife enthusiasts to continue to enjoy the benefits that NEPA provides. Several recent stories help explain the benefits of NEPA, including the following: Recently, a plan to improve U.S. 23 in my home State of Michigan was modified to avoid the largest loss of wetlands in our State's history. Not only will this help improve the biodiversity of the region, but it will also preserve that habitat for migratory waterfowl prized by hunters. This land could have been lost and hunters would have had their access reduced if not for the robust comment process that NEPA provides. There are similar stories across the country. In 2013, changes to the Army Corps of Engineers' plan to increase storage capacity at the John Redmond Reservoir in Kansas were needed to protect prime deer and turkey hunting areas, as well as avoid the destruction of a local boat ramp providing fishermen access to the lake. In 2004, sportsmen's groups from across the country banded together during the NEPA review process and caused BLM to withdraw a proposal to allow oil and gas drilling along the Rocky Mountain Front in Montana. The list goes on and on, but the point is that none of these positive outcomes would have been achieved without a strong NEPA process that encourages public participation instead of limiting it. Furthermore, the habitats utilized by game and sports fishermen are the same as those utilized by endangered fish, wildlife, and plants. Destroying one destroys the other, which is why NEPA must allow for a thorough review of potential impacts to listed species. My amendment would ensure these protections will be preserved so hunters, fishermen, and American wildlife will continue to benefit from them. There is absolutely no legitimate reason to limit public oversight of taxpayer-funded projects. NEPA shines a light on proposed government actions and helps local citizens provide new information and ideas, improve projects, and ensure sustainable decisionmaking. It helps Federal authorities consider a range of alternatives, often resulting in lower costs to the public, something I am sure everyone here supports. NEPA is a quintessentially American, quintessentially small- government law. It reinforces the rights of people to hold their government accountable. A host of environmental groups have endorsed my amendment, but I am particularly pleased to have the support of Trout Unlimited, because my amendment would help protect the rights of anglers. If you hunt, you fish or have constituents who do, you should support a strong NEPA and vote for my amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, one of the linchpins of the RAPID Act is its set of provisions that: deem a permit approved if the permitting agency refuses to meet the bill's reasonable deadlines; and, prohibit a court from overturning a permit approval simply because the permit was deemed approved when deadlines expired before action was taken. If we do not include consequences like these in the bill, how will we ever ensure that recalcitrant, foot-dragging Federal agencies will achieve the bill's goal of streamlined permit decisions? The amendment, however, removes all consequences for agencies' foot- dragging so long as the projects at issue would either limit access to or opportunities for hunting or fishing or impact an endangered or threatened species. That is in the bill. The amendment's sponsor offers no sound reason to do this. The bill does not require projects with these kinds of impacts to be approved. It just requires that permitting decisions, up or down, be reached after, at most, 4\1/2\ years of environmental review. Surely that is enough time to review all kinds of projects, including those that limit access to or opportunities for hunting or fishing or impact endangered or threatened species. To make matters worse, the bill would allow agencies to drag their feet without consequences even if a project had a beneficial impact on an endangered or threatened species. Why should we allow delay for that? I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I want to quickly respond to the comments made by my colleague on the other side of the aisle. We often hear that NEPA is a scapegoat for projects being delayed, but as the GAO and others have found, outside issues, including the complexity of the project, local opposition and, most importantly, funding issues are almost always the cause of delays. If we adequately funded highway and infrastructure projects, we wouldn't be seeing so many delays the majority is [[Page H6241]] so concerned with. NEPA is a convenient excuse, but the facts simply don't support the claim that it is the root cause of projects being delayed. We should not be limiting the public's ability to comment on government decisions; but, instead, we should be enhancing them. This bill does the opposite. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and oppose the underlying bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, my colleague forgets to mention the fact that the lead Federal agency in this is responsible for maintaining a schedule, just like we do in private industry, just like we do in our own homes. That agency is responsible for going to the States and to the locals and other Federal agencies to make sure things are being done. Unfortunately, here in D.C., and sometimes at the State level, the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing, and this is making agencies responsible for that. It is just common sense. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Michigan will be postponed. Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Peters The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 printed in House Report 114-261. Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 27, strike line 11 and all that follows through page 28, line 4, and redesignate provisions accordingly. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentleman from California (Mr. Peters) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, before I entered public service, I practiced environmental law for 15 years in large firms, in a government office, and in my own firm. Through that experience, I learned firsthand of the frustration that many businesses and local governments face when they try to navigate overly complex and underly responsive permit processes. I also know from experience that time is money, and often a business seeking a permit is paying dearly to hold a property or to service a loan while it waits for that permit to be issued. That is why I have often said that for applicants, ``no'' is the second best answer. Tell us ``no'' or tell us how, but don't string us along. That is why I appreciate the spirit of the RAPID Act. I don't think it is the perfect answer. Frankly, I don't think it will become law. I am working on some other streamlining strategies that I think are superior and might have the bipartisan support that both would get them through this Chamber and the Senate and get them signed into law by President Obama. As I told my colleagues on the Committee on the Judiciary, I will vote for the RAPID Act if Congress adopts my amendment and does not pass restrictions on considering the role of greenhouse gasses and climate change on our environment. My amendment would simply eliminate subsection (k) of the bill, a section that explicitly prohibits any consideration of the social cost of carbon. For too long we have heard that we have to choose between a prosperous economy and a clean environment. San Diegans and people around the country know that is a false choice. We can and we must provide economic opportunity and clean air and clean water for future generations. That means providing businesses and communities with regulatory certainty to help them plan and invest in the future, and it also means that we use this streamlined process, with tight and reliable deadlines, to analyze the economic, environmental, and social costs of carbon dioxide emissions. As highlighted in former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg's bipartisan Risky Business report, accounting for the social cost of carbon and preparing for climate change is just smart business practice. The costs of carbon include financial losses from sea level rise. If we continue on our current path of carbon emissions, by 2050, between 66 and 106 billion dollars worth of existing coastal property will likely be below sea level nationwide. Eighty-seven percent of all Californians live in coastal counties, and 80 percent of the State's GDP is derived from those counties. Climate affects energy supply costs. Greenhouse gas-driven changes in temperature, catalyzed by burning fossil fuels, would require us to build new power generation facilities to help cool homes and businesses that Risky Business estimates will cost residential and commercial ratepayers as much as $12 billion a year. That is $12 billion that could be used by families to put their kids through school or buy a home, or by businesses to hire more employees. Climate affects the cost of national defense. In 2014, the Pentagon issued a report on the security risks associated with profound changes to global climate and the environment. The report found that climate change poses an immediate threat to national security. That will put additional upward pressure on our already-stressed defense budget. Climate affects agriculture, water supply, fire preparedness. In California, the largest agriculture producing State in the country, we are in the fourth year of what has been one of the worst droughts in recorded history. Communities across the State are facing water shortages. Dry conditions have extended our fire season to be nearly a year-round concern. Given the stakes associated with carbon emissions on coastal property, energy, defense, our food supply, fires, and our quality of life, shouldn't we at least understand the long-term costs associated with the project? This bill could hold the line on responsiveness and provide long-term certainty to businesses without burying our collective heads in the sand on the costs of carbon, one of the main environmental impacts this environmental law must confront. By stripping out subsection (k) and allowing us to consider the real costs of carbon on our economy, my amendment rejects the false choice between a prosperous economy and a healthy climate. We can and we must have both. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chairman, the amendment seeks to strike the bill's prohibition against agency use in permitting reviews of the Obama administration's pronouncements on the social costs of carbon, but this prohibition was adopted last term for a very good reason. The administration's social cost of carbon estimate is junk science. To be specific, multiple commentators on the administration's findings about the social cost of carbon argue that carbon's social cost is an unknown quantity, that social cost of carbon analysts can get just about any result they desire by fiddling with nonvalidated climate parameters, made-up damage functions, and below-market discount rates, and that social cost of carbon analysis is computer-aided sophistry, its political function being to make renewable energy look like a bargain at any price and fossil energy look unaffordable, no matter how cheap. Junk science and sophistry has no place standing between hard-working Americans and new, high-paying jobs. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining? The CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 30 seconds remaining. [[Page H6242]] Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I have two responses. One, this is not President Obama's agenda. This is the agenda of a bipartisan report, Risky Business, the Department of Defense, and a number of other people who have recognized this is a real problem we have to confront. Second, I would say to the gentleman: Let the science work itself out through the process. There is plenty of science that is questioned in the NEPA process. There is no other point at which this body has prevented a discussion of any content except here. Let the process work it out. I will be with you on your timelines. We will get businesses the certainty that they deserve. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. {time} 1000 Mr. MARINO. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith). Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania and fellow member of the Judiciary Committee for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment. The social cost of carbon is a flawed concept that should play no role in the environmental decisionmaking process. It is based on speculative formulas and has no basis in reality. Formulas can easily be manipulated to support any costly regulation. The social cost of carbon is a political tool the Obama administration uses to impose its extreme agenda on the American people. It is also another way that the administration tries to use secret science and data to justify questionable rulemaking. Speculating on the social cost of carbon should be restricted, not expanded. For these reasons, an agency should not use the social cost of carbon in its environmental review or in its environmental decisionmaking process. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Peters). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed. Amendment No. 8 Offered by Mr. Gosar The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 printed in House Report 114-261. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 28, line 1, insert after ``substantially related document,'' the following: ``the draft guidance entitled: `Revised Draft Guidance for Federal Departments and Agencies on Consideration of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the Effects of Climate change in NEPA Reviews' (79 Fed. Reg. 77801), or any successor thereto or substantially related document,''. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer a commonsense amendment that will protect American jobs and our economy by prohibiting Federal agencies from being forced to follow job-killing and unlawful draft guidance that sneakily seeks to implement Federal policies that pave the way for cap-and-trade-like mandates. Congress and the American people have repeatedly rejected cap-and- trade proposals pushed by this President and his Big Government allies. Knowing he can't lawfully enact a carbon dioxide tax plan, President Obama has chosen to circumvent Congress and is now seeking to address climate change by playing loose and getting creative with the Clean Air Act as well as through an unlawful guidance issued in December 2014. The underlying bill already prohibits Federal agencies from utilizing the social cost of carbon valuation. Furthermore, the social cost of carbon valuation was rejected four times by this very body last Congress. My simple, clarifying amendment adds to the Obama administration's revised draft guidance for greenhouse gas emissions and the effects of climate change that were issued by the White House in December 2014 to the definition for social cost of carbon in the bill. This straightforward amendment is common sense, as this deeply flawed guidance instructs agencies to include a controversial measurement of the social cost of carbon into their analyses and is the Obama administration's latest tool for attempting to implement this terrible new model that has consistently been rejected by the House. Roger Martella, a self-described lifelong environmentalist and career environmental lawyer, testified at the May 2015 House Natural Resources Committee hearing on the revised guidance and the flaws associated with the social cost of carbon model, stating: The `` `social cost of carbon' estimates suffer from a number of significant flaws that should exclude them from the NEPA process. ``First, projected costs of carbon emissions can be manipulated by changing key parameters such as timeframes, discount rates, and other values that have no relation to a given project undergoing review. As a result, applying social cost of carbon estimates can be used to promote pre-determined policy preferences rather than provide for a fair and objective evaluation of a specific proposed federal action. ``Second, OMB and the other federal agencies developed the draft Social Cost of Carbon estimates without any known peer review or opportunity for public comment during the development process. This process is antithetical to NEPA's central premise that informed agency decision making must be based on transparency and open dialogue with the public. ``Third, OMB's draft Social Cost of Carbon estimates are based primarily on global rather than domestic costs and benefits. This is particularly problematic for NEPA reviews because the Courts have established that agencies cannot consider transnational impacts in NEPA reviews. ``Fourth, there is still considerable uncertainty in many of the assumptions and data elements used to create the draft Social Cost of Carbon estimates, such as the damage functions and modeled time horizons. In light of the lack of transparency in the OMB's process, these concerns over accuracy are particularly problematic.'' Mr. Martella's testimony was spot on. Congress, not Washington bureaucrats at the behest of the President, should dictate our country's climate change policy. These sweeping new changes that are seeking to be implemented by the White House did not go through the normal regulatory process, and there was no public comment. Furthermore, the Obama administration has refused to answer pivotal questions about this guidance and even failed to send a witness to a May 2015 hearing on this matter. While the Obama administration acknowledged the draft guidance is not legally enforceable, you best believe that Federal agencies that received the 31-page revised guidance will treat this document like it was signed into law by the President. Unfortunately, this administration just doesn't get it and continues to try to circumvent Congress to impose an extremist agenda that is not based on the best available science. Worse yet, the model utilized to predict the social cost of carbon can easily be manipulated to arrive at any desired outcome. The House has rejected the social cost of carbon numerous times. I ask all those to join me once again in rejecting this flawed proposal and protecting jobs right here in America. I commend the chairman and the committee for their efforts on this legislation and for recognizing that the NEPA process is in desperate need of reform. I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition. The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Michigan is recognized for 5 minutes. Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Gosar amendment [[Page H6243]] because it would weaken a critical part of the National Environmental Policy Act. The Council on Environmental Quality recently issued draft guidance under NEPA detailing how Federal agencies should consider the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. This NEPA guidance is a commonsense and perfectly legal step toward reducing the Federal Government's contribution and vulnerability to global warming. It is smart planning that accounts for risk and will save taxpayers money, something I am sure that everyone here can support. Furthermore, the guidance will only increase NEPA's effectiveness as a tool for environmental justice, helping communities that cannot afford expensive lobbyists to protect their homes and values. Climate change is hitting low-income communities and communities of color the hardest. Instead of blocking progress, we should congratulate President Obama and CEQ on issuing this incredibly important and long overdue draft guidance to Federal agencies and urge them to issue a final version as soon as possible. And, for the record, my understanding is CEQ did have a witness at the hearing that was just referred to. This guidance makes clear that Federal agencies must factor greenhouse gas emissions and climate change into their decisions and will produce better, more informed and more efficient outcomes. Efforts to convince the American people we have nothing to do with climate change--or, as Pope Francis said in words the American people understood yesterday: air pollution--will not slow the pace of actual climate change, and it will harm our economy, public health, and national security. That is why this is a bad amendment. We urge you to vote against it. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOSAR. I yield myself the balance of my time. The Earth's climate has been changing since the beginning of time, and that is something that we can all agree on. MIT researchers recently reported that there was a massive extinction some 252 million years ago that coincided with a massive buildup of carbon dioxide. While the cause of the massive buildup is unknown, it is safe to say that man did not exist and he still can't explain it. You can take all the carbon-producing applications, whether it be oil, coal, or volcanic action, and they still can't get the models to predict. So we are leading the blind with the blind. I ask for all Members to vote for this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. DINGELL. I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, I would like to read an excerpt from Pope Francis' address to us yesterday that really stood out to me: ``I call for a courageous and responsible effort to redirect our steps, and to avert the most serious effects of the environmental deterioration caused by human activity. I am convinced that we can make a difference, and I have no doubt that the United States--and this Congress--have an important role to play.'' I take that call by our Pope very seriously. There are even reports today that China is going to announce a cap-and-trade program. By considering this bill and this amendment, Congress is not playing a constructive role. I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Gosar amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MARINO. Mr. Chair, I support the amendment. It is bad enough that agencies already take too much time to conclude construction permit reviews. It is even worse for them to draw out the process on the basis of junk science. And that is precisely what the Obama administration's pronouncements on the ``social sost of carbon'' appear to be. The Obama administration's current ``social cost of carbon'' estimate is plagued by defects including the lack of full scientific peer review, robust public comment, and full compliance with federal requirements for influential scientific assessments. Subsection (K) of the bill prohibits the use of the administration's ``technical update of the social cost of carbon for regulatory impact analysis under Executive Order No. 12866,'' as well as successors to it. The gentleman's amendment makes crystal clear that agencies also may not rely on administration ``guidance'' documents intended to facilitate agencies' use of the prohibited technical document. I urge my colleagues to suport the amendment. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will be postponed. Amendment No. 9 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 printed in House Report 114-261. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 31, beginning on line 4, strike ``subsection (p)'' and insert ``subsections (q) and (r)''. Page 31, line 17, insert after ``141).'' the following: ``(r) Exception for Certain Projects.--This subchapter does not apply in the case of any project that could be a potential target for a terrorist attack or that involves chemical facilities and other critical infrastructure.''. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, although we have been debating for a long period of time, let me say to my colleagues to remind them--and I see my good friend, Chairman Goodlatte, on the floor--that this legislation amends the National Environmental Policy Act with good intentions. However, what this bill will do is actually strip out critical input from Federal, State, local agencies, and the public, jeopardizing both the environment and public safety--let me repeat that--jeopardizing the American people, environment, and public safety. The bill sets new, tight deadlines for environmental review, permitting, and licensing decisions and simply, as I said earlier, throws wisdom and good judgment to the wind. I serve as a senior member on the Homeland Security Committee. And so I rise today with my amendment that improves the bill and helps to protect the homeland by carving a limiting exception for construction projects that could be potential targets for terrorist acts, such as chemical facilities, nuclear power plants, and other critical infrastructure. Let me offer the comments of the Congressional Budget Office. They have no basis for estimating the number of construction projects that could be expedited or the savings that would be realized in this bill. Of course, those who support it use that as their main Rock of Gibraltar, if you will, their main point of argument that this is a good bill. A good bill in the face of terrorism? Director Comey has indicated that he has determined that there are ongoing investigations of suspected terrorist cells operating in all 50 States. Yet, we want to expedite this process when it is determining issues dealing with our national security to a certain extent. This issue deals with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit said shall account for the potential environmental impacts of acts of terrorism in its environmental review process. {time} 1015 Are you going to rush them along? The NRC has also imposed stringent antiterrorism requirements on its licenses through 10 CFR section 73, which outlines security requirements for the physical protection of nuclear plants and materials. The Jackson Lee amendment covers nuclear power plants and, as well, chemical facilities to not rush the process to protect the American people. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. [[Page H6244]] Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. This amendment denies the benefit of the bill's permit streamlining provisions to any and all projects that could be terrorist targets or involve chemical facilities or other critical infrastructure. That includes projects that would help to protect those infrastructures and facilities from terrorist attacks or other adversities. Why would we want to delay permitting decisions on projects that would help to protect us? The bill, moreover, already provides up to 4\1/2\ years for agencies to complete their environmental reviews for new permit applications and reasonable additional time for agencies to wrap up final permit approvals or denials after that. As I have said before, if agencies can't wrap up their environmental reviews in that much time and then meet the bill's remaining deadlines, there is something terribly wrong with those agencies. Mr. Chairman, new projects, whether they be infrastructure projects that make a dam stronger or make a highway safer or make a nuclear facility less vulnerable to attack, are all important things to do, and we should do them with expedition, not take longer rather than shorter to get them done, because all the time that we are spinning our wheels with the permitting process that can take 20 years or more, we are more vulnerable during that time. Almost all new infrastructure projects are better than what they are replacing, and that should be our guiding principle. Get these things done expeditiously. It will make us safer. It will make us a better economy. It will create more jobs. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, how much time do we have remaining? The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 2\1/2\ minutes remaining. The gentleman from Virginia has 3 minutes remaining. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, quite the contrary to my good friend from Virginia, what this amendment does is protects the process of the NRC to fully review the potential impacts of terrorism on Federal construction projects involving nuclear facilities and chemical facilities as well. In addition, I think when we hear the names Chernobyl, Fukushima, and Three Mile Island, we understand the vast and devastating impact of such an incident that may be caused or driven by terrorism. I would not want to limit the NRC, which has been given court authority by law to investigate and provide an investigation, thorough investigation, on the impact on chemical and nuclear plants, and we have it restricted. It takes more than 4 years to build a nuclear facility. So are you suggesting that the facility, then, can go on and be built for 10, 20 years, and we shut off the NEPA that has the responsibilities for the American people? I don't think that is appropriate. Mr. Chairman, let me suggest that the American people from the Alaska Wilderness League, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Western Environmental Law Center are against this bill. I will place this into the Record. Mr. Chairman, the Executive Office of the President, Council on Environmental Quality is opposed to this bill, and I will insert this into the Record. I just want to mention that, of course, the President has issued a veto threat. Where this bill is going, I do not know. But the main thing I would like to say to my colleagues is: Can't we stand together united around the question of national security? My amendment specifically indicates that this issue of terrorism should be a simple carve-out, and I would ask you to do so. Let me also bring in the comments of the Pope as indicated yesterday: If politics must truly be at the service of the human person, it follows that it cannot be a slave to the economy and finance. Politics is, instead, an expression of our compelling need to live as one in order to build, as one, the greatest common good: that of a community which sacrifices particular interests in order to share, in justice and peace, its goods, its interests, and its social life. The interest of the American people is to accept the Jackson Lee amendment--to carve out an exception in this bill that is opposed by the President and all other aspects of goodwill people here dealing with the environment--to deal with this issue. Might I remind you, Mr. Chairman, of the Volkswagen scandal. If a more robust process had been in mind, 11 million owners of Volkswagens--and 400,000 in the United States--might be in a better place. This is a good amendment dealing with the safety and security of the American people. I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk; it is listed in the Rule as Jackson Lee 9. Many of us wear a number of hats with dual committee assignments; I am a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee and the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations. This perspective and these responsibilities have given me a special appreciation for the difficult and challenging times we live in and the importance of not taking precipitous actions that could put the security of our homeland at risk. Mr. Chair, if H.R. 348, the so-called RAPID Act, were to become law in its present form, a permit or license for project would be ``deemed'' approved if the reviewing agency does not issue the requested permit or license within 90-120 days. The Jackson Lee Amendment improves the bill and helps to protect the homeland by carving a limited exception for construction projects that could be potential targets for terrorist attacks such as chemical facilities, nuclear power plants, and other critical infrastructure. In particular, I think it is important to note that the FBI Director Comey recently indicated that there are ongoing investigations of suspected terrorist cells operating in all of the 50 states. All federal agencies are subject to the environmental decision making requirements under NEPA. This includes the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which the Circuit of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held ``shall account for the potential environmental impacts of acts of terrorism in its environmental review process.'' The NRC has also imposed stringent anti-terrorism requirements on its licenses pursuant to 10 C.F.R. Section 73, which outlines security requirements for the physical protection of nuclear plants and materials. A nuclear power plant is, a chemical facility covered by the Jackson Lee Amendment. Mr. Chair, we should not limit the ability of the NRC to fully review the potential impacts of terrorism on Federal construction projects involving nuclear facilities and chemical facilities, as would be the case were H.R. 348 to become law. Worse still, H.R. 348 would automatically deem construction projects approved even where the NRC needs more time to complete its review of the environmental risk and/or the potential vulnerability of a critical infrastructure facility to terrorist attack. The Jackson Lee Amendment ensures the rushed and dangerous approach to the NEPA approval process embodied in H.R. 348 does not adversely impact the security of the homeland from the risk of terrorist attacks on nuclear facilities or other critical infrastructure construction projects. In short, the Jackson Lee Amendment provided added protection to keep Americans safe. I urge support for the Jackson Lee Amendment. September 17, 2015. Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members and activists, we are writing to urge you to oppose H.R. 348, the misleadingly named ``Responsibly and Professionally Invigorating Development Act of 2015.'' Instead of improving the permitting process, the bill will severely undermine the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and, consequently, the quality and integrity of federal agency decisions. The National Environmental Policy Act plays a critical role in ensuring that projects are carried out in a transparent, collaborative, and responsible manner. NEPA simply requires federal agencies to assess the environmental, economic, and public health impacts of proposals, solicit the input of all affected stakeholders, and disclose their findings publicly before undertaking projects that may significantly affect the environment. Critically, NEPA recognizes that the public-- which includes industry, citizens, local and state governments, and business owners--can make important contributions by providing unique expertise. NEPA also [[Page H6245]] gives a voice to the most impacted and underrepresented, especially to the most vulnerable communities who usually have to bear the most burden of where federal projects are proposed in the first place. However, H.R. 348 strikes at these core purposes of NEPA by systematically prioritizing speed of decisions and project approval over the public interest. Studies on the causes of delay in the permitting process reveal that the primary cause of delay is not the NEPA process. Rather, as multiple studies by the Government Accountability Office and the Congressional Research Service have pointed out, the principal causes of delay in permitting rest outside the NEPA process entirely and are attributable to other factors such as lack of funding, project complexity, and local opposition to the project. The RAPID Act ignores the true causes of delay, and instead, focuses on institutionalizing dangerous ``reforms'' that restrict public input, limit review of the environmental and economic impacts of projects, and that create more, not less, bureaucracy. Provisions in the RAPID Act, such as the following, will create more delays in permitting, result in less flexibility in the process, and tilt the entire permitting process towards shareholder interest, not the public interest. For example, the bill: Places Arbitrary Limitations on Environmental Reviews-- Section 560(i) of the bill threatens to undermine NEPA's goal of informed decision-making and the agency's role of acting in the public interest. It sets arbitrary deadlines on environmental reviews of permits, licenses, or other applications--regardless of the possible economic, health, or environmental impacts. Consequently, it puts communities at risk by promoting rushed and faulty decisions. Limits Consideration of Alternatives--Section 560(g) strikes at what CEQ regulations describe as ``the heart of the NEPA process'' by restricting the range of reasonable alternatives to be considered by an agency. Creates Serious Conflicts of Interests--Section 560(c) blurs the distinct roles of private entities and agencies in agency decisions by allowing private project sponsors with stakes in the decision to prepare environmental review documents which creates inherent conflicts of interest and thus jeopardizes the integrity of the decision-making process. Leading to Unanticipated Delays--The bill forces stakeholders into court preemptively simply to preserve their right to judicial review. The bill also limits the public's judicial access to challenge and address faulty environmental reviews which in turn is likely to increase the controversy and the amount of litigation derived from the permitting process which in turn could add to project delays. Denies the Impacts of Climate Change--Section 560(k) of the bill prohibits any considerations of the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), which the EPA and other federal agencies use to estimate the economic damages associated with specific projects and their related carbon dioxide emissions. The tool is critical for the public to understand the true benefits and costs of a project. Ignoring climate change puts critical infrastructure, tax payer dollars, and local communities at risk. Provisions such as these and many more in the RAPID Act will only serve to increase delay and confusion around the environmental review process. We believe compromising the quality of environmental review and limiting the role of the public is the wrong approach. Far from being broken, the National Environmental Policy Act has proven its worth as an invaluable tool. It ensures that the public, developers, and agencies have a reliable template for consistent and fair proposal assessment for major projects that may impact federal resources. The RAPID Act contradicts and jeopardizes decades of experience gained from enacting this critical environmental law. Further, it tips the balance away from informed decisions and public oversight, jeopardizing the public's ability to participate in how public resources will be managed. Please oppose this unnecessary and overreaching piece of legislation and vote ``no'' on the RAPID Act.

Hon. Bob Goodlatte, Chairman, House Committee on the Judiciary. Hon. John Conyers, Jr., Ranking Member, House Committee on the Judiciary. Dear Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers: I am writing to you to provide the Council on Environmental Quality's (CEQ) views on H.R. 348, the ``Responsibly and Professionally Invigorating Development Act of 2015.'' Although the bill purports to streamline environmental reviews, we believe the legislation is deeply flawed and will undermine the environmental review process. If enacted, these changes could lead to more confusion and delay, interfere with public participation and transparency, and hamper economic growth. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) was signed into law by President Richard Nixon after passing Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support. NEPA ushered in a new era of citizen participation in government, and it required the government to elevate the consideration of the environmental effects of its proposed actions. It remains one of the cornerstones of our Nation's modern environmental protections. NEPA is as relevant and critical today as it was in 1970. NEPA focuses and informs decision makers, policy makers, and the public on alternatives and the tradeoffs involved in making decisions. Today, we take for granted that governmental decision making should be open and transparent, that government actions should be carefully thought out and their consequences explained, and that government should be accountable. Prior to the enactment of NEPA, this was not always the case. H.R. 348 would undo more than four decades of transparent, open, and accountable government decision making. The Administration believes that America's economic health and prosperity are tied to the productive and sustainable use of our environment, and the President has stressed these principles since his first day in office. NEPA remains a vital tool for the Nation as we work to protect our environment and public health and continue to grow our economy. The President also takes seriously the need for efficient permitting and decision making by Federal agencies. American taxpayers, communities and businesses deserve nothing less. However, we reject the notion that NEPA and other Federal environmental laws and regulations hinder job creation. For example, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has found that 96.5 percent of federally funded highway projects are approved under the least intensive, shortest and quickest layer of NEPA analysis, namely categorical exclusions (CEs). CEs can take as little as a few days to a few months to complete, not years, and are usually done concurrently with other aspects of the project review process so that the entire review process is completed quickly. Only 0.3 percent of FHWA projects require a full environmental impact statement (EIS), the most detailed study under NEPA. When there are project delays, they are typically caused by incomplete funding packages, project complexity, changes in project scope, local opposition, and low local priority, or compliance with other laws and requirements facilitated by the NEPA process, but rarely NEPA itself. An investigation by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) of the NEPA process in federally funded highway projects bore this same point out. Within the Administration, we have prioritized improving the environmental review process and continue to make advancements in this space that will improve interagency coordination and synchronization of reviews to increase decision-making speed; improve project siting and project quality; expand innovative mitigation approaches; and drive accountability and transparency through the expanded use of an online permitting dashboard. For example, under Executive Order 13604, the interagency infrastructure permitting steering committee established the permitting dashboard, which makes project schedules transparent to the public and is designed to improve the timeliness and environmental outcomes of the permitting process. This was followed by a Presidential Memorandum to Federal Agencies on May 17, 2013 to modernize Federal infrastructure review, permitting regulations, policies and procedures to significantly reduce the time it takes to permit infrastructure projects. In addition, CEQ has taken several steps to improve and make more efficient Federal agency decision making. This year, the Administration released an updated ``how- to'' handbook (also known as the Red Book), Synchronizing Environmental Reviews for Transportation and other Infrastructure Projects, to improve and modernize NEPA and other types of reviews, such as those required under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA), and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), by providing information to facilitate more widespread adoption of concurrent reviews. More synchronized reviews by Federal permitting agencies will lead to more effective and efficient environmental reviews and projects with reduced impacts to [[Page H6246]] the environment as well as savings of time and money. CEQ also initiated a NEPA Pilot Program in March 2011 to solicit ideas from Federal agencies and the public about innovative time- and cost-saving approaches to NEPA implementation. Under this process, CEQ is working to identify additional innovative approaches that reduce the time and costs required for effective implementation of its NEPA regulations. H.R. 348 would make a number of considerable changes to Federal agency regulatory review, permitting, and environmental analysis that undercut the core principles embodied in NEPA, including reasoned decision-making and public involvement. The legislation seeks to implement these changes to Federal agency decision making under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The passage of this legislation will lead to two sets of standards by which Federal agencies would be expected to comply, one for ``construction projects'' under the APA and one for all other Federal actions, such as rulemaking or planning, under NEPA. This would lead to confusion, delay, and inefficiency. Moreover, the legislation would direct agencies, upon the request of a project sponsor, to adopt State documents if the State laws and procedures provide environmental protection and opportunities for public involvement ``that are substantially equivalent to NEPA.'' In our view, it is difficult to determine whether a State statute is substantially equivalent to NEPA and the legislation contains no requirement for agencies to determine if the State documents are adequate for NEPA purposes. More importantly, the State document may have looked at a different purpose and need for the project, a different set of alternatives than the Federal agency would have looked at, and relied on different standards for analysis. The State, for example, may not have looked at the same factors that Federal agencies are required to consider, such as environmental justice and wetlands protection. Finally, no two State processes are alike, compounding confusion for projects that cross State lines. Thus, a Federal agency's reliance on State documents may lead to inconsistencies between Federal projects and agencies, different environmental goals and protections, confusion among the public, and unclear results for businesses and project applicants. The legislation also establishes arbitrary deadlines for the completion of NEPA analyses. Factors such as feasibility and engineering studies, non-Federal funding, conflicting priorities, local opposition, or applicant responsiveness are just a few examples of delays outside of the control of an agency. Arbitrary deadlines and provisions that automatically approve a project if the agency is unable to make a decision due to one of the factors described above will lead to increased litigation, more delays, and denied projects as agencies will have no choice but to deny a project if the review and analysis cannot be completed before the proposed deadlines. These comments illustrate a few of the many concerns we have with the legislation. The Administration would be happy to provide the Committee with a more thorough and exhaustive list of our substantive concerns with the legislation at the request of the Committee. In closing, when properly implemented, NEPA improves collaboration, consensus, accountability, and transparency surrounding government decision-making and actions. Our Nation's long-term prosperity depends upon our faithful stewardship of the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the land that supports and sustains us. Our country has been strengthened by the open, accountable, informed, and citizen- involved decision-making structure created by NEPA, and our economy has prospered. Sincerely, Christy Goldfuss, Managing Director, Council on Environmental Quality. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time to say to my colleague from Texas that this bill is about national security. The gentlewoman is right. We can all agree on the importance of national security and protecting our security, but making sure that when projects are planned they are implemented within a reasonable period of time. And we are talking about years--not days or weeks or even months--years for a permitting, years for examination to make sure that these are done carefully, but not decades, as happens now with a number of different projects that have been discussed over the last 2 days that, in their current state, without the kinds of repairs, without the kinds of increased improvements, without the kinds of additional safety and security protections that new projects bring online, we are more vulnerable, not less. I fear that the gentlewoman from Texas' amendment would do just that. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. GOODLATTE. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank my good friend for yielding to me. Maybe we can work together on this amendment because it is a simple carve-out. It should be narrow. It clarifies that the bill's provision does not apply to environmental reviews or permitting on other agencies' decisions that could deal with potential terrorist attack targets, such as chemical facilities and other critical infrastructure. I don't think that that is something that the gentleman and myself would disagree with and, particularly, the nuclear plants, which take a longer period of time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Reclaiming my time, I would say to the gentlewoman that the bill allows lots of time for each stage of the permitting process to cover and discover ways to make a project more secure, to make it safer, to improve it in a variety of different ways; and that the gentlewoman's amendment would harm the ability to do that, not help, because it would slow down the process under which we would have these new projects able to begin construction and then be completed. With that, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas will be postponed. Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Johnson of Georgia The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 printed in House Report 114-261. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Add, at the end of the bill, the following: (d) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act or the amendments made by this Act shall have the effect of changing or limiting any law or regulation that requires or provides for public comment or public participation in an agency decision making process. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 420, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, the purpose of this amendment is simple. It protects the right of the public to comment. This amendment reads: ``Nothing in this Act or the amendments made by this Act shall have the effect of changing or limiting any law or regulation that requires or provides for public comment or public participation in an agency decision making process.'' Now, yesterday, Mr. Chairman, the Pope, right here in this very room, called on each of us to pursue a common good, which he told us requires a courageous and responsible effort. And certainly, if we are going to protect the common good, it requires that we protect the right of the public to comment on projects that have an adverse impact on our precious environment, right there where they live. This amendment would restore the right of any member of the public to comment on construction projects that may have an environmental impact; and because of that, I don't expect any opposition to this amendment, Mr. Chairman. Like a number of well-respected environmental groups, I oppose H.R. 348, the so-called RAPID Act, which threatens public health and safety by putting a thumb on the scales of justice in favor of private sector businesses in the project approval process. It is yet another antiregulatory measure whose only design is to grease the wheels of the approval process of projects that are environmentally sensitive. Aside from creating duplicative and costly requirements that pertain to certain types of projects, the RAPID Act would also limit the right of the public to comment on these projects. This bill does that in two ways: first, by reducing opportunities for public input, and secondly, by fast-tracking [[Page H6247]] the approval process through arbitrary deadlines. Through an open, flexible, and timely process, NEPA empowers the public to weigh in on decisions. That means that the local farmer who owns land that would be affected by a Federal construction project-- let's say a nasty pipeline like Keystone--it ensures that that local farmer would have the ability and would stand on local footing with the construction industry and with the Federal Government. My amendment is vital to ensuring that the RAPID Act does not shut the public out of the process. I am sure that all minds agree that that is reasonable. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment. The CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I do rise in opposition to this amendment. I do share, however, the interest of the gentleman from Georgia in promoting the common good, as mentioned by Pope Francis when he spoke in this Chamber yesterday. But the common good is people coming together to improve their lives by creating improved infrastructure for transportation, whether that is highways or mass transit, for delivering energy resources to places where that energy needs to be delivered, to improving the shipping lanes so that goods can be shipped to and from this country and within this country in ways that make it easier for consumers to receive the energy, the products, the transportation that they need and deserve. The RAPID Act will create jobs by ensuring that the Federal environmental review and permitting process works like it should. It will also make sure that these infrastructure projects that deliver the common good will do so in a reasonable period of time, so people won't have to wait 20 years, like we heard yesterday from the gentleman from Texas, about simply lowering the draft, the 8 feet lower, for ships to get up the waterway in east Texas to deliver goods and pick up goods from ports in that part of the country. Why 20 years to make a decision about dredging 8 feet from a waterway? The RAPID Act is drafted to make agencies operate efficiently and transparently. That is not happening in so many, many instances. But, it does not prevent citizens from participating in that process. In fact, the bill makes sure that agencies provide the public with reasonable public comment periods. It authorizes up to 60 days of public comment on Environmental Impact Statements, up to 30 days of comments on environmental assessments and other documents, and grants the lead agency authority to negotiate extensions or provide them on its own ``for good cause.'' {time} 1030 This is more than fair. By comparison, the National Environmental Policy Act, which has been cited many times on the other side of the aisle, only requires agencies to allow 45 days for public comment--not the 60 days provided in the RAPID Act--on draft environmental impact statements and 30 days for public comments on final environmental impact statements. The RAPID Act also reasonably requires that a person comment on an environmental document before challenging it in court and bring any suit within 6 months as opposed to 6 years. Opponents should not be able to delay a project indefinitely by playing ``hide the ball'' with agencies or by resting on their rights. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would like to respond. First, in the narrowed circumstances in which an agency may supplement an environmental impact statement under the bill, the lead agency ``may'' solicit comments from agencies and the public for not more than 30 days beginning on the date of the publication of the supplement. CEQ regulations require an agency to provide for a 45-day public review and comment period, although there is also a provision in the CEQ regulations that allows CEQ to approve alternative procedures for supplemental EISs if circumstances warrant a deviation from the normal process. Secondly, under the bill, each participating agency is to limit its comments on a project to areas within the authority and expertise of the agency and identify statutory authority for their comments. It specifically prohibits the lead agency from acting upon, responding to or including any document that is ``outside of the authority and expertise of the commenting participating agency.'' This is inconsistent with the CEQ regulations, which allow all agencies--whether local, tribal, State, or Federal--to comment on any substantive issue relative to the NEPA analysis, just as all members of the public should be able to do. So, finally, I would just point out that, if we are talking about efficiency and if we are talking about the common good, it does the public no good to cut out public comment from this process. If we can agree on that, then we can agree that this amendment is a good one. With that, I ask for its approval. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson). The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia will be postponed. The Committee will rise informally. The Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas) assumed the chair. ____________________",package_114_57.csv,136231,136231,136303,"[congressional record volume 161, number 139 (friday, september 25, 2015)] [house] [pages h6232-h6247] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] responsibly and professionally invigorating development act of 2015 general leave mr. marino. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on h.r. 348. the speaker pro tempore (mr. lamalfa). is there objection to the request of the gentleman from pennsylvania? there was no objection. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to house resolution 420 and rule xviii, the chair declares the house in the committee of the whole house on the state of the union for the further consideration of the bill, h.r. 348. will the gentleman from tennessee (mr. duncan) kindly resume the chair. {time} 0910 in the committee of the whole accordingly, the house resolved itself into the committee of the whole house on the state of the union for the further consideration of the bill (h.r. 348) to provide for improved coordination of agency actions in the preparation and adoption of environmental documents for permitting determinations, and for other purposes, with mr. duncan of tennessee in the chair. the clerk read the title of the bill. the chair. when the committee of the whole rose on thursday, september 24, 2015, all time for general debate had expired. pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5-minute rule. it shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of rules committee print 114-26. that amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. the text of the amendment in the nature of a substitute is as follows: h.r. 348 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``responsibly and professionally invigorating development act of 2015'' or as the ``rapid act''. sec. 2. coordination of agency administrative operations for efficient decisionmaking.

this amendment makes numerous technical and other minor wording changes to the bill. together, these revisions clarify that the bill does not authorize duplicative agency review proceedings, does not require duplicative project notification and initiation of agency review procedures, and does not allow permitting decisions to be challenged in court by parties who did not first present their arguments in the administrative proceedings that produced the challenged permit. the amendment constitutes an agreement reached between the judiciary committee and the other committee of jurisdiction, the natural resources committee. mr. chairman, i urge my colleagues to support the amendment. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. grijalva. mr. chairman, i ask unanimous consent to claim time in opposition to the amendment, although i am not opposed to the amendment. the chair. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from arizona? there was no objection. the chair. the gentleman from arizona is recognized for 5 minutes. =========================== note =========================== september 25, 2015, on page h6236, the following appeared: there was no objection. mr. grijalva. mr. chairman, the the online version should be corrected to read: there was no objection. the chair. the gentleman from arizona is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. grijalva. mr. chairman, the ========================= end note ========================= mr. grijalva. mr. chairman, the manager's amendment has been categorized as a technical amendment. we are told the amendment is designed to clarify the bill, which is being sold as the answer to our nation's economic woes. the bill is supposed to streamline government environmental reviews, and this amendment is supposed to streamline the underlying bill. unfortunately, the only thing that is being streamlined here are the facts about nepa. mr. chairman, the facts are not in the republicans' favor. for more than 40 years, nepa has ensured that federally funded projects are carried out in a transparent and cost-effective manner, while fostering public participation in the decisionmaking process and minimizing impacts to the environment. in fact, nepa often provides the only forum for citizens to engage in major federal actions that affect our health, well-being, and the environment. nepa saves millions of dollars and is a tool for environmental justice. nepa gave the confederated salish and kootenai tribal governments and citizen groups an opportunity to engage in the design of u.s. 93 in western montana, resulting in a project that successfully addressed safety, environmental, family farming, and cultural concerns. {time} 0915 nepa's success stories, where the process saves money and improves the quality of life for people impacted by federal decisions, go on and on. my republican colleagues tend to streamline these stories so we never get a chance to hear them. here are some facts my republican colleagues might have missed during their streamlining: 95 percent of all nepa analyses are completed through categorical exclusion, which generally requires only a few days. less than 5 percent of nepa actions require an environmental assessment, and less than 1 percent require a full eis. those projects that do require an eis tend to be the largest, most complex. the delays that do occur are more likely the result of local opposition, a lack of funding, or changes in the project's scope. agency data, interviews with agency officials, and available studies show that most nepa analyses do not result in litigation; yet, the underlying bill seeks to restrict judicial review, and the manager's amendment would create a judicial bar to the courthouse doors before a party could seek judicial review. typically, there have been fewer than 100 cases per year nationwide in the last decade even though the nepa review process is applied to tens of thousands of government actions each year and tens of thousands more that are classified as exempt from review based on categorical exclusions. nepa is not a barrier to development. it is a tool for better decision-making. the only reason to avoid nepa or to weaken it is so that you can make decisions less carefully. this is the purpose of the legislation. apparently, the bill itself was not drafted very carefully; so, we have a manager's amendment to fix all the errors. this manager's amendment is just more proof that my republican colleagues should leave nepa alone because their understanding of how it works and what it does is, unfortunately, too streamlined. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. marino. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. the chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. marino). the amendment was agreed to. amendment no. 2 offered by mr. lowenthal the chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 2 printed in house report 114-261. mr. lowenthal. mr. chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: page 14, line 11, insert after the period at the end the following: ``no alternative may be deemed feasible if the alternative does not adequately address risks associated with flooding, wildfire, and climate change.'' the chair. pursuant to house resolution 420, the gentleman from california (mr. lowenthal) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from california. mr. lowenthal. mr. chairman, i yield myself such time as i may consume. as my fellow californian ronald reagan once said, ``there you go again.'' attacks on nepa have become almost a common, weekly occurrence in this congress, and h.r. 348 is just the latest iteration. we should really call this bill the vapid act because it is tired, unimaginative, and a ploy to undermine one of our bedrock environmental laws: nepa. my amendment would not fix all of this bill's problems, but it certainly would inject some small sense of fiscal responsibility into this legislation that seemingly has been designed for wasting taxpayers' money. restricting the ability of the public to comment on proposed projects virtually guarantees more lawsuits and more hastily approved projects that [[page h6237]] could turn into embarrassing boondoggles. particularly in the face of climate change, we must take special care to ensure that the future value of projects is considered. this means thoroughly evaluating the risks associated with more frequent and intense wildfires as well as flooding caused by stronger storms and higher sea levels. doing these reviews will not delay projects. as was pointed out by the ranking member, it is a fact that 95 percent of all nepa analyses are completed through categorical exclusions, which generally require only a few days to process. less than 5 percent require an environmental assessment, and less than 1 percent require a full environmental impact statement, or an eis. those projects that do require an eis tend to be the largest and most complex, and delays that do occur are more likely the result of local opposition, a lack of funding, or changes in the project's scope, not due to nepa. making sure that roads aren't wiped out by a future storm surge or that activities in our national forests don't spark fires or that government-financed and -permitted actions are resilient to climate change is the least we can do to protect taxpayers and the environment. to do this, we need to keep nepa strong, not weaken it by making government actions less transparent. the current nepa process allows for the full consideration of the costs and the benefits of proposed actions and leads to environmentally and economically sound outcomes. i urge a ``yea'' vote on my amendment because the threats associated with climate change and related natural hazards are too great for this house to continue to ignore. mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. marino. mr. chairman, i rise in opposition to the amendment. the chair. the gentleman from pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. marino. mr. chairman, by its terms, the amendment brands infeasible--and, thus, barred from further evaluation--project alternatives that do not appear at the outset of the review process to adequately address risks associated with flooding, wildfire, and climate change. with all due respect, that puts the cart before the horse. the bill is intended to allow the review of alternatives that are technically and economically feasible. it is entirely possible that, during the course of review, a technically and economically feasible alternative that appears initially to be inadequate to address these risks could, on further review, be found to be adequate or to be improved to be adequate. it might even ultimately be found to be the best alternative under review. why should we prematurely end the evaluation of alternatives that could ultimately prove adequate with regard to these types of risks? this does not prevent the review process. what it does prevent is someone waiting to get in at the last moment, which has been 5 or 6 years later, to jam the system up in court, therefore crushing jobs and letting regulation run rampant. i urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. lowenthal. mr. chairman, i just want to comment that risks due to flooding, to stronger storms, to climate change are not putting the cart before the horse. i am simply asking that we don't waste taxpayers' money by not considering these risks. this is a fiscally sound amendment, and i urge an ``aye'' vote. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. marino. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. the chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from california (mr. lowenthal). the question was taken; and the chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. mr. lowenthal. mr. chairman, i demand a recorded vote. the chair. pursuant to clause 6 of rule xviii, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from california will be postponed. amendment no. 3 offered by mr. grijalva the chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 3 printed in house report 114-261. mr. grijalva. mr. chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: page 15, after line 21, insert the following: ``(6) low-income and communities of color analysis.--the evaluation of each alternative in an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment shall identify the potential effects of the alternative on low-income communities and communities of color.''. the chair. pursuant to house resolution 420, the gentleman from arizona (mr. grijalva) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from arizona. mr. grijalva. mr. chairman, the national environmental policy act, or nepa, is a 45-year-old law which stands, basically, for two things: that the federal government should consider alternatives before taking action that can impact people's lives and that the public should have the opportunity to comment on those alternatives before a final decision is made. house republicans oppose both of these simple principles and so they attack nepa time after time, year after year. the bill before us today is just a rerun of those attacks. my amendment, unfortunately, cannot fix this bill. in fact, my amendment is really just proof of what is so dangerous about the rapid act. among the critical issues that can be addressed through our existing nepa process is ensuring environmental justice. bills like the one we are considering today seek to short-circuit that process; so, they seek to short-circuit environmental justice concerns. my amendment would put environmental justice considerations back in the process created by this legislation; but we would not even need this amendment if republicans would just leave nepa alone. twenty-one years ago president bill clinton issued his executive order on environmental justice. after decades of hard work, struggle, some victories along the way, the promise of environmental justice for all communities remains unfulfilled. while environmental toxins and pollution know no class or race, low- income communities and communities of color bear a disproportionate share of adverse environmental consequences. low-income communities and communities of color are routinely targeted to host facilities that have negative environmental impacts, such as landfills, refineries, chemical plants, freeways, and ports. seventy-eight percent of african americans live within 30 miles of a coal-fired power plant. nearly one out of every two latinos lives in the country's top 25 most ozone-polluted cities. for decades, these communities have been battling environmental injustices and have been seeking to build healthy, livable, and sustainable communities. nepa recognizes that, when the public and federal experts work together, better decisions are made. we have not solved the problem yet, but the solution is a more inclusive, more rigorous use of the nepa process, not these constant, industry-friendly attacks on the law. every person has the right to live, work, and play in a healthy and safe environment; yet, too often, the health of too many americans is determined by their race, class, zip code, and street address. it is unfortunate and inefficient to have to come down here to protect these issues one by one for each and every republican bill that is presented. the adoption of my amendment would keep h.r. 348 from destroying the progress we have made on issues for communities of color, but it doesn't solve the problem. a far better approach would be to drop h.r. 348 and to instead invest in making nepa stronger and more inclusive than ever. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. marino. mr. chairman, i claim the time in opposition, although i am not opposed to the amendment. the chair. without objection, the gentleman from pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. [[page h6238]] there was no objection. mr. marino. mr. chairman, among those who suffer most unfairly from poor government decision-making are the communities the gentleman's amendment addresses. for example, growing research shows that the costs of new regulations often have regressive effects on those with lower incomes. when poor government decision-making occurs in the permit review process, similar unfair effects may occur. the gentleman's amendment guards against this by requiring agencies to identify and reveal the potential adverse effects of project alternatives on low-income communities and communities of color. once identified and revealed, of course, any such effects may be avoided, minimized, or mitigated. i urge my colleagues to support the amendment. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. the chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from arizona (mr. grijalva). the question was taken; and the chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. mr. grijalva. mr. chairman, i demand a recorded vote. the chair. pursuant to clause 6 of rule xviii, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from arizona will be postponed. {time} 0930 amendment no. 4 offered by mr. gallego the chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 4 printed in house report 114-261. mr. gallego. mr. chair, i rise to offer an amendment. the chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: page 21, line 12, strike ``or''. page 21, line 14, strike the period at the end and insert ``;

``, or the deadline was extended pursuant to the request of an elected official of a state or locality, or a local tribal official,''. the chair. pursuant to house resolution 420, the gentleman from arizona (mr. gallego) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from arizona. mr. gallego. mr. chair, i rise today to offer a commonsense amendment to the rapid act, a misguided bill that will disempower local leaders, including tribal leaders, and threaten the health and safety of our communities and their communities. as a member of the natural resources committee, time and time again i have witnessed the republican majority siding with big business and gutting bedrock environmental safeguards that for decades have protected our families and our natural heritage. my republican friends claim that this bill is intended to protect the interest of our states and native american tribes. mr. chair, we already have a law on the books for that purpose. it is called the national environmental policy act, nepa, and it works. at its heart, nepa ensures that our government is accountable to the people. this critical law has protected the environment for more than 40 years without imposing arbitrary deadlines or limiting vital public input. it guarantees the public an opportunity to review and comment on actions proposed by the government, enabling important perspectives that would otherwise go unnoticed. in this way, nepa can actually serve as a check on big government. unfortunately, the rapid act promises the opposite, a deeply flawed process that would diminish the voice of state, local, and tribal communities. the rapid act will also establish a new regulatory framework that purposely overrides the nepa review process, limiting public input and consequently undermining the quality and integrity of federal agency decisions. among its many dangerous provisions, the bill will also trigger the automatic approval of construction projects if agencies miss arbitrary deadlines, regardless of the complexity or hazard posed by such potential projects. though the bill includes some extremely limited and narrow exceptions for these deadlines, as it is currently written, it fails to extend those deadlines for our local communities. my amendment would simply create a new good cause exception that would allow a deadline to be extended if a request is made from a local- or state-elected official or a local tribal leader. while my amendment does not fix all the problems in the underlying bill, it ensures that, if this bill should pass, our local and tribal leaders will continue to be empowered, as they are currently under nepa. i support the goal of reducing red tape, but stripping away the ability of our local communities to have their voices heard is undemocratic and unacceptable. mr. chair, special interests don't need us to fight for them. our communities do. i urge my colleagues to support my amendment and to stand with our local and tribal leaders when it comes to projects in their own back yards that impact their homes, families, and business. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. marino. mr. chairman, i rise in opposition to the amendment. the chair. the gentleman from pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. marino. mr. chairman, this amendment would allow agencies to escape the bill's streamlined permitting deadlines simply because an elected state or local official or a local tribal official asks for an extension. the amendment contains no requirement that a federal agency find the compelling basis for an extension or even a significant basis or even any substantive basis at all. on the contrary, all that a recalcitrant federal agency, a project opponent, or anyone else would need to defeat an efficient permitting decision is to find an elected state or local official or a local tribal official willing to put in an extension request for them. the potential for abuse of this proposed provision by those who only seek delay for delay's sake or who seek to kill worthy projects outright is obvious. i urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. i yield back the balance of my time. the chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from arizona (mr. gallego). the question was taken; and the chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. mr. gallego. mr. chair, i demand a recorded vote. the chair. pursuant to clause 6 of rule xviii, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from arizona will be postponed. amendment no. 5 offered by ms. jackson lee the chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 5 printed in house report 114-261. ms. jackson lee. mr. chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: page 24, strike line 19 and all that follows through page 25, line 12. the chair. pursuant to house resolution 420, the gentlewoman from texas (ms. jackson lee) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentlewoman from texas. ms. jackson lee. mr. chairman, i hope that we will find common ground on really responding to a great concern that i think all americans should be concerned about. although this bill is called the rapid act, were it to become law, in the present form, a permit or license for a project would be deemed approved if the reviewing agency does not issue the requested permit or license within 90 to 120 days. that is a short period of [[page h6239]] time for complex regulatory structures that deal with complex industries. an industry that i represent in houston, texas, the energy industry, has complex needs and, as well, complex impacts and consequences if we do not deal with the agencies responsible, if the doe, for example, does not do its due diligence. now, let me say this, mr. chairman. these particular permits are done sooner than 90 to 120 days. but what this bill says is, if the agency is engaged in a very complex deliberative thought process, then, if they reach that deadline and they still have not finished, they are then, if you will, throwing to the side all of the safety issues and issues dealing with the protection of the american people under the bus. my amendment strikes the provision, deeming approved any project for which an agency does not meet the deadlines contained in the bill. i can appreciate some of the frustrations through the review process by the national environmental policy act, but the cure is not this bill. if a federal agency has failed to approve or disapprove a project or make the required finding, we are in trouble. babies are in trouble with formula. senior citizens are in trouble with various pharmaceuticals. they are in trouble. and then, if we run up against the deadline, there is no response. second, frequently there are times when it is the case that the complexity of the issues, as i said, warrant us to do so. in other words, what this bill is saying is: to heck with reason and good judgment. we do not care. to heck with protecting the american people. we do not care. as i listened intently and intensely to the pope's words yesterday, i offer this quote: moses provided us with a good synthesis of your work. you are asked to protect--and speaking to us--by means of the law, the image, and likeness fashioned by god on every human face. this bill smacks in the face of that instruction. i believe that this amendment is worthy of passing. mr. chair, if h.r. 348, the so-called rapid act, were to become law in its present form, a permit or license for project would be ``deemed'' approved if the reviewing agency does not issue the requested permit or license within 90-120 days. my amendment strikes the provision deeming approved any project for which agency does not meet deadlines contained in the bill. mr. chairman, i can appreciate some of the frustrations expressed by many of our friends across the aisle when it comes to review process mandated by the national environmental policy act (nepa). but the cure they propose in h.r. 348 is an example of a medicine that is worse than the disease. under h.r. 348, if a federal agency fails to approve or disapprove the project or make the required finding of the termination within the applicable deadline, which is either 90 days or 120 days, depending on the situation, then the project is automatically deemed approved by such agency. this creates a set of unintended consequences. first, as an agency is up against that deadline and legitimate work is yet to be completed, it is likely to disapprove the project simply because the issues have not been vetted. second, frequently there are times when it is the case that the complexity of issues that need to be resolved necessitates a longer review period, rather than an arbitrary limit. so if h.r. 348 were to become law the most likely outcome is that federal agencies would be required to make decisions based on incomplete information, or information that may not be available within the stringent deadlines, and to deny applications that otherwise would have been approved, but for lack of sufficient review time. in other words, fewer projects would be approved, not more. mr. chairman, h.r. 348 ostensibly seeks to make a minor procedure adjustment to the administrative procedure act (apa). in reality, however, h.r. 348 would radically transform the nepa review process, and not for the better either. for more than 40 years, nepa has been the law of the land and has provided a remarkably effective framework for all types of projects (not just construction projects) that require federal approval pursuant to a federal law, such as the clean air act. for these reasons, i urge all members to support the jackson lee amendment. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. marino. mr. chairman, i rise in opposition to the amendment. the chair. the gentleman from pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. marino. mr. chairman, the american people desperately need new jobs. according to the bureau of labor statistics, america's labor force participation rate remains mired among historic lows. almost 94 million americans who could work are outside the workforce. that is more than the population of all but 12 of the world's countries and more than every other country in the western hemisphere, except for brazil and mexico. we face this historically low rate not because americans don't want to work, but because so many americans have despaired of any hope of finding a new full-time job and have abandoned the workforce. the rapid act offers strong help to reverse this tragedy, restore the hope, and produce millions of new jobs. we must pass the bill, not weaken it, to provide these new high-wage jobs. the gentlewoman's amendment would weaken the bill in one of the worst possible ways. it would remove the clear consequences in the bill for agencies that refuse to follow the bill's deadlines. that consequence is to deem permits approved if agencies refuse to approve or deny them within those deadlines. mr. chairman, the bill provides 4\1/2\ years for agencies to complete their environmental reviews for new permit applications and reasonable and additional time for agencies to wrap up final permit approvals or denials after that; 4\1/2\ years is more time than it took the united states to fight and win world war ii. if agencies can't wrap up their environmental reviews in that much time and then meet the bill's remaining deadlines, there is something terribly wrong with the agencies. the prospect of facing a default approval at the end of the substantial time the bill grants is an eminently reasonable way to assure that agencies will conduct full reviews and wrap their work up in time to make up or down decisions on their own. i urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. i reserve the balance of my time ms. jackson lee. mr. chairman, i am so glad my colleague mentioned the question of jobs. mr. chairman, how much time do i have remaining? the chair. the gentlewoman from texas has 2 minutes remaining. ms. jackson lee. mr. chair, i am very glad my colleague mentioned jobs because none of us here are fighting against jobs. in fact, i happen to be supporting the full employment legislation that my good friend, congressman john conyers, has offered and i have joined. we are not here speaking against jobs. we are speaking for the american people. we are trying to explain the complexity of the permitting process. whether it is for drilling, whether it is to deal with construction, whether it is to deal with complex environmental issues that have to be addressed impacting the american people or, for example, whether it is dealing with the volkswagen company that saw fit to do the technology to undermine viable rules that the american automobile industry was complying with, definitely impacting jobs, i would have hoped that we would have had a process of permitting or a process of determining whether the volkswagen company was violating these rules that were here to help the issue of pollution and other issues here, but also undermining the jobs of our own american companies. let me say that the jackson lee amendment, in essence, is to suggest that there is a lot of complexity that my friends on the other side of the aisle with the rapid act--the very name of it suggests that we are throwing judgment to the wind. all we want to do is to move forward, even if they are ill. and we don't want the taxpayer dollars that have asked these workers in these agencies who have the expertise from the doe, to the fda and beyond-- food and drug administration, department of energy--to protect us. i believe, mr. chairman, that my amendment, by eliminating the 90 to 120, deeming it approved in the midst [[page h6240]] of a crisis when it is not fit to be approved, is an amendment that this body should pass. i ask my colleagues to support the jackson lee amendment because i am here to protect the american people and to do justly, as has been given to us in a wonderful message yesterday by pope francis. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. marino. mr. chair, how much time do i have remaining? the chair. the gentleman from pennsylvania has 2\1/2\ minutes remaining. mr. marino. mr. chair, i want to just give a couple of examples of the timing factor that we are seeing that the agencies just are not executing properly. cape wind project: for more than 12 years--12 years--they were waiting for permits to build an operation that would create jobs and renewable energy. 12 years. orange county toll road in orange county, california: there was a 12- year delay there as well. the project was extended tens of millions of dollars because of the delay there, and jobs were lost because of that. charleston harbor, savannah port dredging project: again, there was a decade of delays in permitting because agencies are just sitting around, not taking the job responsibly. they never would survive in private industry if they operated under those conditions. so those are a few examples of the cost in dollars and cents and the jobs that are lost because of these agencies not performing their responsibilities. i yield back the balance of my time. the chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from texas (ms. jackson lee). the question was taken; and the chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. ms. jackson lee. mr. chairman, i demand a recorded vote. the chair. pursuant to clause 6 of rule xviii, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from texas will be postponed. {time} 0945 amendment no. 6 offered by mrs. dingell the chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 6 printed in house report 114-261. mrs. dingell. mr. chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: page 25, line 4, insert before the period at the end the following: ``, unless the project would limit access to or opportunities for hunting or fishing, or impact a species listed as an endangered species or threatened species under the endangered species act of 1973 (16 u.s.c. 1531 et seq.)''. the chair. pursuant to house resolution 420, the gentlewoman from michigan (mrs. dingell) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentlewoman from michigan. mrs. dingell. mr. chairman, i yield myself such time as i may consume. the national environmental policy act, or nepa as we frequently shorthand it, is one of our bedrock conservation laws, and it has a simple premise: look before you leap. its timelines are designed to provide transparency and public participation in government. h.r. 348 would move us in the opposite direction. my amendment would not fix all of the problems with this bill, but it would allow hunters, anglers, and wildlife enthusiasts to continue to enjoy the benefits that nepa provides. several recent stories help explain the benefits of nepa, including the following: recently, a plan to improve u.s. 23 in my home state of michigan was modified to avoid the largest loss of wetlands in our state's history. not only will this help improve the biodiversity of the region, but it will also preserve that habitat for migratory waterfowl prized by hunters. this land could have been lost and hunters would have had their access reduced if not for the robust comment process that nepa provides. there are similar stories across the country. in 2013, changes to the army corps of engineers' plan to increase storage capacity at the john redmond reservoir in kansas were needed to protect prime deer and turkey hunting areas, as well as avoid the destruction of a local boat ramp providing fishermen access to the lake. in 2004, sportsmen's groups from across the country banded together during the nepa review process and caused blm to withdraw a proposal to allow oil and gas drilling along the rocky mountain front in montana. the list goes on and on, but the point is that none of these positive outcomes would have been achieved without a strong nepa process that encourages public participation instead of limiting it. furthermore, the habitats utilized by game and sports fishermen are the same as those utilized by endangered fish, wildlife, and plants. destroying one destroys the other, which is why nepa must allow for a thorough review of potential impacts to listed species. my amendment would ensure these protections will be preserved so hunters, fishermen, and american wildlife will continue to benefit from them. there is absolutely no legitimate reason to limit public oversight of taxpayer-funded projects. nepa shines a light on proposed government actions and helps local citizens provide new information and ideas, improve projects, and ensure sustainable decisionmaking. it helps federal authorities consider a range of alternatives, often resulting in lower costs to the public, something i am sure everyone here supports. nepa is a quintessentially american, quintessentially small- government law. it reinforces the rights of people to hold their government accountable. a host of environmental groups have endorsed my amendment, but i am particularly pleased to have the support of trout unlimited, because my amendment would help protect the rights of anglers. if you hunt, you fish or have constituents who do, you should support a strong nepa and vote for my amendment. mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. marino. mr. chairman, i rise in opposition to the amendment. the chair. the gentleman from pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. marino. mr. chairman, one of the linchpins of the rapid act is its set of provisions that: deem a permit approved if the permitting agency refuses to meet the bill's reasonable deadlines; and, prohibit a court from overturning a permit approval simply because the permit was deemed approved when deadlines expired before action was taken. if we do not include consequences like these in the bill, how will we ever ensure that recalcitrant, foot-dragging federal agencies will achieve the bill's goal of streamlined permit decisions? the amendment, however, removes all consequences for agencies' foot- dragging so long as the projects at issue would either limit access to or opportunities for hunting or fishing or impact an endangered or threatened species. that is in the bill. the amendment's sponsor offers no sound reason to do this. the bill does not require projects with these kinds of impacts to be approved. it just requires that permitting decisions, up or down, be reached after, at most, 4\1/2\ years of environmental review. surely that is enough time to review all kinds of projects, including those that limit access to or opportunities for hunting or fishing or impact endangered or threatened species. to make matters worse, the bill would allow agencies to drag their feet without consequences even if a project had a beneficial impact on an endangered or threatened species. why should we allow delay for that? i urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. mrs. dingell. mr. chairman, i want to quickly respond to the comments made by my colleague on the other side of the aisle. we often hear that nepa is a scapegoat for projects being delayed, but as the gao and others have found, outside issues, including the complexity of the project, local opposition and, most importantly, funding issues are almost always the cause of delays. if we adequately funded highway and infrastructure projects, we wouldn't be seeing so many delays the majority is [[page h6241]] so concerned with. nepa is a convenient excuse, but the facts simply don't support the claim that it is the root cause of projects being delayed. we should not be limiting the public's ability to comment on government decisions; but, instead, we should be enhancing them. this bill does the opposite. i urge my colleagues to support my amendment and oppose the underlying bill. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. marino. mr. chairman, my colleague forgets to mention the fact that the lead federal agency in this is responsible for maintaining a schedule, just like we do in private industry, just like we do in our own homes. that agency is responsible for going to the states and to the locals and other federal agencies to make sure things are being done. unfortunately, here in d.c., and sometimes at the state level, the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing, and this is making agencies responsible for that. it is just common sense. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. the chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from michigan (mrs. dingell). the question was taken; and the chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. mrs. dingell. mr. chairman, i demand a recorded vote. the chair. pursuant to clause 6 of rule xviii, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from michigan will be postponed. amendment no. 7 offered by mr. peters the chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 7 printed in house report 114-261. mr. peters. mr. chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: page 27, strike line 11 and all that follows through page 28, line 4, and redesignate provisions accordingly. the chair. pursuant to house resolution 420, the gentleman from california (mr. peters) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from california. mr. peters. mr. chairman, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. chairman, before i entered public service, i practiced environmental law for 15 years in large firms, in a government office, and in my own firm. through that experience, i learned firsthand of the frustration that many businesses and local governments face when they try to navigate overly complex and underly responsive permit processes. i also know from experience that time is money, and often a business seeking a permit is paying dearly to hold a property or to service a loan while it waits for that permit to be issued. that is why i have often said that for applicants, ``no'' is the second best answer. tell us ``no'' or tell us how, but don't string us along. that is why i appreciate the spirit of the rapid act. i don't think it is the perfect answer. frankly, i don't think it will become law. i am working on some other streamlining strategies that i think are superior and might have the bipartisan support that both would get them through this chamber and the senate and get them signed into law by president obama. as i told my colleagues on the committee on the judiciary, i will vote for the rapid act if congress adopts my amendment and does not pass restrictions on considering the role of greenhouse gasses and climate change on our environment. my amendment would simply eliminate subsection (k) of the bill, a section that explicitly prohibits any consideration of the social cost of carbon. for too long we have heard that we have to choose between a prosperous economy and a clean environment. san diegans and people around the country know that is a false choice. we can and we must provide economic opportunity and clean air and clean water for future generations. that means providing businesses and communities with regulatory certainty to help them plan and invest in the future, and it also means that we use this streamlined process, with tight and reliable deadlines, to analyze the economic, environmental, and social costs of carbon dioxide emissions. as highlighted in former new york mayor mike bloomberg's bipartisan risky business report, accounting for the social cost of carbon and preparing for climate change is just smart business practice. the costs of carbon include financial losses from sea level rise. if we continue on our current path of carbon emissions, by 2050, between 66 and 106 billion dollars worth of existing coastal property will likely be below sea level nationwide. eighty-seven percent of all californians live in coastal counties, and 80 percent of the state's gdp is derived from those counties. climate affects energy supply costs. greenhouse gas-driven changes in temperature, catalyzed by burning fossil fuels, would require us to build new power generation facilities to help cool homes and businesses that risky business estimates will cost residential and commercial ratepayers as much as $12 billion a year. that is $12 billion that could be used by families to put their kids through school or buy a home, or by businesses to hire more employees. climate affects the cost of national defense. in 2014, the pentagon issued a report on the security risks associated with profound changes to global climate and the environment. the report found that climate change poses an immediate threat to national security. that will put additional upward pressure on our already-stressed defense budget. climate affects agriculture, water supply, fire preparedness. in california, the largest agriculture producing state in the country, we are in the fourth year of what has been one of the worst droughts in recorded history. communities across the state are facing water shortages. dry conditions have extended our fire season to be nearly a year-round concern. given the stakes associated with carbon emissions on coastal property, energy, defense, our food supply, fires, and our quality of life, shouldn't we at least understand the long-term costs associated with the project? this bill could hold the line on responsiveness and provide long-term certainty to businesses without burying our collective heads in the sand on the costs of carbon, one of the main environmental impacts this environmental law must confront. by stripping out subsection (k) and allowing us to consider the real costs of carbon on our economy, my amendment rejects the false choice between a prosperous economy and a healthy climate. we can and we must have both. i urge my colleagues to support my amendment. mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. marino. mr. chairman, i rise in opposition to the amendment. the chair. the gentleman from pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. marino. mr. chairman, the amendment seeks to strike the bill's prohibition against agency use in permitting reviews of the obama administration's pronouncements on the social costs of carbon, but this prohibition was adopted last term for a very good reason. the administration's social cost of carbon estimate is junk science. to be specific, multiple commentators on the administration's findings about the social cost of carbon argue that carbon's social cost is an unknown quantity, that social cost of carbon analysts can get just about any result they desire by fiddling with nonvalidated climate parameters, made-up damage functions, and below-market discount rates, and that social cost of carbon analysis is computer-aided sophistry, its political function being to make renewable energy look like a bargain at any price and fossil energy look unaffordable, no matter how cheap. junk science and sophistry has no place standing between hard-working americans and new, high-paying jobs. i urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. peters. mr. chairman, how much time do i have remaining? the chair. the gentleman from california has 30 seconds remaining. [[page h6242]] mr. peters. mr. chairman, i have two responses. one, this is not president obama's agenda. this is the agenda of a bipartisan report, risky business, the department of defense, and a number of other people who have recognized this is a real problem we have to confront. second, i would say to the gentleman: let the science work itself out through the process. there is plenty of science that is questioned in the nepa process. there is no other point at which this body has prevented a discussion of any content except here. let the process work it out. i will be with you on your timelines. we will get businesses the certainty that they deserve. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. {time} 1000 mr. marino. i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from texas (mr. smith). mr. smith of texas. mr. chairman, i thank my colleague from pennsylvania and fellow member of the judiciary committee for yielding. mr. chairman, i oppose this amendment. the social cost of carbon is a flawed concept that should play no role in the environmental decisionmaking process. it is based on speculative formulas and has no basis in reality. formulas can easily be manipulated to support any costly regulation. the social cost of carbon is a political tool the obama administration uses to impose its extreme agenda on the american people. it is also another way that the administration tries to use secret science and data to justify questionable rulemaking. speculating on the social cost of carbon should be restricted, not expanded. for these reasons, an agency should not use the social cost of carbon in its environmental review or in its environmental decisionmaking process. i urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. mr. marino. mr. chair, i yield back the balance of my time. the chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from california (mr. peters). the question was taken; and the chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. mr. peters. mr. chairman, i demand a recorded vote. the chair. pursuant to clause 6 of rule xviii, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from california will be postponed. amendment no. 8 offered by mr. gosar the chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 8 printed in house report 114-261. mr. gosar. mr. chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: page 28, line 1, insert after ``substantially related document,'' the following: ``the draft guidance entitled: `revised draft guidance for federal departments and agencies on consideration of greenhouse gas emissions and the effects of climate change in nepa reviews' (79 fed. reg. 77801), or any successor thereto or substantially related document,''. the chair. pursuant to house resolution 420, the gentleman from arizona (mr. gosar) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from arizona. mr. gosar. mr. chairman, i rise today to offer a commonsense amendment that will protect american jobs and our economy by prohibiting federal agencies from being forced to follow job-killing and unlawful draft guidance that sneakily seeks to implement federal policies that pave the way for cap-and-trade-like mandates. congress and the american people have repeatedly rejected cap-and- trade proposals pushed by this president and his big government allies. knowing he can't lawfully enact a carbon dioxide tax plan, president obama has chosen to circumvent congress and is now seeking to address climate change by playing loose and getting creative with the clean air act as well as through an unlawful guidance issued in december 2014. the underlying bill already prohibits federal agencies from utilizing the social cost of carbon valuation. furthermore, the social cost of carbon valuation was rejected four times by this very body last congress. my simple, clarifying amendment adds to the obama administration's revised draft guidance for greenhouse gas emissions and the effects of climate change that were issued by the white house in december 2014 to the definition for social cost of carbon in the bill. this straightforward amendment is common sense, as this deeply flawed guidance instructs agencies to include a controversial measurement of the social cost of carbon into their analyses and is the obama administration's latest tool for attempting to implement this terrible new model that has consistently been rejected by the house. roger martella, a self-described lifelong environmentalist and career environmental lawyer, testified at the may 2015 house natural resources committee hearing on the revised guidance and the flaws associated with the social cost of carbon model, stating: the `` `social cost of carbon' estimates suffer from a number of significant flaws that should exclude them from the nepa process. ``first, projected costs of carbon emissions can be manipulated by changing key parameters such as timeframes, discount rates, and other values that have no relation to a given project undergoing review. as a result, applying social cost of carbon estimates can be used to promote pre-determined policy preferences rather than provide for a fair and objective evaluation of a specific proposed federal action. ``second, omb and the other federal agencies developed the draft social cost of carbon estimates without any known peer review or opportunity for public comment during the development process. this process is antithetical to nepa's central premise that informed agency decision making must be based on transparency and open dialogue with the public. ``third, omb's draft social cost of carbon estimates are based primarily on global rather than domestic costs and benefits. this is particularly problematic for nepa reviews because the courts have established that agencies cannot consider transnational impacts in nepa reviews. ``fourth, there is still considerable uncertainty in many of the assumptions and data elements used to create the draft social cost of carbon estimates, such as the damage functions and modeled time horizons. in light of the lack of transparency in the omb's process, these concerns over accuracy are particularly problematic.'' mr. martella's testimony was spot on. congress, not washington bureaucrats at the behest of the president, should dictate our country's climate change policy. these sweeping new changes that are seeking to be implemented by the white house did not go through the normal regulatory process, and there was no public comment. furthermore, the obama administration has refused to answer pivotal questions about this guidance and even failed to send a witness to a may 2015 hearing on this matter. while the obama administration acknowledged the draft guidance is not legally enforceable, you best believe that federal agencies that received the 31-page revised guidance will treat this document like it was signed into law by the president. unfortunately, this administration just doesn't get it and continues to try to circumvent congress to impose an extremist agenda that is not based on the best available science. worse yet, the model utilized to predict the social cost of carbon can easily be manipulated to arrive at any desired outcome. the house has rejected the social cost of carbon numerous times. i ask all those to join me once again in rejecting this flawed proposal and protecting jobs right here in america. i commend the chairman and the committee for their efforts on this legislation and for recognizing that the nepa process is in desperate need of reform. i reserve the balance of my time. mrs. dingell. mr. chairman, i claim the time in opposition. the chair. the gentlewoman from michigan is recognized for 5 minutes. mrs. dingell. mr. chairman, i rise in opposition to the gosar amendment [[page h6243]] because it would weaken a critical part of the national environmental policy act. the council on environmental quality recently issued draft guidance under nepa detailing how federal agencies should consider the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. this nepa guidance is a commonsense and perfectly legal step toward reducing the federal government's contribution and vulnerability to global warming. it is smart planning that accounts for risk and will save taxpayers money, something i am sure that everyone here can support. furthermore, the guidance will only increase nepa's effectiveness as a tool for environmental justice, helping communities that cannot afford expensive lobbyists to protect their homes and values. climate change is hitting low-income communities and communities of color the hardest. instead of blocking progress, we should congratulate president obama and ceq on issuing this incredibly important and long overdue draft guidance to federal agencies and urge them to issue a final version as soon as possible. and, for the record, my understanding is ceq did have a witness at the hearing that was just referred to. this guidance makes clear that federal agencies must factor greenhouse gas emissions and climate change into their decisions and will produce better, more informed and more efficient outcomes. efforts to convince the american people we have nothing to do with climate change--or, as pope francis said in words the american people understood yesterday: air pollution--will not slow the pace of actual climate change, and it will harm our economy, public health, and national security. that is why this is a bad amendment. we urge you to vote against it. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. gosar. i yield myself the balance of my time. the earth's climate has been changing since the beginning of time, and that is something that we can all agree on. mit researchers recently reported that there was a massive extinction some 252 million years ago that coincided with a massive buildup of carbon dioxide. while the cause of the massive buildup is unknown, it is safe to say that man did not exist and he still can't explain it. you can take all the carbon-producing applications, whether it be oil, coal, or volcanic action, and they still can't get the models to predict. so we are leading the blind with the blind. i ask for all members to vote for this amendment. i yield back the balance of my time. mrs. dingell. i yield myself the balance of my time. mr. chairman, i would like to read an excerpt from pope francis' address to us yesterday that really stood out to me: ``i call for a courageous and responsible effort to redirect our steps, and to avert the most serious effects of the environmental deterioration caused by human activity. i am convinced that we can make a difference, and i have no doubt that the united states--and this congress--have an important role to play.'' i take that call by our pope very seriously. there are even reports today that china is going to announce a cap-and-trade program. by considering this bill and this amendment, congress is not playing a constructive role. i urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the gosar amendment. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. marino. mr. chair, i support the amendment. it is bad enough that agencies already take too much time to conclude construction permit reviews. it is even worse for them to draw out the process on the basis of junk science. and that is precisely what the obama administration's pronouncements on the ``social sost of carbon'' appear to be. the obama administration's current ``social cost of carbon'' estimate is plagued by defects including the lack of full scientific peer review, robust public comment, and full compliance with federal requirements for influential scientific assessments. subsection (k) of the bill prohibits the use of the administration's ``technical update of the social cost of carbon for regulatory impact analysis under executive order no. 12866,'' as well as successors to it. the gentleman's amendment makes crystal clear that agencies also may not rely on administration ``guidance'' documents intended to facilitate agencies' use of the prohibited technical document. i urge my colleagues to suport the amendment. the chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from arizona (mr. gosar). the question was taken; and the chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. mrs. dingell. mr. chairman, i demand a recorded vote. the chair. pursuant to clause 6 of rule xviii, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from arizona will be postponed. amendment no. 9 offered by ms. jackson lee the chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 9 printed in house report 114-261. ms. jackson lee. mr. chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: page 31, beginning on line 4, strike ``subsection (p)'' and insert ``subsections (q) and (r)''. page 31, line 17, insert after ``141).'' the following: ``(r) exception for certain projects.--this subchapter does not apply in the case of any project that could be a potential target for a terrorist attack or that involves chemical facilities and other critical infrastructure.''. the chair. pursuant to house resolution 420, the gentlewoman from texas (ms. jackson lee) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentlewoman from texas. ms. jackson lee. mr. chairman, although we have been debating for a long period of time, let me say to my colleagues to remind them--and i see my good friend, chairman goodlatte, on the floor--that this legislation amends the national environmental policy act with good intentions. however, what this bill will do is actually strip out critical input from federal, state, local agencies, and the public, jeopardizing both the environment and public safety--let me repeat that--jeopardizing the american people, environment, and public safety. the bill sets new, tight deadlines for environmental review, permitting, and licensing decisions and simply, as i said earlier, throws wisdom and good judgment to the wind. i serve as a senior member on the homeland security committee. and so i rise today with my amendment that improves the bill and helps to protect the homeland by carving a limiting exception for construction projects that could be potential targets for terrorist acts, such as chemical facilities, nuclear power plants, and other critical infrastructure. let me offer the comments of the congressional budget office. they have no basis for estimating the number of construction projects that could be expedited or the savings that would be realized in this bill. of course, those who support it use that as their main rock of gibraltar, if you will, their main point of argument that this is a good bill. a good bill in the face of terrorism? director comey has indicated that he has determined that there are ongoing investigations of suspected terrorist cells operating in all 50 states. yet, we want to expedite this process when it is determining issues dealing with our national security to a certain extent. this issue deals with the u.s. nuclear regulatory commission, which the circuit court of appeals of the ninth circuit said shall account for the potential environmental impacts of acts of terrorism in its environmental review process. {time} 1015 are you going to rush them along? the nrc has also imposed stringent antiterrorism requirements on its licenses through 10 cfr section 73, which outlines security requirements for the physical protection of nuclear plants and materials. the jackson lee amendment covers nuclear power plants and, as well, chemical facilities to not rush the process to protect the american people. mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. [[page h6244]] mr. goodlatte. mr. chairman, i claim the time in opposition to the amendment. the chair. the gentleman from virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. goodlatte. mr. chairman, i rise in opposition to the amendment. this amendment denies the benefit of the bill's permit streamlining provisions to any and all projects that could be terrorist targets or involve chemical facilities or other critical infrastructure. that includes projects that would help to protect those infrastructures and facilities from terrorist attacks or other adversities. why would we want to delay permitting decisions on projects that would help to protect us? the bill, moreover, already provides up to 4\1/2\ years for agencies to complete their environmental reviews for new permit applications and reasonable additional time for agencies to wrap up final permit approvals or denials after that. as i have said before, if agencies can't wrap up their environmental reviews in that much time and then meet the bill's remaining deadlines, there is something terribly wrong with those agencies. mr. chairman, new projects, whether they be infrastructure projects that make a dam stronger or make a highway safer or make a nuclear facility less vulnerable to attack, are all important things to do, and we should do them with expedition, not take longer rather than shorter to get them done, because all the time that we are spinning our wheels with the permitting process that can take 20 years or more, we are more vulnerable during that time. almost all new infrastructure projects are better than what they are replacing, and that should be our guiding principle. get these things done expeditiously. it will make us safer. it will make us a better economy. it will create more jobs. mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. ms. jackson lee. mr. chairman, how much time do we have remaining? the chair. the gentlewoman from texas has 2\1/2\ minutes remaining. the gentleman from virginia has 3 minutes remaining. ms. jackson lee. mr. chairman, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. chairman, quite the contrary to my good friend from virginia, what this amendment does is protects the process of the nrc to fully review the potential impacts of terrorism on federal construction projects involving nuclear facilities and chemical facilities as well. in addition, i think when we hear the names chernobyl, fukushima, and three mile island, we understand the vast and devastating impact of such an incident that may be caused or driven by terrorism. i would not want to limit the nrc, which has been given court authority by law to investigate and provide an investigation, thorough investigation, on the impact on chemical and nuclear plants, and we have it restricted. it takes more than 4 years to build a nuclear facility. so are you suggesting that the facility, then, can go on and be built for 10, 20 years, and we shut off the nepa that has the responsibilities for the american people? i don't think that is appropriate. mr. chairman, let me suggest that the american people from the alaska wilderness league, the natural resources defense council, and the western environmental law center are against this bill. i will place this into the record. mr. chairman, the executive office of the president, council on environmental quality is opposed to this bill, and i will insert this into the record. i just want to mention that, of course, the president has issued a veto threat. where this bill is going, i do not know. but the main thing i would like to say to my colleagues is: can't we stand together united around the question of national security? my amendment specifically indicates that this issue of terrorism should be a simple carve-out, and i would ask you to do so. let me also bring in the comments of the pope as indicated yesterday: if politics must truly be at the service of the human person, it follows that it cannot be a slave to the economy and finance. politics is, instead, an expression of our compelling need to live as one in order to build, as one, the greatest common good: that of a community which sacrifices particular interests in order to share, in justice and peace, its goods, its interests, and its social life. the interest of the american people is to accept the jackson lee amendment--to carve out an exception in this bill that is opposed by the president and all other aspects of goodwill people here dealing with the environment--to deal with this issue. might i remind you, mr. chairman, of the volkswagen scandal. if a more robust process had been in mind, 11 million owners of volkswagens--and 400,000 in the united states--might be in a better place. this is a good amendment dealing with the safety and security of the american people. i ask my colleagues to support the jackson lee amendment. ms. jackson lee. mr. chair, i have an amendment at the desk; it is listed in the rule as jackson lee 9. many of us wear a number of hats with dual committee assignments; i am a senior member of the homeland security committee and the ranking member of the judiciary subcommittee on crime, terrorism, homeland security, and investigations. this perspective and these responsibilities have given me a special appreciation for the difficult and challenging times we live in and the importance of not taking precipitous actions that could put the security of our homeland at risk. mr. chair, if h.r. 348, the so-called rapid act, were to become law in its present form, a permit or license for project would be ``deemed'' approved if the reviewing agency does not issue the requested permit or license within 90-120 days. the jackson lee amendment improves the bill and helps to protect the homeland by carving a limited exception for construction projects that could be potential targets for terrorist attacks such as chemical facilities, nuclear power plants, and other critical infrastructure. in particular, i think it is important to note that the fbi director comey recently indicated that there are ongoing investigations of suspected terrorist cells operating in all of the 50 states. all federal agencies are subject to the environmental decision making requirements under nepa. this includes the u.s. nuclear regulatory commission, which the circuit of appeals for the ninth circuit has held ``shall account for the potential environmental impacts of acts of terrorism in its environmental review process.'' the nrc has also imposed stringent anti-terrorism requirements on its licenses pursuant to 10 c.f.r. section 73, which outlines security requirements for the physical protection of nuclear plants and materials. a nuclear power plant is, a chemical facility covered by the jackson lee amendment. mr. chair, we should not limit the ability of the nrc to fully review the potential impacts of terrorism on federal construction projects involving nuclear facilities and chemical facilities, as would be the case were h.r. 348 to become law. worse still, h.r. 348 would automatically deem construction projects approved even where the nrc needs more time to complete its review of the environmental risk and/or the potential vulnerability of a critical infrastructure facility to terrorist attack. the jackson lee amendment ensures the rushed and dangerous approach to the nepa approval process embodied in h.r. 348 does not adversely impact the security of the homeland from the risk of terrorist attacks on nuclear facilities or other critical infrastructure construction projects. in short, the jackson lee amendment provided added protection to keep americans safe. i urge support for the jackson lee amendment. september 17, 2015. dear representative: on behalf of our millions of members and activists, we are writing to urge you to oppose h.r. 348, the misleadingly named ``responsibly and professionally invigorating development act of 2015.'' instead of improving the permitting process, the bill will severely undermine the national environmental policy act (nepa) and, consequently, the quality and integrity of federal agency decisions. the national environmental policy act plays a critical role in ensuring that projects are carried out in a transparent, collaborative, and responsible manner. nepa simply requires federal agencies to assess the environmental, economic, and public health impacts of proposals, solicit the input of all affected stakeholders, and disclose their findings publicly before undertaking projects that may significantly affect the environment. critically, nepa recognizes that the public-- which includes industry, citizens, local and state governments, and business owners--can make important contributions by providing unique expertise. nepa also [[page h6245]] gives a voice to the most impacted and underrepresented, especially to the most vulnerable communities who usually have to bear the most burden of where federal projects are proposed in the first place. however, h.r. 348 strikes at these core purposes of nepa by systematically prioritizing speed of decisions and project approval over the public interest. studies on the causes of delay in the permitting process reveal that the primary cause of delay is not the nepa process. rather, as multiple studies by the government accountability office and the congressional research service have pointed out, the principal causes of delay in permitting rest outside the nepa process entirely and are attributable to other factors such as lack of funding, project complexity, and local opposition to the project. the rapid act ignores the true causes of delay, and instead, focuses on institutionalizing dangerous ``reforms'' that restrict public input, limit review of the environmental and economic impacts of projects, and that create more, not less, bureaucracy. provisions in the rapid act, such as the following, will create more delays in permitting, result in less flexibility in the process, and tilt the entire permitting process towards shareholder interest, not the public interest. for example, the bill: places arbitrary limitations on environmental reviews-- section 560(i) of the bill threatens to undermine nepa's goal of informed decision-making and the agency's role of acting in the public interest. it sets arbitrary deadlines on environmental reviews of permits, licenses, or other applications--regardless of the possible economic, health, or environmental impacts. consequently, it puts communities at risk by promoting rushed and faulty decisions. limits consideration of alternatives--section 560(g) strikes at what ceq regulations describe as ``the heart of the nepa process'' by restricting the range of reasonable alternatives to be considered by an agency. creates serious conflicts of interests--section 560(c) blurs the distinct roles of private entities and agencies in agency decisions by allowing private project sponsors with stakes in the decision to prepare environmental review documents which creates inherent conflicts of interest and thus jeopardizes the integrity of the decision-making process. leading to unanticipated delays--the bill forces stakeholders into court preemptively simply to preserve their right to judicial review. the bill also limits the public's judicial access to challenge and address faulty environmental reviews which in turn is likely to increase the controversy and the amount of litigation derived from the permitting process which in turn could add to project delays. denies the impacts of climate change--section 560(k) of the bill prohibits any considerations of the social cost of carbon (scc), which the epa and other federal agencies use to estimate the economic damages associated with specific projects and their related carbon dioxide emissions. the tool is critical for the public to understand the true benefits and costs of a project. ignoring climate change puts critical infrastructure, tax payer dollars, and local communities at risk. provisions such as these and many more in the rapid act will only serve to increase delay and confusion around the environmental review process. we believe compromising the quality of environmental review and limiting the role of the public is the wrong approach. far from being broken, the national environmental policy act has proven its worth as an invaluable tool. it ensures that the public, developers, and agencies have a reliable template for consistent and fair proposal assessment for major projects that may impact federal resources. the rapid act contradicts and jeopardizes decades of experience gained from enacting this critical environmental law. further, it tips the balance away from informed decisions and public oversight, jeopardizing the public's ability to participate in how public resources will be managed. please oppose this unnecessary and overreaching piece of legislation and vote ``no'' on the

24, 2015. hon. bob goodlatte, chairman, house committee on the judiciary. hon. john conyers, jr., ranking member, house committee on the judiciary. dear chairman goodlatte and ranking member conyers: i am writing to you to provide the council on environmental quality's (ceq) views on h.r. 348, the ``responsibly and professionally invigorating development act of 2015.'' although the bill purports to streamline environmental reviews, we believe the legislation is deeply flawed and will undermine the environmental review process. if enacted, these changes could lead to more confusion and delay, interfere with public participation and transparency, and hamper economic growth. the national environmental policy act (nepa) was signed into law by president richard nixon after passing congress with overwhelming bipartisan support. nepa ushered in a new era of citizen participation in government, and it required the government to elevate the consideration of the environmental effects of its proposed actions. it remains one of the cornerstones of our nation's modern environmental protections. nepa is as relevant and critical today as it was in 1970. nepa focuses and informs decision makers, policy makers, and the public on alternatives and the tradeoffs involved in making decisions. today, we take for granted that governmental decision making should be open and transparent, that government actions should be carefully thought out and their consequences explained, and that government should be accountable. prior to the enactment of nepa, this was not always the case. h.r. 348 would undo more than four decades of transparent, open, and accountable government decision making. the administration believes that america's economic health and prosperity are tied to the productive and sustainable use of our environment, and the president has stressed these principles since his first day in office. nepa remains a vital tool for the nation as we work to protect our environment and public health and continue to grow our economy. the president also takes seriously the need for efficient permitting and decision making by federal agencies. american taxpayers, communities and businesses deserve nothing less. however, we reject the notion that nepa and other federal environmental laws and regulations hinder job creation. for example, the federal highway administration (fhwa) has found that 96.5 percent of federally funded highway projects are approved under the least intensive, shortest and quickest layer of nepa analysis, namely categorical exclusions (ces). ces can take as little as a few days to a few months to complete, not years, and are usually done concurrently with other aspects of the project review process so that the entire review process is completed quickly. only 0.3 percent of fhwa projects require a full environmental impact statement (eis), the most detailed study under nepa. when there are project delays, they are typically caused by incomplete funding packages, project complexity, changes in project scope, local opposition, and low local priority, or compliance with other laws and requirements facilitated by the nepa process, but rarely nepa itself. an investigation by the congressional research service (crs) of the nepa process in federally funded highway projects bore this same point out. within the administration, we have prioritized improving the environmental review process and continue to make advancements in this space that will improve interagency coordination and synchronization of reviews to increase decision-making speed; improve project siting and project quality; expand innovative mitigation approaches; and drive accountability and transparency through the expanded use of an online permitting dashboard. for example, under executive order 13604, the interagency infrastructure permitting steering committee established the permitting dashboard, which makes project schedules transparent to the public and is designed to improve the timeliness and environmental outcomes of the permitting process. this was followed by a presidential memorandum to federal agencies on may 17, 2013 to modernize federal infrastructure review, permitting regulations, policies and procedures to significantly reduce the time it takes to permit infrastructure projects. in addition, ceq has taken several steps to improve and make more efficient federal agency decision making. this year, the administration released an updated ``how- to'' handbook (also known as the red book), synchronizing environmental reviews for transportation and other infrastructure projects, to improve and modernize nepa and other types of reviews, such as those required under the endangered species act (esa), the national historic preservation act (nhpa), the clean water act (cwa), the magnuson-stevens fishery conservation and management act (msa), and the marine mammal protection act (mmpa), by providing information to facilitate more widespread adoption of concurrent reviews. more synchronized reviews by federal permitting agencies will lead to more effective and efficient environmental reviews and projects with reduced impacts to [[page h6246]] the environment as well as savings of time and money. ceq also initiated a nepa pilot program in march 2011 to solicit ideas from federal agencies and the public about innovative time- and cost-saving approaches to nepa implementation. under this process, ceq is working to identify additional innovative approaches that reduce the time and costs required for effective implementation of its nepa regulations. h.r. 348 would make a number of considerable changes to federal agency regulatory review, permitting, and environmental analysis that undercut the core principles embodied in nepa, including reasoned decision-making and public involvement. the legislation seeks to implement these changes to federal agency decision making under the administrative procedure act (apa). the passage of this legislation will lead to two sets of standards by which federal agencies would be expected to comply, one for ``construction projects'' under the apa and one for all other federal actions, such as rulemaking or planning, under nepa. this would lead to confusion, delay, and inefficiency. moreover, the legislation would direct agencies, upon the request of a project sponsor, to adopt state documents if the state laws and procedures provide environmental protection and opportunities for public involvement ``that are substantially equivalent to nepa.'' in our view, it is difficult to determine whether a state statute is substantially equivalent to nepa and the legislation contains no requirement for agencies to determine if the state documents are adequate for nepa purposes. more importantly, the state document may have looked at a different purpose and need for the project, a different set of alternatives than the federal agency would have looked at, and relied on different standards for analysis. the state, for example, may not have looked at the same factors that federal agencies are required to consider, such as environmental justice and wetlands protection. finally, no two state processes are alike, compounding confusion for projects that cross state lines. thus, a federal agency's reliance on state documents may lead to inconsistencies between federal projects and agencies, different environmental goals and protections, confusion among the public, and unclear results for businesses and project applicants. the legislation also establishes arbitrary deadlines for the completion of nepa analyses. factors such as feasibility and engineering studies, non-federal funding, conflicting priorities, local opposition, or applicant responsiveness are just a few examples of delays outside of the control of an agency. arbitrary deadlines and provisions that automatically approve a project if the agency is unable to make a decision due to one of the factors described above will lead to increased litigation, more delays, and denied projects as agencies will have no choice but to deny a project if the review and analysis cannot be completed before the proposed deadlines. these comments illustrate a few of the many concerns we have with the legislation. the administration would be happy to provide the committee with a more thorough and exhaustive list of our substantive concerns with the legislation at the request of the committee. in closing, when properly implemented, nepa improves collaboration, consensus, accountability, and transparency surrounding government decision-making and actions. our nation's long-term prosperity depends upon our faithful stewardship of the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the land that supports and sustains us. our country has been strengthened by the open, accountable, informed, and citizen- involved decision-making structure created by nepa, and our economy has prospered. sincerely, christy goldfuss, managing director, council on environmental quality. ms. jackson lee. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. goodlatte. mr. chairman, i yield myself the balance of my time to say to my colleague from texas that this bill is about national security. the gentlewoman is right. we can all agree on the importance of national security and protecting our security, but making sure that when projects are planned they are implemented within a reasonable period of time. and we are talking about years--not days or weeks or even months--years for a permitting, years for examination to make sure that these are done carefully, but not decades, as happens now with a number of different projects that have been discussed over the last 2 days that, in their current state, without the kinds of repairs, without the kinds of increased improvements, without the kinds of additional safety and security protections that new projects bring online, we are more vulnerable, not less. i fear that the gentlewoman from texas' amendment would do just that. ms. jackson lee. will the gentleman yield? mr. goodlatte. i yield to the gentlewoman from texas. ms. jackson lee. i thank my good friend for yielding to me. maybe we can work together on this amendment because it is a simple carve-out. it should be narrow. it clarifies that the bill's provision does not apply to environmental reviews or permitting on other agencies' decisions that could deal with potential terrorist attack targets, such as chemical facilities and other critical infrastructure. i don't think that that is something that the gentleman and myself would disagree with and, particularly, the nuclear plants, which take a longer period of time. mr. goodlatte. reclaiming my time, i would say to the gentlewoman that the bill allows lots of time for each stage of the permitting process to cover and discover ways to make a project more secure, to make it safer, to improve it in a variety of different ways; and that the gentlewoman's amendment would harm the ability to do that, not help, because it would slow down the process under which we would have these new projects able to begin construction and then be completed. with that, i urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. i yield back the balance of my time. the chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from texas (ms. jackson lee). the question was taken; and the chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. ms. jackson lee. mr. chairman, i demand a recorded vote. the chair. pursuant to clause 6 of rule xviii, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from texas will be postponed. amendment no. 10 offered by mr. johnson of georgia the chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 10 printed in house report 114-261. mr. johnson of georgia. mr. chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: add, at the end of the bill, the following: (d) rule of construction.--nothing in this act or the amendments made by this act shall have the effect of changing or limiting any law or regulation that requires or provides for public comment or public participation in an agency decision making process. the chair. pursuant to house resolution 420, the gentleman from georgia (mr. johnson) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from georgia. mr. johnson of georgia. mr. chairman, the purpose of this amendment is simple. it protects the right of the public to comment. this amendment reads: ``nothing in this act or the amendments made by this act shall have the effect of changing or limiting any law or regulation that requires or provides for public comment or public participation in an agency decision making process.'' now, yesterday, mr. chairman, the pope, right here in this very room, called on each of us to pursue a common good, which he told us requires a courageous and responsible effort. and certainly, if we are going to protect the common good, it requires that we protect the right of the public to comment on projects that have an adverse impact on our precious environment, right there where they live. this amendment would restore the right of any member of the public to comment on construction projects that may have an environmental impact; and because of that, i don't expect any opposition to this amendment, mr. chairman. like a number of well-respected environmental groups, i oppose h.r. 348, the so-called rapid act, which threatens public health and safety by putting a thumb on the scales of justice in favor of private sector businesses in the project approval process. it is yet another antiregulatory measure whose only design is to grease the wheels of the approval process of projects that are environmentally sensitive. aside from creating duplicative and costly requirements that pertain to certain types of projects, the rapid act would also limit the right of the public to comment on these projects. this bill does that in two ways: first, by reducing opportunities for public input, and secondly, by fast-tracking [[page h6247]] the approval process through arbitrary deadlines. through an open, flexible, and timely process, nepa empowers the public to weigh in on decisions. that means that the local farmer who owns land that would be affected by a federal construction project-- let's say a nasty pipeline like keystone--it ensures that that local farmer would have the ability and would stand on local footing with the construction industry and with the federal government. my amendment is vital to ensuring that the rapid act does not shut the public out of the process. i am sure that all minds agree that that is reasonable. i urge my colleagues to support this amendment. mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. goodlatte. mr. chairman, i claim the time in opposition to the amendment. the chair. the gentleman from virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. goodlatte. mr. chairman, i do rise in opposition to this amendment. i do share, however, the interest of the gentleman from georgia in promoting the common good, as mentioned by pope francis when he spoke in this chamber yesterday. but the common good is people coming together to improve their lives by creating improved infrastructure for transportation, whether that is highways or mass transit, for delivering energy resources to places where that energy needs to be delivered, to improving the shipping lanes so that goods can be shipped to and from this country and within this country in ways that make it easier for consumers to receive the energy, the products, the transportation that they need and deserve. the rapid act will create jobs by ensuring that the federal environmental review and permitting process works like it should. it will also make sure that these infrastructure projects that deliver the common good will do so in a reasonable period of time, so people won't have to wait 20 years, like we heard yesterday from the gentleman from texas, about simply lowering the draft, the 8 feet lower, for ships to get up the waterway in east texas to deliver goods and pick up goods from ports in that part of the country. why 20 years to make a decision about dredging 8 feet from a waterway? the rapid act is drafted to make agencies operate efficiently and transparently. that is not happening in so many, many instances. but, it does not prevent citizens from participating in that process. in fact, the bill makes sure that agencies provide the public with reasonable public comment periods. it authorizes up to 60 days of public comment on environmental impact statements, up to 30 days of comments on environmental assessments and other documents, and grants the lead agency authority to negotiate extensions or provide them on its own ``for good cause.'' {time} 1030 this is more than fair. by comparison, the national environmental policy act, which has been cited many times on the other side of the aisle, only requires agencies to allow 45 days for public comment--not the 60 days provided in the rapid act--on draft environmental impact statements and 30 days for public comments on final environmental impact statements. the rapid act also reasonably requires that a person comment on an environmental document before challenging it in court and bring any suit within 6 months as opposed to 6 years. opponents should not be able to delay a project indefinitely by playing ``hide the ball'' with agencies or by resting on their rights. i urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. johnson of georgia. mr. chairman, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i would like to respond. first, in the narrowed circumstances in which an agency may supplement an environmental impact statement under the bill, the lead agency ``may'' solicit comments from agencies and the public for not more than 30 days beginning on the date of the publication of the supplement. ceq regulations require an agency to provide for a 45-day public review and comment period, although there is also a provision in the ceq regulations that allows ceq to approve alternative procedures for supplemental eiss if circumstances warrant a deviation from the normal process. secondly, under the bill, each participating agency is to limit its comments on a project to areas within the authority and expertise of the agency and identify statutory authority for their comments. it specifically prohibits the lead agency from acting upon, responding to or including any document that is ``outside of the authority and expertise of the commenting participating agency.'' this is inconsistent with the ceq regulations, which allow all agencies--whether local, tribal, state, or federal--to comment on any substantive issue relative to the nepa analysis, just as all members of the public should be able to do. so, finally, i would just point out that, if we are talking about efficiency and if we are talking about the common good, it does the public no good to cut out public comment from this process. if we can agree on that, then we can agree that this amendment is a good one. with that, i ask for its approval. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. goodlatte. mr. chairman, i urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. i yield back the balance of my time. the chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from georgia (mr. johnson). the question was taken; and the chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. mr. johnson of georgia. mr. chairman, i demand a recorded vote. the chair. pursuant to clause 6 of rule xviii, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from georgia will be postponed. the committee will rise informally. the speaker pro tempore (mr. poe of texas) assumed the chair. ____________________",136231

Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the importance of the poultry industry to Georgia and the issue of highly pathogenic avian influenza. Georgia is the Nation's leading poultry-producing State, and my hometown of Gainesville proudly claims the title of ``chicken capital of the world.'' The poultry industry is critical to the Ninth District of Georgia and the State as a whole. The jobs of 138,000 Georgians depend on the poultry industry, and poultry represents almost half of Georgia's entire agriculture sector. Given the scale and importance of the industry to Georgia, it is critically important that adequate attention is paid to the potential threat of bird flu. We saw the devastating impact of a highly pathogenic AI outbreak earlier this year. It was the worst animal disease outbreak in U.S. history. Now, with birds migrating south for the winter, we have to face the prospect of a disease striking the poultry industry again. Mr. Speaker, APHIS has released a fall plan, and I understand that USDA has been in touch with State governments. But we must do more than simply conceptualize a response. We need to take proactive steps to prevent the spread and severity of high-path AI. I want to commend Commissioner Black and the Georgia Department of Agriculture for their dedication to preparing for a potential outbreak and the commitment of thousands of Georgians who depend on the poultry industry. I am calling on all agencies to work closely with Georgia and implement meaningful measures in coordination with State needs and recommendations. We need to shorten response time, install biosecurity measures, and work to prevent or reduce future outbreaks. We simply cannot wait to act. Steps must be taken now to mitigate damages to this industry that is so vital to the economy in northeast Georgia. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 139 (Friday, September 25, 2015)] [House] [Page H6232] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AVIAN INFLUENZA AND GEORGIA'S EFFORTS (Mr. COLLINS of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

The question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Denham) having assumed the chair, Mr. Byrne, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 348) to provide for improved coordination of agency actions in the preparation and adoption of environmental documents for permitting determinations, and for other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 420, he reported the bill back to the House [[Page H6254]] with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. Motion to Recommit Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill? Ms. KUSTER. I am opposed in its current form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: Ms. Kuster moves to recommit the bill H.R. 348 to the Committee on the Judiciary with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith, with the following amendment: Page 31, line 17, insert after ``112-141).'' the following: ``(r) Protecting Local Communities, Private Property Rights and Tribal Sovereignty.-- ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the provisions of this section shall not apply in the case of a project described in paragraph (2), or an environmental document pertaining to such a project. ``(2) Project described.--A project described in this paragraph is any project that-- ``(A) affects the safe drinking water supply or air quality of local communities that are located near the project; ``(B) involves condemnation or infringing the private property rights of American citizens; or ``(C) affects the health, safety, or sovereignty of Native American tribes. ``(s) Making It in America and Providing Jobs for Unemployed Workers.--Any environmental document approved pursuant to this act shall assess whether a construction project-- ``(1) will utilize equipment and materials manufactured in the United States; and ``(2) will result in the hiring of unemployed workers, including veterans, who are actively seeking work and for whom unemployment taxes were paid during prior employment.''. Ms. KUSTER (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from New Hampshire? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from New Hampshire is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended. Mr. Speaker, we can all agree on the need to ensure that construction projects are completed in a timely and effective manner without the need for unnecessary review or red tape. No one can argue that our current permitting system is perfect. But the bill before us today is yet another misguided Republican attempt to undermine critical environmental protections that we all rely on. This legislation will splinter and unnecessarily accelerate the permitting process in a way that impairs the ability of agencies to effectively evaluate the impacts of a given project. Consequently, the bill will weaken the ability of our constituents to understand the impacts of proposed projects and effectively limit their voice in the permitting process. This is particularly true for low-income and minority communities that too often are faced with a disproportionate share of pollution and environmental contaminants. In my home State of New Hampshire, we are intimately familiar with the need for strong public input in permitting processes. As the permitting moves forward on different energy infrastructure projects, I have been working aggressively to ensure that the views of my constituents are heard. I am concerned that the permitting process under this legislation will make it more difficult for effective environmental review to move forward in New Hampshire. That is why I am offering my amendment today to help provide some additional protections to safeguard human health, the environment, and property rights. Specifically, this amendment would exempt from the requirements in the bill any project that would negatively affect the drinking water supply or air quality of nearby communities. It also ensures that construction projects covered under the legislation cannot violate the sovereignty of Native American tribes. These provisions would at least ensure that we are limiting the most dangerous consequences of this legislation. Additionally, the amendment requires that any environmental documents produced pursuant to the legislation include information about whether a project will use equipment and materials manufactured in the United States and whether it will create jobs for U.S. workers, including our veterans. Like so many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I have been intently focused on what we can do to grow and expand U.S. manufacturing jobs and create good-paying middle-class jobs right here in America and, in particular, as a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, how we can serve our veterans. The reporting requirement in this amendment will help generate greater awareness for how we utilize American-made machinery and products in our construction processes. I urge support for my amendment to make sure that this bill does not harm the health of our constituents and to take an important step toward job creation and hiring of veterans. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. I rise in opposition to the motion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, after President Obama's ill-conceived stimulus bill failed, he blamed its failure on the lack of shovel-ready construction projects. President Obama was even quoted in the press to have joked about it. ``Shovel-ready was not as shovel-ready as we expected,'' he said. Hard-working Americans desperate for jobs didn't think that was funny. They still don't. They are watching us right now, wanting to know if we can deliver meaningful reform that will create jobs. Let's send a message to them today that we can and we will. For years now the President's Jobs Council's recommendation that we streamline the Federal permitting process has been staring the President in the face. Just last term President Obama stood in this House and promised action to ``slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process . . . so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible.'' Mr. Speaker, the RAPID Act is precisely the legislation to do that. It is exactly what our private and public sector leaders have called for. It is what millions of American workers yearning for new work and higher wages need. True to form, some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle support this motion to recommit in an attempt to stop this legislation. They can't yet bring themselves to say, ``Yes, we can'' to the cutting of bureaucratic red tape and obstruction. But this motion to recommit is the exact mirror image of everything that is wrong with the Federal permitting process and keeps jobs from the American people. It is nothing but a fabricated argument, a procedural device, a tried and true tactic of delay--an excuse for Members of Congress to duck a vote and not make a needed decision that will bring millions of good, high-paying jobs to the people of this country. The bill does not require a project to be approved, only that an agency timely decide whether or not to approve it. I urge my colleagues to vote against this motion and vote for the RAPID Act. Finally, Mr. Speaker, all of us today are stunned by the dramatic and courageous decision of the Speaker of the [[Page H6255]] House, John Boehner, to retire at the end of October. We thank him for his tireless work, his conservative leadership of the Republican Conference for 9 years, his distinguished service as Speaker of the House for nearly 5 years, and for his long service to the people of this great country. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Recorded Vote Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 5- minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by a 5-minute vote on the passage of the bill, if ordered.

The question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Denham) having assumed the chair, Mr. Byrne, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 348) to provide for improved coordination of agency actions in the preparation and adoption of environmental documents for permitting determinations, and for other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 420, he reported the bill back to the House [[Page H6254]] with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. Motion to Recommit Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill? Ms. KUSTER. I am opposed in its current form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: Ms. Kuster moves to recommit the bill H.R. 348 to the Committee on the Judiciary with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith, with the following amendment: Page 31, line 17, insert after ``112-141).'' the following: ``(r) Protecting Local Communities, Private Property Rights and Tribal Sovereignty.-- ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the provisions of this section shall not apply in the case of a project described in paragraph (2), or an environmental document pertaining to such a project. ``(2) Project described.--A project described in this paragraph is any project that-- ``(A) affects the safe drinking water supply or air quality of local communities that are located near the project; ``(B) involves condemnation or infringing the private property rights of American citizens; or ``(C) affects the health, safety, or sovereignty of Native American tribes. ``(s) Making It in America and Providing Jobs for Unemployed Workers.--Any environmental document approved pursuant to this act shall assess whether a construction project-- ``(1) will utilize equipment and materials manufactured in the United States; and ``(2) will result in the hiring of unemployed workers, including veterans, who are actively seeking work and for whom unemployment taxes were paid during prior employment.''. Ms. KUSTER (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from New Hampshire? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from New Hampshire is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended. Mr. Speaker, we can all agree on the need to ensure that construction projects are completed in a timely and effective manner without the need for unnecessary review or red tape. No one can argue that our current permitting system is perfect. But the bill before us today is yet another misguided Republican attempt to undermine critical environmental protections that we all rely on. This legislation will splinter and unnecessarily accelerate the permitting process in a way that impairs the ability of agencies to effectively evaluate the impacts of a given project. Consequently, the bill will weaken the ability of our constituents to understand the impacts of proposed projects and effectively limit their voice in the permitting process. This is particularly true for low-income and minority communities that too often are faced with a disproportionate share of pollution and environmental contaminants. In my home State of New Hampshire, we are intimately familiar with the need for strong public input in permitting processes. As the permitting moves forward on different energy infrastructure projects, I have been working aggressively to ensure that the views of my constituents are heard. I am concerned that the permitting process under this legislation will make it more difficult for effective environmental review to move forward in New Hampshire. That is why I am offering my amendment today to help provide some additional protections to safeguard human health, the environment, and property rights. Specifically, this amendment would exempt from the requirements in the bill any project that would negatively affect the drinking water supply or air quality of nearby communities. It also ensures that construction projects covered under the legislation cannot violate the sovereignty of Native American tribes. These provisions would at least ensure that we are limiting the most dangerous consequences of this legislation. Additionally, the amendment requires that any environmental documents produced pursuant to the legislation include information about whether a project will use equipment and materials manufactured in the United States and whether it will create jobs for U.S. workers, including our veterans. Like so many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I have been intently focused on what we can do to grow and expand U.S. manufacturing jobs and create good-paying middle-class jobs right here in America and, in particular, as a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, how we can serve our veterans. The reporting requirement in this amendment will help generate greater awareness for how we utilize American-made machinery and products in our construction processes. I urge support for my amendment to make sure that this bill does not harm the health of our constituents and to take an important step toward job creation and hiring of veterans. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. I rise in opposition to the motion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, after President Obama's ill-conceived stimulus bill failed, he blamed its failure on the lack of shovel-ready construction projects. President Obama was even quoted in the press to have joked about it. ``Shovel-ready was not as shovel-ready as we expected,'' he said. Hard-working Americans desperate for jobs didn't think that was funny. They still don't. They are watching us right now, wanting to know if we can deliver meaningful reform that will create jobs. Let's send a message to them today that we can and we will. For years now the President's Jobs Council's recommendation that we streamline the Federal permitting process has been staring the President in the face. Just last term President Obama stood in this House and promised action to ``slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process . . . so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible.'' Mr. Speaker, the RAPID Act is precisely the legislation to do that. It is exactly what our private and public sector leaders have called for. It is what millions of American workers yearning for new work and higher wages need. True to form, some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle support this motion to recommit in an attempt to stop this legislation. They can't yet bring themselves to say, ``Yes, we can'' to the cutting of bureaucratic red tape and obstruction. But this motion to recommit is the exact mirror image of everything that is wrong with the Federal permitting process and keeps jobs from the American people. It is nothing but a fabricated argument, a procedural device, a tried and true tactic of delay--an excuse for Members of Congress to duck a vote and not make a needed decision that will bring millions of good, high-paying jobs to the people of this country. The bill does not require a project to be approved, only that an agency timely decide whether or not to approve it. I urge my colleagues to vote against this motion and vote for the RAPID Act. Finally, Mr. Speaker, all of us today are stunned by the dramatic and courageous decision of the Speaker of the [[Page H6255]] House, John Boehner, to retire at the end of October. We thank him for his tireless work, his conservative leadership of the Republican Conference for 9 years, his distinguished service as Speaker of the House for nearly 5 years, and for his long service to the people of this great country. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Recorded Vote Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 5- minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by a 5-minute vote on the passage of the bill, if ordered.

The question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Denham) having assumed the chair, Mr. Byrne, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 348) to provide for improved coordination of agency actions in the preparation and adoption of environmental documents for permitting determinations, and for other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 420, he reported the bill back to the House [[Page H6254]] with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. Motion to Recommit Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill? Ms. KUSTER. I am opposed in its current form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: Ms. Kuster moves to recommit the bill H.R. 348 to the Committee on the Judiciary with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith, with the following amendment: Page 31, line 17, insert after ``112-141).'' the following: ``(r) Protecting Local Communities, Private Property Rights and Tribal Sovereignty.-- ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the provisions of this section shall not apply in the case of a project described in paragraph (2), or an environmental document pertaining to such a project. ``(2) Project described.--A project described in this paragraph is any project that-- ``(A) affects the safe drinking water supply or air quality of local communities that are located near the project; ``(B) involves condemnation or infringing the private property rights of American citizens; or ``(C) affects the health, safety, or sovereignty of Native American tribes. ``(s) Making It in America and Providing Jobs for Unemployed Workers.--Any environmental document approved pursuant to this act shall assess whether a construction project-- ``(1) will utilize equipment and materials manufactured in the United States; and ``(2) will result in the hiring of unemployed workers, including veterans, who are actively seeking work and for whom unemployment taxes were paid during prior employment.''. Ms. KUSTER (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from New Hampshire? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from New Hampshire is recognized for 5 minutes. Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended. Mr. Speaker, we can all agree on the need to ensure that construction projects are completed in a timely and effective manner without the need for unnecessary review or red tape. No one can argue that our current permitting system is perfect. But the bill before us today is yet another misguided Republican attempt to undermine critical environmental protections that we all rely on. This legislation will splinter and unnecessarily accelerate the permitting process in a way that impairs the ability of agencies to effectively evaluate the impacts of a given project. Consequently, the bill will weaken the ability of our constituents to understand the impacts of proposed projects and effectively limit their voice in the permitting process. This is particularly true for low-income and minority communities that too often are faced with a disproportionate share of pollution and environmental contaminants. In my home State of New Hampshire, we are intimately familiar with the need for strong public input in permitting processes. As the permitting moves forward on different energy infrastructure projects, I have been working aggressively to ensure that the views of my constituents are heard. I am concerned that the permitting process under this legislation will make it more difficult for effective environmental review to move forward in New Hampshire. That is why I am offering my amendment today to help provide some additional protections to safeguard human health, the environment, and property rights. Specifically, this amendment would exempt from the requirements in the bill any project that would negatively affect the drinking water supply or air quality of nearby communities. It also ensures that construction projects covered under the legislation cannot violate the sovereignty of Native American tribes. These provisions would at least ensure that we are limiting the most dangerous consequences of this legislation. Additionally, the amendment requires that any environmental documents produced pursuant to the legislation include information about whether a project will use equipment and materials manufactured in the United States and whether it will create jobs for U.S. workers, including our veterans. Like so many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I have been intently focused on what we can do to grow and expand U.S. manufacturing jobs and create good-paying middle-class jobs right here in America and, in particular, as a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, how we can serve our veterans. The reporting requirement in this amendment will help generate greater awareness for how we utilize American-made machinery and products in our construction processes. I urge support for my amendment to make sure that this bill does not harm the health of our constituents and to take an important step toward job creation and hiring of veterans. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GOODLATTE. I rise in opposition to the motion. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, after President Obama's ill-conceived stimulus bill failed, he blamed its failure on the lack of shovel-ready construction projects. President Obama was even quoted in the press to have joked about it. ``Shovel-ready was not as shovel-ready as we expected,'' he said. Hard-working Americans desperate for jobs didn't think that was funny. They still don't. They are watching us right now, wanting to know if we can deliver meaningful reform that will create jobs. Let's send a message to them today that we can and we will. For years now the President's Jobs Council's recommendation that we streamline the Federal permitting process has been staring the President in the face. Just last term President Obama stood in this House and promised action to ``slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process . . . so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible.'' Mr. Speaker, the RAPID Act is precisely the legislation to do that. It is exactly what our private and public sector leaders have called for. It is what millions of American workers yearning for new work and higher wages need. True to form, some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle support this motion to recommit in an attempt to stop this legislation. They can't yet bring themselves to say, ``Yes, we can'' to the cutting of bureaucratic red tape and obstruction. But this motion to recommit is the exact mirror image of everything that is wrong with the Federal permitting process and keeps jobs from the American people. It is nothing but a fabricated argument, a procedural device, a tried and true tactic of delay--an excuse for Members of Congress to duck a vote and not make a needed decision that will bring millions of good, high-paying jobs to the people of this country. The bill does not require a project to be approved, only that an agency timely decide whether or not to approve it. I urge my colleagues to vote against this motion and vote for the RAPID Act. Finally, Mr. Speaker, all of us today are stunned by the dramatic and courageous decision of the Speaker of the [[Page H6255]] House, John Boehner, to retire at the end of October. We thank him for his tireless work, his conservative leadership of the Republican Conference for 9 years, his distinguished service as Speaker of the House for nearly 5 years, and for his long service to the people of this great country. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Recorded Vote Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 5- minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by a 5-minute vote on the passage of the bill, if ordered.

amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. if adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended. mr. speaker, we can all agree on the need to ensure that construction projects are completed in a timely and effective manner without the need for unnecessary review or red tape. no one can argue that our current permitting system is perfect. but the bill before us today is yet another misguided republican attempt to undermine critical environmental protections that we all rely on. this legislation will splinter and unnecessarily accelerate the permitting process in a way that impairs the ability of agencies to effectively evaluate the impacts of a given project. consequently, the bill will weaken the ability of our constituents to understand the impacts of proposed projects and effectively limit their voice in the permitting process. this is particularly true for low-income and minority communities that too often are faced with a disproportionate share of pollution and environmental contaminants. in my home state of new hampshire, we are intimately familiar with the need for strong public input in permitting processes. as the permitting moves forward on different energy infrastructure projects, i have been working aggressively to ensure that the views of my constituents are heard. i am concerned that the permitting process under this legislation will make it more difficult for effective environmental review to move forward in new hampshire. that is why i am offering my amendment today to help provide some additional protections to safeguard human health, the environment, and property rights. specifically, this amendment would exempt from the requirements in the bill any project that would negatively affect the drinking water supply or air quality of nearby communities. it also ensures that construction projects covered under the legislation cannot violate the sovereignty of native american tribes. these provisions would at least ensure that we are limiting the most dangerous consequences of this legislation. additionally, the amendment requires that any environmental documents produced pursuant to the legislation include information about whether a project will use equipment and materials manufactured in the united states and whether it will create jobs for u.s. workers, including our veterans. like so many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, i have been intently focused on what we can do to grow and expand u.s. manufacturing jobs and create good-paying middle-class jobs right here in america and, in particular, as a member of the veterans' affairs committee, how we can serve our veterans. the reporting requirement in this amendment will help generate greater awareness for how we utilize american-made machinery and products in our construction processes. i urge support for my amendment to make sure that this bill does not harm the health of our constituents and to take an important step toward job creation and hiring of veterans. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. goodlatte. i rise in opposition to the motion. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from virginia is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. goodlatte. mr. speaker, after president obama's ill-conceived stimulus bill failed, he blamed its failure on the lack of shovel-ready construction projects. president obama was even quoted in the press to have joked about it. ``shovel-ready was not as shovel-ready as we expected,'' he said. hard-working americans desperate for jobs didn't think that was funny. they still don't. they are watching us right now, wanting to know if we can deliver meaningful reform that will create jobs. let's send a message to them today that we can and we will. for years now the president's jobs council's recommendation that we streamline the federal permitting process has been staring the president in the face. just last term president obama stood in this house and promised action to ``slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process . . . so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible.'' mr. speaker, the rapid act is precisely the legislation to do that. it is exactly what our private and public sector leaders have called for. it is what millions of american workers yearning for new work and higher wages need. true to form, some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle support this motion to recommit in an attempt to stop this legislation. they can't yet bring themselves to say, ``yes, we can'' to the cutting of bureaucratic red tape and obstruction. but this motion to recommit is the exact mirror image of everything that is wrong with the federal permitting process and keeps jobs from the american people. it is nothing but a fabricated argument, a procedural device, a tried and true tactic of delay--an excuse for members of congress to duck a vote and not make a needed decision that will bring millions of good, high-paying jobs to the people of this country. the bill does not require a project to be approved, only that an agency timely decide whether or not to approve it. i urge my colleagues to vote against this motion and vote for the rapid act. finally, mr. speaker, all of us today are stunned by the dramatic and courageous decision of the speaker of the [[page h6255]] house, john boehner, to retire at the end of october. we thank him for his tireless work, his conservative leadership of the republican conference for 9 years, his distinguished service as speaker of the house for nearly 5 years, and for his long service to the people of this great country. i yield back the balance of my time. the

Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize September as National Suicide Prevention Month. This month is especially important to think about what needs to be done to help our at-risk veterans. From 1990 to 2010, a veteran committed suicide almost every hour of every day. This is completely unacceptable and signifies a clear need for action to prevent suicide and to treat those who are suffering. Veterans have risked their lives and sacrificed tremendously for our Nation. But the disturbing reality is that far too many of our veterans who fought for our freedom are not free when they return. They are trapped in their own minds. We cannot afford to be bystanders any longer. Mr. Speaker, it is past time we stand by our veterans and everyone else who is suffering. It is incumbent upon all of us to reach out to those who may need help and erase the stigma surrounding mental illness. Together, with an increased focus on the very real, invisible wounds of war, we can better serve our returning heroes. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 139 (Friday, September 25, 2015)] [House] [Page H6256] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION MONTH (Mr. DOLD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

Bill, who went to college and started his political career in the East Bay, is a dedicated public official who spent many years working for the people of California. This includes service in the State legislature as State attorney general and as State treasurer. Among his many successes was his work to protect our environment, a highlight of which is championing the San Francisco Bay Trail. He came up with the idea for the trail, introduced the legislation, and got support from both Republicans and Democrats. It has been 28 years since Bill's idea became law and, thanks to his efforts, we have 340 miles of trail around the bay. It provides opportunities for recreation, education, and transportation for area residents every day. When finished, 500 miles of trails will surround and connect people around the San Francisco Bay area. It is a wonderful gift to future generations.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to inform my colleagues and those who are listening of a very important conference that is occurring here in the Capitol today in the Capitol Visitor Center, a convening of nearly 500 Americans and those of Ukrainian American and Ukrainian heritage who are meeting to save Ukraine now. They are mobilizing humanitarian endeavors across our country to ship medical equipment, to ship used clothing, used shoes, mattresses, tents, to deal with the 1.7 million children who have been left homeless, and over 5 million refugees who have been affected by the brutal Russian invasion on Russia's western side and Ukraine's eastern side, as Russia has killed over 6,000 innocent Ukrainians and thousands have been injured. A cold winter is approaching in Ukraine. Many families are now eating more and more potatoes, lacking sufficient sustenance, and there are so many children that have been displaced. I am here saying, for those who are listening, go to the Web site of the U.S. Ukraine Foundation. Learn what is being done. If you can help in your communities to ship goods through your National Guard, this is the time for freedom fighters across our country to lend humanitarian aid to Ukraine. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 139 (Friday, September 25, 2015)] [House] [Page H6257] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SAVE UKRAINE NOW (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)

CREC-2015-09-25-pt1-PgH6258-2,CREC-2015-09-25,114,CONGRATULATING GENERAL MARTIN DEMPSEY ON HIS RETIREMENT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 139 (Friday, September 25, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6258-H6259] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING GENERAL MARTIN DEMPSEY ON HIS RETIREMENT The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, after 41 years in uniform, General Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the highest-ranking military officer in the land, retires today. More than once this year, we on the Armed Services Committee have expressed our gratitude for his service and bid General Dempsey farewell as he testified before our committee for what we expected would be his final hearing; but, time and time again, world events brought him back to us. That underscores what a consequential job General Dempsey has had. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is the senior military adviser to both the legislative and executive branches of government. I am personally very grateful for his willingness to spend time, formally and informally, with members of our committee discussing our country's security, providing his best military advice on an unprecedented spectrum of serious and diverse threats during an era of declining resources and when Congress and the President have very different views on national security policy. All of that has been a tremendous challenge. In his four decades of dedicated service, General Dempsey has led our forces against threats far different from those we faced when he left his native New Jersey to become a West Point cadet. Instead of Soviets in the Fulda Gap, General Dempsey has had to confront a newly aggressive Russia, an expanding China, Iranian-backed instability in the Middle East, as well as ISIS and al Qaeda. And those are just some of the threats we can see. General Dempsey has also had to face increasing cyber attacks on our military and our country, the threat posed by diseases like Ebola in an increasingly mobile world, and a tremendous amount of change within the military, itself. In honoring him and his service, we also honor, through him, those who have served under him. To meet the challenges that the United States faces around the world and to meet our sacred obligations to our servicemembers and their families requires a commitment to service and sacrifice that separates America from the rest of the world and separates those who serve in the military from much of our own population. It takes something special. For having that ``something special'' and for serving our Nation with honor and distinction for 41 years, I know I speak for my colleagues in thanking General Martin Dempsey and his wife, Deanie, for their service to our country as they move into the next phase of their life together. Mr. Speaker, I will now extend my remarks with further discussion of the career of General Martin Dempsey. General Dempsey's career has been a lesson in dedication to country and selfless service. A career armor officer, he has commanded at every level--from Platoon Leader to Combatant Commander--and his assignments have carried him and his family across the United States and around the world. As a company grade officer, he served with the 2nd Cavalry in Europe and the 10th Cavalry at Fort Carson. Following troop command, he earned his Masters of Arts in English from Duke University and was assigned to the English Department at West Point. He subsequently earned additional advanced degrees from the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College and the National War College. In 1991, General Dempsey deployed with the Third Armored Division in support of Operation Desert Storm. He later commanded a battalion in Germany and then served as the Army's ``senior scout'' as the 67th Colonel of the Third Armored Cavalry Regiment--the Brave Rifles--before reporting to the Joint Staff as an assistant deputy director in the J-5 and later as a Special Assistant to the 14th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In 2003, General Dempsey commanded the 1st Armored Division in Baghdad and returned to Iraq in 2005 as the Commanding General of the Multi-National Security Transition Command--Iraq. From 2007 to 2008, he was the Deputy Commander and then Acting Commander of U.S. Central Command, and from 2008 to 2011, he commanded U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command. Appointed to serve as the Army's 37th Chief of Staff, General Dempsey led his beloved Army a short 149 days before being tapped to serve as the 18th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In that capacity, and as the Nation's highest-ranking military officer, he has served as the principal military advisor to the President, the Secretary of Defense, the National Security Council, and Congress. General Dempsey's job has required him to coordinate and build consensus among the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, the Services, and the Combatant Commands. He has also developed important relationships with military leaders in other nations. He has guided the Joint Force in executing an extraordinary range of global responsibilities, from counter-terrorism and crisis response, to supporting our allies, building partner capacity, and humanitarian assistance. His efforts to strengthen key alliances, bolster new partnerships, and more closely integrate the military with other tools of national power and influence are commendable. General Dempsey's tenure as Chairman has been marked by significant transitions in military operations and personnel in an increasingly dynamic and unpredictable security environment. A firm believer in constantly learning and growing, General Dempsey guided the Joint Force to study, learn, and incorporate lessons learned over the past 14 years. In addition, recognizing the shifting nature of the security environment and our ability to respond to it, General Dempsey led a paradigm shift in how we posture and employ this Joint team around the world. At the same time, the past few years have witnessed exponential growth of the cyber threat against our Nation, and General Dempsey has pushed the expansion of our cyber capabilities in response. He has championed the rapid development of our cyber forces, and implemented the Joint Information Environment to optimize and better defend our military's information technology infrastructure. These initiatives will be critical to the future security of our Nation. As principle steward of the military profession, he renewed an internal commitment to [[Page H6259]] strengthen the Profession of Arms and reinvigorated education, training, and leader development. He managed historic decisions, including reforms to General and Flag Officer ethics, and Department- wide improvements in Sexual Assault Prevention and Response. His stewardship set conditions to preserve the strength of the all- volunteer force and to ensure service members departing the military successfully transition back into their communities. As he retires, General Dempsey should take great pride in his role in ensuring our military remains the best supported, best trained, best equipped, and best led force on the planet. With over four decades of dedicated service to our Nation, General Dempsey and his family deserve our most heartfelt gratitude and admiration. He and Deanie have our very best wishes for the next phase and the challenges and opportunities it will inevitably bring. Our Nation, our Joint Force, and our Army are all better for his leadership and distinguished service. I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 139 (Friday, September 25, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6258-H6259] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING GENERAL MARTIN DEMPSEY ON HIS RETIREMENT The SPEAKER pro tempore.

from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] congratulating general martin dempsey on his retirement the speaker pro tempore. under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the gentleman from texas (mr. thornberry) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. mr. thornberry. mr. speaker, after 41 years in uniform, general martin dempsey, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and the highest-ranking military officer in the land, retires today. more than once this year, we on the armed services committee have expressed our gratitude for his service and bid general dempsey farewell as he testified before our committee for what we expected would be his final hearing; but, time and time again, world events brought him back to us. that underscores what a consequential job general dempsey has had. the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff is the senior military adviser to both the legislative and executive branches of government. i am personally very grateful for his willingness to spend time, formally and informally, with members of our committee discussing our country's security, providing his best military advice on an unprecedented spectrum of serious and diverse threats during an era of declining resources and when congress and the president have very different views on national security policy. all of that has been a tremendous challenge. in his four decades of dedicated service, general dempsey has led our forces against threats far different from those we faced when he left his native new jersey to become a west point cadet. instead of soviets in the fulda gap, general dempsey has had to confront a newly aggressive russia, an expanding china, iranian-backed instability in the middle east, as well as isis and al qaeda. and those are just some of the threats we can see. general dempsey has also had to face increasing cyber attacks on our military and our country, the threat posed by diseases like ebola in an increasingly mobile world, and a tremendous amount of change within the military, itself. in honoring him and his service, we also honor, through him, those who have served under him. to meet the challenges that the united states faces around the world and to meet our sacred obligations to our servicemembers and their families requires a commitment to service and sacrifice that separates america from the rest of the world and separates those who serve in the military from much of our own population. it takes something special. for having that ``something special'' and for serving our nation with honor and distinction for 41 years, i know i speak for my colleagues in thanking general martin dempsey and his wife, deanie, for their service to our country as they move into the next phase of their life together. mr. speaker, i will now extend my remarks with further discussion of the career of general martin dempsey. general dempsey's career has been a lesson in dedication to country and selfless service. a career armor officer, he has commanded at every level--from platoon leader to combatant commander--and his assignments have carried him and his family across the united states and around the world. as a company grade officer, he served with the 2nd cavalry in europe and the 10th cavalry at fort carson. following troop command, he earned his masters of arts in english from duke university and was assigned to the english department at west point. he subsequently earned additional advanced degrees from the u.s. army command and general staff college and the national war college. in 1991, general dempsey deployed with the third armored division in support of operation desert storm. he later commanded a battalion in germany and then served as the army's ``senior scout'' as the 67th colonel of the third armored cavalry regiment--the brave rifles--before reporting to the joint staff as an assistant deputy director in the j-5 and later as a special assistant to the 14th chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. in 2003, general dempsey commanded the 1st armored division in baghdad and returned to iraq in 2005 as the commanding general of the multi-national security transition command--iraq. from 2007 to 2008, he was the deputy commander and then acting commander of u.s. central command, and from 2008 to 2011, he commanded u.s. army training and doctrine command. appointed to serve as the army's 37th chief of staff, general dempsey led his beloved army a short 149 days before being tapped to serve as the 18th chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. in that capacity, and as the nation's highest-ranking military officer, he has served as the principal military advisor to the president, the secretary of defense, the national security council, and congress. general dempsey's job has required him to coordinate and build consensus among the office of the secretary of defense, the joint staff, the services, and the combatant commands. he has also developed important relationships with military leaders in other nations. he has guided the joint force in executing an extraordinary range of global responsibilities, from counter-terrorism and crisis response, to supporting our allies, building partner capacity, and humanitarian assistance. his efforts to strengthen key alliances, bolster new partnerships, and more closely integrate the military with other tools of national power and influence are commendable. general dempsey's tenure as chairman has been marked by significant transitions in military operations and personnel in an increasingly dynamic and unpredictable security environment. a firm believer in constantly learning and growing, general dempsey guided the joint force to study, learn, and incorporate lessons learned over the past 14 years. in addition, recognizing the shifting nature of the security environment and our ability to respond to it, general dempsey led a paradigm shift in how we posture and employ this joint team around the world. at the same time, the past few years have witnessed exponential growth of the cyber threat against our nation, and general dempsey has pushed the expansion of our cyber capabilities in response. he has championed the rapid development of our cyber forces, and implemented the joint information environment to optimize and better defend our military's information technology infrastructure. these initiatives will be critical to the future security of our nation. as principle steward of the military profession, he renewed an internal commitment to [[page h6259]] strengthen the profession of arms and reinvigorated education, training, and leader development. he managed historic decisions, including reforms to general and flag officer ethics, and department- wide improvements in sexual assault prevention and response. his stewardship set conditions to preserve the strength of the all- volunteer force and to ensure service members departing the military successfully transition back into their communities. as he retires, general dempsey should take great pride in his role in ensuring our military remains the best supported, best trained, best equipped, and best led force on the planet. with over four decades of dedicated service to our nation, general dempsey and his family deserve our most heartfelt gratitude and admiration. he and deanie have our very best wishes for the next phase and the challenges and opportunities it will inevitably bring. our nation, our joint force, and our army are all better for his leadership and distinguished service. i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",7753

Mr. President, grace under pressure; country and institution before self. These are the things that come to mind when I think of John Boehner. He is an ally, he is a friend, and he took over as Republican leader at a very difficult time for his party. When some said Republicans could never recover, he never gave up. When some gave into defeatism, he kept up the fight. And because he did, Speaker Boehner was able to transform a broken and dispirited Republican minority into the largest Republican majority since the 1920s. That is a legacy few can match. He flew across the country more times than he can count to support Members of his conference and to recruit new Members to the cause. As the leader of a new majority, he turned the tide in Congress and brought conservative reform in many areas. He worked tirelessly to provide hope to those who dreamed of a better life and to middle-class families who struggled under the weight of this administration. John knows what it is like to struggle and to dream of something better. He has lived it. That a young man from Reading, OH, wielding a bar towel could one day wield the gavel of the U.S. House of Representatives reminds us of the continuing promise of this country. We all know yesterday was an incredibly important event for the Speaker. It was his aim to bring the same spirit of grace to others that has always guided his life. One only had to look out onto the Capitol lawn to see what he achieved. And that he chose this moment to make this decision means he is willing to leave us in a similar spirit. I know we will all have more to say then. But for now, thank you, my friend. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 139 (Friday, September 25, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S6951] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO JOHN BOEHNER Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I, like most of America, was stunned this morning to learn that John Boehner is going to resign in the next few weeks. I have had a relationship with John Boehner for a long time. His becoming Speaker, of course, made those relations much more close. I have not always agreed, and I wasn't always happy with what John told me, but he never ever misled me. He never told me something that wasn't true, and I accepted that. I got to where I understood John Boehner very well. His word was always good. John and I had a lot of dealings--so-called back-channel meetings. Everyone knows that a lot of things we do are not in the public eye. And certainly some things we worked on together perhaps wouldn't have worked out very well in the public eye, but there were things we had to do to get things done. I had a very good relationship with John Boehner. My staff got along with his. He has had two chiefs of staff and they have both been terrific to work with. My staff has reached out to them on so many occasions in very difficult times, and they had a good relationship. I have no doubt that everything John Boehner has done has been done with the fact in mind that he was doing his best for the people of his district in [[Page S6952]] Ohio and for our country. He had a very difficult job. I know the Presiding Officer served under John Boehner and so he knows what a tough job he had. He had this faction, that faction, another faction, and a couple more. But ousting a man like John Boehner--a good man like John Boehner. John Boehner is a conservative Republican, but his problem is that John Boehner has been pragmatic. He has realized there comes a time when you have to make a deal. I say to the Presiding Officer and everyone within the sound of my voice, although I didn't know General Eisenhower, President Eisenhower--never met him, never saw him--but I was here when Ronald Reagan was President and he had conservative credentials. Ronald Reagan was somebody who understood the art of compromise. Who else could have worked out something with the Soviet Union? I am not sure there is anybody, but Ronald Reagan was able to do that. I am so concerned. I am seeing the Republican Party--not the party of Dwight Eisenhower, as I have studied him, or the man Ronald Reagan as I knew him. I just think it is very, very sad the Tea Party Caucus the Republican leaders have embraced to win in 2010, I guess, now have taken over control of the party. To say I will miss John Boehner is a tremendous understatement. I looked out for him in ways I could, and he looked out for me in the ways he could. I will always consider John Boehner my friend, and I look forward to working with him until he leaves. I understand it is going to be in late October, but I will continue to work with him, as I have in the past, to do what I think is the right thing for the country, as I am confident he will. Hopefully, we will continue someplace in the middle to get things done. I have gotten things done with John Boehner that I wasn't happy with, and he wasn't happy with what we had to come up with, but sometimes you do the best you can. I wish John Boehner the very best in the future. Whatever I can do to make his life more pleasant, I will be happy to do that. Whether it is setting up a golf game for him in Las Vegas or helping in some government matter, I will do whatever I can because John Boehner, as far as I am concerned, is a good man, and it is a gross underestimate to say I will miss him. I will. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 139 (Friday, September 25, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S6951-S6952] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO JOHN BOEHNER Mr. REID.

He had a very difficult job. I know the Presiding Officer served under John Boehner and so he knows what a tough job he had. He had this faction, that faction, another faction, and a couple more. But ousting a man like John Boehner--a good man like John Boehner. John Boehner is a conservative Republican, but his problem is that John Boehner has been pragmatic. He has realized there comes a time when you have to make a deal. I say to the Presiding Officer and everyone within the sound of my voice, although I didn't know General Eisenhower, President Eisenhower--never met him, never saw him--but I was here when Ronald Reagan was President and he had conservative credentials. Ronald Reagan was somebody who understood the art of compromise. Who else could have worked out something with the Soviet Union? I am not sure there is anybody, but Ronald Reagan was able to do that. I am so concerned. I am seeing the Republican Party--not the party of Dwight Eisenhower, as I have studied him, or the man Ronald Reagan as I knew him. I just think it is very, very sad the Tea Party Caucus the Republican leaders have embraced to win in 2010, I guess, now have taken over control of the party. To say I will miss John Boehner is a tremendous understatement. I looked out for him in ways I could, and he looked out for me in the ways he could. I will always consider John Boehner my friend, and I look forward to working with him until he leaves. I understand it is going to be in late October, but I will continue to work with him, as I have in the past, to do what I think is the right thing for the country, as I am confident he will. Hopefully, we will continue someplace in the middle to get things done. I have gotten things done with John Boehner that I wasn't happy with, and he wasn't happy with what we had to come up with, but sometimes you do the best you can. I wish John Boehner the very best in the future. Whatever I can do to make his life more pleasant, I will be happy to do that. Whether it is setting up a golf game for him in Las Vegas or helping in some government matter, I will do whatever I can because John Boehner, as far as I am concerned, is a good man, and it is a gross underestimate to say I will miss him. I will. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SULLIVAN.

Mr. President, I, like most of America, was stunned this morning to learn that John Boehner is going to resign in the next few weeks. I have had a relationship with John Boehner for a long time. His becoming Speaker, of course, made those relations much more close. I have not always agreed, and I wasn't always happy with what John told me, but he never ever misled me. He never told me something that wasn't true, and I accepted that. I got to where I understood John Boehner very well. His word was always good. John and I had a lot of dealings--so-called back-channel meetings. Everyone knows that a lot of things we do are not in the public eye. And certainly some things we worked on together perhaps wouldn't have worked out very well in the public eye, but there were things we had to do to get things done. I had a very good relationship with John Boehner. My staff got along with his. He has had two chiefs of staff and they have both been terrific to work with.

Mr. President, Louisianians are committed to preserving the traditions that make us profoundly unique as a State and as a nation. This is especially true in the Louisiana Purchase's oldest city Natchitoches, LA, home to Small Business of the Week, the Judge Porter House Bed and Breakfast. Nestled in the Cane River National Heritage Area, the Judge Porter House Bed and Breakfast offers a unique experience to its guests. Built in 1912, the establishment originally served as the home of ``Judge'' Thomas Fitzgerald Porter and his wife, Wilhelmina. While not an actual judge, judge Porter was a prominent figure who worked at the parish courthouse, and during the course of his life, he enjoyed the honorary title. Over the next few decades, the home was sold to various families who contributed to the effort of restoring the property to its original state. By 1987, while in the care of Mark Rachal and his wife, Sharon, they remodeled the interior and revamped the landscaping for the home's grand reopening in 1996 as a part of the Natchitoches Historic Foundation's Annual Fall Pilgrimage. Today, under the management and care of Charles LaCaze, Jr., the 3,000-square-foot property incorporates many turn-of-the-century architectural elements throughout its five guest rooms, two parlors, and the Queen Anne-style gallery that wraps around the house. Each year, the Judge Porter House Bed and Breakfast hosts guests from around the Nation. Located in downtown Natchitoches, LA, visitors can walk to various local restaurants and shops, as well as visit nearby national parks and fish hatcheries after enjoying a traditional southern-style breakfast. Congratulations to Judge Porter Bed and Breakfast for being selected as Small Business of the Week. Thank you for your commitment to the preservation of Louisiana's rich history. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 139 (Friday, September 25, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S6954] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE JUDGE PORTER HOUSE BED AND BREAKFAST Mr. VITTER.

CREC-2015-09-25-pt1-PgS6952-2,CREC-2015-09-25,114,UNITED STATES-CHINA RELATIONS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 139 (Friday, September 25, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S6952-S6954] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] UNITED STATES-CHINA RELATIONS Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to say a few words about a critical challenge and opportunity facing the United States. For months many of us have been on the floor debating some of the important foreign policy and national security issues that our Nation faces--whether it is Islamic terrorism, ISIS, the President's flawed and dangerous Iran agreement or a resurgent Russia in Europe and the Arctic. The list of these issues is long, and it is growing. But one issue that has not really gotten much attention--I believe the attention that it deserves--and that I would like to speak about this afternoon is the long-term national security and foreign policy consequences of the rise of China. China's President Xi Jinping is in town right now. He is visiting America. He is going to meet with President Obama on a state visit, and some of us in Congress will have an opportunity to meet with him later today. It is an opportunity to start seriously thinking about the challenges and opportunities that a rising China presents to the world and to the United States. Perhaps we are not talking about this issue as much as we should on the floor because it doesn't seem to be an immediate issue. It is a bit of a longer term matter. But it is also something that in historical terms is happening so fast. I will give one statistic. In 1980 China's economy was smaller than that of the Netherlands. Last year, just the incremental growth of China's economy was as large as the Netherlands' economy. They have had incredible growth. But some of our country's most deep and strategic thinkers and historians agree that the rise of China is--over the next decade or two--the paramount issue for us to focus on in the United States. As far back as 2005, 10 years ago almost to the day, then-Deputy Secretary of State Bob Zellick, who went on to be the president of the World Bank and a former U.S. Trade Representative for the United States, a very strategic thinker, gave what was called the ``responsible stakeholders'' speech, a very well-renowned speech that people are still reading on U.S.-China relations. In that speech 10 years ago, he said: ``How the United States deals with China's rising power is a central question in American foreign policy.'' Just a few months ago in testimony before the Armed Services Committee, Harvard Professor Graham Allison gave testimony that in many ways is reflected in an article he just published in the Atlantic yesterday on the eve of the visit of the President of China. He states in that article and in his testimony from a couple of months ago: The preeminent geostrategic challenge of this era is not violent Islamic extremists, or a resurgent Russia. It is the impact that China's ascendance will have on the U.S.-led national order. More specifically, Professor Allison writes that ``the defining question about global order for this generation is whether China and the United States can escape''--what he refers to as ``the Thucydides trap.'' He is referencing the renowned ancient Greek historian. Professor Allison coined this term to describe the strategic dilemma and dangers that occur when a rising power rivals a ruling power, as when--an example he gives in ancient Greece--Athens challenged Sparta in ancient Greece which ultimately led to the Peloponnesian War. Professor Allison has caught the attention of many, including President Xi Jinping of China, who in a speech just a few days ago in Seattle actually referenced this term--the ``Thucydides trap''--when talking about U.S.-China relations. Now, both Professor Allison and President Xi, in his speech, make it clear that conflict between the United States and China is certainly not inevitable, regardless of what he says with regard to the Thucydides trap, and I certainly would agree with that. Professor Allison, however, does appear to draw some very sobering conclusions in his recent article that should make all of us take serious pause. He concludes in his article written yesterday: ``War between the U.S. and China is more likely than recognized at the moment.'' These are his words, not mine. This is one of the most distinguished professors of international relations in the United States. I think these words underscore the need for those of us in the Senate to give due attention to the importance of the U.S.-China relationship and the attendant risks of Graham Allison's Thucydides trap. Fortunately, I believe we are well-positioned as an institution in the Senate to do this. In the Federalist Papers, Madison talks about one of the roles of the U.S. Senate with its Members having 6-year terms to be able to ensure lasting relations between the United States and other nations through the institution of the Senate. Perhaps more than any other part of the Federal Government, this institution has the opportunity to think strategically and act for the long-term interests of our country. Fortunately, we also have many experts, historians, professors, and practitioners, whether it is people such as Bob Zoellick or Graham Allison or Henry Kissinger or a new generation of scholars, such as Mike Green at CSIS, who have been thinking about these issues--the Asia-Pacific, the rise in China--for decades. Their articles, books, and speeches are critical to devising national strategies to advance America's interests in the region. This is a long-term endeavor for all of us. It is imperative that it remains on our radar screens through the [[Page S6953]] course of State visits, through the course of elections, through the course of changing administrations. Contrary to what some say, we as a country do have the capacity to think and act in our long-term strategic interests as a government. Our successful bipartisan strategy dealing with the Soviet Union, started by Kennan's famous ``X'' telegram, which created the strategy of containment over the course of decades, over the course of several administrations and several different Congresses--it was a successful long-term strategy for the United States. From my perspective, as we look at this issue--the Asia-Pacific--its importance--the rise of China--I think a few key touchstones are important to remember. First, America is an Asia-Pacific power. My State of Alaska is an Asia-Pacific State. The United States has strong networks of alliances throughout the Asia-Pacific, and our country has built the post-World War II architecture that has enabled this dynamic region of the world to thrive in terms of peace and in terms of prosperity. In fact, when we look at the last 70 years of history in that region, we have been the linchpin of that peace and prosperity for all countries in the region, whether our strongest allies such as Japan and Korea and Australia or other countries--countries even like China-- and we have earned the trust of our allies for our commitment. So we need to maintain that trust as we move forward and we need to listen to our allies in the region. Second, we need to understand the history of the region and our involvement there better as we think through what the strategy is moving forward. I have had the opportunity to go to the National Archives a number of times already since I joined the Senate, and there is a statue outside the National Archives and it has a command on it. It says simply: ``Study the past.'' Study the past. Again, I think that as we are looking at our strategy in that region, it is critical that we need to be doing that. Professor Allison's article, as well as books, is a good start, and I think all of us need to continue that focus. Third, no matter what strategy we end up using vis-a-vis China and the Asia-Pacific region, we have to be strong again at home. My biggest surprise as a new freshman Senator--my biggest surprise in this body is how little we, or certainly for that matter the Obama administration, talk about our economy, talk about the strength or the lack thereof of our economy. Perhaps because the performance of our economy has been so lackluster, we have even doubled down expectations. They have this term now in Washington called ``the new normal.'' American growth rates have typically been at 3, 3.5, 4 percent GDP growth throughout most of our history. Over the last 6 years, we can barely break 2 percent GDP growth; 1.5, 2 percent. Two quarters ago, we went back into recession. They are now calling this the new normal and we need to accept this. We rarely hear the President or even the Treasury Secretary come out to the American people and say: No, we have to grow traditional levels of American growth--3.5, 5 percent, 4 percent GDP growth. The Presiding Officer knows this. He has focused on this issue. We are not doing that. We have to get back to strength at home because a continued weak U.S. economy--the new normal--growing at 1.5 percent for the next 5, 10 years will create all kinds of additional challenges for us and in my view will make the Thucydides trap that Professor Allison talks about more likely for the United States and China. Yes, China has certain advantages, but in so many areas--in so many areas--the United States holds all the cards--in so many different areas. If we were in a global poker match and we were all at the table--all the big countries--we would look at our hand and we would see aces. Let me just name a few. The high-tech sector, still the envy of the world; not just Silicon Valley, all over America. Our agriculture sector. We feed the world. Universities. We have the best universities in the world, by far--by far. Certain States in America have better top universities than all of China. Finance and commercial aspects of our economy, the best entrepreneurs. Energy. We have a renaissance in energy where we are now the largest producer of oil and gas in the world and the largest producer of renewables. This is a huge advantage. It is creating a rebirth of manufacturing in America. Fisheries. We harvest some of the most amazing seafood, more than almost any other country in the world. Foreign relations. We look at our allies in Asia, they are coming to the United States in terms of wanting to deepen their relationship with us. And, of course, the U.S. military, the finest in the world right now. It is right now. I had the opportunity to go down to the World War II Memorial this morning and I saw a couple of Honor Flights coming in, seeing those veterans of ours who fought and defended this great Nation in World War II. We have had the best military for decades, and we are going to continue to do that. The key is we have to unleash our economic might once again, which has been so dormant during the Obama administration. We have to do this. If we do this, we can view the rise of China from a standpoint of strength, confidence, and opportunity, not trepidation. As Bob Zoellick mentioned 10 years ago in his ``Responsible Stakeholders'' speech: ``You hear voices that perceive China solely through the lens of fear, but America succeeds when we look to the future as an opportunity, not when we fear what the future might bring.'' I have had the opportunity to view the U.S.-China relationship from a variety of lenses, including economic, diplomatic, and even to some degree military. I previously served as the commissioner of natural resources and energy in Alaska and was able to take a trip over there with some Alaskans to look at ways to deepen our economic, trade, and energy relationship between my State and China and have them visit Alaska and participate in those meetings. I served in terms of diplomacy as an assistant secretary of state and have had numerous opportunities to travel to China with some of our top U.S. Government leaders--at the time Bob Zoellick, Secretary of the Treasury Paulson, and Secretary of State Rice--to discuss ways in which to deepen economic relationships and work on the U.S.-China relationship. Even many years ago as a U.S. marine aboard an amphibious assault ship in the East and South China Sea during the third Taiwan Strait crisis, I was a very, very, very small player in an episode that once again demonstrated American resolve and commitment in the region. There is a long tradition from Alaska Senators in keeping a focus on the importance of the Asia-Pacific, from both the Alaska and the U.S. perspective. Former Senator Ted Stevens served in World War II as a Flying Tiger, flying the Hump in that part of the world, and his subsequent focus throughout his career was very much on the Asia-Pacific, as was Frank Murkowski's expertise and experience, particularly with regard to our relationship with Taiwan. The focus on the Asia-Pacific and the rise of China is certainly one that in many ways we can view as an opportunity, certainly in my State. Last year, China became the No. 1 export market for Alaskan goods: $1.4 billion of goods exported from Alaska to China--an 18-percent increase. So I believe maintaining this focus--and we have this visit today with the President of China--is critically important not only to my State, not only to our country but also to our allies in the region. We should all try to put more focus and our best thinking on these critical foreign policy and national security issues which, although they are not always on the front page of the papers, I believe are some of the most important long-term strategic challenges and opportunities we face in this country. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to say a few words about a critical challenge and opportunity facing the United States. For months many of us have been on the floor debating some of the important foreign policy and national security issues that our Nation faces--whether it is Islamic terrorism, ISIS, the President's flawed and dangerous Iran agreement or a resurgent Russia in Europe and the Arctic. The list of these issues is long, and it is growing. But one issue that has not really gotten much attention--I believe the attention that it deserves--and that I would like to speak about this afternoon is the long-term national security and foreign policy consequences of the rise of China. China's President Xi Jinping is in town right now. He is visiting America. He is going to meet with President Obama on a state visit, and some of us in Congress will have an opportunity to meet with him later today. It is an opportunity to start seriously thinking about the challenges and opportunities that a rising China presents to the world and to the United States. Perhaps we are not talking about this issue as much as we should on the floor because it doesn't seem to be an immediate issue. It is a bit of a longer term matter. But it is also something that in historical terms is happening so fast. I will give one statistic. In 1980 China's economy was smaller than that of the Netherlands. Last year, just the incremental growth of China's economy was as large as the Netherlands' economy. They have had incredible growth. But some of our country's most deep and strategic thinkers and historians agree that the rise of China is--over the next decade or two--the paramount issue for us to focus on in the United States.

It is creating a rebirth of manufacturing in America. Fisheries. We harvest some of the most amazing seafood, more than almost any other country in the world. Foreign relations. We look at our allies in Asia, they are coming to the United States in terms of wanting to deepen their relationship with us. And, of course, the U.S. military, the finest in the world right now. It is right now. I had the opportunity to go down to the World War II Memorial this morning and I saw a couple of Honor Flights coming in, seeing those veterans of ours who fought and defended this great Nation in World War II. We have had the best military for decades, and we are going to continue to do that. The key is we have to unleash our economic might once again, which has been so dormant during the Obama administration. We have to do this. If we do this, we can view the rise of China from a standpoint of strength, confidence, and opportunity, not trepidation. As Bob Zoellick mentioned 10 years ago in his ``Responsible Stakeholders'' speech: ``You hear voices that perceive China solely through the lens of fear, but America succeeds when we look to the future as an opportunity, not when we fear what the future might bring.'' I have had the opportunity to view the U.S.-China relationship from a variety of lenses, including economic, diplomatic, and even to some degree military. I previously served as the commissioner of natural resources and energy in Alaska and was able to take a trip over there with some Alaskans to look at ways to deepen our economic, trade, and energy relationship between my State and China and have them visit Alaska and participate in those meetings. I served in terms of diplomacy as an assistant secretary of state and have had numerous opportunities to travel to China with some of our top U.S. Government leaders--at the time Bob Zoellick, Secretary of the Treasury Paulson, and Secretary of State Rice--to discuss ways in which to deepen economic relationships and work on the U.S.-China relationship. Even many years ago as a U.S. marine aboard an amphibious assault ship in the East and South China Sea during the third Taiwan Strait crisis, I was a very, very, very small player in an episode that once again demonstrated American resolve and commitment in the region. There is a long tradition from Alaska Senators in keeping a focus on the importance of the Asia-Pacific, from both the Alaska and the U.S. perspective. Former Senator Ted Stevens served in World War II as a Flying Tiger, flying the Hump in that part of the world, and his subsequent focus throughout his career was very much on the Asia-Pacific, as was Frank Murkowski's expertise and experience, particularly with regard to our relationship with Taiwan. The focus on the Asia-Pacific and the rise of China is certainly one that in many ways we can view as an opportunity, certainly in my State. Last year, China became the No. 1 export market for Alaskan goods: $1.4 billion of goods exported from Alaska to China--an 18-percent increase. So I believe maintaining this focus--and we have this visit today with the President of China--is critically important not only to my State, not only to our country but also to our allies in the region. We should all try to put more focus and our best thinking on these critical foreign policy and national security issues which, although they are not always on the front page of the papers, I believe are some of the most important long-term strategic challenges and opportunities we face in this country. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] united states-china relations mr. sullivan. mr. president, i rise this afternoon to say a few words about a critical challenge and opportunity facing the united states. for months many of us have been on the floor debating some of the important foreign policy and national security issues that our nation faces--whether it is islamic terrorism, isis, the president's flawed and dangerous iran agreement or a resurgent russia in europe and the arctic. the list of these issues is long, and it is growing. but one issue that has not really gotten much attention--i believe the attention that it deserves--and that i would like to speak about this afternoon is the long-term national security and foreign policy consequences of the rise of china. china's president xi jinping is in town right now. he is visiting america. he is going to meet with president obama on a state visit, and some of us in congress will have an opportunity to meet with him later today. it is an opportunity to start seriously thinking about the challenges and opportunities that a rising china presents to the world and to the united states. perhaps we are not talking about this issue as much as we should on the floor because it doesn't seem to be an immediate issue. it is a bit of a longer term matter. but it is also something that in historical terms is happening so fast. i will give one statistic. in 1980 china's economy was smaller than that of the netherlands. last year, just the incremental growth of china's economy was as large as the netherlands' economy. they have had incredible growth. but some of our country's most deep and strategic thinkers and historians agree that the rise of china is--over the next decade or two--the paramount issue for us to focus on in the united states. as far back as 2005, 10 years ago almost to the day, then-deputy secretary of state bob zellick, who went on to be the president of the world bank and a former u.s. trade representative for the united states, a very strategic thinker, gave what was called the ``responsible stakeholders'' speech, a very well-renowned speech that people are still reading on u.s.-china relations. in that speech 10 years ago, he said: ``how the united states deals with china's rising power is a central question in american foreign policy.'' just a few months ago in testimony before the armed services committee, harvard professor graham allison gave testimony that in many ways is reflected in an article he just published in the atlantic yesterday on the eve of the visit of the president of china. he states in that article and in his testimony from a couple of months ago: the preeminent geostrategic challenge of this era is not violent islamic extremists, or a resurgent russia. it is the impact that china's ascendance will have on the u.s.-led national order. more specifically, professor allison writes that ``the defining question about global order for this generation is whether china and the united states can escape''--what he refers to as ``the thucydides trap.'' he is referencing the renowned ancient greek historian. professor allison coined this term to describe the strategic dilemma and dangers that occur when a rising power rivals a ruling power, as when--an example he gives in ancient greece--athens challenged sparta in ancient greece which ultimately led to the peloponnesian war. professor allison has caught the attention of many, including president xi jinping of china, who in a speech just a few days ago in seattle actually referenced this term--the ``thucydides trap''--when talking about u.s.-china relations. now, both professor allison and president xi, in his speech, make it clear that conflict between the united states and china is certainly not inevitable, regardless of what he says with regard to the thucydides trap, and i certainly would agree with that. professor allison, however, does appear to draw some very sobering conclusions in his recent article that should make all of us take serious pause. he concludes in his article written yesterday: ``war between the u.s. and china is more likely than recognized at the moment.'' these are his words, not mine. this is one of the most distinguished professors of international relations in the united states. i think these words underscore the need for those of us in the senate to give due attention to the importance of the u.s.-china relationship and the attendant risks of graham allison's thucydides trap. fortunately, i believe we are well-positioned as an institution in the senate to do this. in the federalist papers, madison talks about one of the roles of the u.s. senate with its members having 6-year terms to be able to ensure lasting relations between the united states and other nations through the institution of the senate. perhaps more than any other part of the federal government, this institution has the opportunity to think strategically and act for the long-term interests of our country. fortunately, we also have many experts, historians, professors, and practitioners, whether it is people such as bob zoellick or graham allison or henry kissinger or a new generation of scholars, such as mike green at csis, who have been thinking about these issues--the asia-pacific, the rise in china--for decades. their articles, books, and speeches are critical to devising national strategies to advance america's interests in the region. this is a long-term endeavor for all of us. it is imperative that it remains on our radar screens through the [[page s6953]] course of state visits, through the course of elections, through the course of changing administrations. contrary to what some say, we as a country do have the capacity to think and act in our long-term strategic interests as a government. our successful bipartisan strategy dealing with the soviet union, started by kennan's famous ``x'' telegram, which created the strategy of containment over the course of decades, over the course of several administrations and several different congresses--it was a successful long-term strategy for the united states. from my perspective, as we look at this issue--the asia-pacific--its importance--the rise of china--i think a few key touchstones are important to remember. first, america is an asia-pacific power. my state of alaska is an asia-pacific state. the united states has strong networks of alliances throughout the asia-pacific, and our country has built the post-world war ii architecture that has enabled this dynamic region of the world to thrive in terms of peace and in terms of prosperity. in fact, when we look at the last 70 years of history in that region, we have been the linchpin of that peace and prosperity for all countries in the region, whether our strongest allies such as japan and korea and australia or other countries--countries even like china-- and we have earned the trust of our allies for our commitment. so we need to maintain that trust as we move forward and we need to listen to our allies in the region. second, we need to understand the history of the region and our involvement there better as we think through what the strategy is moving forward. i have had the opportunity to go to the national archives a number of times already since i joined the senate, and there is a statue outside the national archives and it has a command on it. it says simply: ``study the past.'' study the past. again, i think that as we are looking at our strategy in that region, it is critical that we need to be doing that. professor allison's article, as well as books, is a good start, and i think all of us need to continue that focus. third, no matter what strategy we end up using vis-a-vis china and the asia-pacific region, we have to be strong again at home. my biggest surprise as a new freshman senator--my biggest surprise in this body is how little we, or certainly for that matter the obama administration, talk about our economy, talk about the strength or the lack thereof of our economy. perhaps because the performance of our economy has been so lackluster, we have even doubled down expectations. they have this term now in washington called ``the new normal.'' american growth rates have typically been at 3, 3.5, 4 percent gdp growth throughout most of our history. over the last 6 years, we can barely break 2 percent gdp growth; 1.5, 2 percent. two quarters ago, we went back into recession. they are now calling this the new normal and we need to accept this. we rarely hear the president or even the treasury secretary come out to the american people and say: no, we have to grow traditional levels of american growth--3.5, 5 percent, 4 percent gdp growth. the presiding officer knows this. he has focused on this issue. we are not doing that. we have to get back to strength at home because a continued weak u.s. economy--the new normal--growing at 1.5 percent for the next 5, 10 years will create all kinds of additional challenges for us and in my view will make the thucydides trap that professor allison talks about more likely for the united states and china. yes, china has certain advantages, but in so many areas--in so many areas--the united states holds all the cards--in so many different areas. if we were in a global poker match and we were all at the table--all the big countries--we would look at our hand and we would see aces. let me just name a few. the high-tech sector, still the envy of the world; not just silicon valley, all over america. our agriculture sector. we feed the world. universities. we have the best universities in the world, by far--by far. certain states in america have better top universities than all of china. finance and commercial aspects of our economy, the best entrepreneurs. energy. we have a renaissance in energy where we are now the largest producer of oil and gas in the world and the largest producer of renewables. this is a huge advantage. it is creating a rebirth of manufacturing in america. fisheries. we harvest some of the most amazing seafood, more than almost any other country in the world. foreign relations. we look at our allies in asia, they are coming to the united states in terms of wanting to deepen their relationship with us. and, of course, the u.s. military, the finest in the world right now. it is right now. i had the opportunity to go down to the world war ii memorial this morning and i saw a couple of honor flights coming in, seeing those veterans of ours who fought and defended this great nation in world war ii. we have had the best military for decades, and we are going to continue to do that. the key is we have to unleash our economic might once again, which has been so dormant during the obama administration. we have to do this. if we do this, we can view the rise of china from a standpoint of strength, confidence, and opportunity, not trepidation. as bob zoellick mentioned 10 years ago in his ``responsible stakeholders'' speech: ``you hear voices that perceive china solely through the lens of fear,

Whereas, on the Twenty-Second Day of September, of the Year Two Thousand and Fifteen, Evelyne Rominger was recognized as a 2015 Woman of the year. Whereas, Evelyne Rominger was raised south of Davis on a dairy farm. She met her husband Richard while they were both students at UC Davis and they have been married for 64 years. Evelyne has been a very active community member her entire life, starting with the Dixon 4-H Club and as the student body vice president of Davis High School and later as a member of the Commission of the Californias. She has also been active in several health associations, including as the founding board member of the Yolo County Mental Health Association. Whereas, Evelyne has been an unabashed, lifelong advocate for gender equality and social justice issues. She clearly and persuasively articulates the critical elements of any topic while leaving no room for ambiguity. Evelyne has spent a lifetime perfecting the art of challenging the status quo and pushing the limits of conventional thinking while promoting change by skillfully applying her elements of unconventional wisdom. Whereas, Evelyne has an enormous capacity to engage, mentor, and advocate for complex and sensitive issues, and to achieve the presumed unachievable, no matter the condition or concern. She also embodies a unique quality that demands intellectual clarity and a thoughtful approach to strategic planning, all while inspiring communities of people to move in a like direction.

BLAKE FARENTHOLD of texas in the house of representatives Friday, September 25, 2015 Mr. FARENTHOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 104th national day of the Republic of China, or ROC, which most of my fellow Americans know as Taiwan. Double Ten Day commemorates the Wuchang Uprising, the event that triggered a revolution that rippled from southern China and led to both the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and the establishment of the ROC on January 1, 1912. With our country's entry into World War II, we joined forces with the ROC and the other Allies to defeat the Axis, and this year, our two countries have observed the 70th anniversary of the end of that war. In the decades that followed, our two countries stood together as we faced common enemies during the Cold War, and this unshakable relationship weathered the challenges posed by the change in our diplomatic relations from Taipei to Beijing. In recent decades, Taiwan has created a democracy that, since 1996, has conducted direct presidential elections every four years and witnessed the peaceful passage of power from one political party to another on two occasions, transforming into an example to other nations in the region and beyond that aspire to democracy. It is a regional and global economic force, and makes global contributions culturally in fields from art to fashion. Through our shared security partnership, Taiwan also contributes to the security of the Asia-Pacific, and is a humanitarian force around the globe. As a member of Congressional Taiwan Caucus, I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in wishing the people of Taiwan a Happy Double Ten Day, and in thanking Taiwan for its many contributions to the global community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 139 (Friday, September 25, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1357] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING DOUBLE TEN DAY ______ HON.

Joann is a native daughter of Guam who has had a long career, spanning a collective 25 years in Guam's tourism industry. She is known throughout the island for spreading Guam's famous hospitality and hafa adai spirit. Joann graduated from the Academy of Our Lady of Guam in 1974 and went on to receive a Bachelor of Science Degree in Finance Management in 1978 from the University of San Francisco. Her first job after college was working as a staff assistant for fiscal affairs in the office of the governor of Guam. She began working with Duty Free Shoppers early on in her career as Divisional Merchandising Manager and helped opened 23 [[Page E1359]] boutiques that appealed to the Asian tourist market on Guam while arrivals were climbing. She took a short break from her career in the tourism industry to support her husband, Felix, as he served as the Governor of Guam for two terms. During this time, she focused on protecting the environment and improving the island community. She launched the Simple Tasks Aimed at Reducing Trash (START) program. Joann made her comeback to the industry as the General Manager of the Guam Visitors Bureau. It was there that she was able to work with and support a team that helped increase visitor arrivals on Guam to the highest numbers seen in 15 years. Joann then returned to DFS Group Ltd. in January 2013 where she serves as the Director of Market Development of the T-Galleria. As the Director of Market Development, she is responsible for identifying local trends in the private and public sectors and recognizing visitors' preference in local products. She plays a very instrumental role at the T-Galleria and has helped the organization develop the Guam Unique Merchandising Art program. This program allows local artisans the opportunity to showcase Guam's local art, history and culture through their work in a luxury retail setting. Joann is passionate about all the work she does and is resourceful and determined to carry out every task she does with success. Her work in both the public and private sectors has helped various organizations to grow, and in turn has allowed the Guam tourism industry to prosper. Additionally, Joann is heavily involved with non-profit agencies throughout the island of Guam. Joann continues a close relationship with the Guam Visitors Bureau and is involved with the Guam Chamber of Commerce, Guam Women's Chamber of Commerce, Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Guam Hotel and Restaurant Association, Make A Wish Foundation, Guam Museum Foundation, Japan Club of Guam and Guam Memorial Hospital Volunteers Association. She is also a board member of the Tourism Education Council, Guam Tourism Foundation, Latte of Freedom Foundation, Guam Red Cross and Guam Unique Merchandise and Art. I extend my congratulations to Joann G. Camacho on being named the 2015 Guam Business Woman of the Year and thank her for her service and dedication to the island of Guam throughout the years. I also extend my congratulations to her husband, Governor Felix P. Camacho, their children, Jessica, Felix Jr. and Maria, and their grandchildren, Scotty, Colin, Raymond and Mason. I wish her the best on this important achievement. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 139 (Friday, September 25, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1358-E1359] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING JOANN G.

Whereas, she has also provided inspirational leadership to 4-H, Catholic Ladies Relief Society, Our Lady of Lourdes and the Colusa Regional Medical Center.

JOHN L. MICA of florida in the house of representatives Friday, September 25, 2015 Mr. MICA. Mr. Speaker, today in Central Florida the life of Victor ``Woody'' Woodman will be celebrated as he is remembered and laid to rest. There are people in our lives who have made an important impact on each of us and Woody Woodman was a special mentor to me and a wonderful friend over the years. Some forty-three years ago he placed his faith and confidence in me to aid him as Executive Director, as he chaired the Orange County Local Government Study Commission. Woody Woodman helped set the stage for reorganization of Orange County Florida Government. Born to Joseph and Ella Woodman in New York City he was raised in Jacksonville, Florida where he graduated from Lee High School. He was a Florida State Champion sprinter and received a scholarship to the University of Alabama. At Alabama he was a student leader and president of his Sigma Chi Fraternity on three separate occasions. After earning his undergraduate Business Degree in 1951, he then received a Juris Doctorate at Alabama. Woody served as a 2nd Lieutenant in the United States Air Force and in the Judge Advocate Division stationed in Scotland. In 1964 Woody moved to Winter Park and joined what was to become the Winderweedle, Haines, Ward and Woodman law firm. He and his late wife, Louise, raised a son and daughter, Doug and Melissa. In the legal community, Victor Woodman distinguished himself in both Orange County and Florida Bar Associations. He helped lead U.S. Senator Paula Hawkins' Federal Judicial Nominating Committee. For the past 26 years he has been a Trustee of the Elizabeth Morse Genius and Charles Hosmer Morse Foundations in Winter Park. Wood was a member of the Country Club of Orlando where he served [[Page E1361]] as a Board Member and President. He was a long time member of Rotary and the First Presbyterian Church of Orlando. Everyone who met or knew Woody Woodman was impressed with his demeanor, wit and wonderful personality. His wise counsel to me helped launch my successful professional, business and political career. Woody will truly be missed by all whose lives he touched. While a devoted Alabama fan, Woody's wife of 37 years, Susan, helped him better appreciate the Florida Gators. Thank you again Victor ``Woody'' Woodman for wonderful memories of a wonderful life. To Susan, Doug, Melissa and family, I extend my deepest sympathy. Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my colleagues to join me as I pay tribute to this special friend, community leader and great American. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 139 (Friday, September 25, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1360-E1361] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO VICTOR ``WOODY'' WOODMAN ______ HON.

The goal is to break down barriers between students and make them more aware of what they say and do and how their words and actions affect the people around them. The daylong trainings take place several times throughout the year and are open to any student who wishes to participate. Topics cover a wide range of disabling conditions, sexual orientation, race, religion, and culture. Whereas, Jennifer's Peer Helping program pairs an older student with each incoming 7th grader who monitors them periodically throughout the year and serves as a mentor. Peer Helper's give Prevention presentations to the 7th graders on alcohol, tobacco, marijuana and stress management. This builds trust and role modeling on how to treat themselves and one another with respect. Whereas, in Jennifer's P.E. classes, she establishes a learning environment at the beginning of each year before any physical education takes place. Her emphasis is on the principles of teamwork as a critical life skill to be utilized well beyond the basketball court. Jennifer's commitment to the nurturing of caring, young people who will in turn grow into a caring community are a reflection of her deep character and hope for a strong bright future.

ALCEE L. HASTINGS of florida in the house of representatives Friday, September 25, 2015 Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind my colleagues of the actions Turkey, a longstanding NATO ally, is taking in the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), which has proven to be one of the greatest security challenges of our lifetime. In 2013, Turkey designated ISIS and all offshoots of al Qaeda as terrorist organizations, including the al Nusra Front. The dangers Turkey faces have most recently been exemplified by the attack on Suruc on July 20, 2015, in which 32 people tragically lost their lives. Just a few days later, ISIS assaulted a border military post in which a Turkish soldier was killed. It is disheartening to see that the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) terrorist organization has taken ISIS attacks against Turkey as an opportunity to restart its terrorist campaign against civilians and officials. Facing these threats, Turkey has become an even more active coalition partner against ISIS. Recently, Turkey opened its military base in Incirlik for manned and unmanned coalition air operations, and has also deployed its own aircraft for air strikes against ISIS targets in Syria. This cooperation has allowed our countries to more effectively combat the threat of ISIS. Mr. Speaker, I condemn the terrorist actions of ISIS and commend our ally for their furthered commitment in the fight against this terrorist organization. As a former President for the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE PA), I have worked closely with my Turkish counterparts, and know that the international effort has been bolstered by the steps Turkey has taken. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing these tremendous efforts by our ally, as we both move forward to combat the threat of ISIS. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 139 (Friday, September 25, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1361] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY IN THEIR FIGHT AGAINST ISIS ______ HON.

ADAM SMITH of washington in the house of representatives Friday, September 25, 2015 Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I want to register my deep concerns with a pair of bills, H.R. 3504 and H.R. 3134, that were considered by the House last week. Although I was unable to be present to vote against these measures due to a medical appointment related to my recovery from two recent hip surgeries, I remain steadfastly opposed to both bills. I am a strong supporter of increasing access to family planning and women's healthcare services. H.R. 3134, passed in the House last week by a vote of 241-187, prohibits the federal government from funding Planned Parenthood health centers for one year. This legislation is nothing more than a punitive and intrusive attack on the essential and wide-ranging healthcare services that Planned Parenthood provides. If this bill was signed into law, it would cut off essential health services for millions of women, men, and families across the United States. Planned Parenthood serves a total of 2.7 million patients per year. It is a central provider of equitable access to healthcare for both men and women of underserved communities across the United States. One in five American women will use Planned Parenthood services at some time during her life. In Washington State, more than 103,000 women and men-- nearly 65 percent of whom are at or below the poverty line--use Planned Parenthood for their family planning and basic health needs. If this legislation succeeds, millions of Americans will be stripped of this access. Anti-choice rhetoric and controversy has surrounded federal funding for Planned Parenthood because about three percent of the services they provide include abortion services. Current law already denies Medicaid coverage for these services by almost completely barring federal funding, except in very limited circumstances. Ninety percent of the services Planned Parenthood provides are preventative health services, including lifesaving cancer screenings, blood pressure checks, birth control, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, and educational efforts to avoid unwanted pregnancies and prevent abortions. Failing to fund Planned Parenthood will greatly diminish access to these services for low income women, men, and families in need of affordable healthcare and preventative screenings. H.R. 3504 was also passed in the House last week. This bill legislation attempts to advance the anti-choice, anti-health agenda by interfering with important and difficult medical judgments that should be left up to health professionals. If enacted into law, this bill would apply scare tactics like onerous criminal penalties on doctors and clinicians. These penalties are punitive and will intimidate women away from seeking safe, legal, standardized, evidence-based care. This legislation is not a restatement of current ``born-alive'' law which contained language assuring no interference in a women's right to terminate a pregnancy. Instead, this bill takes that assurance away from women. This effort signifies the latest attempt by extreme Republicans to limit women's access to safe, legal abortions. I strongly oppose this legislation that politicizes women's health and interferes in the doctor-patient relationship Mr. Speaker, I stand with women across the United States to defend their access to comprehensive reproductive health options, and commend Planned Parenthood for leading in this effort. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 139 (Friday, September 25, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1362] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EXPRESSING OPPOSITION TO H.R. 3504 AND H.R. 3134 ______ HON.

YORK--WWI AMERICAN SOLDIER,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 139 (Friday, September 25, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1362] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SGT. ALVIN C. YORK--WWI AMERICAN SOLDIER ______ HON. TED POE of texas in the house of representatives Friday, September 25, 2015 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Sergeant York is one of the most decorated American heroes of the 20th century. A Congressional Medal of Honor recipient, he is best remembered for his role in a battalion to capture German positions during an attack in 1918 in the Chatel-Chehery region of France on the war's Western Front. A German machine gun fire attack resulted in the loss of numerous Americans, leaving York in charge of the seven remaining soldiers. Leaving his men under cover, Sergeant York ventured out to silence the enemy fire. As he describes in his diary: Those machine guns were spitting fire and cutting down the undergrowth all around me something awful. There were over thirty of them in continuous action, and all I could do was touch the Germans off just as fast as I could. I was sharp shooting . . . All the time I kept yelling at them to come down. I didn't want to kill any more than I had to. But it was they or I. And I was giving them the best I had. York's courageous assault resulted in 20 enemy casualties and 132 captures. The young soldier was immediately promoted and awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Later, he was awarded the Medal of Honor. The citation describes his deeds as ``fearless'', ``daring'' and ``heroic''. But while the description is fair, in many ways York's story is not just one of the battlefield and it is worth reflecting on York the man, not the myth. A person of deep Christian faith, Sergeant York was converted--or as he put it ``saved''--in his late teens by the Reverend M. H. Russell, known in Tennessee as the ``evangelist of the mountains''. While in his youth he admits to being inclined to sin, since joining the Church of Christ in Christian Union, York found more righteous pursuits, teaching children scripture and singing in the choir. ``I am a good deal like Paul,'' York wrote in his diary. ``The things I loved, I now hate.'' When, in 1917, the United States heard the call of its allies and joined the war effort, the young churchgoer and singer received a note requiring him to report to his local board. Despite rising to be a military hero, York was unsure whether the war was just, torn between the pacifism of his faith and patriotism for his country. ``I was bothered a plenty as to whether it was right or wrong,'' he wrote. ``I knew that if it was right, everything would be all right.'' ``And I also knew that if it was wrong and we were only fighting for a bunch of foreigners, it would all be wrong. And I prayed and prayed. I prayed two whole days and a night out on the mountainside. And I received my assurance direct from God . . . that it was all right, and that I was coming back.'' Well Sergeant York did come back and the people of Tennessee should be very pleased. Following the war, York returned to the region of his boyhood in the Wolf River valley of Tennessee and committed himself to public service. A national figure upon his return, he turned down offers for endorsements, public appearances and even the movie rights to his life, instead turning attention to the needs of his local community. He lobbied the Tennessee State Legislature for funds for education and infrastructure and in 1926 established a school in Fentress County, which still stands today. When asked how he wanted to be remembered, Sergeant York responded simply: ``For improving education in Tennessee''. We remember him for much more than that today--for his patriotic service of his nation and God. And that's just the way it is. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 139 (Friday, September 25, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1362] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SGT.

Whereas, on the Twenty-Second Day of September, of the Year Two Thousand and Fifteen, Jane Johnson was recognized as a 2015 Woman of the year. Whereas, Jane Johnson has been working in the nonprofit field in Solana County for 30 years. Originally from San Mateo County, Jane was part of the team that moved Marine World Africa USA from Redwood City to Vallejo, CA in 1985. Her passion for educating children about our world's wildlife continues but has taken a bit of a back seat to providing services to at-risk children in Solano County. Whereas, in 1989, Jane left Marine World to join the Girl Scouts. Under her tenure as CEO of the Girl Scout Council of Napa-Solano, the local organization was recognized nationally for its service to girls in underserved communities. Outreach programs focusing on self-esteem, empowerment, and job skills grew to include services in every low- income housing project in both Napa and Solano counties, juvenile hall sites in both counties, teen parenting programs, and a battered women's shelter. Whereas, Jane currently provides leadership as the Executive Director to Solano County's [[Page E1363]] largest children's mental health service provider, Child Haven. She brings to the organization a solid business background, with a commitment to professionalism and a drive for excellence. Under her leadership, the agency has increased service contracts by 61%, diversified funding streams, and grown in cultural diversity, thus allowing local families greater access to mental health services. Collaboration and shared responsibility for our community is integral in Jane's management style. Jane is proud to have served on the leadership team bringing a Family Justice Center to Solano County, thus creating a single entrance to services for domestic violence victims, young and old.

CREC-2015-09-25-pt1-PgE1363-2,CREC-2015-09-25,114,INTRODUCTION OF THE ROCK CREEK NATIONAL PARK ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 139 (Friday, September 25, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1363] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE ROCK CREEK NATIONAL PARK ACT ______ HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Friday, September 25, 2015 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, September 27, 2015 marks the 125th anniversary of Rock Creek Park, and to celebrate, today, I introduce a bill to redesignate the National Park Service-owned Rock Creek Park, in the District of Columbia, as ``Rock Creek National Park.'' Renaming this park will highlight its significance to the nation, including visitors to the nation's capital, and encourage more daily use and involvement with the park's beautiful trails, waterways and features by residents of the District of Columbia. Rock Creek Park is a historically rich park, established by Congress in 1890 ``for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of the United States,'' and is the oldest urban park and the third federal park ever created, after Yellowstone and Sequoia. Rock Creek Park was designed to preserve animals, timber, forestry, and other interests in the park, and to ensure that its natural state is maintained as much as possible. Over time, several structures have been established or donated to further preserve Rock Creek Park. In 1892, for example, the federal government acquired Peirce Mill in Rock Creek Park, one of the mills used by local farmers during the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. In 1950, the Old Stone House, located at 3051 M Street NW, with its great pre-Revolutionary War architectural merit, was acquired. The building was restored, and programs explain the house's rich history from the colonial period to the present day. The Fort Circle Parks were also acquired to interpret and preserve the Civil War Defenses of Washington, which created a ring of protection for the nation's capital during the Civil War. Today, Rock Creek Park offers District of Columbia, Maryland, and Northern Virginia residents an escape from urban living. Residents and tourists alike also enjoy many activities in the park's 2,000 acres, including hiking and bike riding on the historical trails, horseback riding, picnicking, tennis, and other recreational activities in some of the open fields. Moreover, residents are involved in the cleanup and maintenance of the trails and waterways. The Rock Creek Conservancy works directly with the National Park Service and is dedicated to protecting and promoting the entirety of the Rock Creek watershed through conservation, recreation, and education programs. Redesignating Rock Creek Park as Rock Creek National Park will help the National Park Service, the Rock Creek Conservancy, area residents, and visitors to recognize the national status of the park and protect and revitalize this remarkable resource in our nation's capital. It is fitting that we recognize the historical significance of Rock Creek Park on its 125th birthday by using the occasion to rename it Rock Creek National Park. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this legislation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 139 (Friday, September 25, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1363] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE ROCK CREEK NATIONAL PARK ACT ______ HON.

For the past 15 years, city residents have been delighted to learn that there are no limits to Jan's imagination and determination to design and implement programs tailored especially for them. Whereas, Jan works collaboratively with schools and service and civic clubs to provide athletic programs to children and adults. She coordinates with these same organizations, local businesses, Live Oak's Chamber of Commerce, the Arts Commission, and Police and Fire departments to provide annual events including the National Night Out, Small Town Christmas, and the Live Oak Fall Festival. Whereas, ensuring the recreational needs of Live Oak's youth are met is where Jan really shines.

Jan has created scholarship opportunities for all youth programs, including Pool Passes based on family income, so that no Live Oak child is turned away for the inability to pay.

Calvo's Select Care has its main office in Guam and has branches in the Northern Mariana Islands, Palau and service offices in the Philippines. Calvo's Select Care has experienced steady growth over the years. Significant expansion of Calvo's Select Care was signified with the opening of its office in Koror, Palau in 2006 and its service office in Manila, Philippines in 2007. In 2008 Calvo's Select Care became the sole provider of health insurance benefits for the government of Guam employees and in 2013 was approved to offer health insurance benefits to federal employees and annuitants. The company insures over 38,000 members from government of Guam employees and retirees, federal employees and annuitants, and commercial groups throughout Guam, CNMI and Palau. Calvo's Select Care provides an extensive network of medical providers to its members in Guam, the CNMI, Palau, the mainland United States, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines. The company is also innovative and offers unique plans to meet the variety of needs of its members. Calvo's Select Care introduced the first web based application in Guam for its members to use.

Calvo's Select Care also offers free gym benefits to government of Guam employees and discounted gym memberships for its commercial groups. In addition to gym access, these wellness programs include smoking cessation and diabetes management. Calvo's Select Care introduced the Air Ambulance discount program to its members. The program has been a success and has saved over 10 lives on island since it started. Additionally, the company plans on launching a mobile application to provide better service and make things more consumer friendly.

JEFF MILLER of florida in the house of representatives Friday, September 25, 2015 Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Captain Gregory M. ``Mark'' Beavers, for his nearly three decades of honorable service in the United States Navy Medical Service Corps and to our great Nation on the occasion of his retirement as Director of the Armed Forces Pest Management Board, Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Energy, Installations, and Environment, U.S. Army Garrison Forest Glen, Silver Spring, Maryland, August 1, 2015. Upon receiving his Bachelor of Science in Biology in 1980 from James Madison University and a Master of Science in Entomology from the University of Florida in 1983, Captain Beavers served the State of Florida as a Biological Technician at the Citrus Research and Education Center in Lake Alfred. In 1985, he answered the call to serve our Nation and received his direct commission in the United States Navy. As a naval officer and entomologist, his military duty stations spanned the globe and included the Navy Disease Vector Ecology and Control Center, Alameda, California, and Navy Environmental and Preventive Medicine Unit Number Five, San Diego, California. In 1990, he was transferred to U.S. Naval Hospital in Subic Bay, Philippines, where he served in a vital role as Head of the Preventive Medicine Department and the Entomology Division. Following his tour of duty in the Philippines, which saw the volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo, he was selected for the Navy's Duty Under Instruction program, and in 1996, received his Doctor of Philosophy in Entomology at the University of Kentucky. From there, Captain Beavers reported to Naval Medical Research Unit Number Three in Cairo, Egypt, where he served for nearly four years as a research entomologist and then assumed the position of Officer in Charge, Navy Disease Vector Ecology and Control Center in Jacksonville, Florida. In 2002, Captain Beavers was assigned to Pensacola, Florida, where he would establish his roots as a resident of the greater Gulf Coast, and served as the Executive Officer of Naval Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory and as the Navy Surgeon General's Specialty Leader for Navy Entomology. In 2005, he reported to Maryland's Naval Medical Research Center where he was tasked as the Navy Medical Research and Development Liaison to the U.S. Army Medical Materiel Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick, Maryland. Due to his extensive experience and proven leadership, he was appointed by the Commanding General of U.S. Army Medical Materiel Research and Materiel Command as Director of the Department of Defense's Military Infectious Diseases Research Program. In 2009, Captain Beavers reported to the Armed Forces Pest Management Board as Chief of the Information Services Division, and in 2012, he was appointed the 16th Director of the Armed Forces Pest Management Board. According to those who were fortunate to have served with him throughout his prestigious and impressive military career and as evidenced by his numerous awards and accolades, including the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal (4 awards), the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal (2 awards), and the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal (4 awards), in addition to other individual and unit service awards, Captain Beavers served with honor and distinction, and as a grateful Nation, we owe him our gratitude. On behalf of the United States Congress, I sincerely thank Captain Beavers, the proud son of William Julian and Betty Jean Beavers and brother to Stephen Michael and Paul David Beavers, for his admirable military service. My wife Vicki joins me in wishing him continued success as he turns to the next chapter in his life. We also want to recognize and thank his wife Carol and sons, James and Michael for their many sacrifices and support as a dedicated and loving Navy Family. May God continue to bless the entire Beavers family and all of our men and women in uniform who have bravely answered the call to defend our great Nation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 139 (Friday, September 25, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1365] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE DEDICATION AND HONORABLE SERVICE OF CAPTAIN GREGORY M. ``MARK'' BEAVERS, UNITED STATES NAVY ______ HON.

GERALD E. CONNOLLY of virginia in the house of representatives Friday, September 25, 2015 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Dunn Loring Woods Civic Association on the occasion of its 50th Anniversary. Located in the heart of Fairfax County and the 11th Congressional District of Virginia, the Dunn Loring Woods neighborhood consists of approximately 550 homes situated on about 300 acres. By the summer of 1964, construction of the homes was complete. The next spring, residents formed the Dunn Loring Woods Civic Association (DLWCA) to enable the community to speak with one voice on local issues and seek improvements in the neighborhood. DLWCA also operates an active Neighborhood Watch program which helps to ensure the area remains safe and that neighbors stay connected. Neighbors can communicate with each other through DLWCA's website, blog, and social media platforms. Dunn Loring Woods is known as an exceptionally warm, friendly, and welcoming neighborhood. Many of the original owners still reside there, and those who have moved often return to attend community events such as block parties. Residents tell stories of young residents helping their elderly neighbors, and civic association meetings that more closely resemble friends stopping in to chat. Each year, the DLWCA presents the Edward P. Day Citizenship Award to an individual in recognition of his or her service to Dunn Loring Woods and the surrounding community. I am pleased to congratulate Joe Murphy for receiving this honor for 2015. Joe is an [[Page E1366]] original owner and for 38 years spearheaded the Syracuse Circle block party. While several blocks or cul-de-sacs have their own long standing traditions, nothing compared to the parties that Joe threw. Joe's enthusiasm, energy, and creativity epitomize the personality of Dunn Loring Woods. Always looking to the future, 5 years ago the DLWCA established a scholarship program. This program provides a $500 scholarship to a local high school senior who has demonstrated good citizenship and commitment to the community. I congratulate Emily Reinhart, a senior at Marshall High School, for being the winner of the 2015 scholarship. Emily is a scholar-athlete, has earned the Girl Scout Silver Award, is a member of the National Art Honor Society, and is active in Stop Hunger Now, which packages meals to be sent to more than 63 countries. As the former president of my own civic association, I know firsthand that when residents invest their time, care, and energies in their communities, it benefits all. Fairfax County is considered one of the best places in the nation in which to work, live, and raise a family, largely because of the willingness of so many to become actively involved. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating the Dunn Loring Woods Civic Association on its 50th anniversary and in thanking all of the residents for their tireless efforts and dedication to the community and region.","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 139 (Friday, September 25, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1365-E1366] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DUNN LORING WOODS CIVIC ASSOCIATION ______ HON.

GERALD E. CONNOLLY of virginia in the house of representatives Friday, September 25, 2015 Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Dunn Loring Woods Civic Association on the occasion of its 50th Anniversary. Located in the heart of Fairfax County and the 11th Congressional District of Virginia, the Dunn Loring Woods neighborhood consists of approximately 550 homes situated on about 300 acres. By the summer of 1964, construction of the homes was complete. The next spring, residents formed the Dunn Loring Woods Civic Association (DLWCA) to enable the community to speak with one voice on local issues and seek improvements in the neighborhood. DLWCA also operates an active Neighborhood Watch program which helps to ensure the area remains safe and that neighbors stay connected. Neighbors can communicate with each other through DLWCA's website, blog, and social media platforms. Dunn Loring Woods is known as an exceptionally warm, friendly, and welcoming neighborhood. Many of the original owners still reside there, and those who have moved often return to attend community events such as block parties. Residents tell stories of young residents helping their elderly neighbors, and civic association meetings that more closely resemble friends stopping in to chat. Each year, the DLWCA presents the Edward P. Day Citizenship Award to an individual in recognition of his or her service to Dunn Loring Woods and the surrounding community. I am pleased to congratulate Joe Murphy for receiving this honor for 2015. Joe is an [[Page E1366]] original owner and for 38 years spearheaded the Syracuse Circle block party. While several blocks or cul-de-sacs have their own long standing traditions, nothing compared to the parties that Joe threw. Joe's enthusiasm, energy, and creativity epitomize the personality of Dunn Loring Woods. Always looking to the future, 5 years ago the DLWCA established a scholarship program. This program provides a $500 scholarship to a local high school senior who has demonstrated good citizenship and commitment to the community. I congratulate Emily Reinhart, a senior at Marshall High School, for being the winner of the 2015 scholarship. Emily is a scholar-athlete, has earned the Girl Scout Silver Award, is a member of the National Art Honor Society, and is active in Stop Hunger Now, which packages meals to be sent to more than 63 countries. As the former president of my own civic association, I know firsthand that when residents invest their time, care, and energies in their communities, it benefits all. Fairfax County is considered one of the best places in the nation in which to work, live, and raise a family, largely because of the willingness of so many to become actively involved. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating the Dunn Loring Woods Civic Association on its 50th anniversary and in thanking all of the residents for their tireless efforts and dedication to the community and region.",package_114_57.csv,3282,3282,3354,"[congressional record volume 161, number 139 (friday, september 25, 2015)] [extensions of remarks] [pages e1365-e1366] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] recognizing the 50th anniversary of the dunn loring woods civic association ______ hon. gerald e. connolly of virginia in the house of representatives friday, september 25, 2015 mr. connolly. mr. speaker, i rise to congratulate dunn loring woods civic association on the occasion of its 50th anniversary. located in the heart of fairfax county and the 11th congressional district of virginia, the dunn loring woods neighborhood consists of approximately 550 homes situated on about 300 acres. by the summer of 1964, construction of the homes was complete. the next spring, residents formed the dunn loring woods civic association (dlwca) to enable the community to speak with one voice on local issues and seek improvements in the neighborhood. dlwca also operates an active neighborhood watch program which helps to ensure the area remains safe and that neighbors stay connected. neighbors can communicate with each other through dlwca's website, blog, and social media platforms. dunn loring woods is known as an exceptionally warm, friendly, and welcoming neighborhood. many of the original owners still reside there, and those who have moved often return to attend community events such as block parties. residents tell stories of young residents helping their elderly neighbors, and civic association meetings that more closely resemble friends stopping in to chat. each year, the dlwca presents the edward p. day citizenship award to an individual in recognition of his or her service to dunn loring woods and the surrounding community. i am pleased to congratulate joe murphy for receiving this honor for 2015. joe is an [[page e1366]] original owner and for 38 years spearheaded the syracuse circle block party. while several blocks or cul-de-sacs have their own long standing traditions, nothing compared to the parties that joe threw. joe's enthusiasm, energy, and creativity epitomize the personality of dunn loring woods. always looking to the future, 5 years ago the dlwca established a scholarship program. this program provides a $500 scholarship to a local high school senior who has demonstrated good citizenship and commitment to the community. i congratulate emily reinhart, a senior at marshall high school, for being the winner of the 2015 scholarship. emily is a scholar-athlete, has earned the girl scout silver award, is a member of the national art honor society, and is active in stop hunger now, which packages meals to be sent to more than 63 countries. as the former president of my own civic association, i know firsthand that when residents invest their time, care, and energies in their communities, it benefits all. fairfax county is considered one of the best places in the nation in which to work, live, and raise a family, largely because of the willingness of so many to become actively involved. mr. speaker, i ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating the dunn loring woods civic association on its 50th anniversary and in thanking all of the residents for their tireless efforts and dedication to the community and region.",3282
