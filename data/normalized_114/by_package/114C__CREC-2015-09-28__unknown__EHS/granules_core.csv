CREC-2015-09-28-pt1-PgH6263-4,CREC-2015-09-28,114,"HONDURAS MUST PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS, VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6263-H6264] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONDURAS MUST PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS, VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for 5 minutes. Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, last week I joined a fact-finding delegation to Honduras led by WOLA, the Washington Office on Latin America. We looked at the problem of violence and the lack of opportunity in order to understand why families and young people continue to flee the country. We wanted to learn what the Honduran Government and people were doing in response to the problems that confront their country and how the United States might help. We met with families, young people, and community leaders in several marginal and violent communities, including those who benefit from programs at Casa Alianza. The delegation also visited an innovative USAID-sponsored violence prevention program. It not only offers programs for young people in a poor and dangerous neighborhood, but brings together community leaders and local institutions to tackle local problems. By strengthening local leaders and groups and working with trained and vetted local police, crime levels have dropped and new opportunities for youth have been created. These are hopeful results for a community that 1 year ago was under siege by violent criminal actors. We also met with many NGOs, human rights defenders, and international organizations to understand the intertwined problems of human rights, Democratic governance, and corruption. We had substantial conversations with Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez and met with our Ambassador, James Nealon, and his team, and I am grateful for how generous they were with their time. I would like to share with my colleagues a few thoughts and conclusions from this trip. First, I have no doubt that violence or lack of opportunity are driving families and young people to flee Honduras. I saw the marginal communities and heard the stories from families about the problems young people face. The best thing we can do is support efforts that break the cycle of violence and help build opportunities for youth in Honduras and elsewhere in Central America. At Casa Alianza and the USAID project, we saw the kind of programs that actually make a difference. That is where we should be directing our assistance. Additionally, I also heard how long-term drought is exacerbating hunger, malnutrition, and the loss of livelihoods in rural central Honduras and igniting a new wave of migration. Second, I heard from returned migrants and the families of migrants, including those whose loved ones have disappeared and never been heard from again. Migrants face abuse as they travel. They are extorted by authorities in Mexico and sometimes Guatemala and robbed or kidnapped and held for ransom by criminal groups. Young women run the risk of being trafficked and forced into prostitution. We heard from returned migrants, especially those who had been stopped in Mexico, about the return journey and the lack of services at the El Corinto border crossing. We met migrants who had fled gang violence only to be forced to return to the same dangers. I was moved by many of these stories. Migrants, even those traveling without legal documents, have basic rights, and we should be working with the Governments of Mexico and Honduras to ensure that they get decent treatment, access to needed services, and the protection they deserve. Third, human rights abuses continue to be a serious problem in Honduras. Longtime human rights defenders, journalists, and gay, lesbian, and transgender activists described ongoing threats, attacks, and even assassinations, and the response by the police and the attorney general has not improved. In fact, a U.S.-supported special investigative unit that was supposed to focus on attacks on the LGBT community, journalists, and others has investigated even fewer cases this year than last. I am troubled by the government's focus on special military police units, whose human rights record isn't good. I support the U.S. decision not to provide aid to the military police. Instead, the Honduran Government needs to [[Page H6264]] clean up and strengthen civilian police and the Attorney General's Office. My trip to Honduras was both challenging and inspiring. I saw troubling problems of poverty and violence, heard painful stories about migrant abuses and disappearances, and saw major problems in the area of human rights and the protection of human rights defenders and activists. But I also saw hope. I met with young people who dream of bright futures for themselves in Honduras, with student and youth leaders who are campaigning selflessly and courageously to build mechanisms to tackle corruption, and with LGBT activists, human rights defenders, and journalists who are standing up to threats. I saw community-led projects to combat violence and poverty that are making a real difference. Mr. Speaker, last week our Nation was graced by the presence of Pope Francis. I was deeply moved by his call for us to welcome the stranger, to help the most vulnerable among us, and to work together for the common good. I believe each of those calls to action apply to the case of Honduras, both in how we respond to Hondurans fleeing to the United States to find safe haven and a new life and how we help Hondurans respond to their own problems inside their country. I look forward, Mr. Speaker, to working with my colleagues to help the Honduran people deal successfully with these challenges. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6263-H6264] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONDURAS MUST PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS, VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Takai) for 5 minutes. Mr. TAKAI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, located in Waikiki, Hawaii. I want to extend my congratulations to the Center on reaching this important milestone. For the last 20 years, the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies has made significant strides in educating, connecting, and empowering security practitioners. I would like to thank the Center for their leadership. I am pleased to see the APCSS renamed as the Daniel K. Inouye Center, honoring the legacy of the late Senator who advocated strongly for peace and stability around the world. As the United States shifts its focus to the Asia-Pacific region, the Daniel K. Inouye Center will be uniquely situated to play a critical role in driving our Nation's security policy. The U.S. rebalance to Asia will rely heavily on Hawaii's location and relationship with our partner nations in the region. I can think of no better venue than the Inouye Center for bringing together representatives from different countries to discuss joint cooperation on important issues. As I have witnessed firsthand, the Center is focused on producing results. This will be crucial as we continue to move forward with the rebalance and begin to tackle some of the most pressing security- related issues. Once again, I want to extend my congratulations on 20 years of service and my warmest thanks--mahalo--for the tremendous work being done there. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [House] [Page H6264] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DKI APCSS 20TH ANNIVERSARY VIDEO MESSAGE The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Cardenas) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. General Leave Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the Record on H.R. 1624. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The bipartisan bill before us today is a much-needed fix for small- business owners and employees struggling to comply with the healthcare law. H.R. 1624 is a bill to amend the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Public Health Service Act to revise the definition of small employer. The bill would allow the States to continue defining the small group health insurance market as employers with 1 to 50 employees. Section 1304 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act changed the Federal definition of the small group market to include employers with 1 to 100 employees. The States, however, have been allowed to continue defining the small group market as employers with 1 to 50 employees until January 1, 2016. But beginning on or after January 1, 2016, plans sold or renewed for employers with 51 to 100 employees will be subject to the various small group health plan regulations established by PPACA. These more restrictive rating rules will increase health insurance premiums for these employers and reduce flexibility in benefit design. The new requirements could also lead some employers with 51 to 100 employees to self-insure to avoid higher premiums. If that happens, this could result in adverse selection in the small group pool and higher premiums for employers with 1 to 50 employees. Unless this current law is reversed, the disruption in the marketplace will be significant. For example, it is estimated that, under current law, more than 3 million employees will experience a double-digit percent increase in their healthcare premiums. Ultimately, cost increases for small employers will change their choices regarding offering coverage, could change their business model, and will ultimately be felt by millions of workers. Because the impact of current law will vary by State, defining the small group market should be left to the States, which is a policy envisioned in H.R. 1624. I am pleased to say there is considerable support for this legislation in the House and the Senate. The flexibility that would be given to States with immediate passage of H.R. 1624 would help ensure stable, small group health insurance markets that reflect the unique characteristics in each of the States. If Congress passes H.R. 1624, premiums will be lower and allow millions of employees and employers to keep the plan they have and like. This is a [[Page H6266]] commonsense policy that deserves our bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 1624. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, at this point, I reserve the balance of my time so that Congressman Guthrie can speak first. Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), the vice chair of the Health Subcommittee on Energy and Commerce. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here. I rise in support of H.R. 1624, the Protecting Affordable Coverage for Employees Act. This bill, which I introduced along with my friend from California (Mr. Cardenas), Congressman Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona will protect smaller employers from increased healthcare costs and will prevent their employees from being forced out of their current healthcare plans. The small group market is currently defined as 1 to 50 employees, but a provision in the healthcare law will expand the group's size from 1 to 100 on January 1. With this expansion comes more onerous regulations and the expectation of dramatic rate hikes. One estimate by Oliver Wyman predicts that those in the 51 to 100 group will see an average of an 18 percent premium increase in 2016 based on the new rating rules alone. H.R. 1624 stops the mandated expansion of the small group market that will occur on January 1 and allows States to define their own market. Mr. Speaker, I have heard from many Kentuckians who would be impacted by this change, and their concerns are real. Small businesses are afraid to expand, and mid-sized businesses have no idea what the costs would be or how they can plan for this new change. This issue has widespread support, with over half the House as cosponsors and nearly a third of the Senate as cosponsors. Members on both sides of the aisle agree that we must act now to stop this new mandate. It has been a great pleasure working with the gentleman from California (Mr. Cardenas). It is an issue that we see is happening in Washington, that is happening out in our districts, out across to the businesses. Both sides of the aisle have come together to say: Let's change the law. Let's make sure that the small businesses and medium-sized businesses are not affected, and let's move forward. It wasn't just that we signed our names as cosponsors. There was a lot of hard work that I know the gentleman from California (Mr. Cardenas) did to bring more and more cosponsors to this bill. This is a significant change. It is significant for the people who live in our districts. I encourage support. I appreciate Mr. Cardenas, Ms. Sinema, and Mr. Mullin. Mr. CARDENAS. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would like to first thank my colleague from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie). It has been a pleasure and honor to serve with him on this bill. It is really important for us to understand how monumental this moment is. This isn't the biggest bill in the world. But, yet, at the same time, if you are a small business in the United States of America and you have 1 to 50 employees or now even 1 to 100 employees, this bill hopefully will help affect your business and your employees in a way that is better. I rise in support of H.R. 1624. I truly appreciate the willingness to work on a bipartisan bill, as demonstrated today, which is going to positively impact so many communities across the country through the small businesses it will affect. H.R. 1624, the Protecting Affordable Coverage for Employees Act, introduced by my colleagues, once again, Mr. Guthrie, Mr. Mullin, Ms. Sinema, and myself--two Republicans and two Democrats is a true bipartisan effort--would stop a potential health insurance rate shock by allowing States to determine the appropriate size of their small group market. As a former small-business owner myself, I recognize the struggle there is to live out the American Dream. I know how difficult it can be when a specific sector of small business is affected by regulations and laws created by local, State, or Federal governments. I have seen the impact in neighborhoods throughout my district when a small local business opens their doors or closes their doors. Their supply chain is local. Their employees have a vested interest in their success. Their customers treasure the connection a small hometown business brings. I know I echo the view of the entire U.S. House of Representatives when I applaud these small businesses, the risks that they have taken, and the celebration of their successes. The Affordable Care Act isn't perfect. By no means is the Affordable Care Act perfect. But I am grateful for all the benefits that the law has provided since its enactment. Today more than 16 million Americans have gained access to affordable health insurance that did not have it before enacting the act. My district is one of only two districts in the United States to see a double-digit increase in insured residents since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act is the biggest change to American health care in the past 70 years. It brings down costs, covering more Americans and making dozens of other crucial changes to how our Nation views health care. However, no law is perfect. When it was first created, Social Security didn't cover agricultural and domestic workers. Medicaid didn't begin to cover mammograms until 1991. Even with these fundamental programs of our Nation's safety net, improvement and compromise was necessary to lead to more perfect laws. While certain States, like California, have decided to move forward with the expansion, this bill still provides States the flexibility to ensure market stability for small businesses across the country. I appreciate the bipartisan effort to bring this bill to the floor. I look forward to advancing the PACE Act and continuing to build on a record of working together in a bipartisan fashion. I was just sharing a moment with my colleague from Kentucky, Congressman Guthrie, in talking about how proud I am of this moment and how much I appreciate his willingness to reach across the aisle and work with us to make sure that we bring a fix--not the biggest fix, but a fix--that will help American businesses and American workers across this country. It is an opportunity for us to work together. But, more importantly, it is an opportunity for us to do the job that we were elected to do: to put aside partisan bickering, to make sure that we look at what is best for America, try our best to bring a bill to the floor through both houses, and, hopefully, get the signature of the President of the United States. Again, it was due to this bipartisan effort that I think that what I just described is going to happen. Come January of 2016, it is going to be a better place for all of us--for our businesses and our workers-- because we were willing to work together. Once again, it is not the easiest thing to do, but it is something that, unfortunately, is far too rare. I hope that this is the beginning, the beginning of many of us working together and making good things happen for America and its Territories. I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 1624. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. It is an important bill. It is a bipartisan bill. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 1624. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, 17.6 million Americans have gained health insurance coverage and are no longer one accident, injury, or diagnosis away from financial ruin. This is the largest reduction in the uninsured in four decades. The ACA has increased access and reduced financial barriers to important preventive services, such as cancer screenings and well-woman visits by requiring their coverage with no cost sharing. The law also stopped insurers from discriminating based on preexisting conditions or placing annual limits on how much health care they will cover. Though the ACA is already helping millions nationwide, no law is perfect, and there are certainly ways we can improve the ACA and build upon its successes. Given the political theatre that tends to surround the ACA, I am pleased to see that my Republican colleagues [[Page H6267]] are ready to work together on bipartisan proposals such as H.R. 1624 with the goal of strengthening the law. Unfortunately, though, I do not agree with the approach this bill takes. H.R. 1624 would permanently change the law to make the small group expansion currently required under the ACA optional for states and allow states to ``opt in'' if they choose. Research tells us that some states simply are not ready to expand their small group market and that expansion in these states could result in higher costs for certain consumers. However, the small group expansion was included in the ACA for good reason. The benefits of expansion such as added consumer protections and increased stability for small employers are important and achievable goals. States like Washington are already experiencing the benefits of an expanded small group market. I am concerned that H.R. 1624 is premature, and I would instead prefer a few year transitional delay of the small group expansion or an ``opt out'' option for states instead. I believe these alternatives would ensure that states continue to work towards the goal of expansion, rather than disregarding the provision altogether. Mr. Speaker, I am also disappointed that this bill was not considered under regular order. Such an important issue deserves thoughtful discussion and opportunities for amendments. I had hoped to offer an amendment that would allow states to ``opt out'' of the expansion. Since I was unable to discuss this amendment and other potential changes to the bill with my colleagues in a committee markup, I remain uncertain that this legislation is the best course of action. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1624, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6265-H6267] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PROTECTING AFFORDABLE COVERAGE FOR EMPLOYEES ACT Mr. PITTS.

(a) PPACA Amendments.--Section 1304(b) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18024(b)) is amended-- (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``101'' and inserting ``51''; (2) in paragraph (2), by striking ``100'' and inserting ``50''; and (3) by amending paragraph (3) to read as follows: ``(3) State option to extend definition of small employer.--Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), nothing in this section shall prevent a State from applying this subsection by treating as a small employer, with respect to a calendar year and a plan year, an employer who employed an average of at least 1 but not more than 100 employees on business days during the preceding calendar year and who employs at least 1 employee on the first day of the plan year.''.

(c) Deposit of Savings Into Medicare Improvement Fund.-- Section 1898(b)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395iii(b)(1)) is amended by striking ``$0'' and inserting ``$205,000,000''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Cardenas) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. General Leave Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials in the Record on H.R. 1624. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The bipartisan bill before us today is a much-needed fix for small- business owners and employees struggling to comply with the healthcare law. H.R. 1624 is a bill to amend the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Public Health Service Act to revise the definition of small employer. The bill would allow the States to continue defining the small group health insurance market as employers with 1 to 50 employees. Section 1304 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act changed the Federal definition of the small group market to include employers with 1 to 100 employees. The States, however, have been allowed to continue defining the small group market as employers with 1 to 50 employees until January 1, 2016. But beginning on or after January 1, 2016, plans sold or renewed for employers with 51 to 100 employees will be subject to the various small group health plan regulations established by PPACA. These more restrictive rating rules will increase health insurance premiums for these employers and reduce flexibility in benefit design. The new requirements could also lead some employers with 51 to 100 employees to self-insure to avoid higher premiums. If that happens, this could result in adverse selection in the small group pool and higher premiums for employers with 1 to 50 employees. Unless this current law is reversed, the disruption in the marketplace will be significant. For example, it is estimated that, under current law, more than 3 million employees will experience a double-digit percent increase in their healthcare premiums. Ultimately, cost increases for small employers will change their choices regarding offering coverage, could change their business model, and will ultimately be felt by millions of workers. Because the impact of current law will vary by State, defining the small group market should be left to the States, which is a policy envisioned in H.R. 1624. I am pleased to say there is considerable support for this legislation in the House and the Senate. The flexibility that would be given to States with immediate passage of H.R. 1624 would help ensure stable, small group health insurance markets that reflect the unique characteristics in each of the States. If Congress passes H.R. 1624, premiums will be lower and allow millions of employees and employers to keep the plan they have and like. This is a [[Page H6266]] commonsense policy that deserves our bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 1624. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. CARDENAS. Mr. Speaker, at this point, I reserve the balance of my time so that Congressman Guthrie can speak first. Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), the vice chair of the Health Subcommittee on Energy and Commerce. Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here. I rise in support of H.R. 1624, the Protecting Affordable Coverage for Employees Act. This bill, which I introduced along with my friend from California (Mr. Cardenas), Congressman Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona will protect smaller employers from increased healthcare costs and will prevent their employees from being forced out of their current healthcare plans. The small group market is currently defined as 1 to 50 employees, but a provision in the healthcare law will expand the group's size from 1 to 100 on January 1. With this expansion comes more onerous regulations and the expectation of dramatic rate hikes. One estimate by Oliver Wyman predicts that those in the 51 to 100 group will see an average of an 18 percent premium increase in 2016 based on the new rating rules alone. H.R. 1624 stops the mandated expansion of the small group market that will occur on January 1 and allows States to define their own market. Mr. Speaker, I have heard from many Kentuckians who would be impacted by this change, and their concerns are real. Small businesses are afraid to expand, and mid-sized businesses have no idea what the costs would be or how they can plan for this new change. This issue has widespread support, with over half the House as cosponsors and nearly a third of the Senate as cosponsors. Members on both sides of the aisle agree that we must act now to stop this new mandate. It has been a great pleasure working with the gentleman from California (Mr. Cardenas). It is an issue that we see is happening in Washington, that is happening out in our districts, out across to the businesses. Both sides of the aisle have come together to say: Let's change the law. Let's make sure that the small businesses and medium-sized businesses are not affected, and let's move forward. It wasn't just that we signed our names as cosponsors. There was a lot of hard work that I know the gentleman from California (Mr. Cardenas) did to bring more and more cosponsors to this bill. This is a significant change. It is significant for the people who live in our districts. I encourage support. I appreciate Mr. Cardenas, Ms. Sinema, and Mr. Mullin. Mr. CARDENAS. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would like to first thank my colleague from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie). It has been a pleasure and honor to serve with him on this bill. It is really important for us to understand how monumental this moment is. This isn't the biggest bill in the world. But, yet, at the same time, if you are a small business in the United States of America and you have 1 to 50 employees or now even 1 to 100 employees, this bill hopefully will help affect your business and your employees in a way that is better. I rise in support of H.R. 1624. I truly appreciate the willingness to work on a bipartisan bill, as demonstrated today, which is going to positively impact so many communities across the country through the small businesses it will affect. H.R. 1624, the Protecting Affordable Coverage for Employees Act, introduced by my colleagues, once again, Mr. Guthrie, Mr. Mullin, Ms. Sinema, and myself--two Republicans and two Democrats is a true bipartisan effort--would stop a potential health insurance rate shock by allowing States to determine the appropriate size of their small group market. As a former small-business owner myself, I recognize the struggle there is to live out the American Dream. I know how difficult it can be when a specific sector of small business is affected by regulations and laws created by local, State, or Federal governments. I have seen the impact in neighborhoods throughout my district when a small local business opens their doors or closes their doors. Their supply chain is local. Their employees have a vested interest in their success. Their customers treasure the connection a small hometown business brings. I know I echo the view of the entire U.S. House of Representatives when I applaud these small businesses, the risks that they have taken, and the celebration of their successes. The Affordable Care Act isn't perfect. By no means is the Affordable Care Act perfect. But I am grateful for all the benefits that the law has provided since its enactment. Today more than 16 million Americans have gained access to affordable health insurance that did not have it before enacting the act. My district is one of only two districts in the United States to see a double-digit increase in insured residents since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act is the biggest change to American health care in the past 70 years. It brings down costs, covering more Americans and making dozens of other crucial changes to how our Nation views health care. However, no law is perfect. When it was first created, Social Security didn't cover agricultural and domestic workers. Medicaid didn't begin to cover mammograms until 1991. Even with these fundamental programs of our Nation's safety net, improvement and compromise was necessary to lead to more perfect laws. While certain States, like California, have decided to move forward with the expansion, this bill still provides States the flexibility to ensure market stability for small businesses across the country. I appreciate the bipartisan effort to bring this bill to the floor. I look forward to advancing the PACE Act and continuing to build on a record of working together in a bipartisan fashion. I was just sharing a moment with my colleague from Kentucky, Congressman Guthrie, in talking about how proud I am of this moment and how much I appreciate his willingness to reach across the aisle and work with us to make sure that we bring a fix--not the biggest fix, but a fix--that will help American businesses and American workers across this country. It is an opportunity for us to work together. But, more importantly, it is an opportunity for us to do the job that we were elected to do: to put aside partisan bickering, to make sure that we look at what is best for America, try our best to bring a bill to the floor through both houses, and, hopefully, get the signature of the President of the United States. Again, it was due to this bipartisan effort that I think that what I just described is going to happen. Come January of 2016, it is going to be a better place for all of us--for our businesses and our workers-- because we were willing to work together. Once again, it is not the easiest thing to do, but it is something that, unfortunately, is far too rare. I hope that this is the beginning, the beginning of many of us working together and making good things happen for America and its Territories. I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 1624. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. It is an important bill. It is a bipartisan bill. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 1624. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, 17.6 million Americans have gained health insurance coverage and are no longer one accident, injury, or diagnosis away from financial ruin. This is the largest reduction in the uninsured in four decades. The ACA has increased access and reduced financial barriers to important preventive services, such as cancer screenings and well-woman visits by requiring their coverage with no cost sharing. The law also stopped insurers from discriminating based on preexisting conditions or placing annual limits on how much health care they will cover. Though the ACA is already helping millions nationwide, no law is perfect, and there are certainly ways we can improve the ACA and build upon its successes. Given the political theatre that tends to surround the ACA, I am pleased to see that my Republican colleagues [[Page H6267]] are ready to work together on bipartisan proposals such as H.R. 1624 with the goal of strengthening the law. Unfortunately, though, I do not agree with the approach this bill takes. H.R. 1624 would permanently change the law to make the small group expansion currently required under the ACA optional for states and allow states to ``opt in'' if they choose. Research tells us that some states simply are not ready to expand their small group market and that expansion in these states could result in higher costs for certain consumers. However, the small group expansion was included in the ACA for good reason. The benefits of expansion such as added consumer protections and increased stability for small employers are important and achievable goals. States like Washington are already experiencing the benefits of an expanded small group market. I am concerned that H.R. 1624 is premature, and I would instead prefer a few year transitional delay of the small group expansion or an ``opt out'' option for states instead. I believe these alternatives would ensure that states continue to work towards the goal of expansion, rather than disregarding the provision altogether. Mr. Speaker, I am also disappointed that this bill was not considered under regular order. Such an important issue deserves thoughtful discussion and opportunities for amendments. I had hoped to offer an amendment that would allow states to ``opt out'' of the expansion. Since I was unable to discuss this amendment and other potential changes to the bill with my colleagues in a committee markup, I remain uncertain that this legislation is the best course of action. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1624, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6265-H6267] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PROTECTING AFFORDABLE COVERAGE FOR EMPLOYEES ACT Mr. PITTS.

materials in the record on h.r. 1624. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from pennsylvania? there was no objection. mr. pitts. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. the bipartisan bill before us today is a much-needed fix for small- business owners and employees struggling to comply with the healthcare law. h.r. 1624 is a bill to amend the patient protection and affordable care act and the public health service act to revise the definition of small employer. the bill would allow the states to continue defining the small group health insurance market as employers with 1 to 50 employees. section 1304 of the patient protection and affordable care act changed the federal definition of the small group market to include employers with 1 to 100 employees. the states, however, have been allowed to continue defining the small group market as employers with 1 to 50 employees until january 1, 2016. but beginning on or after january 1, 2016, plans sold or renewed for employers with 51 to 100 employees will be subject to the various small group health plan regulations established by ppaca. these more restrictive rating rules will increase health insurance premiums for these employers and reduce flexibility in benefit design. the new requirements could also lead some employers with 51 to 100 employees to self-insure to avoid higher premiums. if that happens, this could result in adverse selection in the small group pool and higher premiums for employers with 1 to 50 employees. unless this current law is reversed, the disruption in the marketplace will be significant. for example, it is estimated that, under current law, more than 3 million employees will experience a double-digit percent increase in their healthcare premiums. ultimately, cost increases for small employers will change their choices regarding offering coverage, could change their business model, and will ultimately be felt by millions of workers. because the impact of current law will vary by state, defining the small group market should be left to the states, which is a policy envisioned in h.r. 1624. i am pleased to say there is considerable support for this legislation in the house and the senate. the flexibility that would be given to states with immediate passage of h.r. 1624 would help ensure stable, small group health insurance markets that reflect the unique characteristics in each of the states. if congress passes h.r. 1624, premiums will be lower and allow millions of employees and employers to keep the plan they have and like. this is a [[page h6266]] commonsense policy that deserves our bipartisan support. i urge my colleagues to vote in favor of h.r. 1624. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. cardenas. mr. speaker, at this point, i reserve the balance of my time so that congressman guthrie can speak first. mr. pitts. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from kentucky (mr. guthrie), the vice chair of the health subcommittee on energy and commerce. mr. guthrie. mr. speaker, i am pleased to be here. i rise in support of h.r. 1624, the protecting affordable coverage for employees act. this bill, which i introduced along with my friend from california (mr. cardenas), congressman markwayne mullin of oklahoma, and kyrsten sinema of arizona will protect smaller employers from increased healthcare costs and will prevent their employees from being forced out of their current healthcare plans. the small group market is currently defined as 1 to 50 employees, but a provision in the healthcare law will expand the group's size from 1 to 100 on january 1. with this expansion comes more onerous regulations and the expectation of dramatic rate hikes. one estimate by oliver wyman predicts that those in the 51 to 100 group will see an average of an 18 percent premium increase in 2016 based on the new rating rules alone. h.r. 1624 stops the mandated expansion of the small group market that will occur on january 1 and allows states to define their own market. mr. speaker, i have heard from many kentuckians who would be impacted by this change, and their concerns are real. small businesses are afraid to expand, and mid-sized businesses have no idea what the costs would be or how they can plan for this new change. this issue has widespread support, with over half the house as cosponsors and nearly a third of the senate as cosponsors. members on both sides of the aisle agree that we must act now to stop this new mandate. it has been a great pleasure working with the gentleman from california (mr. cardenas). it is an issue that we see is happening in washington, that is happening out in our districts, out across to the businesses. both sides of the aisle have come together to say: let's change the law. let's make sure that the small businesses and medium-sized businesses are not affected, and let's move forward. it wasn't just that we signed our names as cosponsors. there was a lot of hard work that i know the gentleman from california (mr. cardenas) did to bring more and more cosponsors to this bill. this is a significant change. it is significant for the people who live in our districts. i encourage support. i appreciate mr. cardenas, ms. sinema, and mr. mullin. mr. cardenas. i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i would like to first thank my colleague from kentucky (mr. guthrie). it has been a pleasure and honor to serve with him on this bill. it is really important for us to understand how monumental this moment is. this isn't the biggest bill in the world. but, yet, at the same time, if you are a small business in the united states of america and you have 1 to 50 employees or now even 1 to 100 employees, this bill hopefully will help affect your business and your employees in a way that is better. i rise in support of h.r. 1624. i truly appreciate the willingness to work on a bipartisan bill, as demonstrated today, which is going to positively impact so many communities across the country through the small businesses it will affect. h.r. 1624, the protecting affordable coverage for employees act, introduced by my colleagues, once again, mr. guthrie, mr. mullin, ms. sinema, and myself--two republicans and two democrats is a true bipartisan effort--would stop a potential health insurance rate shock by allowing states to determine the appropriate size of their small group market. as a former small-business owner myself, i recognize the struggle there is to live out the american dream. i know how difficult it can be when a specific sector of small business is affected by regulations and laws created by local, state, or federal governments. i have seen the impact in neighborhoods throughout my district when a small local business opens their doors or closes their doors. their supply chain is local. their employees have a vested interest in their success. their customers treasure the connection a small hometown business brings. i know i echo the view of the entire u.s. house of representatives when i applaud these small businesses, the risks that they have taken, and the celebration of their successes. the affordable care act isn't perfect. by no means is the affordable care act perfect. but i am grateful for all the benefits that the law has provided since its enactment. today more than 16 million americans have gained access to affordable health insurance that did not have it before enacting the act. my district is one of only two districts in the united states to see a double-digit increase in insured residents since the implementation of the affordable care act. the affordable care act is the biggest change to american health care in the past 70 years. it brings down costs, covering more americans and making dozens of other crucial changes to how our nation views health care. however, no law is perfect. when it was first created, social security didn't cover agricultural and domestic workers. medicaid didn't begin to cover mammograms until 1991. even with these fundamental programs of our nation's safety net, improvement and compromise was necessary to lead to more perfect laws. while certain states, like california, have decided to move forward with the expansion, this bill still provides states the flexibility to ensure market stability for small businesses across the country. i appreciate the bipartisan effort to bring this bill to the floor. i look forward to advancing the pace act and continuing to build on a record of working together in a bipartisan fashion. i was just sharing a moment with my colleague from kentucky, congressman guthrie, in talking about how proud i am of this moment and how much i appreciate his willingness to reach across the aisle and work with us to make sure that we bring a fix--not the biggest fix, but a fix--that will help american businesses and american workers across this country. it is an opportunity for us to work together. but, more importantly, it is an opportunity for us to do the job that we were elected to do: to put aside partisan bickering, to make sure that we look at what is best for america, try our best to bring a bill to the floor through both houses, and, hopefully, get the signature of the president of the united states. again, it was due to this bipartisan effort that i think that what i just described is going to happen. come january of 2016, it is going to be a better place for all of us--for our businesses and our workers-- because we were willing to work together. once again, it is not the easiest thing to do, but it is something that, unfortunately, is far too rare. i hope that this is the beginning, the beginning of many of us working together and making good things happen for america and its territories. i urge my colleagues to vote for h.r. 1624. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. pitts. mr. speaker, this is a good bill. it is an important bill. it is a bipartisan bill. i urge my colleagues to vote in favor of h.r. 1624. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. pallone. mr. speaker, since the passage of the affordable care act, 17.6 million americans have gained health insurance coverage and are no longer one accident, injury, or diagnosis away from financial ruin. this is the largest reduction in the uninsured in four decades. the aca has increased access and reduced financial barriers to important preventive services, such as cancer screenings and well-woman visits by requiring their coverage with no cost sharing. the law also stopped insurers from discriminating based on preexisting conditions or placing annual limits on how much health care they will cover. though the aca is already helping millions nationwide, no law is perfect, and there are certainly ways we can improve the aca and build upon its successes. given the political theatre that tends to surround the aca, i am pleased to see that my republican colleagues [[page h6267]] are ready to work together on bipartisan proposals such as h.r. 1624 with the goal of strengthening the law. unfortunately, though, i do not agree with the approach this bill takes. h.r. 1624 would permanently change the law to make the small group expansion currently required under the aca optional for states and allow states to ``opt in'' if they choose. research tells us that some states simply are not ready to expand their small group market and that expansion in these states could result in higher costs for certain consumers. however, the small group expansion was included in the aca for good reason. the benefits of expansion such as added consumer protections and increased stability for small employers are important and achievable goals. states like washington are already experiencing the benefits of an expanded small group market. i am concerned that h.r. 1624 is premature, and i would instead prefer a few year transitional delay of the small group expansion or an ``opt out'' option for states instead. i believe these alternatives would ensure that states continue to work towards the goal of expansion, rather than disregarding the provision altogether. mr. speaker, i am also disappointed that this bill was not considered under regular order. such an important issue deserves thoughtful discussion and opportunities for amendments. i had hoped to offer an amendment that would allow states to ``opt out'' of the expansion. since i was unable to discuss this amendment and other potential changes to the bill with my colleagues in a committee markup, i remain uncertain that this legislation is the best course of action. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. pitts) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 1624, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",15982

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. General Leave Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I introduced H.R. 3089, the Grants Oversight and New Efficiency, or GONE, Act, to bring much-needed accountability to the Federal grant- making process. This bipartisan bill requires each agency to report to Congress on the amount of expired and empty grant accounts that remain open on the government's books. Under the bill, the agencies must examine the 30 grants that have been expired for the longest period of time and explain why these grants have not been closed. One year after this initial report, these agencies will update Congress, reporting on which accounts previously identified have been closed and which remain open. These reports will help Congress better understand why expired grant accounts remain open at taxpayer expense. Mr. Speaker, in fiscal year 2014, Federal grant expenditures exceeded $529 billion, and that is real money. This enormous amount of money demands strong financial management to protect taxpayer dollars from waste. In 2012, GAO released a report on the timeliness of grant closeouts by Federal agencies. The report found nearly $1 billion remaining in undisbursed funds within expired grant accounts. Within one of the grant management systems GAO examined, there were almost 1,000 accounts that had been expired for 5 years or more and still had not been closed out. {time} 1545 GAO found out that this same management system contained 28,000 expired grant accounts with no funds in them. Mr. Speaker, expired grant accounts create multiple levels of waste. First, the undisbursed funds remaining in expired accounts could be better used for their appropriated purpose or returned to the Treasury to help bring down the deficit and mounting debt. Second, agencies pay a monthly fee for each account that remains open within the Federal payment management system. As a result, agencies could be spending roughly $2 million per year to maintain these 28,000 accounts with no funds in them, assuming they have not been closed. Surely we can find a better use for these taxpayer dollars rather than wasting funds maintaining expired accounts. Finally, grants that are not properly closed out slow the grant- making agency from conducting the necessary oversight to ensure that funds were properly spent and that taxpayer money is not being wasted. The GONE Act is a response to these issues. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3089 utilizes the Department of Health and Human Services to coordinate with agencies to provide these reports to Congress. HHS was chosen for this role because of some of its successful closeout efforts implemented in 2011. HHS's commendable work on grant closeout is exactly [[Page H6272]] why we added a provision to this bill requiring HHS to coordinate with the Office of Management and Budget in reporting to Congress on legislative changes needed to improve the process of grants administration. H.R. 3089 strengthens oversight by asking the inspectors general of the largest grant-making agencies to conduct a risk assessment of their agency's grant closeout processes. I thank Senators Fischer and Manchin for their work on the Senate companion bill, S. 1115, including their work on the bill before the House today. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to bring some commonsense steps to the Federal grant-making process by supporting this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the legislation under consideration, H.R. 3089, the Grant Oversight and New Efficiency Act, was introduced by my friend Mr. Walberg of Michigan in July of this year; and it was reported out of the House Oversight Committee with the support of Mrs. Brenda Lawrence, also of Michigan, this month. This bill would require one-time reports from Federal agencies on expired grants. As noted earlier by Mr. Walberg, in a report by the Government Accountability Office, Federal agencies do not always close out expired grants properly. In fact, GAO has found that in 2011, nearly $800 million in undisbursed balances remained in expired grant accounts. That money could be returned to the Treasury and spent on any number of pressing priorities here in the House and Senate. In particular, Mr. Walberg's bill, H.R. 3089, would require agencies to report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and Congress on grants that have expired and whether they have undisbursed balances. The bill would also require agencies to make recommendations on which grants should be closed out immediately as well as explain why certain grants were not properly closed out to begin with. I commend the Representatives from Michigan, both Mr. Walberg, our lead sponsor on this bill, and Mrs. Lawrence, for their work on this bipartisan bill. This is a commonsense, good government measure that every Member should support. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his support and leadership on the floor. I thank the chairman and ranking member of our committee. Most importantly, I thank my good friend and colleague from Michigan, Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence, for her support and helpful additions to this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this commonsense bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3089, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. General Leave Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I introduced H.R. 3089, the Grants Oversight and New Efficiency, or GONE, Act, to bring much-needed accountability to the Federal grant- making process. This bipartisan bill requires each agency to report to Congress on the amount of expired and empty grant accounts that remain open on the government's books. Under the bill, the agencies must examine the 30 grants that have been expired for the longest period of time and explain why these grants have not been closed. One year after this initial report, these agencies will update Congress, reporting on which accounts previously identified have been closed and which remain open. These reports will help Congress better understand why expired grant accounts remain open at taxpayer expense. Mr. Speaker, in fiscal year 2014, Federal grant expenditures exceeded $529 billion, and that is real money. This enormous amount of money demands strong financial management to protect taxpayer dollars from waste. In 2012, GAO released a report on the timeliness of grant closeouts by Federal agencies. The report found nearly $1 billion remaining in undisbursed funds within expired grant accounts. Within one of the grant management systems GAO examined, there were almost 1,000 accounts that had been expired for 5 years or more and still had not been closed out. {time} 1545 GAO found out that this same management system contained 28,000 expired grant accounts with no funds in them. Mr. Speaker, expired grant accounts create multiple levels of waste. First, the undisbursed funds remaining in expired accounts could be better used for their appropriated purpose or returned to the Treasury to help bring down the deficit and mounting debt. Second, agencies pay a monthly fee for each account that remains open within the Federal payment management system. As a result, agencies could be spending roughly $2 million per year to maintain these 28,000 accounts with no funds in them, assuming they have not been closed. Surely we can find a better use for these taxpayer dollars rather than wasting funds maintaining expired accounts. Finally, grants that are not properly closed out slow the grant- making agency from conducting the necessary oversight to ensure that funds were properly spent and that taxpayer money is not being wasted. The GONE Act is a response to these issues. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3089 utilizes the Department of Health and Human Services to coordinate with agencies to provide these reports to Congress. HHS was chosen for this role because of some of its successful closeout efforts implemented in 2011. HHS's commendable work on grant closeout is exactly [[Page H6272]] why we added a provision to this bill requiring HHS to coordinate with the Office of Management and Budget in reporting to Congress on legislative changes needed to improve the process of grants administration. H.R. 3089 strengthens oversight by asking the inspectors general of the largest grant-making agencies to conduct a risk assessment of their agency's grant closeout processes. I thank Senators Fischer and Manchin for their work on the Senate companion bill, S. 1115, including their work on the bill before the House today. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to bring some commonsense steps to the Federal grant-making process by supporting this bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the legislation under consideration, H.R. 3089, the Grant Oversight and New Efficiency Act, was introduced by my friend Mr. Walberg of Michigan in July of this year; and it was reported out of the House Oversight Committee with the support of Mrs. Brenda Lawrence, also of Michigan, this month. This bill would require one-time reports from Federal agencies on expired grants. As noted earlier by Mr. Walberg, in a report by the Government Accountability Office, Federal agencies do not always close out expired grants properly. In fact, GAO has found that in 2011, nearly $800 million in undisbursed balances remained in expired grant accounts. That money could be returned to the Treasury and spent on any number of pressing priorities here in the House and Senate. In particular, Mr. Walberg's bill, H.R. 3089, would require agencies to report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and Congress on grants that have expired and whether they have undisbursed balances. The bill would also require agencies to make recommendations on which grants should be closed out immediately as well as explain why certain grants were not properly closed out to begin with. I commend the Representatives from Michigan, both Mr. Walberg, our lead sponsor on this bill, and Mrs. Lawrence, for their work on this bipartisan bill. This is a commonsense, good government measure that every Member should support. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his support and leadership on the floor. I thank the chairman and ranking member of our committee. Most importantly, I thank my good friend and colleague from Michigan, Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence, for her support and helpful additions to this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this commonsense bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3089, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 136) to amend chapter 21 of title 5, United States Code, to provide that fathers of certain permanently disabled or deceased veterans shall be included with mothers of such veterans as preference eligibles for treatment in the civil service. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: S. 136 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Gold Star Fathers Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. PREFERENCE ELIGIBLE TREATMENT FOR FATHERS OF CERTAIN PERMANENTLY DISABLED OR DECEASED VETERANS. Section 2108(3) of title 5, United States Code, is amended by striking subparagraphs (F) and (G) and inserting the following: ``(F) the parent of an individual who lost his or her life under honorable conditions while serving in the armed forces during a period named by paragraph (1)(A) of this section, if-- ``(i) the spouse of that parent is totally and permanently disabled; or ``(ii) that parent, when preference is claimed, is unmarried or, if married, legally separated from his or her spouse; ``(G) the parent of a service-connected permanently and totally disabled veteran, if-- ``(i) the spouse of that parent is totally and permanently disabled; or ``(ii) that parent, when preference is claimed, is unmarried or, if married, legally separated from his or her spouse; and''. SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE. The amendment made by this Act shall take effect 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. General Leave Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 136, the Gold Star Fathers Act of 2015. This important piece of legislation supports fathers of permanently disabled or deceased veterans in their search for employment with the Federal Government. Mr. Speaker, under current law, mothers of certain permanently disabled or deceased veterans receive preference in hiring for civil service positions in recognition of their sacrifice. That preference applies when the mother is widowed, divorced, or separated, or if their husband is totally or permanently disabled. The Gold Star Fathers Act of 2015 extends this same benefit to fathers. The bill also grants preference in hiring to parents who never married along with those that are widowed, divorced, or legally separated. I thank Senators Wyden, Brown, and Collins for their work over several Congresses on this important issue, and Congresswoman Esty for sponsoring the House companion bill. Mr. Speaker, we owe a debt of gratitude to our veterans and to the mothers and fathers of our veterans. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 136, the Gold Star Fathers Act of 2015, bipartisan legislation introduced by my colleague, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, last January and cosponsored by Senators Sherrod Brown of Rhode Island and Susan Collins of Maine. This bill passed the United States Senate by unanimous consent in May of this year and was favorably reported out of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in July. This legislation also has bipartisan support in the House in the form of identical legislation, H.R. 1222, introduced by my colleague, Representative Elizabeth Esty, of Connecticut. In appreciation of the sacrifices that Gold Star families have made on behalf of our grateful Nation, the Gold Star Fathers Act would extend the 10-point hiring preference for Federal civilian jobs to the fathers of servicemembers who have been permanently disabled or who lost their lives while serving on Active Duty. This would be identical to the Federal hiring preference that has been available to our Gold Star Mothers since 1948. Mr. Speaker, this legislation is reflective of the immense gratitude that we hold as a nation for the parents of our fallen and disabled heroes. It also recognizes the profound sacrifice that our Gold Star families continue to endure every day. It is a burden that is shouldered by the very few on behalf of the entire Nation. Back in South Boston, my mother-in-law, Helen Shaughnessy, originally Helen Bailey, is a Gold Star sister. She lost her brother, Arnie Bailey, in April of 1944 on his first jump over the Rhine close to the end of the Second World War in Europe. I know that their family continues to carry that pain and that burden each and every day. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support Ms. Esty in her efforts, along with Senator Wyden and others in the Senate, to support S. 136. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty). I would like to introduce and welcome her remarks. She is the lead sponsor of this bill in the House and has been a true champion on behalf of veterans all over this country. Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 136, the Senate companion to my bill in the House, the Gold Star Fathers Act of 2015. I want to thank Chairman Chaffetz and Ranking Member Cummings for their support of our Gold Star families and for prioritizing this bipartisan bill that would bring equity to the treatment of all Gold Star families, and I want to thank my friends Mr. Walberg and Mr. Lynch for their support today. Mr. Speaker, on Memorial Day last year, I met with Gold Star families in Waterbury, Connecticut, and I heard the stories of how deeply they feel the loss of their loved ones, whether that loss was a year ago, 20 years ago, or 40 years ago. I heard from mothers and I heard from fathers about the difficulty of continuing on without a member of their family that they held so dear. [[Page H6268]] Those willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for their country deserve to know that we will support and care for their loved ones they leave behind. After talking with these families, I knew that we needed to do more for these grieving families and we needed to do more to recognize the sacrifice of their loved ones. That is why I introduced the House bill companion of the Gold Star Fathers Act. Mr. Speaker, our country has long recognized that mothers who have lost a child in military service or are caring for their son or daughter who was permanently disabled in the military deserve a hand when seeking Federal employment. Currently, qualifying mothers of certain disabled or deceased veterans are eligible to receive the veterans hiring preference that will no longer be used by their loved one when applying for certain Federal service jobs. However, mothers are not the only ones who grieve. The loss of a child is felt just as strongly by our veterans' fathers as by their mothers. It is time to ensure equal treatment of and respect for all parents of deceased or disabled veterans. That is why the Gold Star Fathers Act would extend this hiring preference to fathers as well. In many cases, not only have the parents undergone significant trauma emotionally, but they have lost a working-age member of their family; and in the case of a permanently disabled child, they may have mounting medical bills to deal with as well. It is time to establish equality in our Nation's treatment of the parents of deceased and disabled veterans. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Senators Wyden, Collins, and Brown for their leadership on the Gold Star Fathers Act in the Senate, and I want to thank my former colleague Representative Tim Bishop for his past leadership on this issue as well. Mr. Speaker, I call on all of my colleagues to join us in honoring our Gold Star families. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in favor of this bipartisan, unanimously supported Gold Star Fathers Act. Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this commonsense bill. It is more than common sense. We talk about family values a lot. These are family values. These are highest family values of parents that have raised young people who are willing to step forward for our country without consideration of their own lives or their futures in most cases. So I applaud my colleagues' efforts on this behalf, and I support and ask that this bill be supported fully by this body. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 136. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6267-H6268] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1515 GOLD STAR FATHERS ACT OF 2015 Mr. WALBERG.

That preference applies when the mother is widowed, divorced, or separated, or if their husband is totally or permanently disabled. The Gold Star Fathers Act of 2015 extends this same benefit to fathers. The bill also grants preference in hiring to parents who never married along with those that are widowed, divorced, or legally separated. I thank Senators Wyden, Brown, and Collins for their work over several Congresses on this important issue, and Congresswoman Esty for sponsoring the House companion bill. Mr. Speaker, we owe a debt of gratitude to our veterans and to the mothers and fathers of our veterans. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 136, the Gold Star Fathers Act of 2015, bipartisan legislation introduced by my colleague, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, last January and cosponsored by Senators Sherrod Brown of Rhode Island and Susan Collins of Maine. This bill passed the United States Senate by unanimous consent in May of this year and was favorably reported out of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in July. This legislation also has bipartisan support in the House in the form of identical legislation, H.R. 1222, introduced by my colleague, Representative Elizabeth Esty, of Connecticut. In appreciation of the sacrifices that Gold Star families have made on behalf of our grateful Nation, the Gold Star Fathers Act would extend the 10-point hiring preference for Federal civilian jobs to the fathers of servicemembers who have been permanently disabled or who lost their lives while serving on Active Duty. This would be identical to the Federal hiring preference that has been available to our Gold Star Mothers since 1948. Mr. Speaker, this legislation is reflective of the immense gratitude that we hold as a nation for the parents of our fallen and disabled heroes. It also recognizes the profound sacrifice that our Gold Star families continue to endure every day. It is a burden that is shouldered by the very few on behalf of the entire Nation. Back in South Boston, my mother-in-law, Helen Shaughnessy, originally Helen Bailey, is a Gold Star sister. She lost her brother, Arnie Bailey, in April of 1944 on his first jump over the Rhine close to the end of the Second World War in Europe. I know that their family continues to carry that pain and that burden each and every day. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support Ms. Esty in her efforts, along with Senator Wyden and others in the Senate, to support S. 136. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty). I would like to introduce and welcome her remarks. She is the lead sponsor of this bill in the House and has been a true champion on behalf of veterans all over this country. Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 136, the Senate companion to my bill in the House, the Gold Star Fathers Act of 2015. I want to thank Chairman Chaffetz and Ranking Member Cummings for their support of our Gold Star families and for prioritizing this bipartisan bill that would bring equity to the treatment of all Gold Star families, and I want to thank my friends Mr. Walberg and Mr. Lynch for their support today. Mr. Speaker, on Memorial Day last year, I met with Gold Star families in Waterbury, Connecticut, and I heard the stories of how deeply they feel the loss of their loved ones, whether that loss was a year ago, 20 years ago, or 40 years ago. I heard from mothers and I heard from fathers about the difficulty of continuing on without a member of their family that they held so dear. [[Page H6268]] Those willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for their country deserve to know that we will support and care for their loved ones they leave behind. After talking with these families, I knew that we needed to do more for these grieving families and we needed to do more to recognize the sacrifice of their loved ones. That is why I introduced the House bill companion of the Gold Star Fathers Act. Mr. Speaker, our country has long recognized that mothers who have lost a child in military service or are caring for their son or daughter who was permanently disabled in the military deserve a hand when seeking Federal employment. Currently, qualifying mothers of certain disabled or deceased veterans are eligible to receive the veterans hiring preference that will no longer be used by their loved one when applying for certain Federal service jobs. However, mothers are not the only ones who grieve. The loss of a child is felt just as strongly by our veterans' fathers as by their mothers. It is time to ensure equal treatment of and respect for all parents of deceased or disabled veterans. That is why the Gold Star Fathers Act would extend this hiring preference to fathers as well. In many cases, not only have the parents undergone significant trauma emotionally, but they have lost a working-age member of their family; and in the case of a permanently disabled child, they may have mounting medical bills to deal with as well. It is time to establish equality in our Nation's treatment of the parents of deceased and disabled veterans. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Senators Wyden, Collins, and Brown for their leadership on the Gold Star Fathers Act in the Senate, and I want to thank my former colleague Representative Tim Bishop for his past leadership on this issue as well. Mr. Speaker, I call on all of my colleagues to join us in honoring our Gold Star families. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in favor of this bipartisan, unanimously supported Gold Star Fathers Act. Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this commonsense bill. It is more than common sense. We talk about family values a lot. These are family values. These are highest family values of parents that have raised young people who are willing to step forward for our country without consideration of their own lives or their futures in most cases. So I applaud my colleagues' efforts on this behalf, and I support and ask that this bill be supported fully by this body. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 136. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6267-H6268] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1515 GOLD STAR FATHERS ACT OF 2015 Mr. WALBERG.

CREC-2015-09-28-pt1-PgH6269,CREC-2015-09-28,114,FEDERAL VEHICLE REPAIR COST SAVINGS ACT OF 2015,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6269-H6271] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FEDERAL VEHICLE REPAIR COST SAVINGS ACT OF 2015 Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 565) to reduce the operation and maintenance costs associated with the Federal fleet by encouraging the use of remanufactured parts, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: S. 565 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Vehicle Repair Cost Savings Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds that, in March 2013, the Government Accountability Office issued a report that confirmed that-- (1) there are approximately 588,000 vehicles in the civilian Federal fleet; (2) Federal agencies spent approximately $975,000,000 on repair and maintenance of the Federal fleet in 2011; (3) remanufactured vehicle components, such as engines, starters, alternators, steering racks, and clutches, tend to be less expensive than comparable new replacement parts; and (4) the United States Postal Service and the Department of the Interior both informed the Government Accountability Office that the respective agencies rely on the use of remanufactured vehicle components to reduce costs. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act-- [[Page H6270]] (1) the term ``Federal agency'' has the meaning given that term in section 102 of title 40, United States Code; and (2) the term ``remanufactured vehicle component'' means a vehicle component (including an engine, transmission, alternator, starter, turbocharger, steering, or suspension component) that has been returned to same-as-new, or better, condition and performance by a standardized industrial process that incorporates technical specifications (including engineering, quality, and testing standards) to yield fully warranted products. SEC. 4. REQUIREMENT TO USE REMANUFACTURED VEHICLE COMPONENTS. The head of each Federal agency-- (1) shall encourage the use of remanufactured vehicle components to maintain Federal vehicles, if using such components reduces the cost of maintaining the Federal vehicles while maintaining quality; and (2) shall not encourage the use of remanufactured vehicle components to maintain Federal vehicles, if using such components-- (A) does not reduce the cost of maintaining Federal vehicles; (B) lowers the quality of vehicle performance, as determined by the employee of the Federal agency responsible for the repair decision; or (C) delays the return to service of a vehicle. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. General Leave Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of S. 565, the Federal Vehicle Repair Cost Savings Act of 2015. This bill is a bipartisan and bicameral effort designed to reduce the costs of maintenance for the Federal vehicle fleet. The Federal Vehicle Repair Cost Savings Act encourages agencies to use remanufactured vehicle components when doing so will reduce maintenance costs while also maintain quality. The term ``remanufactured vehicle components'' refers to components that have been returned to same-as-new or better condition and performance by a standardized industrial process that incorporates technical specifications. In 2013, a Government Accountability Office report found that remanufactured vehicle components, such as engines, starters, alternators, steering racks, and clutches, tend to be less expensive than comparable new parts. In fact, a 2012 study by the U.S. International Trade Commission found that remanufacturing parts can result in savings of 85 percent of the energy and material used to manufacture equivalent new parts. Further, this study found that remanufactured parts are, on average, 20 to 50 percent less expensive. Requiring agency heads under this bill to encourage their Federal vehicle maintenance staff to use remanufactured components will reduce maintenance costs, which totaled $975 million in 2011, for 588,000 vehicles. This bill is also supported by the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, which directly employs over 734,000 people in U.S. manufacturing jobs. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressmen Huizenga and Ashford for their work on the House companion bill. I also want to thank Senators Peters and Lankford for their work on this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan cost savings legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of S. 565, the Federal Vehicle Repair Cost Savings Act, introduced by Senator Peters of Michigan. I would also like to recognize Representative Bill Huizenga of Michigan for his good work on this legislation. S. 565 passed the United States Senate by unanimous consent last month. With today's House passage, it can go straight to the President's desk for his signature. The Federal Vehicle Repair Cost Savings Act would require the head of each Federal agency to encourage the use of remanufactured vehicle components if doing so would reduce costs while maintaining high quality. The intent behind this bill is to raise awareness of the option of using remanufactured parts and inform agency fleet managers of this cost-saving option. I would note that the bill encourages the heads of Federal agencies to use remanufactured parts, but the decision ultimately to do so would remain at the discretion of fleet managers. According to a March 2013 Government Accountability Office report, Federal agencies spent about $1 billion on vehicle repair and maintenance in 2011. The report also found that remanufactured vehicle components tend to be much less expensive. For example, the Postal Service and the Department of Interior informed GAO that they rely on remanufactured vehicle components to reduce costs. Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense piece of legislation that seeks to save taxpayer dollars and better ensure that the Federal Government is purchasing high-quality products. I urge Members on both sides of the aisle to vote for this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), my good friend and colleague. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, especially my friend, Chairman Chaffetz, and my friend, Mr. Walberg, here from Michigan, as well as Ranking Member Cummings, for bringing this bipartisan, bicameral bill to the floor to save taxpayer dollars and create jobs. I often hear, like most of us do, from our constituents: Why can't Congress work together and get something done and eliminate wasteful spending and create jobs? Well, we have got it, folks. Here we go. With the Federal Vehicle Repair Cost Savings Act, I teamed up with Senator Gary Peters, also of Michigan. We are going to save literally millions of taxpayer dollars by reducing spending on Federal vehicle maintenance and create good manufacturing jobs. Our commonsense bill calls on Federal agencies to use remanufactured components to repair and maintain the Federal vehicle fleet when using those parts would lower costs, achieve higher safety standards, and maintain quality and performance. Remanufactured parts are less expensive than brand-new parts and have been returned to same-as-new condition. I know this from firsthand experience, owning a small sand and gravel operation where we oftentimes use remanufactured parts on our own trucks. The component may be an engine, may be a transmission, may be a drivetrain, may be a rear end or an alternator. Each of those repairs presents an opportunity to be more fiscally responsible with taxpayer dollars. In 2013, a GAO report found that the Federal Government owns a fleet of approximately 588,000 vehicles. The cost of maintaining that fleet has ballooned to nearly $1 billion. While it is clear there needs to be a fleet of these Federal vehicles to have access to a reliable motor pool, it is important that these vehicles be maintained efficiently and effectively to ensure that those tax dollars--our precious tax dollars--are used in the most effective way possible. In addition to eliminating wasteful spending, this legislation serves as an important boost to good-paying jobs and remanufacturing suppliers. According to the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, remanufacturing of motor vehicle parts is responsible for over 30,000 full-time jobs across the United States. For example, in my district, Valley Truck Parts, headquartered in Wyoming, employs 250 Michiganders. In Kentwood, Michigan, North America Fuel Systems Remanufacturing employs more than 150 people. These companies, among so many others across Michigan and so many other States, demonstrate how remanufacturing supports good-paying middle class jobs in States like Michigan and Ohio and North Carolina and Pennsylvania and so many others. It is [[Page H6271]] going to play an expanded role, I believe, in making this Federal Government even more efficient. I encourage my colleagues to join us in this effort to save millions of taxpayer dollars, support good jobs, and make the Federal Government run more efficiently. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In closing, having heard the comments on this, I urge the adoption of this commonsense bill that encourages also us doing an environmental thing as well in using resources that we have. I ask that my colleagues support this commonsense bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 565. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6269-H6271] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FEDERAL VEHICLE REPAIR COST SAVINGS ACT OF 2015 Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 565) to reduce the operation and maintenance costs associated with the Federal fleet by encouraging the use of remanufactured parts, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: S. 565 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Vehicle Repair Cost Savings Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds that, in March 2013, the Government Accountability Office issued a report that confirmed that-- (1) there are approximately 588,000 vehicles in the civilian Federal fleet; (2) Federal agencies spent approximately $975,000,000 on repair and maintenance of the Federal fleet in 2011; (3) remanufactured vehicle components, such as engines, starters, alternators, steering racks, and clutches, tend to be less expensive than comparable new replacement parts; and (4) the United States Postal Service and the Department of the Interior both informed the Government Accountability Office that the respective agencies rely on the use of remanufactured vehicle components to reduce costs. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act-- [[Page H6270]] (1) the term ``Federal agency'' has the meaning given that term in section 102 of title 40, United States Code; and (2) the term ``remanufactured vehicle component'' means a vehicle component (including an engine, transmission, alternator, starter, turbocharger, steering, or suspension component) that has been returned to same-as-new, or better, condition and performance by a standardized industrial process that incorporates technical specifications (including engineering, quality, and testing standards) to yield fully warranted products. SEC. 4. REQUIREMENT TO USE REMANUFACTURED VEHICLE COMPONENTS. The head of each Federal agency-- (1) shall encourage the use of remanufactured vehicle components to maintain Federal vehicles, if using such components reduces the cost of maintaining the Federal vehicles while maintaining quality; and (2) shall not encourage the use of remanufactured vehicle components to maintain Federal vehicles, if using such components-- (A) does not reduce the cost of maintaining Federal vehicles; (B) lowers the quality of vehicle performance, as determined by the employee of the Federal agency responsible for the repair decision; or (C) delays the return to service of a vehicle. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. General Leave Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of S. 565, the Federal Vehicle Repair Cost Savings Act of 2015. This bill is a bipartisan and bicameral effort designed to reduce the costs of maintenance for the Federal vehicle fleet. The Federal Vehicle Repair Cost Savings Act encourages agencies to use remanufactured vehicle components when doing so will reduce maintenance costs while also maintain quality. The term ``remanufactured vehicle components'' refers to components that have been returned to same-as-new or better condition and performance by a standardized industrial process that incorporates technical specifications. In 2013, a Government Accountability Office report found that remanufactured vehicle components, such as engines, starters, alternators, steering racks, and clutches, tend to be less expensive than comparable new parts. In fact, a 2012 study by the U.S. International Trade Commission found that remanufacturing parts can result in savings of 85 percent of the energy and material used to manufacture equivalent new parts. Further, this study found that remanufactured parts are, on average, 20 to 50 percent less expensive. Requiring agency heads under this bill to encourage their Federal vehicle maintenance staff to use remanufactured components will reduce maintenance costs, which totaled $975 million in 2011, for 588,000 vehicles. This bill is also supported by the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, which directly employs over 734,000 people in U.S. manufacturing jobs. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressmen Huizenga and Ashford for their work on the House companion bill. I also want to thank Senators Peters and Lankford for their work on this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan cost savings legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of S. 565, the Federal Vehicle Repair Cost Savings Act, introduced by Senator Peters of Michigan. I would also like to recognize Representative Bill Huizenga of Michigan for his good work on this legislation. S. 565 passed the United States Senate by unanimous consent last month. With today's House passage, it can go straight to the President's desk for his signature. The Federal Vehicle Repair Cost Savings Act would require the head of each Federal agency to encourage the use of remanufactured vehicle components if doing so would reduce costs while maintaining high quality. The intent behind this bill is to raise awareness of the option of using remanufactured parts and inform agency fleet managers of this cost-saving option. I would note that the bill encourages the heads of Federal agencies to use remanufactured parts, but the decision ultimately to do so would remain at the discretion of fleet managers. According to a March 2013 Government Accountability Office report, Federal agencies spent about $1 billion on vehicle repair and maintenance in 2011. The report also found that remanufactured vehicle components tend to be much less expensive. For example, the Postal Service and the Department of Interior informed GAO that they rely on remanufactured vehicle components to reduce costs. Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense piece of legislation that seeks to save taxpayer dollars and better ensure that the Federal Government is purchasing high-quality products. I urge Members on both sides of the aisle to vote for this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), my good friend and colleague. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, especially my friend, Chairman Chaffetz, and my friend, Mr. Walberg, here from Michigan, as well as Ranking Member Cummings, for bringing this bipartisan, bicameral bill to the floor to save taxpayer dollars and create jobs. I often hear, like most of us do, from our constituents: Why can't Congress work together and get something done and eliminate wasteful spending and create jobs? Well, we have got it, folks. Here we go. With the Federal Vehicle Repair Cost Savings Act, I teamed up with Senator Gary Peters, also of Michigan. We are going to save literally millions of taxpayer dollars by reducing spending on Federal vehicle maintenance and create good manufacturing jobs. Our commonsense bill calls on Federal agencies to use remanufactured components to repair and maintain the Federal vehicle fleet when using those parts would lower costs, achieve higher safety standards, and maintain quality and performance. Remanufactured parts are less expensive than brand-new parts and have been returned to same-as-new condition. I know this from firsthand experience, owning a small sand and gravel operation where we oftentimes use remanufactured parts on our own trucks. The component may be an engine, may be a transmission, may be a drivetrain, may be a rear end or an alternator. Each of those repairs presents an opportunity to be more fiscally responsible with taxpayer dollars. In 2013, a GAO report found that the Federal Government owns a fleet of approximately 588,000 vehicles. The cost of maintaining that fleet has ballooned to nearly $1 billion. While it is clear there needs to be a fleet of these Federal vehicles to have access to a reliable motor pool, it is important that these vehicles be maintained efficiently and effectively to ensure that those tax dollars--our precious tax dollars--are used in the most effective way possible. In addition to eliminating wasteful spending, this legislation serves as an important boost to good-paying jobs and remanufacturing suppliers. According to the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, remanufacturing of motor vehicle parts is responsible for over 30,000 full-time jobs across the United States. For example, in my district, Valley Truck Parts, headquartered in Wyoming, employs 250 Michiganders. In Kentwood, Michigan, North America Fuel Systems Remanufacturing employs more than 150 people. These companies, among so many others across Michigan and so many other States, demonstrate how remanufacturing supports good-paying middle class jobs in States like Michigan and Ohio and North Carolina and Pennsylvania and so many others. It is [[Page H6271]] going to play an expanded role, I believe, in making this Federal Government even more efficient.

(c) Application.--The amendments made by subsection (a) shall apply with respect to any employee (as that term is defined in section 6329(d)(1) of title 5, United States Code, as added by subsection (a)) hired on or after the date that is one year after the date of enactment of this Act. (d) Regulations.--Not later than 9 months after the date of enactment of this Act-- (1) the Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe regulations with respect to the leave provided by the amendment in subsection (a) for employees, but not including employees of the United States Postal Service or the Postal Regulatory Commission; and (2) the Postmaster General shall prescribe regulations for such leave with respect to officers and employees of the United States Postal Service and the Postal Regulatory Commission. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. General Leave Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 313, the Wounded Warriors Federal Leave Act of 2015, sponsored by my colleague, Congressman Stephen Lynch. This important piece of legislation supports wounded warriors newly hired in the Federal Government. The Wounded Warriors Federal Leave Act of 2015 supports our disabled veterans transitioning to civilian careers by providing sick leave for medical treatments and appointments that are related to their service- connected disability. Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan legislation provides immediate access to sick leave for any new Federal employee who is a veteran with a service-connected disability rated at 30 percent or more for the purposes of undergoing medical treatment for such disability. Because Federal employees begin with a zero sick leave balance and accrue sick leave over time, disabled veterans beginning civilian jobs often have insufficient sick leave to attend medical appointments required for treatment of their service-connected disabilities. This bill provides our newly hired disabled veterans with immediate access of up to 13 days for sick leave so that our disabled veterans do not have to take unpaid leave to care for their service-connected injuries. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 313 is supported by a number of veterans and employee organizations, including the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Federal Managers Association. [[Page H6269]] I commend Mr. Lynch for his leadership on this issue and for working with Mr. Farenthold, Ranking Member Cummings, Mr. Connolly, and Ms. Norton to bring this bipartisan legislation before the committee. I also want to acknowledge Senators Tester, Moran, and Toomey for their work on the Senate companion bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 313, the Wounded Warriors Federal Leave Act of 2015. I introduced this bipartisan legislation in January of this year, and I am proud that it has now gained the support of over 30 Democratic and Republican Members of Congress. I also want to thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg), for his remarks and his support of this bill. At the outset, I would also like to thank Chairman Jason Chaffetz and Ranking Member Elijah Cummings along with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Farenthold) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly) of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee for their leadership in bringing H.R. 313 to the floor. I would also like to thank many of the veterans groups and Federal unions and workforce organizations that have joined together to endorse this legislation. They include the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion, and the 31 unions and member organizations that make up the Federal Postal Coalition. Let me also commend Jennifer Hemingway of the majority staff for the Oversight and Government Reform Committee and Lena Chang of the Democratic staff for our committee for their great work on this bill. Mr. Speaker, the Wounded Warriors Federal Leave Act will address a problem faced by many wounded warriors who are transitioning to civilian life through new careers in the Federal workforce. Currently, a first-year Federal employee will begin his or her career with zero sick leave in the event of a medical event. That is because under current law, full-time Federal employees only earn 4 hours of paid sick leave for each pay period that they work. Obviously, starting from the beginning, they will have zero balance in their sick leave bank--with a maximum of 104 hours of paid sick leave that is available per year. Nevertheless, new employees start with zero. While Federal workers are able to carry over unused annual sick leave from year to year, they begin their first year on the job with no sick leave whatsoever. Now, this lack of initial leave for newly hired Federal workers is particularly burdensome on those employees who are also wounded warriors. These employees need to make regular visits to the VA to seek medical treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, and other service-connected disabilities, and they are quickly forced to burn up any sick leave that they do accrue during their first year at a Federal agency. {time} 1530 Several wounded warriors who have transitioned to the Federal workforce following their tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan and other assignments have highlighted this difficulty during discussions with me and my staff. These workers reported that, without sufficient leave during their first year on the job, they were routinely faced with the difficult choice between having to take a day off work without pay or simply skipping their scheduled VA appointments altogether. Some wounded warriors reported that the closest VA facility to their job was located a 2- or 3-hour drive away. As additionally noted by the Federal Managers Association: ``Young men and women struggle with available leave as they attempt to keep service-related, medically-necessary appointments, which puts undue stress on both managers and their Federal employees as they try to meet their Congressionally-mandated missions and goals.'' Mr. Speaker, we must afford our wounded warriors the flexibility to receive medical care as they transition to serving our Nation in a new capacity, through a Federal civilian job. The Wounded Warriors Federal Leave Act would do just that. This bill will provide first-year Federal employees who have a VA disability rating of 30 percent or greater with 104 hours of wounded warrior leave from the moment they begin their Federal workforce careers. This includes eligible new hires at our Nation's largest employer of veterans--the Defense Department--as well as the United States Postal Service. H.R. 313 also recognizes that these dedicated Federal workers will have accumulated up to 104 hours of traditional sick leave by the end of their first year on the job. That is why the bill also provides that any unused wounded warrior leave would not carry over beyond the second year. The Wounded Warriors Federal Leave Act will also provide critical importance, given that the most recent Federal data on veterans employment indicates that Federal agencies are hiring a growing number of veterans each year. In fiscal year 2014, nearly 60,000, or 33.2 percent, of new hires at Federal agencies were veterans. That is an increase of 9.2 percent over fiscal year 2009. With the number of our young people who have served multiple tours of duty--three, four, five tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan--this is especially important. Approximately 16,000 of newly Federal employees were wounded warriors with a disability rating of 30 percent or greater. Again, I am thankful to Mr. Chaffetz, Mr. Walberg, Mr. Cummings, and Mr. Connolly. And, also, I want to thank Mr. Tester. When we sent this bill over to the Senate looking for a cosponsor in the Senate, Senator Tester was quick to step up and take on this fight in the Senate. I want to thank him for his work on this bill in the Senate side. In closing, I urge all our Members to vote in favor of H.R. 313. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I truly thank Congressman Lynch for his leadership on this issue. It is an issue not only whose time has come, but probably should have come long before this. It is a great idea that deals with the reality of what we face in dealing with wounded warriors and their ongoing success that this country--a grateful country--ought to be involved with encouraging. I urge the adoption of the bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 313. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6268-H6269] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WOUNDED WARRIORS FEDERAL LEAVE ACT OF 2015 Mr. WALBERG.

(a) in general.--subchapter ii of chapter 63 of title 5, united states code, is amended by adding at the end the following: ``sec. 6329. disabled veteran leave ``(a) during the 12-month period beginning on the first day of employment, any employee who is a veteran with a service- connected disability rated at 30 percent or more is entitled to leave, without loss or reduction in pay, for purposes of undergoing medical treatment for such disability for which sick leave could regularly be used. ``(b)(1) the leave credited to an employee under subsection (a) may not exceed 104 hours. ``(2) any leave credited to an employee pursuant to subsection (a) that is not used during the 12-month period described in such subsection may not be carried over and shall be forfeited. ``(c) in order to verify that leave credited to an employee pursuant to subsection (a) is used for treating a service- connected disability, such employee shall submit to the head of the employing agency certification, in such form and manner as the director of the office of personnel management may prescribe, that such employee used such leave for purposes of being furnished treatment for such disability by a health care provider. ``(d) in this section-- ``(1) the term `employee' has the meaning given such term in section 2105, and includes an officer or employee of the united states postal service or of the postal regulatory commission; ``(2) the term `service-connected' has the meaning given such term in section 101(16) of title 38; and ``(3) the term `veteran' has the meaning given such term in section 101(2) of such title.''. (b) clerical amendment.--the table of sections for chapter 63 of title 5, united states code, is amended by adding after the item relating to section 6328 the following: ``6329. disabled veteran leave.''. (c) application.--the amendments made by subsection (a) shall apply with respect to any employee (as that term is defined in section 6329(d)(1) of title 5, united states code, as added by subsection (a)) hired on or after the date that is one year after the date of enactment of this act. (d) regulations.--not later than 9 months after the date of enactment of this act-- (1) the director of the office of personnel management shall prescribe regulations with respect to the leave provided by the amendment in subsection (a) for employees, but not including employees of the united states postal service or the postal regulatory commission; and (2) the postmaster general shall prescribe regulations for such leave with respect to officers and employees of the united states postal service and the postal regulatory commission. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from michigan (mr. walberg) and the gentleman from massachusetts (mr. lynch) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from michigan. general leave mr. walberg. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from michigan? there was no objection. mr. walberg. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h.r. 313, the wounded warriors federal leave act of 2015, sponsored by my colleague, congressman stephen lynch. this important piece of legislation supports wounded warriors newly hired in the federal government. the wounded warriors federal leave act of 2015 supports our disabled veterans transitioning to civilian careers by providing sick leave for medical treatments and appointments that are related to their service- connected disability. mr. speaker, this bipartisan legislation provides immediate access to sick leave for any new federal employee who is a veteran with a service-connected disability rated at 30 percent or more for the purposes of undergoing medical treatment for such disability. because federal employees begin with a zero sick leave balance and accrue sick leave over time, disabled veterans beginning civilian jobs often have insufficient sick leave to attend medical appointments required for treatment of their service-connected disabilities. this bill provides our newly hired disabled veterans with immediate access of up to 13 days for sick leave so that our disabled veterans do not have to take unpaid leave to care for their service-connected injuries. mr. speaker, h.r. 313 is supported by a number of veterans and employee organizations, including the american legion, veterans of foreign wars, and federal managers association. [[page h6269]] i commend mr. lynch for his leadership on this issue and for working with mr. farenthold, ranking member cummings, mr. connolly, and ms. norton to bring this bipartisan legislation before the committee. i also want to acknowledge senators tester, moran, and toomey for their work on the senate companion bill. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. lynch. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of h.r. 313, the wounded warriors federal leave act of 2015. i introduced this bipartisan legislation in january of this year, and i am proud that it has now gained the support of over 30 democratic and republican members of congress. i also want to thank the gentleman from michigan (mr. walberg), for his remarks and his support of this bill. at the outset, i would also like to thank chairman jason chaffetz and ranking member elijah cummings along with the gentleman from texas (mr. farenthold) and the gentleman from virginia (mr. connolly) of the house oversight and government reform committee for their leadership in bringing h.r. 313 to the floor. i would also like to thank many of the veterans groups and federal unions and workforce organizations that have joined together to endorse this legislation. they include the veterans of foreign wars, the american legion, and the 31 unions and member organizations that make up the federal postal coalition. let me also commend jennifer hemingway of the majority staff for the oversight and government reform committee and lena chang of the democratic staff for our committee for their great work on this bill. mr. speaker, the wounded warriors federal leave act will address a problem faced by many wounded warriors who are transitioning to civilian life through new careers in the federal workforce. currently, a first-year federal employee will begin his or her career with zero sick leave in the event of a medical event. that is because under current law, full-time federal employees only earn 4 hours of paid sick leave for each pay period that they work. obviously, starting from the beginning, they will have zero balance in their sick leave bank--with a maximum of 104 hours of paid sick leave that is available per year. nevertheless, new employees start with zero. while federal workers are able to carry over unused annual sick leave from year to year, they begin their first year on the job with no sick leave whatsoever. now, this lack of initial leave for newly hired federal workers is particularly burdensome on those employees who are also wounded warriors. these employees need to make regular visits to the va to seek medical treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, and other service-connected disabilities, and they are quickly forced to burn up any sick leave that they do accrue during their first year at a federal agency. {time} 1530 several wounded warriors who have transitioned to the federal workforce following their tours of duty in iraq and afghanistan and other assignments have highlighted this difficulty during discussions with me and my staff. these workers reported that, without sufficient leave during their first year on the job, they were routinely faced with the difficult choice between having to take a day off work without pay or simply skipping their scheduled va appointments altogether. some wounded warriors reported that the closest va facility to their job was located a 2- or 3-hour drive away. as additionally noted by the federal managers association: ``young men and women struggle with available leave as they attempt to keep service-related, medically-necessary appointments, which puts undue stress on both managers and their federal employees as they try to meet their congressionally-mandated missions and goals.'' mr. speaker, we must afford our wounded warriors the flexibility to receive medical care as they transition to serving our nation in a new capacity, through a federal civilian job. the wounded warriors federal leave act would do just that. this bill will provide first-year federal employees who have a va disability rating of 30 percent or greater with 104 hours of wounded warrior leave from the moment they begin their federal workforce careers. this includes eligible new hires at our nation's largest employer of veterans--the defense department--as well as the united states postal service. h.r. 313 also recognizes that these dedicated federal workers will have accumulated up to 104 hours of traditional sick leave by the end of their first year on the job. that is why the bill also provides that any unused wounded warrior leave would not carry over beyond the second year. the wounded warriors federal leave act will also provide critical importance, given that the most recent federal data on veterans employment indicates that federal agencies are hiring a growing number of veterans each year. in fiscal year 2014, nearly 60,000, or 33.2 percent, of new hires at federal agencies were veterans. that is an increase of 9.2 percent over fiscal year 2009. with the number of our young people who have served multiple tours of duty--three, four, five tours of duty in iraq and afghanistan--this is especially important. approximately 16,000 of newly federal employees were wounded warriors with a disability rating of 30 percent or greater. again, i am thankful to mr. chaffetz, mr. walberg, mr. cummings, and mr. connolly. and, also, i want to thank mr. tester. when we sent this bill over to the senate looking for a cosponsor in the senate, senator tester was quick to step up and take on this fight in the senate. i want to thank him for his work on this bill in the senate side. in closing, i urge all our members to vote in favor of h.r. 313. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. walberg. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i truly thank congressman lynch for his leadership on this issue. it is an issue not only whose time has come, but probably should have come long before this. it is a great idea that deals with the reality of what we face in dealing with wounded warriors and their ongoing success that this country--a grateful country--ought to be involved with encouraging. i urge the adoption of the bill. i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from michigan (mr. walberg) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 313. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",12395

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo) and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. General Leave Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 3614. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, on September 30, 2015, the authorization for the Federal Aviation Administration programs and taxes that fund those programs will expire. H.R. 3614 is a clean, 6-month extension of all necessary authorizations through March 31 of 2016. As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Aviation, I believe it is critical for Congress to come together in a bipartisan, long-term FAA reauthorization bill. On the Aviation Subcommittee, Chairman Shuster and I have had great working partnerships with Congressman DeFazio and Congressman Larsen. I want to thank Congressman DeFazio and Congressman Larsen for their bipartisan cooperation in this very important area. Without an extension, the FAA will not be able to spend funds from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Therefore, airport construction projects across the country will be halted, contractors that support FAA will not be paid, construction jobs will be lost, and thousands of FAA employees could be furloughed. In my district in New Jersey, I have the privilege of representing approximately 4,000 FAA employees and contractors who work at the FAA's premier technical center in the Nation. They contribute an extraordinary amount of energy and dedication to making sure that aviation continues to move forward. Without them, the state of aviation in our country would suffer, and we cannot afford them to be at home for failing because we failed to do our work and pass an extension bill. A lapse in the authorization will also result in the halt of certification and registration of new aviation products, greatly disrupting the aviation manufacturing industry and jeopardizing more good paying jobs. The FAA's aircraft registry would close, delaying deliveries of new aircraft. As many as 10,000 aircraft a month could be grounded if registration cannot be renewed. H.R. 3614 will allow us to continue developing a bipartisan, long- term reauthorization bill which will improve, rebuild, and modernize our Nation's safe, yet highly antiquated, aviation system. I urge support of H.R. 3614. I reserve the balance of my time Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I agree with my good friend, the gentleman from New Jersey, that it is essential that we pass H.R. 3614--the Senate passed it expeditiously--and it be signed by the President. We cannot afford even, you know, the thought of a shutdown of the FAA. We have actually gone down that road in the past. Chairman Mica, in July of 2011, put some provisions into an FAA reauthorization that were objectionable to two very powerful Senators, and we actually went through a shutdown. What we lost was $400 million of revenue because the excise tax expired. Now, one airline, to give them credit, did pass the savings through, the excise tax, Alaska Airlines. All the other airlines kept the money, and we lost $400 million from the trust fund. Capital programs ground to a halt. Airport construction ground to a halt, threatening tens of thousands of jobs. Airport inspectors had to work. They were essential employees. They weren't paid, and they couldn't get government vouchers, so they had to use their personal credit cards to purchase tickets to go to work to do their job, which they weren't being paid for. I mean, this was the ultimate of absurdity. I only go into some detail on that because that is relevant to this extension. This is a 6-month extension. That should give us more than ample time to agree upon a long-term FAA authorization. Much work has already been done on major portions of the bill, but some disagreements remain over the future of the air traffic organization. My preference would be to insulate the entire FAA from future vicissitudes of Congress going off the rails with a shutdown and furloughs and provisions that are unacceptable to the Senate that cause a temporary lapse in authorization. You know, we can get there. We are very close now. This year, all but 7 percent of the FAA's budget will be paid for by user fees, excise taxes, and others, so we are quite close. We would like to reform procurement, to streamline it and make it work better at the FAA. When I was a very young Member of Congress, I got to witness the airport air traffic controller's workstation of the future. That was 1987. Well, it is 2015, and they don't have them yet. The FAA is the only agency of government worse at procurement than the Pentagon. Congress has tried to reform it; it didn't stick. We have got to try something different to get it to be more agile to give us the 21st century equipment and software that we need. Then there are issues of the actual sort of shape of the FAA bureaucracy, a little bit like that in the middle. Congress, also back in 1986, gave the FAA license to reform personnel practices to deal with some of that midlevel management bulge and streamline the agency and decisionmaking process, but that didn't take either. So the three problems are the predictability of funding and the agency being able to look into the future without having to worry about shutdowns, furloughs--I don't know how much time they spent over the last couple of weeks getting ready for this shutdown that everyone thought would come this week before Speaker Boehner announced his retirement; that has got to [[Page H6274]] be dealt with--and then also the procurement reform and the personnel. The chairman's solution is to separate only the air traffic organization from the FAA and insulate that from Congress and those sorts of problems and make it, you know, free of the procurement rules and a lot of the personnel rules. I would prefer to do that with the entire agency, because there are functions--we do have the best air traffic control system in the world. We are busier in the U.S. with more planes under instrument flight rules on a daily basis, about 20 percent more on an IFR average, than Canada, U.K., France, and Germany combined. So we know we have a safe system. We move massive amounts of air traffic. We don't want to mess that up. And I understand, but I also don't think we can isolate it from other decisionmakers in the agency and leave them subject to the vicissitudes of Congress. The people who do the certifications, who do the inspections, who do the safety, it seems to me it should all be moved; and I propose a 21st century constitutionally chartered corporation in order to accomplish those goals and make it self-funding, self-sufficient, and not subject to appropriations or shutdowns or anything else that a future Congress might imagine. So that is the hangup. We haven't agreed on that part yet, but I think we can. We share common objectives, and 6 months should be more than ample time. I am hopeful that early this fall the chairman and I can resolve those issues with other members of the committee, and then we can go forward with our colleagues in the Senate and hopefully have, you know, a bill on the President's desk early, early next year, if not by the end of this year, although December promises to be perhaps a bit chaotic around here. {time} 1600 In any case, 6 months should be ample time. I do not anticipate multiple short-term extensions. I don't want them, nor does the chairman, nor do, I believe, any other thoughtful members of the committee. I see the gentleman from New Jersey shaking his head. We couldn't agree more. We have been down that road before, down that runway before. We don't want to go down that runway again. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Larsen). Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the temporary measure to extend the authorization of the FAA today, but I do so with great disappointment. We could be on the floor today to enact a longer term FAA reauthorization bill. In the last 2 years, the Subcommittee on Aviation, led by my colleague from New Jersey, Mr. LoBiondo, has held 16 hearings on a variety of topics. We have heard from stakeholders that there is a long list of things that we need to do to stay competitive with our economic rivals and keep our airspace the safest and most efficient in the world: We need to reform aircraft certification so that manufacturers can get the newest, safest equipment to market. We need to set clear rules for unmanned aerial vehicles and accelerate efforts for their safe use. We need to advance NextGen programs to move air traffic faster and more efficiently. Chairman Shuster, Chairman LoBiondo, Ranking Member DeFazio, and I have achieved a bipartisan agreement on most of these major key issues that we need to address. That bill is ready to go. We didn't hear during these hearings that we needed to privatize air traffic control. Now, some people want to privatize air traffic control. I know that they want to do this in good faith. But we don't need to do it, and it is preventing the things that we need to do from getting done. An entire bipartisan bill is being held up because we can't agree yet on the details of what would be a very complex proposal. I fail to understand why at this juncture such a proposal is necessary, particularly when it prevents significant and much-needed reform from taking place. There is no dispute that today we safely operate the most complex and congested airspace in the world. Last year the Government Accountability Office asked 76 aviation stakeholders whether the FAA is capable of operating an efficient air traffic control system. The overwhelming majority, 64 of those, said the FAA is, in fact, capable of doing so. Privatizing the current system is clearly not a pressing need. It is a want. I wish I could say today I am surprised that we find ourselves here today, but many people have been saying for a long time that this was the situation that we would be facing on September 30. In fact, when we held a hearing on air traffic privatization back in March, I predicted we were headed down this road of multiple short-term reauthorizations. The bipartisan portions of the bill that Chairman Shuster, Chairman LoBiondo, Ranking Member DeFazio, and I have agreed to would have immediate benefits all over the country. In my home State of Washington, it would protect and create American jobs through airport construction and aerospace manufacturing; it would improve aviation safety; it would improve the way the aircraft and parts are certified to get newer and safer technology to market; it would build on the safety improvements that this body has made following the tragic Colgan flight 3407 in 2009; it would improve the regulation and the development of unmanned aerial systems, which continue to proliferate in our airspace. We need a strong regulatory system in place to safely grow the unmanned aircraft industry, and until we act, that system cannot be in place. For every day of this extension, travelers and the aerospace industry will not receive the improvements and protections that we have crafted in the bipartisan portions of the bill that we are close to agreeing on. We will continue to fall behind other countries that are making similar improvements. As many lawmakers and aviation stakeholders recall, the last FAA reauthorization bill came after a period of 5 years and 23 short-term extensions. I had hoped we would avoid serial extensions this time around, but today we start down that path. Yes, it is with disappointment that I am here to support a temporary extension and strongly urge all my colleagues to make sure this is the only temporary extension before enactment of a long-term bill. We have a long list of things that we need to do today to improve our airspace. We should focus on those things instead of the things only that we want to do. Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the committee. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, here we are with a short-term extension for 6 months. I believe it is critical that we do this, obviously, as it is about to expire. There are things that not only do we want to do, but we need to do, to make sure that we have the safest airspace in the world. We also need to make sure it is the most efficient airspace in the world. We can do that if we deploy the technology and the things we have been talking about for almost 2 years now to transform the FAA into something that can move quicker, that can deploy the technology that is available to us. When we look around the world, there are over 50 countries that have taken the air traffic control organization out of government and have been able to maintain the highest levels of safety, but deploy technology that makes their airspace more efficient. That is the kind of thing we are looking at. I think we are at a critical time. What we have been talking about is not anything new. It is something that we have been talking about for 20 years. In fact, the Clinton administration had a similar proposal, the Bush administration had a similar proposal, and here we are today talking about it. But I think that we have different groups that are looking positively at this. We are very close to putting something together that, as I said, will transform the air traffic control system while keeping back in government [[Page H6275]] the safety and regulatory oversight to this agency to make sure that we are streamlining the certification process for our aviation industry that is manufacturing everything from Boeings to Gulfstreams, to the avionics, to the parts that go into these flying systems. We have got to maintain our lead in the world. The way we do that is to streamline the certification process. The gentleman from Washington, who has Boeing in his district, agrees with me on that issue. There is a lot more in this that we need to do to move forward. I think, as we get through September and into October, we are going to be able to see the bill that we have put forth that is going to have, I believe, bipartisan support not only from Congress, but around the country, around Washington, D.C., and, as I said, here in the House. In talking to the Senate, I am encouraged by what they have said about what we are looking at proposing. Again, I would encourage all Members to support this 6-month extension to give us the time to get our bill on and off the floor and let the Senate work on it so we can truly do something that is bold, do something that is transformational, and do something that will be very, very positive for aviation, not only travel, but for the manufacturing industry in this country. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I have requests to speak from Members who aren't here. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, again, I would like to thank Mr. Shuster, Mr. DeFazio, and Mr. Larsen. I urge all my colleagues to support the legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, with passage of H.R. 3614 today, the House will ``kick the can down the road'' on a long-term FAA reauthorization for another six months. I certainly recognize the dire need to keep our airports and air travel system functioning in the face of an expiration of the FAA's authorization in less than 72 hours. However, I'm very disappointed that this bill does not contain any changes to current policy regarding aircraft noise impacts on communities surrounding airports. Over the last several months, constituents throughout my Congressional District have experienced an alarming increase in aircraft noise due to the implementation of new flight paths under the FAA's Next Gen program. The new flight paths have caused certain communities to be hit especially hard by airplane noise, and other rural communities that have never experienced it are now being bombarded by noise. Many of these communities received little or no advance notice or opportunity to comment on the flight path changes before they were implemented, and they were blindsided when the changes went into effect earlier this year. In July, I joined the Congressional Quiet Skies Caucus so that together we could make recommendations for the Transportation Committee to include in an FAA reauthorization bill. These recommendations include: ensuring that FAA completes a robust community engagement process before flight paths are changed; requiring the FAA to use a new method of measuring noise that captures the true levels of noise on the ground; removing the categorical exclusion from full environmental reviews for flight path changes; and mandating independent research on the health impacts of aviation noise. These important reforms would substantially improve the FAA's process of addressing and avoiding noise impacts. Once again, I wish to express my disappointment that the bill before us today simply reauthorizes the FAA for another six months with none of these important changes included. As the debate over a long-term FAA reauthorization continues, I hope these recommendations will be carefully considered and ultimately included in the final legislation. The ability to get a good night's sleep for thousands of my constituents depends on it. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3614. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6272-H6275] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AIRPORT AND AIRWAY EXTENSION ACT OF 2015 Mr. LoBIONDO.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo) and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. General Leave Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 3614. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, on September 30, 2015, the authorization for the Federal Aviation Administration programs and taxes that fund those programs will expire. H.R. 3614 is a clean, 6-month extension of all necessary authorizations through March 31 of 2016. As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Aviation, I believe it is critical for Congress to come together in a bipartisan, long-term FAA reauthorization bill. On the Aviation Subcommittee, Chairman Shuster and I have had great working partnerships with Congressman DeFazio and Congressman Larsen. I want to thank Congressman DeFazio and Congressman Larsen for their bipartisan cooperation in this very important area. Without an extension, the FAA will not be able to spend funds from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Therefore, airport construction projects across the country will be halted, contractors that support FAA will not be paid, construction jobs will be lost, and thousands of FAA employees could be furloughed. In my district in New Jersey, I have the privilege of representing approximately 4,000 FAA employees and contractors who work at the FAA's premier technical center in the Nation. They contribute an extraordinary amount of energy and dedication to making sure that aviation continues to move forward. Without them, the state of aviation in our country would suffer, and we cannot afford them to be at home for failing because we failed to do our work and pass an extension bill. A lapse in the authorization will also result in the halt of certification and registration of new aviation products, greatly disrupting the aviation manufacturing industry and jeopardizing more good paying jobs. The FAA's aircraft registry would close, delaying deliveries of new aircraft. As many as 10,000 aircraft a month could be grounded if registration cannot be renewed. H.R. 3614 will allow us to continue developing a bipartisan, long- term reauthorization bill which will improve, rebuild, and modernize our Nation's safe, yet highly antiquated, aviation system. I urge support of H.R. 3614. I reserve the balance of my time Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I agree with my good friend, the gentleman from New Jersey, that it is essential that we pass H.R. 3614--the Senate passed it expeditiously--and it be signed by the President. We cannot afford even, you know, the thought of a shutdown of the FAA. We have actually gone down that road in the past. Chairman Mica, in July of 2011, put some provisions into an FAA reauthorization that were objectionable to two very powerful Senators, and we actually went through a shutdown. What we lost was $400 million of revenue because the excise tax expired. Now, one airline, to give them credit, did pass the savings through, the excise tax, Alaska Airlines. All the other airlines kept the money, and we lost $400 million from the trust fund. Capital programs ground to a halt. Airport construction ground to a halt, threatening tens of thousands of jobs. Airport inspectors had to work. They were essential employees. They weren't paid, and they couldn't get government vouchers, so they had to use their personal credit cards to purchase tickets to go to work to do their job, which they weren't being paid for. I mean, this was the ultimate of absurdity. I only go into some detail on that because that is relevant to this extension. This is a 6-month extension. That should give us more than ample time to agree upon a long-term FAA authorization. Much work has already been done on major portions of the bill, but some disagreements remain over the future of the air traffic organization. My preference would be to insulate the entire FAA from future vicissitudes of Congress going off the rails with a shutdown and furloughs and provisions that are unacceptable to the Senate that cause a temporary lapse in authorization. You know, we can get there. We are very close now. This year, all but 7 percent of the FAA's budget will be paid for by user fees, excise taxes, and others, so we are quite close. We would like to reform procurement, to streamline it and make it work better at the FAA. When I was a very young Member of Congress, I got to witness the airport air traffic controller's workstation of the future. That was 1987. Well, it is 2015, and they don't have them yet. The FAA is the only agency of government worse at procurement than the Pentagon. Congress has tried to reform it; it didn't stick. We have got to try something different to get it to be more agile to give us the 21st century equipment and software that we need. Then there are issues of the actual sort of shape of the FAA bureaucracy, a little bit like that in the middle. Congress, also back in 1986, gave the FAA license to reform personnel practices to deal with some of that midlevel management bulge and streamline the agency and decisionmaking process, but that didn't take either. So the three problems are the predictability of funding and the agency being able to look into the future without having to worry about shutdowns, furloughs--I don't know how much time they spent over the last couple of weeks getting ready for this shutdown that everyone thought would come this week before Speaker Boehner announced his retirement; that has got to [[Page H6274]] be dealt with--and then also the procurement reform and the personnel. The chairman's solution is to separate only the air traffic organization from the FAA and insulate that from Congress and those sorts of problems and make it, you know, free of the procurement rules and a lot of the personnel rules. I would prefer to do that with the entire agency, because there are functions--we do have the best air traffic control system in the world. We are busier in the U.S. with more planes under instrument flight rules on a daily basis, about 20 percent more on an IFR average, than Canada, U.K., France, and Germany combined. So we know we have a safe system. We move massive amounts of air traffic. We don't want to mess that up. And I understand, but I also don't think we can isolate it from other decisionmakers in the agency and leave them subject to the vicissitudes of Congress. The people who do the certifications, who do the inspections, who do the safety, it seems to me it should all be moved; and I propose a 21st century constitutionally chartered corporation in order to accomplish those goals and make it self-funding, self-sufficient, and not subject to appropriations or shutdowns or anything else that a future Congress might imagine. So that is the hangup. We haven't agreed on that part yet, but I think we can. We share common objectives, and 6 months should be more than ample time. I am hopeful that early this fall the chairman and I can resolve those issues with other members of the committee, and then we can go forward with our colleagues in the Senate and hopefully have, you know, a bill on the President's desk early, early next year, if not by the end of this year, although December promises to be perhaps a bit chaotic around here. {time} 1600 In any case, 6 months should be ample time. I do not anticipate multiple short-term extensions. I don't want them, nor does the chairman, nor do, I believe, any other thoughtful members of the committee. I see the gentleman from New Jersey shaking his head. We couldn't agree more. We have been down that road before, down that runway before. We don't want to go down that runway again. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Larsen). Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the temporary measure to extend the authorization of the FAA today, but I do so with great disappointment. We could be on the floor today to enact a longer term FAA reauthorization bill. In the last 2 years, the Subcommittee on Aviation, led by my colleague from New Jersey, Mr. LoBiondo, has held 16 hearings on a variety of topics. We have heard from stakeholders that there is a long list of things that we need to do to stay competitive with our economic rivals and keep our airspace the safest and most efficient in the world: We need to reform aircraft certification so that manufacturers can get the newest, safest equipment to market. We need to set clear rules for unmanned aerial vehicles and accelerate efforts for their safe use. We need to advance NextGen programs to move air traffic faster and more efficiently. Chairman Shuster, Chairman LoBiondo, Ranking Member DeFazio, and I have achieved a bipartisan agreement on most of these major key issues that we need to address. That bill is ready to go. We didn't hear during these hearings that we needed to privatize air traffic control. Now, some people want to privatize air traffic control. I know that they want to do this in good faith. But we don't need to do it, and it is preventing the things that we need to do from getting done. An entire bipartisan bill is being held up because we can't agree yet on the details of what would be a very complex proposal. I fail to understand why at this juncture such a proposal is necessary, particularly when it prevents significant and much-needed reform from taking place. There is no dispute that today we safely operate the most complex and congested airspace in the world. Last year the Government Accountability Office asked 76 aviation stakeholders whether the FAA is capable of operating an efficient air traffic control system. The overwhelming majority, 64 of those, said the FAA is, in fact, capable of doing so. Privatizing the current system is clearly not a pressing need. It is a want. I wish I could say today I am surprised that we find ourselves here today, but many people have been saying for a long time that this was the situation that we would be facing on September 30. In fact, when we held a hearing on air traffic privatization back in March, I predicted we were headed down this road of multiple short-term reauthorizations. The bipartisan portions of the bill that Chairman Shuster, Chairman LoBiondo, Ranking Member DeFazio, and I have agreed to would have immediate benefits all over the country. In my home State of Washington, it would protect and create American jobs through airport construction and aerospace manufacturing; it would improve aviation safety; it would improve the way the aircraft and parts are certified to get newer and safer technology to market; it would build on the safety improvements that this body has made following the tragic Colgan flight 3407 in 2009; it would improve the regulation and the development of unmanned aerial systems, which continue to proliferate in our airspace. We need a strong regulatory system in place to safely grow the unmanned aircraft industry, and until we act, that system cannot be in place. For every day of this extension, travelers and the aerospace industry will not receive the improvements and protections that we have crafted in the bipartisan portions of the bill that we are close to agreeing on. We will continue to fall behind other countries that are making similar improvements. As many lawmakers and aviation stakeholders recall, the last FAA reauthorization bill came after a period of 5 years and 23 short-term extensions. I had hoped we would avoid serial extensions this time around, but today we start down that path. Yes, it is with disappointment that I am here to support a temporary extension and strongly urge all my colleagues to make sure this is the only temporary extension before enactment of a long-term bill. We have a long list of things that we need to do today to improve our airspace. We should focus on those things instead of the things only that we want to do. Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the committee. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, here we are with a short-term extension for 6 months. I believe it is critical that we do this, obviously, as it is about to expire. There are things that not only do we want to do, but we need to do, to make sure that we have the safest airspace in the world. We also need to make sure it is the most efficient airspace in the world. We can do that if we deploy the technology and the things we have been talking about for almost 2 years now to transform the FAA into something that can move quicker, that can deploy the technology that is available to us. When we look around the world, there are over 50 countries that have taken the air traffic control organization out of government and have been able to maintain the highest levels of safety, but deploy technology that makes their airspace more efficient. That is the kind of thing we are looking at. I think we are at a critical time. What we have been talking about is not anything new. It is something that we have been talking about for 20 years. In fact, the Clinton administration had a similar proposal, the Bush administration had a similar proposal, and here we are today talking about it. But I think that we have different groups that are looking positively at this. We are very close to putting something together that, as I said, will transform the air traffic control system while keeping back in government [[Page H6275]] the safety and regulatory oversight to this agency to make sure that we are streamlining the certification process for our aviation industry that is manufacturing everything from Boeings to Gulfstreams, to the avionics, to the parts that go into these flying systems. We have got to maintain our lead in the world. The way we do that is to streamline the certification process. The gentleman from Washington, who has Boeing in his district, agrees with me on that issue. There is a lot more in this that we need to do to move forward. I think, as we get through September and into October, we are going to be able to see the bill that we have put forth that is going to have, I believe, bipartisan support not only from Congress, but around the country, around Washington, D.C., and, as I said, here in the House. In talking to the Senate, I am encouraged by what they have said about what we are looking at proposing. Again, I would encourage all Members to support this 6-month extension to give us the time to get our bill on and off the floor and let the Senate work on it so we can truly do something that is bold, do something that is transformational, and do something that will be very, very positive for aviation, not only travel, but for the manufacturing industry in this country. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I have requests to speak from Members who aren't here. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, again, I would like to thank Mr. Shuster, Mr. DeFazio, and Mr. Larsen. I urge all my colleagues to support the legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, with passage of H.R. 3614 today, the House will ``kick the can down the road'' on a long-term FAA reauthorization for another six months. I certainly recognize the dire need to keep our airports and air travel system functioning in the face of an expiration of the FAA's authorization in less than 72 hours. However, I'm very disappointed that this bill does not contain any changes to current policy regarding aircraft noise impacts on communities surrounding airports. Over the last several months, constituents throughout my Congressional District have experienced an alarming increase in aircraft noise due to the implementation of new flight paths under the FAA's Next Gen program. The new flight paths have caused certain communities to be hit especially hard by airplane noise, and other rural communities that have never experienced it are now being bombarded by noise. Many of these communities received little or no advance notice or opportunity to comment on the flight path changes before they were implemented, and they were blindsided when the changes went into effect earlier this year. In July, I joined the Congressional Quiet Skies Caucus so that together we could make recommendations for the Transportation Committee to include in an FAA reauthorization bill. These recommendations include: ensuring that FAA completes a robust community engagement process before flight paths are changed; requiring the FAA to use a new method of measuring noise that captures the true levels of noise on the ground; removing the categorical exclusion from full environmental reviews for flight path changes; and mandating independent research on the health impacts of aviation noise. These important reforms would substantially improve the FAA's process of addressing and avoiding noise impacts. Once again, I wish to express my disappointment that the bill before us today simply reauthorizes the FAA for another six months with none of these important changes included. As the debate over a long-term FAA reauthorization continues, I hope these recommendations will be carefully considered and ultimately included in the final legislation. The ability to get a good night's sleep for thousands of my constituents depends on it. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3614. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6272-H6275] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AIRPORT AND AIRWAY EXTENSION ACT OF 2015 Mr. LoBIONDO.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo) and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey. General Leave Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 3614. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey? There was no objection. Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, on September 30, 2015, the authorization for the Federal Aviation Administration programs and taxes that fund those programs will expire. H.R. 3614 is a clean, 6-month extension of all necessary authorizations through March 31 of 2016. As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Aviation, I believe it is critical for Congress to come together in a bipartisan, long-term FAA reauthorization bill. On the Aviation Subcommittee, Chairman Shuster and I have had great working partnerships with Congressman DeFazio and Congressman Larsen. I want to thank Congressman DeFazio and Congressman Larsen for their bipartisan cooperation in this very important area. Without an extension, the FAA will not be able to spend funds from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Therefore, airport construction projects across the country will be halted, contractors that support FAA will not be paid, construction jobs will be lost, and thousands of FAA employees could be furloughed. In my district in New Jersey, I have the privilege of representing approximately 4,000 FAA employees and contractors who work at the FAA's premier technical center in the Nation. They contribute an extraordinary amount of energy and dedication to making sure that aviation continues to move forward. Without them, the state of aviation in our country would suffer, and we cannot afford them to be at home for failing because we failed to do our work and pass an extension bill. A lapse in the authorization will also result in the halt of certification and registration of new aviation products, greatly disrupting the aviation manufacturing industry and jeopardizing more good paying jobs. The FAA's aircraft registry would close, delaying deliveries of new aircraft. As many as 10,000 aircraft a month could be grounded if registration cannot be renewed. H.R. 3614 will allow us to continue developing a bipartisan, long- term reauthorization bill which will improve, rebuild, and modernize our Nation's safe, yet highly antiquated, aviation system. I urge support of H.R. 3614. I reserve the balance of my time Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I agree with my good friend, the gentleman from New Jersey, that it is essential that we pass H.R. 3614--the Senate passed it expeditiously--and it be signed by the President. We cannot afford even, you know, the thought of a shutdown of the FAA. We have actually gone down that road in the past. Chairman Mica, in July of 2011, put some provisions into an FAA reauthorization that were objectionable to two very powerful Senators, and we actually went through a shutdown. What we lost was $400 million of revenue because the excise tax expired. Now, one airline, to give them credit, did pass the savings through, the excise tax, Alaska Airlines. All the other airlines kept the money, and we lost $400 million from the trust fund. Capital programs ground to a halt. Airport construction ground to a halt, threatening tens of thousands of jobs. Airport inspectors had to work. They were essential employees. They weren't paid, and they couldn't get government vouchers, so they had to use their personal credit cards to purchase tickets to go to work to do their job, which they weren't being paid for. I mean, this was the ultimate of absurdity. I only go into some detail on that because that is relevant to this extension. This is a 6-month extension. That should give us more than ample time to agree upon a long-term FAA authorization. Much work has already been done on major portions of the bill, but some disagreements remain over the future of the air traffic organization. My preference would be to insulate the entire FAA from future vicissitudes of Congress going off the rails with a shutdown and furloughs and provisions that are unacceptable to the Senate that cause a temporary lapse in authorization. You know, we can get there. We are very close now. This year, all but 7 percent of the FAA's budget will be paid for by user fees, excise taxes, and others, so we are quite close. We would like to reform procurement, to streamline it and make it work better at the FAA. When I was a very young Member of Congress, I got to witness the airport air traffic controller's workstation of the future. That was 1987. Well, it is 2015, and they don't have them yet. The FAA is the only agency of government worse at procurement than the Pentagon. Congress has tried to reform it; it didn't stick. We have got to try something different to get it to be more agile to give us the 21st century equipment and software that we need. Then there are issues of the actual sort of shape of the FAA bureaucracy, a little bit like that in the middle. Congress, also back in 1986, gave the FAA license to reform personnel practices to deal with some of that midlevel management bulge and streamline the agency and decisionmaking process, but that didn't take either. So the three problems are the predictability of funding and the agency being able to look into the future without having to worry about shutdowns, furloughs--I don't know how much time they spent over the last couple of weeks getting ready for this shutdown that everyone thought would come this week before Speaker Boehner announced his retirement; that has got to [[Page H6274]] be dealt with--and then also the procurement reform and the personnel. The chairman's solution is to separate only the air traffic organization from the FAA and insulate that from Congress and those sorts of problems and make it, you know, free of the procurement rules and a lot of the personnel rules. I would prefer to do that with the entire agency, because there are functions--we do have the best air traffic control system in the world. We are busier in the U.S. with more planes under instrument flight rules on a daily basis, about 20 percent more on an IFR average, than Canada, U.K., France, and Germany combined. So we know we have a safe system. We move massive amounts of air traffic. We don't want to mess that up. And I understand, but I also don't think we can isolate it from other decisionmakers in the agency and leave them subject to the vicissitudes of Congress. The people who do the certifications, who do the inspections, who do the safety, it seems to me it should all be moved; and I propose a 21st century constitutionally chartered corporation in order to accomplish those goals and make it self-funding, self-sufficient, and not subject to appropriations or shutdowns or anything else that a future Congress might imagine. So that is the hangup. We haven't agreed on that part yet, but I think we can. We share common objectives, and 6 months should be more than ample time. I am hopeful that early this fall the chairman and I can resolve those issues with other members of the committee, and then we can go forward with our colleagues in the Senate and hopefully have, you know, a bill on the President's desk early, early next year, if not by the end of this year, although December promises to be perhaps a bit chaotic around here. {time} 1600 In any case, 6 months should be ample time. I do not anticipate multiple short-term extensions. I don't want them, nor does the chairman, nor do, I believe, any other thoughtful members of the committee. I see the gentleman from New Jersey shaking his head. We couldn't agree more. We have been down that road before, down that runway before. We don't want to go down that runway again. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Larsen). Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the temporary measure to extend the authorization of the FAA today, but I do so with great disappointment. We could be on the floor today to enact a longer term FAA reauthorization bill. In the last 2 years, the Subcommittee on Aviation, led by my colleague from New Jersey, Mr. LoBiondo, has held 16 hearings on a variety of topics. We have heard from stakeholders that there is a long list of things that we need to do to stay competitive with our economic rivals and keep our airspace the safest and most efficient in the world: We need to reform aircraft certification so that manufacturers can get the newest, safest equipment to market. We need to set clear rules for unmanned aerial vehicles and accelerate efforts for their safe use. We need to advance NextGen programs to move air traffic faster and more efficiently. Chairman Shuster, Chairman LoBiondo, Ranking Member DeFazio, and I have achieved a bipartisan agreement on most of these major key issues that we need to address. That bill is ready to go. We didn't hear during these hearings that we needed to privatize air traffic control. Now, some people want to privatize air traffic control. I know that they want to do this in good faith. But we don't need to do it, and it is preventing the things that we need to do from getting done. An entire bipartisan bill is being held up because we can't agree yet on the details of what would be a very complex proposal. I fail to understand why at this juncture such a proposal is necessary, particularly when it prevents significant and much-needed reform from taking place. There is no dispute that today we safely operate the most complex and congested airspace in the world. Last year the Government Accountability Office asked 76 aviation stakeholders whether the FAA is capable of operating an efficient air traffic control system. The overwhelming majority, 64 of those, said the FAA is, in fact, capable of doing so. Privatizing the current system is clearly not a pressing need. It is a want. I wish I could say today I am surprised that we find ourselves here today, but many people have been saying for a long time that this was the situation that we would be facing on September 30. In fact, when we held a hearing on air traffic privatization back in March, I predicted we were headed down this road of multiple short-term reauthorizations. The bipartisan portions of the bill that Chairman Shuster, Chairman LoBiondo, Ranking Member DeFazio, and I have agreed to would have immediate benefits all over the country. In my home State of Washington, it would protect and create American jobs through airport construction and aerospace manufacturing; it would improve aviation safety; it would improve the way the aircraft and parts are certified to get newer and safer technology to market; it would build on the safety improvements that this body has made following the tragic Colgan flight 3407 in 2009; it would improve the regulation and the development of unmanned aerial systems, which continue to proliferate in our airspace. We need a strong regulatory system in place to safely grow the unmanned aircraft industry, and until we act, that system cannot be in place. For every day of this extension, travelers and the aerospace industry will not receive the improvements and protections that we have crafted in the bipartisan portions of the bill that we are close to agreeing on. We will continue to fall behind other countries that are making similar improvements. As many lawmakers and aviation stakeholders recall, the last FAA reauthorization bill came after a period of 5 years and 23 short-term extensions. I had hoped we would avoid serial extensions this time around, but today we start down that path. Yes, it is with disappointment that I am here to support a temporary extension and strongly urge all my colleagues to make sure this is the only temporary extension before enactment of a long-term bill. We have a long list of things that we need to do today to improve our airspace. We should focus on those things instead of the things only that we want to do. Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster), the chairman of the committee. Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, here we are with a short-term extension for 6 months. I believe it is critical that we do this, obviously, as it is about to expire. There are things that not only do we want to do, but we need to do, to make sure that we have the safest airspace in the world. We also need to make sure it is the most efficient airspace in the world. We can do that if we deploy the technology and the things we have been talking about for almost 2 years now to transform the FAA into something that can move quicker, that can deploy the technology that is available to us. When we look around the world, there are over 50 countries that have taken the air traffic control organization out of government and have been able to maintain the highest levels of safety, but deploy technology that makes their airspace more efficient. That is the kind of thing we are looking at. I think we are at a critical time. What we have been talking about is not anything new. It is something that we have been talking about for 20 years. In fact, the Clinton administration had a similar proposal, the Bush administration had a similar proposal, and here we are today talking about it. But I think that we have different groups that are looking positively at this. We are very close to putting something together that, as I said, will transform the air traffic control system while keeping back in government [[Page H6275]] the safety and regulatory oversight to this agency to make sure that we are streamlining the certification process for our aviation industry that is manufacturing everything from Boeings to Gulfstreams, to the avionics, to the parts that go into these flying systems. We have got to maintain our lead in the world. The way we do that is to streamline the certification process. The gentleman from Washington, who has Boeing in his district, agrees with me on that issue. There is a lot more in this that we need to do to move forward. I think, as we get through September and into October, we are going to be able to see the bill that we have put forth that is going to have, I believe, bipartisan support not only from Congress, but around the country, around Washington, D.C., and, as I said, here in the House. In talking to the Senate, I am encouraged by what they have said about what we are looking at proposing. Again, I would encourage all Members to support this 6-month extension to give us the time to get our bill on and off the floor and let the Senate work on it so we can truly do something that is bold, do something that is transformational, and do something that will be very, very positive for aviation, not only travel, but for the manufacturing industry in this country. Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I have requests to speak from Members who aren't here. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, again, I would like to thank Mr. Shuster, Mr. DeFazio, and Mr. Larsen. I urge all my colleagues to support the legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, with passage of H.R. 3614 today, the House will ``kick the can down the road'' on a long-term FAA reauthorization for another six months. I certainly recognize the dire need to keep our airports and air travel system functioning in the face of an expiration of the FAA's authorization in less than 72 hours. However, I'm very disappointed that this bill does not contain any changes to current policy regarding aircraft noise impacts on communities surrounding airports. Over the last several months, constituents throughout my Congressional District have experienced an alarming increase in aircraft noise due to the implementation of new flight paths under the FAA's Next Gen program. The new flight paths have caused certain communities to be hit especially hard by airplane noise, and other rural communities that have never experienced it are now being bombarded by noise.

These important reforms would substantially improve the FAA's process of addressing and avoiding noise impacts. Once again, I wish to express my disappointment that the bill before us today simply reauthorizes the FAA for another six months with none of these important changes included. As the debate over a long-term FAA reauthorization continues, I hope these recommendations will be carefully considered and ultimately included in the final legislation. The ability to get a good night's sleep for thousands of my constituents depends on it. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

gentleman from new jersey (mr. lobiondo) and the gentleman from oregon (mr. defazio) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from new jersey. general leave mr. lobiondo. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on h.r. 3614. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from new jersey? there was no objection. mr. lobiondo. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, on september 30, 2015, the authorization for the federal aviation administration programs and taxes that fund those programs will expire. h.r. 3614 is a clean, 6-month extension of all necessary authorizations through march 31 of 2016. as the chairman of the subcommittee on aviation, i believe it is critical for congress to come together in a bipartisan, long-term faa reauthorization bill. on the aviation subcommittee, chairman shuster and i have had great working partnerships with congressman defazio and congressman larsen. i want to thank congressman defazio and congressman larsen for their bipartisan cooperation in this very important area. without an extension, the faa will not be able to spend funds from the airport and airway trust fund. therefore, airport construction projects across the country will be halted, contractors that support faa will not be paid, construction jobs will be lost, and thousands of faa employees could be furloughed. in my district in new jersey, i have the privilege of representing approximately 4,000 faa employees and contractors who work at the faa's premier technical center in the nation. they contribute an extraordinary amount of energy and dedication to making sure that aviation continues to move forward. without them, the state of aviation in our country would suffer, and we cannot afford them to be at home for failing because we failed to do our work and pass an extension bill. a lapse in the authorization will also result in the halt of certification and registration of new aviation products, greatly disrupting the aviation manufacturing industry and jeopardizing more good paying jobs. the faa's aircraft registry would close, delaying deliveries of new aircraft. as many as 10,000 aircraft a month could be grounded if registration cannot be renewed. h.r. 3614 will allow us to continue developing a bipartisan, long- term reauthorization bill which will improve, rebuild, and modernize our nation's safe, yet highly antiquated, aviation system. i urge support of h.r. 3614. i reserve the balance of my time mr. defazio. i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i agree with my good friend, the gentleman from new jersey, that it is essential that we pass h.r. 3614--the senate passed it expeditiously--and it be signed by the president. we cannot afford even, you know, the thought of a shutdown of the faa. we have actually gone down that road in the past. chairman mica, in july of 2011, put some provisions into an faa reauthorization that were objectionable to two very powerful senators, and we actually went through a shutdown. what we lost was $400 million of revenue because the excise tax expired. now, one airline, to give them credit, did pass the savings through, the excise tax, alaska airlines. all the other airlines kept the money, and we lost $400 million from the trust fund. capital programs ground to a halt. airport construction ground to a halt, threatening tens of thousands of jobs. airport inspectors had to work. they were essential employees. they weren't paid, and they couldn't get government vouchers, so they had to use their personal credit cards to purchase tickets to go to work to do their job, which they weren't being paid for. i mean, this was the ultimate of absurdity. i only go into some detail on that because that is relevant to this extension. this is a 6-month extension. that should give us more than ample time to agree upon a long-term faa authorization. much work has already been done on major portions of the bill, but some disagreements remain over the future of the air traffic organization. my preference would be to insulate the entire faa from future vicissitudes of congress going off the rails with a shutdown and furloughs and provisions that are unacceptable to the senate that cause a temporary lapse in authorization. you know, we can get there. we are very close now. this year, all but 7 percent of the faa's budget will be paid for by user fees, excise taxes, and others, so we are quite close. we would like to reform procurement, to streamline it and make it work better at the faa. when i was a very young member of congress, i got to witness the airport air traffic controller's workstation of the future. that was 1987. well, it is 2015, and they don't have them yet. the faa is the only agency of government worse at procurement than the pentagon. congress has tried to reform it; it didn't stick. we have got to try something different to get it to be more agile to give us the 21st century equipment and software that we need. then there are issues of the actual sort of shape of the faa bureaucracy, a little bit like that in the middle. congress, also back in 1986, gave the faa license to reform personnel practices to deal with some of that midlevel management bulge and streamline the agency and decisionmaking process, but that didn't take either. so the three problems are the predictability of funding and the agency being able to look into the future without having to worry about shutdowns, furloughs--i don't know how much time they spent over the last couple of weeks getting ready for this shutdown that everyone thought would come this week before speaker boehner announced his retirement; that has got to [[page h6274]] be dealt with--and then also the procurement reform and the personnel. the chairman's solution is to separate only the air traffic organization from the faa and insulate that from congress and those sorts of problems and make it, you know, free of the procurement rules and a lot of the personnel rules. i would prefer to do that with the entire agency, because there are functions--we do have the best air traffic control system in the world. we are busier in the u.s. with more planes under instrument flight rules on a daily basis, about 20 percent more on an ifr average, than canada, u.k., france, and germany combined. so we know we have a safe system. we move massive amounts of air traffic. we don't want to mess that up. and i understand, but i also don't think we can isolate it from other decisionmakers in the agency and leave them subject to the vicissitudes of congress. the people who do the certifications, who do the inspections, who do the safety, it seems to me it should all be moved; and i propose a 21st century constitutionally chartered corporation in order to accomplish those goals and make it self-funding, self-sufficient, and not subject to appropriations or shutdowns or anything else that a future congress might imagine. so that is the hangup. we haven't agreed on that part yet, but i think we can. we share common objectives, and 6 months should be more than ample time. i am hopeful that early this fall the chairman and i can resolve those issues with other members of the committee, and then we can go forward with our colleagues in the senate and hopefully have, you know, a bill on the president's desk early, early next year, if not by the end of this year, although december promises to be perhaps a bit chaotic around here. {time} 1600 in any case, 6 months should be ample time. i do not anticipate multiple short-term extensions. i don't want them, nor does the chairman, nor do, i believe, any other thoughtful members of the committee. i see the gentleman from new jersey shaking his head. we couldn't agree more. we have been down that road before, down that runway before. we don't want to go down that runway again. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. lobiondo. mr. speaker, i continue to reserve the balance of my time. mr. defazio. mr. speaker, i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from washington (mr. larsen). mr. larsen of washington. mr. speaker, i rise in support of the temporary measure to extend the authorization of the faa today, but i do so with great disappointment. we could be on the floor today to enact a longer term faa reauthorization bill. in the last 2 years, the subcommittee on aviation, led by my colleague from new jersey, mr. lobiondo, has held 16 hearings on a variety of topics. we have heard from stakeholders that there is a long list of things that we need to do to stay competitive with our economic rivals and keep our airspace the safest and most efficient in the world: we need to reform aircraft certification so that manufacturers can get the newest, safest equipment to market. we need to set clear rules for unmanned aerial vehicles and accelerate efforts for their safe use. we need to advance nextgen programs to move air traffic faster and more efficiently. chairman shuster, chairman lobiondo, ranking member defazio, and i have achieved a bipartisan agreement on most of these major key issues that we need to address. that bill is ready to go. we didn't hear during these hearings that we needed to privatize air traffic control. now, some people want to privatize air traffic control. i know that they want to do this in good faith. but we don't need to do it, and it is preventing the things that we need to do from getting done. an entire bipartisan bill is being held up because we can't agree yet on the details of what would be a very complex proposal. i fail to understand why at this juncture such a proposal is necessary, particularly when it prevents significant and much-needed reform from taking place. there is no dispute that today we safely operate the most complex and congested airspace in the world. last year the government accountability office asked 76 aviation stakeholders whether the faa is capable of operating an efficient air traffic control system. the overwhelming majority, 64 of those, said the faa is, in fact, capable of doing so. privatizing the current system is clearly not a pressing need. it is a want. i wish i could say today i am surprised that we find ourselves here today, but many people have been saying for a long time that this was the situation that we would be facing on september 30. in fact, when we held a hearing on air traffic privatization back in march, i predicted we were headed down this road of multiple short-term reauthorizations. the bipartisan portions of the bill that chairman shuster, chairman lobiondo, ranking member defazio, and i have agreed to would have immediate benefits all over the country. in my home state of washington, it would protect and create american jobs through airport construction and aerospace manufacturing; it would improve aviation safety; it would improve the way the aircraft and parts are certified to get newer and safer technology to market; it would build on the safety improvements that this body has made following the tragic colgan flight 3407 in 2009; it would improve the regulation and the development of unmanned aerial systems, which continue to proliferate in our airspace. we need a strong regulatory system in place to safely grow the unmanned aircraft industry, and until we act, that system cannot be in place. for every day of this extension, travelers and the aerospace industry will not receive the improvements and protections that we have crafted in the bipartisan portions of the bill that we are close to agreeing on. we will continue to fall behind other countries that are making similar improvements. as many lawmakers and aviation stakeholders recall, the last faa reauthorization bill came after a period of 5 years and 23 short-term extensions. i had hoped we would avoid serial extensions this time around, but today we start down that path. yes, it is with disappointment that i am here to support a temporary extension and strongly urge all my colleagues to make sure this is the only temporary extension before enactment of a long-term bill. we have a long list of things that we need to do today to improve our airspace. we should focus on those things instead of the things only that we want to do. mr. lobiondo. mr. speaker, i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. shuster), the chairman of the committee. mr. shuster. mr. speaker, here we are with a short-term extension for 6 months. i believe it is critical that we do this, obviously, as it is about to expire. there are things that not only do we want to do, but we need to do, to make sure that we have the safest airspace in the world. we also need to make sure it is the most efficient airspace in the world. we can do that if we deploy the technology and the things we have been talking about for almost 2 years now to transform the faa into something that can move quicker, that can deploy the technology that is available to us. when we look around the world, there are over 50 countries that have taken the air traffic control organization out of government and have been able to maintain the highest levels of safety, but deploy technology that makes their airspace more efficient. that is the kind of thing we are looking at. i think we are at a critical time. what we have been talking about is not anything new. it is something that we have been talking about for 20 years. in fact, the clinton administration had a similar proposal, the bush administration had a similar proposal, and here we are today talking about it. but i think that we have different groups that are looking positively at this. we are very close to putting something together that, as i said, will transform the air traffic control system while keeping back in government [[page h6275]] the safety and regulatory oversight to this agency to make sure that we are streamlining the certification process for our aviation industry that is manufacturing everything from boeings to gulfstreams, to the avionics, to the parts that go into these flying systems. we have got to maintain our lead in the world. the way we do that is to streamline the certification process. the gentleman from washington, who has boeing in his district, agrees with me on that issue. there is a lot more in this that we need to do to move forward. i think, as we get through september and into october, we are going to be able to see the bill that we have put forth that is going to have, i believe, bipartisan support not only from congress, but around the country, around washington, d.c., and, as i said, here in the house. in talking to the senate, i am encouraged by what they have said about what we are looking at proposing. again, i would encourage all members to support this 6-month extension to give us the time to get our bill on and off the floor and let the senate work on it so we can truly do something that is bold, do something that is transformational, and do something that will be very, very positive for aviation, not only travel, but for the manufacturing industry in this country. mr. defazio. mr. speaker, i have requests to speak from members who aren't here. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. lobiondo. mr. speaker, again, i would like to thank mr. shuster, mr. defazio, and mr. larsen. i urge all my colleagues to support the legislation. i yield back the balance of my time. ms. eshoo. mr. speaker, with passage of h.r. 3614 today, the house will ``kick the can down the road'' on a long-term faa reauthorization for another six months. i certainly recognize the dire need to keep our airports and air travel system functioning in the face of an expiration of the faa's authorization in less than 72 hours. however, i'm very disappointed that this bill does not contain any changes to current policy regarding aircraft noise impacts on communities surrounding airports. over the last several months, constituents throughout my congressional district have experienced an alarming increase in aircraft noise due to the implementation of new flight paths under the faa's next gen program. the new flight paths have caused certain communities to be hit especially hard by airplane noise, and other rural communities that have never experienced it are now being bombarded by noise. many of these communities received little or no advance notice or opportunity to comment on the flight path changes before they were implemented, and they were blindsided when the changes went into effect earlier this year. in july, i joined the congressional quiet skies caucus so that together we could make recommendations for the transportation committee to include in an faa reauthorization bill. these recommendations include: ensuring that faa completes a robust community engagement process before flight paths are changed; requiring the faa to use a new method of measuring noise that captures the true levels of noise on the ground; removing the categorical exclusion from full environmental reviews for flight path changes; and mandating independent research on the health impacts of aviation noise. these important reforms would substantially improve the faa's process of addressing and avoiding noise impacts. once again, i wish to express my disappointment that the bill before us today simply reauthorizes the faa for another six months with none of these important changes included. as the debate over a long-term faa reauthorization continues, i hope these recommendations will be carefully considered and ultimately included in the final legislation. the ability to get a good night's sleep for thousands of my constituents depends on it. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from new jersey (mr. lobiondo) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 3614. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",26701
CREC-2015-09-28-pt1-PgH6275,CREC-2015-09-28,114,EQUITABLE ACCESS TO CARE AND HEALTH ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6275-H6276] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EQUITABLE ACCESS TO CARE AND HEALTH ACT Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2061) to amend section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide an additional religious exemption from the individual health coverage mandate, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 2061 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Equitable Access to Care and Health Act'' or the ``EACH Act''. SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION FROM HEALTH COVERAGE RESPONSIBILITY REQUIREMENT. (a) In General.--Section 5000A(d)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to read as follows: ``(A) Religious conscience exemptions.-- ``(i) In general.--Such term shall not include any individual for any month if such individual has in effect an exemption under section 1311(d)(4)(H) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which certifies that-- ``(I) such individual is a member of a recognized religious sect or division thereof which is described in section 1402(g)(1), and is adherent of established tenets or teachings of such sect or division as described in such section, or ``(II) such individual is a member of a religious sect or division thereof which is not described in section 1402(g)(1), who relies solely on a religious method of healing, and for whom the acceptance of medical health services would be inconsistent with the religious beliefs of the individual. ``(ii) Special rules.-- ``(I) Medical health services defined.--For purposes of this subparagraph, the term `medical health services' does not include routine dental, vision, and hearing services, midwifery services, vaccinations, necessary medical services provided to children, services required by law or by a third party, and such other services as the Secretary of Health and Human Services may provide in implementing section 1311(d)(4)(H) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. ``(II) Attestation required.--Clause (i)(II) shall apply to an individual for months in a taxable year only if the information provided by the individual under section 1411(b)(5)(A) of such Act includes an attestation that the individual has not received medical health services during the preceding taxable year.''. (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2013. (c) Construction.--Nothing in the amendment made by subsection (a) shall preempt any State law requiring the provision of medical treatment for children, especially those who are seriously ill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin. General Leave Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 2061 currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Wisconsin? There was no objection. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise to speak in favor of the EACH Act. This bill would expand the religious liberty exemption to the individual mandate. Right now the exemption is minuscule. To qualify, you have to believe as a matter of faith in giving up any private or public insurance, including Social Security. That includes the Amish, the Order of Mennonites, and that is about it. That is way too strict. Let's remember the reason for this mandate in the first place. The other side said that, if you get sick and you don't have insurance, the rest of us will have to pay for your health care. Well, we are talking about people who do not use health care. So why should they have to be forced to buy insurance for health care that they don't use? I don't think we should force anybody to buy health insurance against their will, for that matter, but I think it is especially wrong to force people to buy insurance against their faith. This bill simply says: If you, as a matter of faith, don't use health care, then you are exempt from the individual mandate. I am glad we are working on this long overdue change today. I would note that this came out of committee on a voice vote. I encourage Members to support it. [[Page H6276]] Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The current religious exemption from ACA mirrors other religious exemptions used in the Internal Revenue Code. The EACH Act provides that anyone who ``is a member of a religious sect that relies solely on religious methods of healing and for whom medical care is inconsistent with religious beliefs'' can claim a religious exemption from the individual mandate requirement. As a step to maintain a narrowly defined religious exemption and meet concerns, this legislation is written more precisely than the previous bill that passed unanimously in this House. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), the author of the EACH Act. Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Ryan for his leadership on this issue. I really appreciate the Committee on Ways and Means allowing me, a noncommittee member, to be able to take this important piece of legislation to the floor today. Today this Congress has an opportunity to work in a bipartisan way to promote religious liberty and, frankly, Mr. Speaker, fairness. H.R. 2061, the EACH Act, does this by modestly expanding the religious conscience exemption under the Affordable Care Act to include individuals like Christian Scientists, who rely solely on religious methods of healing. The existing religious conscience exemption under the Affordable Care Act exclusively applies, as Chairman Ryan said, to a few certain sects of faith. As a result, many Americans--as I mentioned before, the Christian Scientists--are required to purchase medical health insurance that does not cover the health care of their religious practice or choice. Alternatively, they are forced to pay tax penalties for not purchasing such insurance. A similar version of the EACH Act passed this House unanimously under the suspension of the rules during the last Congress. In order to improve the bill, as Mr. Levin, my colleague stated, modest changes to this bill's language were made, with input from the Department of Treasury, the Department of Health and Human Services, and other key stakeholders. Under this bill's new language, applicants must annually attest to the exchange that they are a member of a religious group, that they rely solely on a religious method of healing, and that they have not received medical health services during the preceding taxable year. Additionally, with the help of input from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the bill now makes it clear that the legislation does not preempt any State laws requiring the provision of medical treatment for children. Further, if a parent needs to provide necessary medical services to a child, doing so would not invalidate the individual's exemption. The EACH Act is truly an example of bipartisan legislation with input from stakeholders to make it better. As of today, it has more than 100 Republican and more than 60 Democratic cosponsors. I am particularly proud to have worked with my friend and colleague, Mr. Keating, on moving this legislation forward. He knows this issue well. His home State of Massachusetts established a similar religious conscience exemption in State law, and it is working just as planned. Mr. Speaker, I also represent Principia College in Elsah, Illinois. It is a college for Christian Scientists. I am proud to stand up and promote their religious liberty and that of many others in this great Nation. I urge a ``yes'' vote. {time} 1615 Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2061) to amend section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide an additional religious exemption from the individual health coverage mandate, and for other purposes, as amended.

This Act may be cited as the ``Equitable Access to Care and Health Act'' or the ``EACH Act''. SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION FROM HEALTH COVERAGE RESPONSIBILITY REQUIREMENT. (a) In General.--Section 5000A(d)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to read as follows: ``(A) Religious conscience exemptions.-- ``(i) In general.--Such term shall not include any individual for any month if such individual has in effect an exemption under section 1311(d)(4)(H) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which certifies that-- ``(I) such individual is a member of a recognized religious sect or division thereof which is described in section 1402(g)(1), and is adherent of established tenets or teachings of such sect or division as described in such section, or ``(II) such individual is a member of a religious sect or division thereof which is not described in section 1402(g)(1), who relies solely on a religious method of healing, and for whom the acceptance of medical health services would be inconsistent with the religious beliefs of the individual. ``(ii) Special rules.-- ``(I) Medical health services defined.--For purposes of this subparagraph, the term `medical health services' does not include routine dental, vision, and hearing services, midwifery services, vaccinations, necessary medical services provided to children, services required by law or by a third party, and such other services as the Secretary of Health and Human Services may provide in implementing section 1311(d)(4)(H) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. ``(II) Attestation required.--Clause (i)(II) shall apply to an individual for months in a taxable year only if the information provided by the individual under section 1411(b)(5)(A) of such Act includes an attestation that the individual has not received medical health services during the preceding taxable year.''.

To qualify, you have to believe as a matter of faith in giving up any private or public insurance, including Social Security. That includes the Amish, the Order of Mennonites, and that is about it. That is way too strict. Let's remember the reason for this mandate in the first place. The other side said that, if you get sick and you don't have insurance, the rest of us will have to pay for your health care. Well, we are talking about people who do not use health care. So why should they have to be forced to buy insurance for health care that they don't use? I don't think we should force anybody to buy health insurance against their will, for that matter, but I think it is especially wrong to force people to buy insurance against their faith. This bill simply says: If you, as a matter of faith, don't use health care, then you are exempt from the individual mandate. I am glad we are working on this long overdue change today.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 139) to permanently allow an exclusion under the Supplemental Security Income program and the Medicaid program for compensation provided to individuals who participate in clinical trials for rare diseases or conditions. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: S. 139 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. ELIMINATION OF SUNSET PROVISION. Effective as if included in the enactment of the Improving Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-255, 124 Stat. 2640), section 3 of that Act is amended by striking subsection (e). The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin. General Leave Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on S. 139, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Wisconsin? There was no objection. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of S. 139, the Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act. The National Institutes of Health says that there are 7,000 rare diseases affecting people in the United States, and if we are going to find cures for those diseases, the first thing we need to do is to get people to participate in clinical trials. All too often, researchers cannot find enough participants because so few people have these diseases in the first place. Now--no surprise here--the government used to make it more difficult for researchers to find people. Say you had a rare disease and you were on public assistance, like SSI or Medicaid. If you got compensated for participating in one of these trials, you got smaller benefits. That is why, in 2010, we passed the Improving Access to Clinical Trials Act. For the past 5 years, this law has allowed people to collect up to $2,000 per year by participating in rare-disease clinical trials without threat of losing their SSI or Medicaid benefits. The GAO says the law is working. Ever since we passed this law, more people on SSI have been participating in clinical trials as a result of it. The problem is this law expires next week, on October 5, so this bill would simply extend current law. That way, more people can participate in clinical trials without any reason to worry or without any threat to a loss of their benefits, and that way, we will continue to make strides in fighting these diseases. CBO tells us this bill will cost virtually nothing. My friends, Senator Hatch and Senator Wyden, introduced this bill in the Senate. It passed the Senate by unanimous consent. In the House, my colleagues Mr. Doggett and Mr. Marino from Pennsylvania have introduced it along with 50 other cosponsors. I will include in the Record a letter listing the many supporters of this legislation. It is a list of over 70 organizations, including the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the Muscular Dystrophy Association, and the Huntington's Disease Society of America, just to name a few. [[Page H6277]] September 22, 2015. Hon. Paul D. Ryan, Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. Sander M. Levin, Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. Charles Boustany, Jr., Chairman, Subcommittee on Human Resources, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. Lloyd Doggett, Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Human Resources, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Chairmen Ryan and Boustany and Ranking Members Levin and Doggett: The undersigned organizations, representing millions of Americans with rare and genetic diseases, advocates, industry, and academic institutions, write to express strong support for H.R. 209/S. 139, the Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2015. This legislation will permanently remove a barrier to clinical research and allow Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid recipients to participate in and benefit from clinical trials without fear of losing vital benefits. The Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2015 eliminates the sunset clause from the Improving Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2009 (IACT), legislation signed into law in 2010, making the IACT a permanent law. This will allow patients with rare diseases to continue to receive up to $2,000 in compensation for participating in clinical trials without that compensation counting towards their income eligibility limits for SSI and Medicaid. Removing barriers to drug trial participation is particularly important as recent advances in medical research and technology allow for the development of new and promising medications. Securing an adequate number of clinical trial participants is vital for therapies that treat rare conditions, but rare disease researchers in particular often have difficulty recruiting drug trial participants, simply because they have a smaller pool of patients. Further, with the advent of precision medicine, therapies are being customized to treat a patient's specific genetic makeup. These types of trials often require clinical trial participants bearing specific genetic mutations, which necessarily creates an even more complex and exclusive clinical trial recruitment process. Ensuring that all patients with rare diseases are able to participate in clinical trials can help open the door for the advancement of new targeted therapies in many important areas of medicine, including cancer and rare diseases like cystic fibrosis. Now is the time to ensure that all patients have access to clinical trials for potentially life-saving treatments. We look forward to working with you to secure passage of this bill to enable Social Security beneficiaries to participate in clinical trials so that research into life-saving treatments may continue to advance.

This is common sense, and I urge my colleagues to adopt this. There is one more point I would like to make. Nick Gwyn, the minority staff director of the Human Resources Subcommittee on Ways and Means, is retiring. I would like to take a minute to recognize Nick Gwyn for his work on this issue. He is leaving the staff of Ways and Means after serving on the committee since 1998. This should be the last of many bills that he has helped our colleagues manage on the floor. During his time staffing the committee, Nick has worked on numerous laws related to welfare, disability, and unemployment policy. He also worked closely with our staff to create bipartisan child welfare laws that found more loving families for children in need. We wish Nick well in the next stage of his career, and we thank him for his service to the committee, the House, and the country. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I also wanted to honor Mr. Gwyn, and this is a good opportunity for us to do that. I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin), the ranking Democrat on the committee. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Doggett and I will say a few words, when many, many are in order. Nick Gwyn has been, as our chairman said, a more than valuable member of this staff and a more than dedicated member of this staff. He has been invaluable. His dedication has been endless. Nick is leaving to pursue family and other needs. He knows he is going to leave us in need, in terms of his immense talents. His dedication to the subject matter that is, by definition, so directly involved with people is really beyond estimation. The subcommittee's work deals, as I said, with the everyday challenges that so many of the citizens in this country face day in and day out. It was only a few days ago that we heard from Pope Francis how important it is for this institution to focus on the individual needs of people, including those who are poor, some with handicaps, but everybody who is in need of a hand up, really, as much, if not more than, a helping hand. And Nick has devoted over a dozen years to this very purpose. So, if I might say so, we have worked together with Nick, and we just want to thank him for more than a job well done. We have been very proud to serve with him. Mr. DOGGETT. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I will just add, Nick, that I know you have spent some 25 years here on the [[Page H6278]] Hill, 17 with our committee. Though I benefited from your good counsel before becoming the ranking Democrat on the Human Resources Subcommittee, I particularly appreciated your good counsel during the last 3 years, whether it was working on child abuse and our successful work with former Chair Dave Camp and getting a national commission or dealing with problems of the unemployed. Just overall, the jurisdiction of our subcommittee is about children, children in need. Whether they are under this SSI program or child abuse or child care, they are children who should be able to rely on the Temporary Assistance for Needy Family program for their needs. Nick has been an able advocate for children and someone who did work well, as Chairman Ryan said, with all members of our committee to advance these purposes. We wish him well in his new endeavors, and we thank him for his service. Mr. Speaker, if I might talk just a little bit about the Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act, it is about getting new treatments quickly into the lives of patients that are suffering from dread diseases across America, reauthorizing existing law. Senator Ron Wyden led this effort successfully in the Senate with Senator Hatch. And here, my colleagues, Mr. Marino and Mr. Jim McGovern, co-chairs of the Cystic Fibrosis Caucus, joined with me in the introduction of this legislation in the House. The National Organization for Rare Disorders, and over 75 other organizations, has been a strong supporter of this legislation, and I thank them for their work on behalf of the legislation. This bill makes permanent a law that is due to expire that will allow for individuals with certain debilitating conditions to exempt a small amount of their income gained from participating in medical trials from Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, and for Medicaid eligibility determination. This exemption removes an important barrier to participating in clinical trials. If it is allowed to expire, patients contributing to vital research could face the difficult decision of either dropping out of the trials altogether or losing their benefits. If you have ever met with someone with cystic fibrosis or someone in your family has it, you recognize how small the daily challenges that you face are compared to theirs. I think of Nicole Flores in Austin, who has two children battling with rare diseases. She explained that patients shouldn't have to worry about losing assistance when they are just working hard to stay alive. Over the past several months, I have heard from a number of families affected by rare diseases. These are parents who shared with me how far-reaching the modest relief this bill provides can provide for a number of people. One couple recently sent me a picture of their 15-year-old son Mac Rung, who was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis at birth. Every morning and every evening, Mac undergoes chest therapy in order to clear his lungs and to avoid serious damage to help him get through the day. He takes medications with every meal to help him absorb his food and gain weight. He is battling a disease that many Americans have never heard of at an age where he shouldn't have to worry about anything other than school. And because this disease is progressive, they are really working against the clock. Because of the approval of two new drugs, they told me that they never have had as much hope for Mac and his future as they do today. And while they are not a family that themselves rely on the bill that we have today before us, as Chairman Ryan indicated, they, and anyone with these rare diseases, stand to benefit if we have widespread participation in clinical trials on the approval of other new promising drugs like the ones that are already helping Mac. Financially penalizing vulnerable people for participating in research does nothing to advance that research. The National Institutes of Health--NIH, as we know it--estimates that 25 million Americans are suffering because of rare disease. I hope now that today, the House will join the Senate in approving the Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act and that we continue this important effort to support patients across the country. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello). Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 209, the Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act, legislation that I have cosponsored. We must continue to ensure barriers do not stall patients from participating in rare disease clinical trials. This bill will continue to encourage rare disease patients, even those receiving Social Security Income or Medicaid benefits, to participate in clinical trials without jeopardizing their eligibility for those benefits. All patients should have access to these important and often lifesaving trials that will advance medical research and work towards improving their health. The Senate has taken the important step to pass this legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to advance this commonsense, bipartisan initiative and send it to the President's desk for his signature. I thank the chairman and all those involved in the House for their work on this. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Ryan as well as Chairman Upton and Ranking Member Frank Pallone, who marked up this bill, and urge bipartisan approval of it. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I also urge our colleagues to support this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support S. 139, the Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2015. This bill will ensure current Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid recipients can maintain those benefits while participating in clinical trials. Keeping their benefits will help them, but as a doctor I know that their participation in such trials stands to benefit countless others as well who suffer from rare conditions, both in the U.S. and abroad. We should ensure that public policy encourages that whenever we can, and that's what this bill does. Under current law, the Social Security Administration excludes up to $2,000 annually in compensation received by individuals participating in rare disease clinical trials when determining their SSI and Medicaid eligibility and benefits. But this provision, put in place by bipartisan legislation in 2010, is set to expire on October 5, 2015. After that date, all payments for participating in such clinical trials would be counted as income for SSI and Medicaid recipients, reducing or even ending their eligibility for those benefits. A number of people with rare diseases like Cystic Fibrosis receive SSI benefits. If this policy is not made permanent, an individual participating in a clinical trial for a new treatment for Cystic Fibrosis could see a reduction or even the complete elimination of those important benefits. The reality is, most simply won't take that risk, and will avoid participating in such trials. As GAO found in a 2014 report, ``some stakeholders noted that compensation decreased participation in clinical trials in the past because individuals were concerned about its impact on their SSI eligibility and benefits.'' On the other hand, ``financial incentives to participate in clinical trials have generally been found to encourage participation in trials. This is likely because of the time, inconvenience, and expense that may be involved.'' Ultimately, not continuing this policy could actually prevent clinical trials from occurring, since it would restrict the already small number of people able to participate in the trial in the first place. That's why the passage of S. 139 is so important, as it will remove the sunset date for current law--October 5, 2015. Failing to do so would force individuals to once again choose between maintaining their current health and disability benefits and the chance to participate in a clinical trial that could improve or even cure their condition, as well as help others like them in the future. This bill is simple and consistent with current SSI program exemptions. S. 139 strikes the October 5, 2015 sunset date on current policy, permitting SSI and Medicaid recipients with rare diseases to participate in such trials that help to advance research into finding cures. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that S. 139 will result in insignificant costs to the Federal government over the next 10 years, meaning no offset for this legislation is required. But its true value to people with rare diseases--and those who in the future might benefit by their participation in clinical trials permitted under this legislation--could be enormous. Let's pass this important legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by [[Page H6279]] the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 139. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6276-H6279] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ENSURING ACCESS TO CLINICAL TRIALS ACT OF 2015 Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 139) to permanently allow an exclusion under the Supplemental Security Income program and the Medicaid program for compensation provided to individuals who participate in clinical trials for rare diseases or conditions. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: S. 139 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2015''. SEC. 2. ELIMINATION OF SUNSET PROVISION. Effective as if included in the enactment of the Improving Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-255, 124 Stat. 2640), section 3 of that Act is amended by striking subsection (e). The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin. General Leave Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on S. 139, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Wisconsin? There was no objection. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of S. 139, the Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act. The National Institutes of Health says that there are 7,000 rare diseases affecting people in the United States, and if we are going to find cures for those diseases, the first thing we need to do is to get people to participate in clinical trials. All too often, researchers cannot find enough participants because so few people have these diseases in the first place. Now--no surprise here--the government used to make it more difficult for researchers to find people. Say you had a rare disease and you were on public assistance, like SSI or Medicaid. If you got compensated for participating in one of these trials, you got smaller benefits. That is why, in 2010, we passed the Improving Access to Clinical Trials Act. For the past 5 years, this law has allowed people to collect up to $2,000 per year by participating in rare-disease clinical trials without threat of losing their SSI or Medicaid benefits. The GAO says the law is working. Ever since we passed this law, more people on SSI have been participating in clinical trials as a result of it. The problem is this law expires next week, on October 5, so this bill would simply extend current law. That way, more people can participate in clinical trials without any reason to worry or without any threat to a loss of their benefits, and that way, we will continue to make strides in fighting these diseases. CBO tells us this bill will cost virtually nothing. My friends, Senator Hatch and Senator Wyden, introduced this bill in the Senate. It passed the Senate by unanimous consent. In the House, my colleagues Mr. Doggett and Mr. Marino from Pennsylvania have introduced it along with 50 other cosponsors. I will include in the Record a letter listing the many supporters of this legislation. It is a list of over 70 organizations, including the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the Muscular Dystrophy Association, and the Huntington's Disease Society of America, just to name a few. [[Page H6277]] September 22, 2015. Hon. Paul D. Ryan, Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. Sander M. Levin, Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. Charles Boustany, Jr., Chairman, Subcommittee on Human Resources, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. Lloyd Doggett, Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Human Resources, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Chairmen Ryan and Boustany and Ranking Members Levin and Doggett: The undersigned organizations, representing millions of Americans with rare and genetic diseases, advocates, industry, and academic institutions, write to express strong support for H.R. 209/S. 139, the Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2015. This legislation will permanently remove a barrier to clinical research and allow Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid recipients to participate in and benefit from clinical trials without fear of losing vital benefits. The Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2015 eliminates the sunset clause from the Improving Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2009 (IACT), legislation signed into law in 2010, making the IACT a permanent law. This will allow patients with rare diseases to continue to receive up to $2,000 in compensation for participating in clinical trials without that compensation counting towards their income eligibility limits for SSI and Medicaid. Removing barriers to drug trial participation is particularly important as recent advances in medical research and technology allow for the development of new and promising medications. Securing an adequate number of clinical trial participants is vital for therapies that treat rare conditions, but rare disease researchers in particular often have difficulty recruiting drug trial participants, simply because they have a smaller pool of patients. Further, with the advent of precision medicine, therapies are being customized to treat a patient's specific genetic makeup. These types of trials often require clinical trial participants bearing specific genetic mutations, which necessarily creates an even more complex and exclusive clinical trial recruitment process. Ensuring that all patients with rare diseases are able to participate in clinical trials can help open the door for the advancement of new targeted therapies in many important areas of medicine, including cancer and rare diseases like cystic fibrosis. Now is the time to ensure that all patients have access to clinical trials for potentially life-saving treatments. We look forward to working with you to secure passage of this bill to enable Social Security beneficiaries to participate in clinical trials so that research into life-saving treatments may continue to advance.

Effective as if included in the enactment of the Improving Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-255, 124 Stat. 2640), section 3 of that Act is amended by striking subsection (e). The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin. General Leave Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on S. 139, currently under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Wisconsin? There was no objection. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of S. 139, the Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act. The National Institutes of Health says that there are 7,000 rare diseases affecting people in the United States, and if we are going to find cures for those diseases, the first thing we need to do is to get people to participate in clinical trials. All too often, researchers cannot find enough participants because so few people have these diseases in the first place. Now--no surprise here--the government used to make it more difficult for researchers to find people. Say you had a rare disease and you were on public assistance, like SSI or Medicaid. If you got compensated for participating in one of these trials, you got smaller benefits. That is why, in 2010, we passed the Improving Access to Clinical Trials Act. For the past 5 years, this law has allowed people to collect up to $2,000 per year by participating in rare-disease clinical trials without threat of losing their SSI or Medicaid benefits. The GAO says the law is working. Ever since we passed this law, more people on SSI have been participating in clinical trials as a result of it. The problem is this law expires next week, on October 5, so this bill would simply extend current law. That way, more people can participate in clinical trials without any reason to worry or without any threat to a loss of their benefits, and that way, we will continue to make strides in fighting these diseases. CBO tells us this bill will cost virtually nothing. My friends, Senator Hatch and Senator Wyden, introduced this bill in the Senate. It passed the Senate by unanimous consent. In the House, my colleagues Mr. Doggett and Mr. Marino from Pennsylvania have introduced it along with 50 other cosponsors. I will include in the Record a letter listing the many supporters of this legislation. It is a list of over 70 organizations, including the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the Muscular Dystrophy Association, and the Huntington's Disease Society of America, just to name a few. [[Page H6277]] September 22, 2015. Hon. Paul D. Ryan, Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. Sander M. Levin, Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. Charles Boustany, Jr., Chairman, Subcommittee on Human Resources, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Hon. Lloyd Doggett, Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Human Resources, Committee on Ways and Means, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Chairmen Ryan and Boustany and Ranking Members Levin and Doggett: The undersigned organizations, representing millions of Americans with rare and genetic diseases, advocates, industry, and academic institutions, write to express strong support for H.R. 209/S. 139, the Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2015. This legislation will permanently remove a barrier to clinical research and allow Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid recipients to participate in and benefit from clinical trials without fear of losing vital benefits. The Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2015 eliminates the sunset clause from the Improving Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2009 (IACT), legislation signed into law in 2010, making the IACT a permanent law. This will allow patients with rare diseases to continue to receive up to $2,000 in compensation for participating in clinical trials without that compensation counting towards their income eligibility limits for SSI and Medicaid. Removing barriers to drug trial participation is particularly important as recent advances in medical research and technology allow for the development of new and promising medications. Securing an adequate number of clinical trial participants is vital for therapies that treat rare conditions, but rare disease researchers in particular often have difficulty recruiting drug trial participants, simply because they have a smaller pool of patients. Further, with the advent of precision medicine, therapies are being customized to treat a patient's specific genetic makeup. These types of trials often require clinical trial participants bearing specific genetic mutations, which necessarily creates an even more complex and exclusive clinical trial recruitment process. Ensuring that all patients with rare diseases are able to participate in clinical trials can help open the door for the advancement of new targeted therapies in many important areas of medicine, including cancer and rare diseases like cystic fibrosis. Now is the time to ensure that all patients have access to clinical trials for potentially life-saving treatments. We look forward to working with you to secure passage of this bill to enable Social Security beneficiaries to participate in clinical trials so that research into life-saving treatments may continue to advance.

This is common sense, and I urge my colleagues to adopt this. There is one more point I would like to make. Nick Gwyn, the minority staff director of the Human Resources Subcommittee on Ways and Means, is retiring. I would like to take a minute to recognize Nick Gwyn for his work on this issue. He is leaving the staff of Ways and Means after serving on the committee since 1998. This should be the last of many bills that he has helped our colleagues manage on the floor. During his time staffing the committee, Nick has worked on numerous laws related to welfare, disability, and unemployment policy. He also worked closely with our staff to create bipartisan child welfare laws that found more loving families for children in need. We wish Nick well in the next stage of his career, and we thank him for his service to the committee, the House, and the country. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I also wanted to honor Mr. Gwyn, and this is a good opportunity for us to do that. I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin), the ranking Democrat on the committee. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Doggett and I will say a few words, when many, many are in order. Nick Gwyn has been, as our chairman said, a more than valuable member of this staff and a more than dedicated member of this staff. He has been invaluable. His dedication has been endless. Nick is leaving to pursue family and other needs. He knows he is going to leave us in need, in terms of his immense talents. His dedication to the subject matter that is, by definition, so directly involved with people is really beyond estimation. The subcommittee's work deals, as I said, with the everyday challenges that so many of the citizens in this country face day in and day out. It was only a few days ago that we heard from Pope Francis how important it is for this institution to focus on the individual needs of people, including those who are poor, some with handicaps, but everybody who is in need of a hand up, really, as much, if not more than, a helping hand. And Nick has devoted over a dozen years to this very purpose. So, if I might say so, we have worked together with Nick, and we just want to thank him for more than a job well done. We have been very proud to serve with him. Mr. DOGGETT. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I will just add, Nick, that I know you have spent some 25 years here on the [[Page H6278]] Hill, 17 with our committee. Though I benefited from your good counsel before becoming the ranking Democrat on the Human Resources Subcommittee, I particularly appreciated your good counsel during the last 3 years, whether it was working on child abuse and our successful work with former Chair Dave Camp and getting a national commission or dealing with problems of the unemployed. Just overall, the jurisdiction of our subcommittee is about children, children in need. Whether they are under this SSI program or child abuse or child care, they are children who should be able to rely on the Temporary Assistance for Needy Family program for their needs. Nick has been an able advocate for children and someone who did work well, as Chairman Ryan said, with all members of our committee to advance these purposes. We wish him well in his new endeavors, and we thank him for his service. Mr. Speaker, if I might talk just a little bit about the Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act, it is about getting new treatments quickly into the lives of patients that are suffering from dread diseases across America, reauthorizing existing law. Senator Ron Wyden led this effort successfully in the Senate with Senator Hatch. And here, my colleagues, Mr. Marino and Mr. Jim McGovern, co-chairs of the Cystic Fibrosis Caucus, joined with me in the introduction of this legislation in the House. The National Organization for Rare Disorders, and over 75 other organizations, has been a strong supporter of this legislation, and I thank them for their work on behalf of the legislation. This bill makes permanent a law that is due to expire that will allow for individuals with certain debilitating conditions to exempt a small amount of their income gained from participating in medical trials from Supplemental Security Income, or SSI, and for Medicaid eligibility determination. This exemption removes an important barrier to participating in clinical trials. If it is allowed to expire, patients contributing to vital research could face the difficult decision of either dropping out of the trials altogether or losing their benefits. If you have ever met with someone with cystic fibrosis or someone in your family has it, you recognize how small the daily challenges that you face are compared to theirs. I think of Nicole Flores in Austin, who has two children battling with rare diseases. She explained that patients shouldn't have to worry about losing assistance when they are just working hard to stay alive. Over the past several months, I have heard from a number of families affected by rare diseases. These are parents who shared with me how far-reaching the modest relief this bill provides can provide for a number of people. One couple recently sent me a picture of their 15-year-old son Mac Rung, who was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis at birth. Every morning and every evening, Mac undergoes chest therapy in order to clear his lungs and to avoid serious damage to help him get through the day. He takes medications with every meal to help him absorb his food and gain weight. He is battling a disease that many Americans have never heard of at an age where he shouldn't have to worry about anything other than school. And because this disease is progressive, they are really working against the clock. Because of the approval of two new drugs, they told me that they never have had as much hope for Mac and his future as they do today. And while they are not a family that themselves rely on the bill that we have today before us, as Chairman Ryan indicated, they, and anyone with these rare diseases, stand to benefit if we have widespread participation in clinical trials on the approval of other new promising drugs like the ones that are already helping Mac. Financially penalizing vulnerable people for participating in research does nothing to advance that research. The National Institutes of Health--NIH, as we know it--estimates that 25 million Americans are suffering because of rare disease. I hope now that today, the House will join the Senate in approving the Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act and that we continue this important effort to support patients across the country. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello). Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 209, the Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act, legislation that I have cosponsored. We must continue to ensure barriers do not stall patients from participating in rare disease clinical trials. This bill will continue to encourage rare disease patients, even those receiving Social Security Income or Medicaid benefits, to participate in clinical trials without jeopardizing their eligibility for those benefits. All patients should have access to these important and often lifesaving trials that will advance medical research and work towards improving their health. The Senate has taken the important step to pass this legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to advance this commonsense, bipartisan initiative and send it to the President's desk for his signature. I thank the chairman and all those involved in the House for their work on this. Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Ryan as well as Chairman Upton and Ranking Member Frank Pallone, who marked up this bill, and urge bipartisan approval of it. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I also urge our colleagues to support this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support S. 139, the Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2015. This bill will ensure current Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid recipients can maintain those benefits while participating in clinical trials. Keeping their benefits will help them, but as a doctor I know that their participation in such trials stands to benefit countless others as well who suffer from rare conditions, both in the U.S. and abroad. We should ensure that public policy encourages that whenever we can, and that's what this bill does. Under current law, the Social Security Administration excludes up to $2,000 annually in compensation received by individuals participating in rare disease clinical trials when determining their SSI and Medicaid eligibility and benefits. But this provision, put in place by bipartisan legislation in 2010, is set to expire on October 5, 2015. After that date, all payments for participating in such clinical trials would be counted as income for SSI and Medicaid recipients, reducing or even ending their eligibility for those benefits. A number of people with rare diseases like Cystic Fibrosis receive SSI benefits. If this policy is not made permanent, an individual participating in a clinical trial for a new treatment for Cystic Fibrosis could see a reduction or even the complete elimination of those important benefits. The reality is, most simply won't take that risk, and will avoid participating in such trials. As GAO found in a 2014 report, ``some stakeholders noted that compensation decreased participation in clinical trials in the past because individuals were concerned about its impact on their SSI eligibility and benefits.'' On the other hand, ``financial incentives to participate in clinical trials have generally been found to encourage participation in trials. This is likely because of the time, inconvenience, and expense that may be involved.'' Ultimately, not continuing this policy could actually prevent clinical trials from occurring, since it would restrict the already small number of people able to participate in the trial in the first place. That's why the passage of S. 139 is so important, as it will remove the sunset date for current law--October 5, 2015. Failing to do so would force individuals to once again choose between maintaining their current health and disability benefits and the chance to participate in a clinical trial that could improve or even cure their condition, as well as help others like them in the future. This bill is simple and consistent with current SSI program exemptions. S. 139 strikes the October 5, 2015 sunset date on current policy, permitting SSI and Medicaid recipients with rare diseases to participate in such trials that help to advance research into finding cures. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that S. 139 will result in insignificant costs to the Federal government over the next 10 years, meaning no offset for this legislation is required. But its true value to people with rare diseases--and those who in the future might benefit by their participation in clinical trials permitted under this legislation--could be enormous. Let's pass this important legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by [[Page H6279]] the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 139. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_54.csv,21245,21245,21317,"[congressional record volume 161, number 140 (monday, september 28, 2015)] [house] [pages h6276-h6279] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] ensuring access to clinical trials act of 2015 mr. ryan of wisconsin. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (s. 139) to permanently allow an exclusion under the supplemental security income program and the medicaid program for compensation provided to individuals who participate in clinical trials for rare diseases or conditions. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: s. 139 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``ensuring access to clinical trials act of 2015''. sec. 2. elimination of sunset provision. effective as if included in the enactment of the improving access to clinical trials act of 2009 (public law 111-255, 124 stat. 2640), section 3 of that act is amended by striking subsection (e). the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from wisconsin (mr. ryan) and the gentleman from texas (mr. doggett) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from wisconsin. general leave mr. ryan of wisconsin. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on s. 139, currently under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from wisconsin? there was no objection. mr. ryan of wisconsin. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in support of s. 139, the ensuring access to clinical trials act. the national institutes of health says that there are 7,000 rare diseases affecting people in the united states, and if we are going to find cures for those diseases, the first thing we need to do is to get people to participate in clinical trials. all too often, researchers cannot find enough participants because so few people have these diseases in the first place. now--no surprise here--the government used to make it more difficult for researchers to find people. say you had a rare disease and you were on public assistance, like ssi or medicaid. if you got compensated for participating in one of these trials, you got smaller benefits. that is why, in 2010, we passed the improving access to clinical trials act. for the past 5 years, this law has allowed people to collect up to $2,000 per year by participating in rare-disease clinical trials without threat of losing their ssi or medicaid benefits. the gao says the law is working. ever since we passed this law, more people on ssi have been participating in clinical trials as a result of it. the problem is this law expires next week, on october 5, so this bill would simply extend current law. that way, more people can participate in clinical trials without any reason to worry or without any threat to a loss of their benefits, and that way, we will continue to make strides in fighting these diseases. cbo tells us this bill will cost virtually nothing. my friends, senator hatch and senator wyden, introduced this bill in the senate. it passed the senate by unanimous consent. in the house, my colleagues mr. doggett and mr. marino from pennsylvania have introduced it along with 50 other cosponsors. i will include in the record a letter listing the many supporters of this legislation. it is a list of over 70 organizations, including the cystic fibrosis foundation, the muscular dystrophy association, and the huntington's disease society of america, just to name a few.

i am pleased to support s. 139, the ensuring access to clinical trials act of 2015. this bill will ensure current supplemental security income (ssi) and medicaid recipients can maintain those benefits while participating in clinical trials. keeping their benefits will help them, but as a doctor i know that their participation in such trials stands to benefit countless others as well who suffer from rare conditions, both in the u.s. and abroad. we should ensure that public policy encourages that whenever we can, and that's what this bill does. under current law, the social security administration excludes up to $2,000 annually in compensation received by individuals participating in rare disease clinical trials when determining their ssi and medicaid eligibility and benefits. but this provision, put in place by bipartisan legislation in 2010, is set to expire on october 5, 2015. after that date, all payments for participating in such clinical trials would be counted as income for ssi and medicaid recipients, reducing or even ending their eligibility for those benefits. a number of people with rare diseases like cystic fibrosis receive ssi benefits. if this policy is not made permanent, an individual participating in a clinical trial for a new treatment for cystic fibrosis could see a reduction or even the complete elimination of those important benefits. the reality is, most simply won't take that risk, and will avoid participating in such trials. as gao found in a 2014 report, ``some stakeholders noted that compensation decreased participation in clinical trials in the past because individuals were concerned about its impact on their ssi eligibility and benefits.'' on the other hand, ``financial incentives to participate in clinical trials have generally been found to encourage participation in trials. this is likely because of the time, inconvenience, and expense that may be involved.'' ultimately, not continuing this policy could actually prevent clinical trials from occurring, since it would restrict the already small number of people able to participate in the trial in the first place. that's why the passage of s. 139 is so important, as it will remove the sunset date for current law--october 5, 2015. failing to do so would force individuals to once again choose between maintaining their current health and disability benefits and the chance to participate in a clinical trial that could improve or even cure their condition, as well as help others like them in the future. this bill is simple and consistent with current ssi program exemptions. s. 139 strikes the october 5, 2015 sunset date on current policy, permitting ssi and medicaid recipients with rare diseases to participate in such trials that help to advance research into finding cures. the congressional budget office estimates that s. 139 will result in insignificant costs to the federal government over the next 10 years, meaning no offset for this legislation is required. but its true value to people with rare diseases--and those who in the future might benefit by their participation in clinical trials permitted under this legislation--could be enormous. let's pass this important legislation. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by [[page h6279]] the gentleman from wisconsin (mr. ryan) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, s. 139. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Smith of Nebraska). Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bishop) and the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. General Leave Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill, H.R. 3594. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and rise in support of the Higher Education Extension Act of 2015. Mr. Speaker, this week, several provisions of the Higher Education Extension Act are set to expire, including the Perkins Loan Program. For several decades, the Perkins Loan Program has provided low- interest-rate loans to college students with severe financial need. If we allow this program to expire, it would be at a time when our Nation's higher education system is failing many students trying to earn a college degree and a lifetime of opportunity and success. College costs continue to soar, new rules and regulations discourage innovation and deny access, and students are struggling to complete their education, not to mention find good-paying jobs. This is a very bleak reality facing students from my home State of Michigan and across the country. The American people deserve better. Students and families in my district and across the country deserve better, and my three children, who will one day in the not-so-distant future begin their college careers, deserve better. The reauthorization of the Higher Education Extension Act presents Congress an opportunity to strengthen higher education for students, families, and taxpayers. My colleagues and I have already proposed a number of responsible reforms that promise to promote innovation, strengthen transparency, and help students complete their education. Members are also working to streamline the confusing maze of financial programs so that students can get the support they need. As we continue our efforts to reauthorize the law, now is not the time to turn our backs on the students who rely on the Perkins Loan Program for their college education. Now is the time to help meet the immediate need of students in Michigan and across our country, and the Higher Education Extension Act of 2015 will do just exactly that. This bipartisan proposal will extend for 1 year the Perkins Loan Program, allowing participating colleges and universities to continue to service their borrowers. It will also allow current Perkins recipients who remain in the same academic program to be eligible to receive those funds through March 2018. The legislation will also extend other provisions in the Higher Education Extension Act that aim to support students, institutions, and policymakers. Finally, let me note for my colleagues and the American people, by reforming the Perkins Loan Program, we ensure that this legislation is fully paid for, at no additional cost to taxpayers. I am proud to lead this bipartisan effort with the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan), who shares my commitment to helping other students achieve their dream of a college education. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the Higher Education Extension Act of 2015. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 3594, the Higher Education Extension Act, and I would like to thank my colleague, Mr. Bishop, as well as my colleagues, Ms. Slaughter, Mr. Messer, and Ranking Member Scott, for their leadership on this issue. This bill would extend the Perkins Loan Program for 1 year. Perkins loans are need-based loans which foster access to higher education for low-income students by providing low-interest loans to students in need. Colleges and universities tailor the program to best fit borrowers' and educational institutions' situations. Perkins is a risk-sharing program, with institutions contributing one-third of their students' awards. This ``ownership interest'' also contributes to the successful management of this vital program. We have only 2 days before the Perkins Loan Program is set to expire, so we must act immediately. Since its inception in 1958, over $28 billion in loans have been made to students through almost 26 million aid awards. Perkins Loan borrowers are predominantly from lower income families and are often the first in their family to attend college. [[Page H6280]] Perkins loans have a set interest rate of 5 percent, which begins to accrue 9 months after the borrower ceases to be a student. However, this program has not been reauthorized since the 2009 fiscal year. Besides making higher education accessible for lower income students, this program serves as an incentive for people who wish to go into a public service by offering targeted loan cancellations for specific progression in areas of national need, including teaching, nursing, and law enforcement. Earlier this year, I introduced a bipartisan resolution in support of the Perkins loans with Congressman Messer of Indiana, H. Res. 294, with 56 cosponsors. My colleague Representative Louise Slaughter, a leader on this issue, offered a letter with more than 90 bipartisan signatures in support of this important program. Over 33 groups and higher educational institutions have supported this bill's reauthorization. Bottom line, the Perkins Loan Program has helped millions of students and families struggling to find a way to pay for college. I applaud my colleague across the aisle, specifically, a thank-you to Mr. Bishop, for helping to ensure students have access to Federal financial aid that they need to make college affordable and accessible. I urge support of this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici). Ms. BONAMICI. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Bishop and Congressman Pocan for introducing H.R. 3594, the Higher Education Extension Act. I would also like to thank Chairman Kline and Ranking Member Scott for supporting a bipartisan effort to avoid the expiration of the Federal Perkins Loan Program, a program that helps make college affordable for low-income students across the country. In my district in Oregon, across the State, and across the country, colleges and universities use the Perkins Loan Program to expand access to higher education. For example, Linfield College and Pacific University, in my district, award Perkins loans to hundreds of students; and University of Oregon and Oregon State University distribute Perkins loans to thousands, providing a clear benefit to students who have significant financial need. As Congress works to reauthorize the Higher Education Extension Act, it is important that we continue to increase access to affordable higher education. I commend my colleague for introducing the Higher Education Extension Act, and I ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan bill. Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. DeSaulnier). Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for this bipartisan effort, and I want to thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise today also in support of the Higher Education Extension Act. The Perkins Loan Program provides low-interest loans to economically disadvantaged students to help finance their postsecondary educations. The Perkins Loan Program assisted nearly 540,000 American students nationwide in the 2013-2014 academic year by providing $1.2 billion in loans. More than 1,500 colleges and universities across the United States participate in this popular program. While the Perkins Loan Program is sometimes viewed as benefiting students predominately in the Northeast, California is the second largest recipient. In California, more than 46,000 students received these loans last year. These loans resulted in more than $105 million in the last year to California students. Students from across the country who attend California schools, like Saint Mary's College in my district, are able to receive a top-notch education through assistance programs like the Perkins Loan Program. Increasing access and improving affordability translates to increased opportunities for students and improves the Nation's economy by ensuring that today's students are tomorrow's highly trained workforce. This bill is a necessary step to ensuring that our students continue to receive the assistance they need and deserve. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter), who has been a leader on this issue. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I am very grateful to Mr. Bishop and to Mr. Messer and Mr. Pocan and all others who worked on this really important issue. Mr. Speaker, the Perkins Loan Program is 57 years old. It is the Nation's longest running Federal student loan program. It is unlike any other Federal student aid program because this critical program is specifically directed at helping low-income students afford the cost of higher education. It helps the deserving students who would not be able to afford a college education otherwise, students that save up and work hard for every credit that they earn. Without Perkins, 500,000 low-income students across the country, nearly 50,000 from the State of New York and over 6,000 in my district alone, would not have access to a critical safety net. The Perkins Loan fills the gaps in student aid, and acts as a lifeline when unforeseen disruptions jeopardize a student's ability to pay for college. They offer an affordable alternative to private student loans and, furthermore, they are self-sustaining, meaning that as graduated students pay back their loans, they fund the current students' loans. This summer, 94 bipartisan colleagues joined me in a letter urging Chairman Kline and Ranking Member Scott to ensure that the Perkins Loan Program was not allowed to expire, and I am grateful for their help here on this today. I stood with students and the presidents of colleges and universities in my district, two of whom have received Perkins loans themselves, to voice support for the continuation of the program. Among the people attending were three medical students from the University of Rochester. Heaven knows, we cannot afford to lose the services of three medical students. I was also privileged to stand with my good friend Congressman Pocan and to hear from advocates and students who see and experience the benefits of the Perkins loans every day. While I strongly prefer a long-term reauthorization and look forward to working with my colleagues in the coming months to secure one, I am pleased that the Higher Education Extension Act succeeds in keeping the program alive, ensures that next year's incoming class will be able to access Perkins loans, and buys us some time to secure a lasting extension. I urge passage of this bill for all those students whose education dreams depend on having the Perkins loans. Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I just want to again thank Representative Bishop for all your work on this--thank you very much--and Chairman Kline and Ranking Member Scott. This is, I think, a good example of how we can work together in a committee to make sure that higher educational needs are met. I represent about 75,000 higher education students. With UW Madison as the flagship, about 45,000 students, we have other campuses for the UW system, Beloit College and other smaller private colleges, Madison College and others. This is a really important program, not just back home in Wisconsin, but across the country; and the fact that we are able to get this done in a bipartisan manner shows how I think Congress can work its very best. So I urge my colleagues to support this. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank Mr. Pocan as well and all those that have come to support the bill. [[Page H6281]] Helping more individuals access and complete higher education is a goal we all share. Research shows that students who earn a degree or credential are more likely to succeed in today's global economy. For example, those with an Associate Degree are expected to earn 27 percent more than those with a high school diploma over the course of a lifetime, underscoring the value of higher education. {time} 1645 Unfortunately, less than 60 percent of students complete their studies within 6 years often because they can't afford to. Failure to pass the Higher Education Extension Act of 2015 will only make it more difficult for some students to access and complete their education. Students across the country--including in my home State of Michigan-- count on the Perkins Loan Program to help afford a college education. By supporting this responsible bipartisan legislation, we will deliver certainty to students and institutions as we continue to work on the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 3594. I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, as we pass the Higher Education Extension Act of 2015, I would like to emphasize the importance of higher education in assisting our young people in building the knowledge and skills that will allow them to succeed in the workforce and, ultimately, help U.S. businesses and industry to compete in the global market. Michigan is home to many outstanding colleges and universities and I often speak with families throughout the 14th District and the state about the financial burden created by the increasing cost of higher education. Like many Americans, I firmly believe that making higher education more affordable and accessible should be among our foremost priorities. During a recent trip to my District, I spoke with a student who held a full-time job while in school because her family could not afford her tuition. Although work can be extremely rewarding and helps to build a strong work-ethic, students who are forced to work long hours and attend school full-time often suffer diminished academic success. Since 1986, the Federal Perkins Loan Program has been an essential part of college financial aid packages because it provides a long-term and low-interest alternative to expensive private loans for students. Extending the Perkins Loan Program will provide lower income students with the funding they need to attend college with their full focus on their education. Additionally, the cost of this extension is not borne by taxpayers. Rather, the Perkins Loan Program fully funds itself when past loan recipients pay-off the balance of their loan. I am proud that our Chamber has taken this important step toward ensuring all young people have the opportunity to benefit from a world class education. I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for supporting the fight to make higher education affordable and accessible for all Americans. Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, which would extend the Perkins Loan program for one year, so that students who have demonstrated exceptional financial need can complete their undergraduate or graduate education in order to become academically qualified to join our workforce. Historically, Perkins loans have served our students well by offering low-cost loans with flexible repayment terms and generous forgiveness options. They are often the difference between whether or not our students can afford to attend college, including 12,000 students in Texas. For the academic year 2013-2014, nearly 500,000 students who needed financial assistance were awarded nearly $1 billion in Perkins loans. And throughout its 57-year history, more than 30 million students with need have benefited from this program. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the federal government will reclaim nearly $5 billion in revenue from Perkins loans over the next ten years. That is $5 billion that should be returned to students to help keep college affordable for the most financially challenged students. And that is $5 billion that would have been lost if the program is not extended. Without Perkins loans, schools would lose the necessary flexibility to help students cover their expenses after federal grants and Stafford loans are applied or unforeseen circumstances jeopardize a student's ability to pay for college. If we want the United States of America to remain a global leader with the competitive edge necessary to sustain economic growth and job creation, we need the best, most highly trained workforce to sustain our advantages. The Perkins Loan program is a major part of helping our students develop, reach for and join that workforce. For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to extend the federal Perkins Loan program. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bishop) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3594. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6279-H6281] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1630 HIGHER EDUCATION EXTENSION ACT OF 2015 Mr. BISHOP of Michigan.

I urge support of this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici). Ms. BONAMICI. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Bishop and Congressman Pocan for introducing H.R. 3594, the Higher Education Extension Act. I would also like to thank Chairman Kline and Ranking Member Scott for supporting a bipartisan effort to avoid the expiration of the Federal Perkins Loan Program, a program that helps make college affordable for low-income students across the country. In my district in Oregon, across the State, and across the country, colleges and universities use the Perkins Loan Program to expand access to higher education. For example, Linfield College and Pacific University, in my district, award Perkins loans to hundreds of students; and University of Oregon and Oregon State University distribute Perkins loans to thousands, providing a clear benefit to students who have significant financial need. As Congress works to reauthorize the Higher Education Extension Act, it is important that we continue to increase access to affordable higher education. I commend my colleague for introducing the Higher Education Extension Act, and I ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan bill. Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. DeSaulnier). Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for this bipartisan effort, and I want to thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise today also in support of the Higher Education Extension Act. The Perkins Loan Program provides low-interest loans to economically disadvantaged students to help finance their postsecondary educations. The Perkins Loan Program assisted nearly 540,000 American students nationwide in the 2013-2014 academic year by providing $1.2 billion in loans. More than 1,500 colleges and universities across the United States participate in this popular program. While the Perkins Loan Program is sometimes viewed as benefiting students predominately in the Northeast, California is the second largest recipient. In California, more than 46,000 students received these loans last year. These loans resulted in more than $105 million in the last year to California students. Students from across the country who attend California schools, like Saint Mary's College in my district, are able to receive a top-notch education through assistance programs like the Perkins Loan Program. Increasing access and improving affordability translates to increased opportunities for students and improves the Nation's economy by ensuring that today's students are tomorrow's highly trained workforce. This bill is a necessary step to ensuring that our students continue to receive the assistance they need and deserve. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter), who has been a leader on this issue. Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I am very grateful to Mr. Bishop and to Mr. Messer and Mr. Pocan and all others who worked on this really important issue. Mr. Speaker, the Perkins Loan Program is 57 years old. It is the Nation's longest running Federal student loan program. It is unlike any other Federal student aid program because this critical program is specifically directed at helping low-income students afford the cost of higher education. It helps the deserving students who would not be able to afford a college education otherwise, students that save up and work hard for every credit that they earn. Without Perkins, 500,000 low-income students across the country, nearly 50,000 from the State of New York and over 6,000 in my district alone, would not have access to a critical safety net. The Perkins Loan fills the gaps in student aid, and acts as a lifeline when unforeseen disruptions jeopardize a student's ability to pay for college. They offer an affordable alternative to private student loans and, furthermore, they are self-sustaining, meaning that as graduated students pay back their loans, they fund the current students' loans. This summer, 94 bipartisan colleagues joined me in a letter urging Chairman Kline and Ranking Member Scott to ensure that the Perkins Loan Program was not allowed to expire, and I am grateful for their help here on this today. I stood with students and the presidents of colleges and universities in my district, two of whom have received Perkins loans themselves, to voice support for the continuation of the program. Among the people attending were three medical students from the University of Rochester. Heaven knows, we cannot afford to lose the services of three medical students. I was also privileged to stand with my good friend Congressman Pocan and to hear from advocates and students who see and experience the benefits of the Perkins loans every day. While I strongly prefer a long-term reauthorization and look forward to working with my colleagues in the coming months to secure one, I am pleased that the Higher Education Extension Act succeeds in keeping the program alive, ensures that next year's incoming class will be able to access Perkins loans, and buys us some time to secure a lasting extension. I urge passage of this bill for all those students whose education dreams depend on having the Perkins loans. Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I just want to again thank Representative Bishop for all your work on this--thank you very much--and Chairman Kline and Ranking Member Scott. This is, I think, a good example of how we can work together in a committee to make sure that higher educational needs are met. I represent about 75,000 higher education students. With UW Madison as the flagship, about 45,000 students, we have other campuses for the UW system, Beloit College and other smaller private colleges, Madison College and others. This is a really important program, not just back home in Wisconsin, but across the country; and the fact that we are able to get this done in a bipartisan manner shows how I think Congress can work its very best. So I urge my colleagues to support this. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank Mr. Pocan as well and all those that have come to support the bill. [[Page H6281]] Helping more individuals access and complete higher education is a goal we all share. Research shows that students who earn a degree or credential are more likely to succeed in today's global economy. For example, those with an Associate Degree are expected to earn 27 percent more than those with a high school diploma over the course of a lifetime, underscoring the value of higher education. {time} 1645 Unfortunately, less than 60 percent of students complete their studies within 6 years often because they can't afford to. Failure to pass the Higher Education Extension Act of 2015 will only make it more difficult for some students to access and complete their education. Students across the country--including in my home State of Michigan-- count on the Perkins Loan Program to help afford a college education. By supporting this responsible bipartisan legislation, we will deliver certainty to students and institutions as we continue to work on the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 3594. I yield back the balance of my time. Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, as we pass the Higher Education Extension Act of 2015, I would like to emphasize the importance of higher education in assisting our young people in building the knowledge and skills that will allow them to succeed in the workforce and, ultimately, help U.S. businesses and industry to compete in the global market. Michigan is home to many outstanding colleges and universities and I often speak with families throughout the 14th District and the state about the financial burden created by the increasing cost of higher education. Like many Americans, I firmly believe that making higher education more affordable and accessible should be among our foremost priorities. During a recent trip to my District, I spoke with a student who held a full-time job while in school because her family could not afford her tuition. Although work can be extremely rewarding and helps to build a strong work-ethic, students who are forced to work long hours and attend school full-time often suffer diminished academic success. Since 1986, the Federal Perkins Loan Program has been an essential part of college financial aid packages because it provides a long-term and low-interest alternative to expensive private loans for students. Extending the Perkins Loan Program will provide lower income students with the funding they need to attend college with their full focus on their education. Additionally, the cost of this extension is not borne by taxpayers. Rather, the Perkins Loan Program fully funds itself when past loan recipients pay-off the balance of their loan. I am proud that our Chamber has taken this important step toward ensuring all young people have the opportunity to benefit from a world class education. I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for supporting the fight to make higher education affordable and accessible for all Americans. Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, which would extend the Perkins Loan program for one year, so that students who have demonstrated exceptional financial need can complete their undergraduate or graduate education in order to become academically qualified to join our workforce. Historically, Perkins loans have served our students well by offering low-cost loans with flexible repayment terms and generous forgiveness options. They are often the difference between whether or not our students can afford to attend college, including 12,000 students in Texas. For the academic year 2013-2014, nearly 500,000 students who needed financial assistance were awarded nearly $1 billion in Perkins loans. And throughout its 57-year history, more than 30 million students with need have benefited from this program. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the federal government will reclaim nearly $5 billion in revenue from Perkins loans over the next ten years. That is $5 billion that should be returned to students to help keep college affordable for the most financially challenged students. And that is $5 billion that would have been lost if the program is not extended. Without Perkins loans, schools would lose the necessary flexibility to help students cover their expenses after federal grants and Stafford loans are applied or unforeseen circumstances jeopardize a student's ability to pay for college. If we want the United States of America to remain a global leader with the competitive edge necessary to sustain economic growth and job creation, we need the best, most highly trained workforce to sustain our advantages. The Perkins Loan program is a major part of helping our students develop, reach for and join that workforce. For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to extend the federal Perkins Loan program. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bishop) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3594. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6279-H6281] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1630 HIGHER EDUCATION EXTENSION ACT OF 2015 Mr. BISHOP of Michigan.

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Smith of Nebraska). Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bishop) and the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. General Leave Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill, H.R. 3594. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and rise in support of the Higher Education Extension Act of 2015. Mr. Speaker, this week, several provisions of the Higher Education Extension Act are set to expire, including the Perkins Loan Program. For several decades, the Perkins Loan Program has provided low- interest-rate loans to college students with severe financial need. If we allow this program to expire, it would be at a time when our Nation's higher education system is failing many students trying to earn a college degree and a lifetime of opportunity and success. College costs continue to soar, new rules and regulations discourage innovation and deny access, and students are struggling to complete their education, not to mention find good-paying jobs. This is a very bleak reality facing students from my home State of Michigan and across the country. The American people deserve better. Students and families in my district and across the country deserve better, and my three children, who will one day in the not-so-distant future begin their college careers, deserve better. The reauthorization of the Higher Education Extension Act presents Congress an opportunity to strengthen higher education for students, families, and taxpayers. My colleagues and I have already proposed a number of responsible reforms that promise to promote innovation, strengthen transparency, and help students complete their education. Members are also working to streamline the confusing maze of financial programs so that students can get the support they need. As we continue our efforts to reauthorize the law, now is not the time to turn our backs on the students who rely on the Perkins Loan Program for their college education. Now is the time to help meet the immediate need of students in Michigan and across our country, and the Higher Education Extension Act of 2015 will do just exactly that. This bipartisan proposal will extend for 1 year the Perkins Loan Program, allowing participating colleges and universities to continue to service their borrowers. It will also allow current Perkins recipients who remain in the same academic program to be eligible to receive those funds through March 2018. The legislation will also extend other provisions in the Higher Education Extension Act that aim to support students, institutions, and policymakers. Finally, let me note for my colleagues and the American people, by reforming the Perkins Loan Program, we ensure that this legislation is fully paid for, at no additional cost to taxpayers. I am proud to lead this bipartisan effort with the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan), who shares my commitment to helping other students achieve their dream of a college education. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the Higher Education Extension Act of 2015. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 3594, the Higher Education Extension Act, and I would like to thank my colleague, Mr. Bishop, as well as my colleagues, Ms. Slaughter, Mr. Messer, and Ranking Member Scott, for their leadership on this issue. This bill would extend the Perkins Loan Program for 1 year. Perkins loans are need-based loans which foster access to higher education for low-income students by providing low-interest loans to students in need. Colleges and universities tailor the program to best fit borrowers' and educational institutions' situations. Perkins is a risk-sharing program, with institutions contributing one-third of their students' awards. This ``ownership interest'' also contributes to the successful management of this vital program. We have only 2 days before the Perkins Loan Program is set to expire, so we must act immediately. Since its inception in 1958, over $28 billion in loans have been made to students through almost 26 million aid awards. Perkins Loan borrowers are predominantly from lower income families and are often the first in their family to attend college. [[Page H6280]] Perkins loans have a set interest rate of 5 percent, which begins to accrue 9 months after the borrower ceases to be a student. However, this program has not been reauthorized since the 2009 fiscal year. Besides making higher education accessible for lower income students, this program serves as an incentive for people who wish to go into a public service by offering targeted loan cancellations for specific progression in areas of national need, including teaching, nursing, and law enforcement. Earlier this year, I introduced a bipartisan resolution in support of the Perkins loans with Congressman Messer of Indiana, H. Res. 294, with 56 cosponsors. My colleague Representative Louise Slaughter, a leader on this issue, offered a letter with more than 90 bipartisan signatures in support of this important program. Over 33 groups and higher educational institutions have supported this bill's reauthorization. Bottom line, the Perkins Loan Program has helped millions of students and families struggling to find a way to pay for college. I applaud my colleague across the aisle, specifically, a thank-you to Mr. Bishop, for helping to ensure students have access to Federal financial aid that they need to make college affordable and accessible. I urge support of this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici). Ms. BONAMICI. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Bishop and Congressman Pocan for introducing H.R. 3594, the Higher Education Extension Act. I would also like to thank Chairman Kline and Ranking Member Scott for supporting a bipartisan effort to avoid the expiration of the Federal Perkins Loan Program, a program that helps make college affordable for low-income students across the country. In my district in Oregon, across the State, and across the country, colleges and universities use the Perkins Loan Program to expand access to higher education. For example, Linfield College and Pacific University, in my district, award Perkins loans to hundreds of students; and University of Oregon and Oregon State University distribute Perkins loans to thousands, providing a clear benefit to students who have significant financial need. As Congress works to reauthorize the Higher Education Extension Act, it is important that we continue to increase access to affordable higher education. I commend my colleague for introducing the Higher Education Extension Act, and I ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan bill. Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. DeSaulnier). Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for this bipartisan effort, and I want to thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise today also in support of the Higher Education Extension Act.

there was no objection. mr. bishop of michigan. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume, and rise in support of the higher education extension act of 2015. mr. speaker, this week, several provisions of the higher education extension act are set to expire, including the perkins loan program. for several decades, the perkins loan program has provided low- interest-rate loans to college students with severe financial need. if we allow this program to expire, it would be at a time when our nation's higher education system is failing many students trying to earn a college degree and a lifetime of opportunity and success. college costs continue to soar, new rules and regulations discourage innovation and deny access, and students are struggling to complete their education, not to mention find good-paying jobs. this is a very bleak reality facing students from my home state of michigan and across the country. the american people deserve better. students and families in my district and across the country deserve better, and my three children, who will one day in the not-so-distant future begin their college careers, deserve better. the reauthorization of the higher education extension act presents congress an opportunity to strengthen higher education for students, families, and taxpayers. my colleagues and i have already proposed a number of responsible reforms that promise to promote innovation, strengthen transparency, and help students complete their education. members are also working to streamline the confusing maze of financial programs so that students can get the support they need. as we continue our efforts to reauthorize the law, now is not the time to turn our backs on the students who rely on the perkins loan program for their college education. now is the time to help meet the immediate need of students in michigan and across our country, and the higher education extension act of 2015 will do just exactly that. this bipartisan proposal will extend for 1 year the perkins loan program, allowing participating colleges and universities to continue to service their borrowers. it will also allow current perkins recipients who remain in the same academic program to be eligible to receive those funds through march 2018. the legislation will also extend other provisions in the higher education extension act that aim to support students, institutions, and policymakers. finally, let me note for my colleagues and the american people, by reforming the perkins loan program, we ensure that this legislation is fully paid for, at no additional cost to taxpayers. i am proud to lead this bipartisan effort with the gentleman from wisconsin (mr. pocan), who shares my commitment to helping other students achieve their dream of a college education. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the higher education extension act of 2015. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. pocan. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise today in support of h.r. 3594, the higher education extension act, and i would like to thank my colleague, mr. bishop, as well as my colleagues, ms. slaughter, mr. messer, and ranking member scott, for their leadership on this issue. this bill would extend the perkins loan program for 1 year. perkins loans are need-based loans which foster access to higher education for low-income students by providing low-interest loans to students in need. colleges and universities tailor the program to best fit borrowers' and educational institutions' situations. perkins is a risk-sharing program, with institutions contributing one-third of their students' awards. this ``ownership interest'' also contributes to the successful management of this vital program. we have only 2 days before the perkins loan program is set to expire, so we must act immediately. since its inception in 1958, over $28 billion in loans have been made to students through almost 26 million aid awards. perkins loan borrowers are predominantly from lower income families and are often the first in their family to attend college. [[page h6280]] perkins loans have a set interest rate of 5 percent, which begins to accrue 9 months after the borrower ceases to be a student. however, this program has not been reauthorized since the 2009 fiscal year. besides making higher education accessible for lower income students, this program serves as an incentive for people who wish to go into a public service by offering targeted loan cancellations for specific progression in areas of national need, including teaching, nursing, and law enforcement. earlier this year, i introduced a bipartisan resolution in support of the perkins loans with congressman messer of indiana, h. res. 294, with 56 cosponsors. my colleague representative louise slaughter, a leader on this issue, offered a letter with more than 90 bipartisan signatures in support of this important program. over 33 groups and higher educational institutions have supported this bill's reauthorization. bottom line, the perkins loan program has helped millions of students and families struggling to find a way to pay for college. i applaud my colleague across the aisle, specifically, a thank-you to mr. bishop, for helping to ensure students have access to federal financial aid that they need to make college affordable and accessible. i urge support of this bill, and i reserve the balance of my time. mr. bishop of michigan. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. pocan. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from oregon (ms. bonamici). ms. bonamici. i thank the gentleman for yielding. mr. speaker, i thank congressman bishop and congressman pocan for introducing h.r. 3594, the higher education extension act. i would also like to thank chairman kline and ranking member scott for supporting a bipartisan effort to avoid the expiration of the federal perkins loan program, a program that helps make college affordable for low-income students across the country. in my district in oregon, across the state, and across the country, colleges and universities use the perkins loan program to expand access to higher education. for example, linfield college and pacific university, in my district, award perkins loans to hundreds of students; and university of oregon and oregon state university distribute perkins loans to thousands, providing a clear benefit to students who have significant financial need. as congress works to reauthorize the higher education extension act, it is important that we continue to increase access to affordable higher education. i commend my colleague for introducing the higher education extension act, and i ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan bill. mr. bishop of michigan. mr. speaker, i continue to reserve the balance of my time. mr. pocan. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from california (mr. desaulnier). mr. desaulnier. mr. speaker, i thank my colleagues for this bipartisan effort, and i want to thank the gentleman for yielding. i rise today also in support of the higher education extension act. the perkins loan program provides low-interest loans to economically disadvantaged students to help finance their postsecondary educations. the perkins loan program assisted nearly 540,000 american students nationwide in the 2013-2014 academic year by providing $1.2 billion in loans. more than 1,500 colleges and universities across the united states participate in this popular program. while the perkins loan program is sometimes viewed as benefiting students predominately in the northeast, california is the second largest recipient. in california, more than 46,000 students received these loans last year. these loans resulted in more than $105 million in the last year to california students. students from across the country who attend california schools, like saint mary's college in my district, are able to receive a top-notch education through assistance programs like the perkins loan program. increasing access and improving affordability translates to increased opportunities for students and improves the nation's economy by ensuring that today's students are tomorrow's highly trained workforce. this bill is a necessary step to ensuring that our students continue to receive the assistance they need and deserve. i urge my colleagues to support this bill. mr. bishop of michigan. mr. speaker, i continue to reserve the balance of my time. mr. pocan. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from new york (ms. slaughter), who has been a leader on this issue. ms. slaughter. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman for yielding, and i am very grateful to mr. bishop and to mr. messer and mr. pocan and all others who worked on this really important issue. mr. speaker, the perkins loan program is 57 years old. it is the nation's longest running federal student loan program. it is unlike any other federal student aid program because this critical program is specifically directed at helping low-income students afford the cost of higher education. it helps the deserving students who would not be able to afford a college education otherwise, students that save up and work hard for every credit that they earn. without perkins, 500,000 low-income students across the country, nearly 50,000 from the state of new york and over 6,000 in my district alone, would not have access to a critical safety net. the perkins loan fills the gaps in student aid, and acts as a lifeline when unforeseen disruptions jeopardize a student's ability to pay for college. they offer an affordable alternative to private student loans and, furthermore, they are self-sustaining, meaning that as graduated students pay back their loans, they fund the current students' loans. this summer, 94 bipartisan colleagues joined me in a letter urging chairman kline and ranking member scott to ensure that the perkins loan program was not allowed to expire, and i am grateful for their help here on this today. i stood with students and the presidents of colleges and universities in my district, two of whom have received perkins loans themselves, to voice support for the continuation of the program. among the people attending were three medical students from the university of rochester. heaven knows, we cannot afford to lose the services of three medical students. i was also privileged to stand with my good friend congressman pocan and to hear from advocates and students who see and experience the benefits of the perkins loans every day. while i strongly prefer a long-term reauthorization and look forward to working with my colleagues in the coming months to secure one, i am pleased that the higher education extension act succeeds in keeping the program alive, ensures that next year's incoming class will be able to access perkins loans, and buys us some time to secure a lasting extension. i urge passage of this bill for all those students whose education dreams depend on having the perkins loans. mr. bishop of michigan. mr. speaker, i continue to reserve the balance of my time. mr. pocan. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i just want to again thank representative bishop for all your work on this--thank you very much--and chairman kline and ranking member scott. this is, i think, a good example of how we can work together in a committee to make sure that higher educational needs are met. i represent about 75,000 higher education students. with uw madison as the flagship, about 45,000 students, we have other campuses for the uw system, beloit college and other smaller private colleges, madison college and others. this is a really important program, not just back home in wisconsin, but across the country; and the fact that we are able to get this done in a bipartisan manner shows how i think congress can work its very best. so i urge my colleagues to support this. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. bishop of michigan. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time. mr. speaker, first of all, i would like to thank mr. pocan as well and all those that have come to support the bill. [[page h6281]] helping more individuals access and complete higher education is a goal we all share. research shows that students who earn a degree or credential are more likely to succeed in today's global economy. for example, those with an associate degree are expected to earn 27 percent more than those with a high school diploma over the course of a lifetime, underscoring the value of higher education. {time} 1645 unfortunately, less than 60 percent of students complete their studies within 6 years often because they can't afford to. failure to pass the higher education extension act of 2015 will only make it more difficult for some students to access and complete their education. students across the country--including in my home state of michigan-- count on the perkins loan program to help afford a college education. by supporting this responsible bipartisan legislation, we will deliver certainty to students and institutions as we continue to work on the reauthorization of the higher education act. i urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on h.r. 3594. i yield back the balance of my time. mrs. lawrence. mr. speaker, as we pass the higher education extension act of 2015, i would like to emphasize the importance of higher education in assisting our young people in building the knowledge and skills that will allow them to succeed in the workforce and, ultimately, help u.s. businesses and industry to compete in the global market. michigan is home to many outstanding colleges and universities and i often speak with families throughout the 14th district and the state about the financial burden created by the increasing cost of higher education. like many americans, i firmly believe that making higher education more affordable and accessible should be among our foremost priorities. during a recent trip to my district, i spoke with a student who held a full-time job while in school because her family could not afford her tuition. although work can be extremely rewarding and helps to build a strong work-ethic, students who are forced to work long hours and attend school full-time often suffer diminished academic success. since 1986, the federal perkins loan program has been an essential part of college financial aid packages because it provides a long-term and low-interest alternative to expensive private loans for students. extending the perkins loan program will provide lower income students with the funding they need to attend college with their full focus on their education. additionally, the cost of this extension is not borne by taxpayers. rather, the perkins loan program fully funds itself when past loan recipients pay-off the balance of their loan. i am proud that our chamber has taken this important step toward ensuring all young people have the opportunity to benefit from a world class education. i want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for supporting the fight to make higher education affordable and accessible for all americans. mr. hinojosa. mr. speaker, i rise in support of this bill, which would extend the perkins loan program for one year, so that students who have demonstrated exceptional financial need can complete their undergraduate or graduate education in order to become academically qualified to join our workforce. historically, perkins loans have served our students well by offering low-cost loans with flexible repayment terms and generous forgiveness options. they are often the difference between whether or not our students can afford to attend college, including 12,000 students in texas. for the academic year 2013-2014, nearly 500,000 students who needed financial assistance were awarded nearly $1 billion in perkins loans. and throughout its 57-year history, more than 30 million students with need have benefited from this program. the congressional budget office has estimated that the federal government will reclaim nearly $5 billion in revenue from perkins loans over the next ten years. that is $5 billion that should be returned to students to help keep college affordable for the most financially challenged students. and that is $5 billion that would have been lost if the program is not extended. without perkins loans, schools would lose the necessary flexibility to help students cover their expenses after federal grants and stafford loans are applied or unforeseen circumstances jeopardize a student's ability to pay for college. if we want the united states of america to remain a global leader with the competitive edge necessary to sustain economic growth and job creation, we need the best, most highly trained workforce to sustain our advantages. the perkins loan program is a major part of helping our students develop, reach for and join that workforce. for these reasons, mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to extend the federal perkins loan program. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from michigan (mr. bishop) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 3594. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",21696
CREC-2015-09-28-pt1-PgH6281,CREC-2015-09-28,114,AMERICAN SAMOA MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE POSTPONEMENT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6281-H6284] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMERICAN SAMOA MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE POSTPONEMENT Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2617) to amend the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 to postpone a scheduled increase in the minimum wage applicable to American Samoa, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 2617 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. MINIMUM WAGE FOR AMERICAN SAMOA. (a) Minimum Wage.--Paragraph (2) of section 8103(b) of the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 (29 U.S.C. 206 note) is amended to read as follows: ``(2) the minimum wage applicable to American Samoa under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(a)(1)) shall be-- ``(A) the applicable wage rate in effect for each industry and classification as of September 29, 2015; and ``(B) increased by $0.50 an hour (or such lesser amount as may be necessary to equal the minimum wage under section 6(a)(1) of such Act), beginning on December 31, 2016, and on December 31 of every third year thereafter, until the minimum wage applicable to American Samoa under this paragraph is equal to the minimum wage set forth in such section.''. (b) GAO Reports.--Section 8104 of the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 (29 U.S.C. 206 note) is amended-- (1) in subsection (a)-- (A) by striking ``September 1, 2011'' and inserting ``April 1, 2017''; and (B) by striking the second sentence and inserting the following: ``The Government Accountability Office shall submit a subsequent report not later than April 1, 2020.''; (2) in subsection (b), by striking ``the study under subsection (a)'' and inserting ``any report under subsection (a)''; and (3) by adding at the end the following: ``(c) Report on Alternative Methods of Increasing the Minimum Wage in American Samoa.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this subsection, the Government Accountability Office shall transmit to Congress a report on alternative ways of increasing the minimum wage in American Samoa to keep pace with the cost of living in American Samoa and to eventually equal the minimum wage set forth in section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(a)(1)).''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bishop) and the gentleman from the Northern Mariana Islands (Mr. Sablan) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. General Leave Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous materials on H.R. 2617. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 2617. This legislation is simple and straightforward. It would delay for 15 months a minimum wage increase that will take effect in American Samoa in just 2 days. If this increase takes effect, it will harm the very people it was intended to help, the hard-working men and women of American Samoa. The reason we are here today is also quite simple. We are here because the local government in American Samoa is urging us to do this. We are here because the employers in American Samoa, who are few and far between, are urging us to do this. And, most importantly, we are here because the [[Page H6282]] workers in American Samoa are urging us to do this. You don't have to take my word for it. Those are the facts that have been reported by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office. For years, the territory has been plagued by a weak economy, fewer jobs, and higher inflation. The tuna canning industry, an essential part of the American Samoa economy, has been hit especially hard. According to our own independent government watchdog, previous wage increases have forced employers to delay expansion, limit overtime, and cut labor costs, which means that they have ultimately had to lay off workers. Many fear these tough challenges will only get worse if we fail to act now. It should be noted that this isn't the first time we have had to take this step. When our Democratic colleagues were in control a few years back, they passed legislation delaying the arbitrary wage increase they set in motion. That effort passed with strong bipartisan support, and I expect today's legislation will as well. I also want to note that the legislation will help us end a dangerous pattern of uncertainty and last-minute delays. Under the bill, the Government Accountability Office is required to report on alternatives to setting the minimum wage in American Samoa. No doubt there are a number of alternatives Congress could consider. For example, local leaders have proposed bestowing upon them the responsibility for setting wages in their local communities. While this is certainly an interesting idea, it is a debate for another day. Today let's do the right thing by passing this important legislation. In closing, I wish to thank my colleague from American Samoa, Delegate Amata Radewagen, for authoring this legislative proposal and for her tireless leadership on behalf of her constituents. I urge all of my colleagues to stand with the people of American Samoa and support this legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, reducing the income inequality between the people I represent in the Northern Mariana Islands and Americans in the rest of our Nation is one of my key goals as a Member of Congress. Household median income in the Marianas was just $20,000 in the last census compared to $53,000 nationwide. For that reason, I have always supported the decision made in the 110th Congress to raise the minimum wage in the Marianas to the U.S. level in a series of graduated steps. When that decision was enacted in Public Law 110-28, the locally set minimum wage in the Mariana Islands was just $3.05 per hour and the minimum wage had been stuck at that level since the 1990s. Today the minimum wage has effectively doubled to $6.05 and will increase to $6.55 a year from now. That doubling of the minimum wage has occurred during a period of economic difficulty for the Mariana Islands. Gross domestic product was dropping by 8 percent, 12 percent, 19 percent in the first 3 years of minimum wage increase. I should say, however, that these drops had nothing to do with the wage and everything to do with the loss of manufacturing because of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade and because of a loss of tourism. In the most recent year for which GDP data is available for our islands, we had economic growth of 4.4 percent, even as the minimum wage continued to rise. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis says that this economic growth reflects a growth in tourism, especially an increase in tourism from China. But it also reflects a growth in consumption because workers who are paid more can spend more, and that is good for the economy. So I look forward to next year's increase of another 50 cents in the minimum wage in the Mariana Islands. I look forward to reaching the national minimum wage in 2019, and I support legislation raising the national minimum wage because I have now seen in my district that increasing wages can have a positive impact on economic activity and improve people's lives. At the same time, I recognize that there is such a thing as economic reality. Raising the minimum wage too quickly could have a detrimental effect, could cause employment to shrink. For that reason, over the last 7 years that I have been in Congress, I worked with Members on both sides of the aisle to tailor the minimum wage increases to the specific economic realities in my district. Instead of raising it by 50 cents every year, as the original law required, we skipped the increases in 2011, 2013, and this year, 2015. We arrived at the decision to stretch out the time of the increases by listening to employers on the island and to workers because workers also understand that increasing wages too quickly could jeopardize their jobs. We also listened carefully to the Government Accountability Office experts who look at the effect of these minimum wage increases periodically and report back to Congress. I think that, so far, as least, we have successfully walked the fine line. We have kept the minimum wage increasing--faster than prices, GAO tells us--without disrupting the economy. I am very grateful to both Democrats here in Congress, who agreed to slow down the increases, and to Republicans, who agreed to let the minimum wage keep going up. They did so, I think, because of a recognition that a relatively isolated island economy might need special consideration and because, when it comes to a decision that only affects a Member's own district, there is a tradition of deference here in Congress to the views of that Member. This is a very long way around to saying that I support H.R. 2617, the bill now under consideration. The gentlewoman from American Samoa (Mrs. Radewagen) has made the determination that what is best for her constituents is to delay further increases in the minimum wage. She too represents a relatively isolated island economy. Her constituents too have incomes much below the U.S. average. The specific economic factors in American Samoa are not the same as in the Northern Mariana Islands. So while a delay for American Samoa may be appropriate, I would not want to imply a further delay for the Northern Marianas is called for at this time. But I do think that the same courtesy that the House has provided to me, when it comes to making a judgment about the well-being of the people I represent, should be given to the Delegate from American Samoa with respect to her own district. For that reason, I urge Members to support passage of H.R. 2617. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentlewoman from American Samoa (Mrs. Radewagen). Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege for me to serve the people of American Samoa in the U.S. House of Representatives. My home district of American Samoa, an isolated group of islands, is 6 hours by plane south of Hawaii. Sometimes we jokingly refer to our three main exports as canned tuna, military personnel, and NFL players. Today I would like to talk about the canned tuna, though. Due to an oversight, the Fair Minimum Wage Act, which became law in 2007, contained language that stipulated that American Samoa must raise its minimum wage by 50 cents every 3 years starting in 2009 until it meets the Federal standard. Since that time, Congress has graciously granted two waivers to American Samoa which prevents them from having to institute the increase, and wisely so. Had Congress not granted the waivers, the effects would have been absolutely devastating to our local economy, of which the tuna canneries comprise 80 percent. When the Fair Minimum Wage Act was passed in 2007, American Samoa had two canneries on the island. As a direct result of the law and concern with future wage increases, in 2009, the day after a deadly tsunami struck our island, the cannery operated by Chicken of the Sea relocated to Thailand, causing thousands to instantly lose their jobs and hundreds shortly followed. In Thailand, Chicken of the Sea now pays their workers a mere $1.25 an hour and are rumored to be cutting wages further in 2016, while the workers in [[Page H6283]] American Samoa are paid $4.76 an hour. While $4.76 may not seem like a large amount here in the States, one must realize that, in American Samoa, the cost of living is drastically different. Due to how the lands are owned and managed in American Samoa, there is actually no such thing as rent or a mortgage, items that often comprise up to one-half of a person's monthly expenses. Because our people do not have an expense for housing, $4.76 an hour goes much further than it would here in the States. While well-intended, the Fair Minimum Wage Act has placed the economic well-being of American Samoa in great jeopardy. No one would like to see the people of American Samoa prosper and have their wages increased more than I. However, this is neither the time nor mechanism for such a drastic increase, as it would surely be the proverbial nail in the coffin for the local economy, as the two canneries that are currently operating out of American Samoa have stated the strong possibility of having to leave our island because they simply would not be able to compete financially against their foreign competitors. One of these canneries just opened this year and is trying to establish a toehold in the region. Without the extension, this will be very difficult for them. Currently, due to many factors, the long-term continuity of the Pago Pago-based canneries is now threatened by reduced tuna deliveries and supply, which will negatively affect cannery production, impact cannery employment and support services, and could possibly destroy American Samoa's economy altogether. {time} 1700 Past decisions by the United States Government have led to the current dire situation. In 2005, the U.S. Government agreed to reduce fishing opportunities by U.S. purse seine vessels on the high seas and within the U.S. EEZ. At the same time, the U.S. purse seine fleet contracted from 49 vessels in 1994 to 11 in 2007. This major shift in the management of the purse seine fishery should have been recognized by the United States Government as significant in terms of fleet operations and the impact it would have on American Samoa. Unfortunately, it seems that the territory was not considered. That same year, the U.S. allowed Taiwanese-built vessels to become U.S. flagged, thereby receiving the same benefits afforded under the South Pacific Tuna Treaty. These new vessels fish farther away from American Samoa and predominantly offload their catch in Thailand. In 2013, the U.S. Government agreed to pay a combined amount, from both government and industry, of approximately $90 million, while agreeing to further reduce the United States fishing effort on the high seas. After that, in 2014, the United States agreed to an inexcusable deal, to the detriment of American Samoa, reducing the amount of fishing days available in Kiribati waters to the United States fleet from 4,313 to just 300 days in just 1 year. Kiribati waters are typically the most productive purse seine fishing grounds in close proximity to Pago Pago. However, the American Samoa-based purse seine vessels are now forced to travel great distances, making Pago Pago canneries less desirable and increasing transshipping to foreign ports. In addition, the expansion of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument and the high seas effort limit have further reduce the fishing grounds available to the American Samoa-based purse seine fleet, lending to the dire situation facing American Samoa's local canneries. These are waters that have been fished by our people for many centuries. Like other small island developing states and territories in the Pacific, American Samoa and the fishing industry it supports should be afforded special recognition, not crushed by the worst aspects of capitalism--and I say this as a devout capitalist. Until we begin to safeguard our fishery interests in the region, American Samoa's tuna fisheries will continue to wither, creating economic ruin in American Samoa, the other Pacific territories, and even Hawaii, leaving the United States as a passive observer in the world's largest tuna fishery, leaving other nations such as China to run roughshod over fisheries to the detriment of not only the people, but the environment as well. We must reverse some of the missteps the United States has taken over the years which have left the American Samoa economy in this highly vulnerable position. The closing off of large swaths of ocean, under the guise of national monuments, which cover thousands of square miles of traditional fishing grounds that our people have used for centuries, to the reduction in allotted fishing days that have gone from over 4,000 to under 500 in just 1 year, this is certainly not the time to put further pressure on an industry that is seemingly under attack from all sides, a local industry that operates at a loss in comparison to its competitors when it comes to labor, due to their longstanding relationship with the people of American Samoa, for which we are very grateful. Mr. Speaker, I have heard some concern about Congress continuing to kick the can down the road on this issue. To those, I extend willing and eager hands for cooperation and assistance in fixing the mechanism by which the wages are set in American Samoa. The playing fields between the United States and American Samoa are too drastically different to place on the same wage scale, and to keep American Samoa tied to the current standard is dangerous and irresponsible. It is my plan to use the time granted in the extension to work on a new mechanism for setting the minimum wage rate in American Samoa, and I happily encourage fellow Members to join me in this mission. If there is ever any bill that I introduce that I wish I could vote against, this would be it. However, while it is difficult, I also know that it must be done. Oftentimes, the things that are the most difficult are also the most important, and currently, there is no issue more important to the economic well-being of American Samoa than this. I respectfully and wholeheartedly ask my colleagues in both the House and Senate to support this legislation that is so absolutely critical to the economic stability of American Samoa. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 3 minutes. Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Without it, Mr. Speaker, I am afraid we will be back here in just a few months trying to figure out a way to subsidize what is already the most economically challenged territory or State in our Nation. The tuna canning industry is all we have. There is no Coca-Cola or IBM. We have no Silicon Valley there to provide massive revenue and employment opportunity to the territory. There aren't numerous military and government facilities that provide sources of economic growth. We are not surrounded by fellow States that enable us to expand to other markets. All we have is the tuna industry, and we are grateful for them. So again, I graciously ask my fellow colleagues to support this unfortunate, yet essential, piece of legislation. If you cannot support it, all I ask is that you do not block it, because it would be absolutely devastating to our people. I want to thank Chairman Kline, Ranking Member Scott, and the committee staff for their assistance in getting this measure to the floor, as well as the numerous other staff and Members who put in many hours of hard work to get us here today. Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I do urge my colleagues to please support H.R. 2617. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, as I noted earlier, this effort is supported by local leaders in American Samoa. It is supported by employers in American Samoa, and, most importantly, it is supported by the working men and women of American Samoa. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by [[Page H6284]] the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bishop) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2617, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6281-H6284] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] AMERICAN SAMOA MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE POSTPONEMENT Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2617) to amend the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 to postpone a scheduled increase in the minimum wage applicable to American Samoa, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 2617 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. MINIMUM WAGE FOR AMERICAN SAMOA. (a) Minimum Wage.--Paragraph (2) of section 8103(b) of the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 (29 U.S.C. 206 note) is amended to read as follows: ``(2) the minimum wage applicable to American Samoa under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(a)(1)) shall be-- ``(A) the applicable wage rate in effect for each industry and classification as of September 29, 2015; and ``(B) increased by $0.50 an hour (or such lesser amount as may be necessary to equal the minimum wage under section 6(a)(1) of such Act), beginning on December 31, 2016, and on December 31 of every third year thereafter, until the minimum wage applicable to American Samoa under this paragraph is equal to the minimum wage set forth in such section.''. (b) GAO Reports.--Section 8104 of the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 (29 U.S.C. 206 note) is amended-- (1) in subsection (a)-- (A) by striking ``September 1, 2011'' and inserting ``April 1, 2017''; and (B) by striking the second sentence and inserting the following: ``The Government Accountability Office shall submit a subsequent report not later than April 1, 2020.''; (2) in subsection (b), by striking ``the study under subsection (a)'' and inserting ``any report under subsection (a)''; and (3) by adding at the end the following: ``(c) Report on Alternative Methods of Increasing the Minimum Wage in American Samoa.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this subsection, the Government Accountability Office shall transmit to Congress a report on alternative ways of increasing the minimum wage in American Samoa to keep pace with the cost of living in American Samoa and to eventually equal the minimum wage set forth in section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(a)(1)).''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bishop) and the gentleman from the Northern Mariana Islands (Mr. Sablan) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. General Leave Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous materials on H.R. 2617. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise today in support of H.R. 2617. This legislation is simple and straightforward. It would delay for 15 months a minimum wage increase that will take effect in American Samoa in just 2 days. If this increase takes effect, it will harm the very people it was intended to help, the hard-working men and women of American Samoa. The reason we are here today is also quite simple. We are here because the local government in American Samoa is urging us to do this. We are here because the employers in American Samoa, who are few and far between, are urging us to do this. And, most importantly, we are here because the [[Page H6282]] workers in American Samoa are urging us to do this. You don't have to take my word for it. Those are the facts that have been reported by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office. For years, the territory has been plagued by a weak economy, fewer jobs, and higher inflation. The tuna canning industry, an essential part of the American Samoa economy, has been hit especially hard. According to our own independent government watchdog, previous wage increases have forced employers to delay expansion, limit overtime, and cut labor costs, which means that they have ultimately had to lay off workers. Many fear these tough challenges will only get worse if we fail to act now. It should be noted that this isn't the first time we have had to take this step. When our Democratic colleagues were in control a few years back, they passed legislation delaying the arbitrary wage increase they set in motion. That effort passed with strong bipartisan support, and I expect today's legislation will as well. I also want to note that the legislation will help us end a dangerous pattern of uncertainty and last-minute delays. Under the bill, the Government Accountability Office is required to report on alternatives to setting the minimum wage in American Samoa. No doubt there are a number of alternatives Congress could consider. For example, local leaders have proposed bestowing upon them the responsibility for setting wages in their local communities. While this is certainly an interesting idea, it is a debate for another day. Today let's do the right thing by passing this important legislation. In closing, I wish to thank my colleague from American Samoa, Delegate Amata Radewagen, for authoring this legislative proposal and for her tireless leadership on behalf of her constituents. I urge all of my colleagues to stand with the people of American Samoa and support this legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, reducing the income inequality between the people I represent in the Northern Mariana Islands and Americans in the rest of our Nation is one of my key goals as a Member of Congress. Household median income in the Marianas was just $20,000 in the last census compared to $53,000 nationwide. For that reason, I have always supported the decision made in the 110th Congress to raise the minimum wage in the Marianas to the U.S. level in a series of graduated steps. When that decision was enacted in Public Law 110-28, the locally set minimum wage in the Mariana Islands was just $3.05 per hour and the minimum wage had been stuck at that level since the 1990s. Today the minimum wage has effectively doubled to $6.05 and will increase to $6.55 a year from now. That doubling of the minimum wage has occurred during a period of economic difficulty for the Mariana Islands. Gross domestic product was dropping by 8 percent, 12 percent, 19 percent in the first 3 years of minimum wage increase. I should say, however, that these drops had nothing to do with the wage and everything to do with the loss of manufacturing because of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade and because of a loss of tourism. In the most recent year for which GDP data is available for our islands, we had economic growth of 4.4 percent, even as the minimum wage continued to rise. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis says that this economic growth reflects a growth in tourism, especially an increase in tourism from China. But it also reflects a growth in consumption because workers who are paid more can spend more, and that is good for the economy. So I look forward to next year's increase of another 50 cents in the minimum wage in the Mariana Islands. I look forward to reaching the national minimum wage in 2019, and I support legislation raising the national minimum wage because I have now seen in my district that increasing wages can have a positive impact on economic activity and improve people's lives. At the same time, I recognize that there is such a thing as economic reality. Raising the minimum wage too quickly could have a detrimental effect, could cause employment to shrink. For that reason, over the last 7 years that I have been in Congress, I worked with Members on both sides of the aisle to tailor the minimum wage increases to the specific economic realities in my district. Instead of raising it by 50 cents every year, as the original law required, we skipped the increases in 2011, 2013, and this year, 2015. We arrived at the decision to stretch out the time of the increases by listening to employers on the island and to workers because workers also understand that increasing wages too quickly could jeopardize their jobs. We also listened carefully to the Government Accountability Office experts who look at the effect of these minimum wage increases periodically and report back to Congress. I think that, so far, as least, we have successfully walked the fine line. We have kept the minimum wage increasing--faster than prices, GAO tells us--without disrupting the economy. I am very grateful to both Democrats here in Congress, who agreed to slow down the increases, and to Republicans, who agreed to let the minimum wage keep going up. They did so, I think, because of a recognition that a relatively isolated island economy might need special consideration and because, when it comes to a decision that only affects a Member's own district, there is a tradition of deference here in Congress to the views of that Member. This is a very long way around to saying that I support H.R. 2617, the bill now under consideration. The gentlewoman from American Samoa (Mrs. Radewagen) has made the determination that what is best for her constituents is to delay further increases in the minimum wage. She too represents a relatively isolated island economy. Her constituents too have incomes much below the U.S. average. The specific economic factors in American Samoa are not the same as in the Northern Mariana Islands. So while a delay for American Samoa may be appropriate, I would not want to imply a further delay for the Northern Marianas is called for at this time. But I do think that the same courtesy that the House has provided to me, when it comes to making a judgment about the well-being of the people I represent, should be given to the Delegate from American Samoa with respect to her own district. For that reason, I urge Members to support passage of H.R. 2617. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentlewoman from American Samoa (Mrs. Radewagen). Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege for me to serve the people of American Samoa in the U.S. House of Representatives. My home district of American Samoa, an isolated group of islands, is 6 hours by plane south of Hawaii. Sometimes we jokingly refer to our three main exports as canned tuna, military personnel, and NFL players. Today I would like to talk about the canned tuna, though. Due to an oversight, the Fair Minimum Wage Act, which became law in 2007, contained language that stipulated that American Samoa must raise its minimum wage by 50 cents every 3 years starting in 2009 until it meets the Federal standard. Since that time, Congress has graciously granted two waivers to American Samoa which prevents them from having to institute the increase, and wisely so. Had Congress not granted the waivers, the effects would have been absolutely devastating to our local economy, of which the tuna canneries comprise 80 percent. When the Fair Minimum Wage Act was passed in 2007, American Samoa had two canneries on the island. As a direct result of the law and concern with future wage increases, in 2009, the day after a deadly tsunami struck our island, the cannery operated by Chicken of the Sea relocated to Thailand, causing thousands to instantly lose their jobs and hundreds shortly followed. In Thailand, Chicken of the Sea now pays their workers a mere $1.25 an hour and are rumored to be cutting wages further in 2016, while the workers in [[Page H6283]] American Samoa are paid $4.76 an hour. While $4.76 may not seem like a large amount here in the States, one must realize that, in American Samoa, the cost of living is drastically different. Due to how the lands are owned and managed in American Samoa, there is actually no such thing as rent or a mortgage, items that often comprise up to one-half of a person's monthly expenses. Because our people do not have an expense for housing, $4.76 an hour goes much further than it would here in the States. While well-intended, the Fair Minimum Wage Act has placed the economic well-being of American Samoa in great jeopardy. No one would like to see the people of American Samoa prosper and have their wages increased more than I. However, this is neither the time nor mechanism for such a drastic increase, as it would surely be the proverbial nail in the coffin for the local economy, as the two canneries that are currently operating out of American Samoa have stated the strong possibility of having to leave our island because they simply would not be able to compete financially against their foreign competitors. One of these canneries just opened this year and is trying to establish a toehold in the region. Without the extension, this will be very difficult for them. Currently, due to many factors, the long-term continuity of the Pago Pago-based canneries is now threatened by reduced tuna deliveries and supply, which will negatively affect cannery production, impact cannery employment and support services, and could possibly destroy American Samoa's economy altogether. {time} 1700 Past decisions by the United States Government have led to the current dire situation.

After that, in 2014, the United States agreed to an inexcusable deal, to the detriment of American Samoa, reducing the amount of fishing days available in Kiribati waters to the United States fleet from 4,313 to just 300 days in just 1 year.

Mr. Speaker, reducing the income inequality between the people I represent in the Northern Mariana Islands and Americans in the rest of our Nation is one of my key goals as a Member of Congress. Household median income in the Marianas was just $20,000 in the last census compared to $53,000 nationwide.

But it also reflects a growth in consumption because workers who are paid more can spend more, and that is good for the economy. So I look forward to next year's increase of another 50 cents in the minimum wage in the Mariana Islands. I look forward to reaching the national minimum wage in 2019, and I support legislation raising the national minimum wage because I have now seen in my district that increasing wages can have a positive impact on economic activity and improve people's lives. At the same time, I recognize that there is such a thing as economic reality. Raising the minimum wage too quickly could have a detrimental effect, could cause employment to shrink. For that reason, over the last 7 years that I have been in Congress, I worked with Members on both sides of the aisle to tailor the minimum wage increases to the specific economic realities in my district. Instead of raising it by 50 cents every year, as the original law required, we skipped the increases in 2011, 2013, and this year, 2015. We arrived at the decision to stretch out the time of the increases by listening to employers on the island and to workers because workers also understand that increasing wages too quickly could jeopardize their jobs. We also listened carefully to the Government Accountability Office experts who look at the effect of these minimum wage increases periodically and report back to Congress. I think that, so far, as least, we have successfully walked the fine line. We have kept the minimum wage increasing--faster than prices, GAO tells us--without disrupting the economy. I am very grateful to both Democrats here in Congress, who agreed to slow down the increases, and to Republicans, who agreed to let the minimum wage keep going up. They did so, I think, because of a recognition that a relatively isolated island economy might need special consideration and because, when it comes to a decision that only affects a Member's own district, there is a tradition of deference here in Congress to the views of that Member. This is a very long way around to saying that I support H.R. 2617, the bill now under consideration. The gentlewoman from American Samoa (Mrs. Radewagen) has made the determination that what is best for her constituents is to delay further increases in the minimum wage. She too represents a relatively isolated island economy. Her constituents too have incomes much below the U.S. average. The specific economic factors in American Samoa are not the same as in the Northern Mariana Islands. So while a delay for American Samoa may be appropriate, I would not want to imply a further delay for the Northern Marianas is called for at this time. But I do think that the same courtesy that the House has provided to me, when it comes to making a judgment about the well-being of the people I represent, should be given to the Delegate from American Samoa with respect to her own district. For that reason, I urge Members to support passage of H.R. 2617. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentlewoman from American Samoa (Mrs. Radewagen). Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege for me to serve the people of American Samoa in the U.S. House of Representatives. My home district of American Samoa, an isolated group of islands, is 6 hours by plane south of Hawaii. Sometimes we jokingly refer to our three main exports as canned tuna, military personnel, and NFL players. Today I would like to talk about the canned tuna, though. Due to an oversight, the Fair Minimum Wage Act, which became law in 2007, contained language that stipulated that American Samoa must raise its minimum wage by 50 cents every 3 years starting in 2009 until it meets the Federal standard. Since that time, Congress has graciously granted two waivers to American Samoa which prevents them from having to institute the increase, and wisely so. Had Congress not granted the waivers, the effects would have been absolutely devastating to our local economy, of which the tuna canneries comprise 80 percent. When the Fair Minimum Wage Act was passed in 2007, American Samoa had two canneries on the island. As a direct result of the law and concern with future wage increases, in 2009, the day after a deadly tsunami struck our island, the cannery operated by Chicken of the Sea relocated to Thailand, causing thousands to instantly lose their jobs and hundreds shortly followed. In Thailand, Chicken of the Sea now pays their workers a mere $1.25 an hour and are rumored to be cutting wages further in 2016, while the workers in [[Page H6283]] American Samoa are paid $4.76 an hour. While $4.76 may not seem like a large amount here in the States, one must realize that, in American Samoa, the cost of living is drastically different. Due to how the lands are owned and managed in American Samoa, there is actually no such thing as rent or a mortgage, items that often comprise up to one-half of a person's monthly expenses. Because our people do not have an expense for housing, $4.76 an hour goes much further than it would here in the States. While well-intended, the Fair Minimum Wage Act has placed the economic well-being of American Samoa in great jeopardy. No one would like to see the people of American Samoa prosper and have their wages increased more than I. However, this is neither the time nor mechanism for such a drastic increase, as it would surely be the proverbial nail in the coffin for the local economy, as the two canneries that are currently operating out of American Samoa have stated the strong possibility of having to leave our island because they simply would not be able to compete financially against their foreign competitors. One of these canneries just opened this year and is trying to establish a toehold in the region. Without the extension, this will be very difficult for them. Currently, due to many factors, the long-term continuity of the Pago Pago-based canneries is now threatened by reduced tuna deliveries and supply, which will negatively affect cannery production, impact cannery employment and support services, and could possibly destroy American Samoa's economy altogether. {time} 1700 Past decisions by the United States Government have led to the current dire situation. In 2005, the U.S. Government agreed to reduce fishing opportunities by U.S. purse seine vessels on the high seas and within the U.S. EEZ. At the same time, the U.S. purse seine fleet contracted from 49 vessels in 1994 to 11 in 2007. This major shift in the management of the purse seine fishery should have been recognized by the United States Government as significant in terms of fleet operations and the impact it would have on American Samoa. Unfortunately, it seems that the territory was not considered. That same year, the U.S. allowed Taiwanese-built vessels to become U.S. flagged, thereby receiving the same benefits afforded under the South Pacific Tuna Treaty. These new vessels fish farther away from American Samoa and predominantly offload their catch in Thailand. In 2013, the U.S. Government agreed to pay a combined amount, from both government and industry, of approximately $90 million, while agreeing to further reduce the United States fishing effort on the high seas. After that, in 2014, the United States agreed to an inexcusable deal, to the detriment of American Samoa, reducing the amount of fishing days available in Kiribati waters to the United States fleet from 4,313 to just 300 days in just 1 year. Kiribati waters are typically the most productive purse seine fishing grounds in close proximity to Pago Pago. However, the American Samoa-based purse seine vessels are now forced to travel great distances, making Pago Pago canneries less desirable and increasing transshipping to foreign ports. In addition, the expansion of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument and the high seas effort limit have further reduce the fishing grounds available to the American Samoa-based purse seine fleet, lending to the dire situation facing American Samoa's local canneries. These are waters that have been fished by our people for many centuries. Like other small island developing states and territories in the Pacific, American Samoa and the fishing industry it supports should be afforded special recognition, not crushed by the worst aspects of capitalism--and I say this as a devout capitalist. Until we begin to safeguard our fishery interests in the region, American Samoa's tuna fisheries will continue to wither, creating economic ruin in American Samoa, the other Pacific territories, and even Hawaii, leaving the United States as a passive observer in the world's largest tuna fishery, leaving other nations such as China to run roughshod over fisheries to the detriment of not only the people, but the environment as well. We must reverse some of the missteps the United States has taken over the years which have left the American Samoa economy in this highly vulnerable position. The closing off of large swaths of ocean, under the guise of national monuments, which cover thousands of square miles of traditional fishing grounds that our people have used for centuries, to the reduction in allotted fishing days that have gone from over 4,000 to under 500 in just 1 year, this is certainly not the time to put further pressure on an industry that is seemingly under attack from all sides, a local industry that operates at a loss in comparison to its competitors when it comes to labor, due to their longstanding relationship with the people of American Samoa, for which we are very grateful. Mr. Speaker, I have heard some concern about Congress continuing to kick the can down the road on this issue. To those, I extend willing and eager hands for cooperation and assistance in fixing the mechanism by which the wages are set in American Samoa. The playing fields between the United States and American Samoa are too drastically different to place on the same wage scale, and to keep American Samoa tied to the current standard is dangerous and irresponsible. It is my plan to use the time granted in the extension to work on a new mechanism for setting the minimum wage rate in American Samoa, and I happily encourage fellow Members to join me in this mission. If there is ever any bill that I introduce that I wish I could vote against, this would be it. However, while it is difficult, I also know that it must be done. Oftentimes, the things that are the most difficult are also the most important, and currently, there is no issue more important to the economic well-being of American Samoa than this. I respectfully and wholeheartedly ask my colleagues in both the House and Senate to support this legislation that is so absolutely critical to the economic stability of American Samoa. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 3 minutes. Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Without it, Mr. Speaker, I am afraid we will be back here in just a few months trying to figure out a way to subsidize what is already the most economically challenged territory or State in our Nation. The tuna canning industry is all we have. There is no Coca-Cola or IBM. We have no Silicon Valley there to provide massive revenue and employment opportunity to the territory. There aren't numerous military and government facilities that provide sources of economic growth. We are not surrounded by fellow States that enable us to expand to other markets. All we have is the tuna industry, and we are grateful for them. So again, I graciously ask my fellow colleagues to support this unfortunate, yet essential, piece of legislation. If you cannot support it, all I ask is that you do not block it, because it would be absolutely devastating to our people. I want to thank Chairman Kline, Ranking Member Scott, and the committee staff for their assistance in getting this measure to the floor, as well as the numerous other staff and Members who put in many hours of hard work to get us here today. Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I do urge my colleagues to please support H.R. 2617. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, as I noted earlier, this effort is supported by local leaders in American Samoa. It is supported by employers in American Samoa, and, most importantly, it is supported by the working men and women of American Samoa. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by [[Page H6284]] the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bishop) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2617, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_54.csv,20376,20376,20448,"[congressional record volume 161, number 140 (monday, september 28, 2015)] [house] [pages h6281-h6284] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] american samoa minimum wage increase postponement mr. bishop of michigan. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 2617) to amend the fair minimum wage act of 2007 to postpone a scheduled increase in the minimum wage applicable to american samoa, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 2617 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. minimum wage for american samoa. (a) minimum wage.--paragraph (2) of section 8103(b) of the fair minimum wage act of 2007 (29 u.s.c. 206 note) is amended to read as follows: ``(2) the minimum wage applicable to american samoa under section 6(a)(1) of the fair labor standards act of 1938 (29 u.s.c. 206(a)(1)) shall be-- ``(a) the applicable wage rate in effect for each industry and classification as of september 29, 2015; and ``(b) increased by $0.50 an hour (or such lesser amount as may be necessary to equal the minimum wage under section 6(a)(1) of such act), beginning on december 31, 2016, and on december 31 of every third year thereafter, until the minimum wage applicable to american samoa under this paragraph is equal to the minimum wage set forth in such section.''. (b) gao reports.--section 8104 of the fair minimum wage act of 2007 (29 u.s.c. 206 note) is amended-- (1) in subsection (a)-- (a) by striking ``september 1, 2011'' and inserting ``april 1, 2017''; and (b) by striking the second sentence and inserting the following: ``the government accountability office shall submit a subsequent report not later than april 1, 2020.''; (2) in subsection (b), by striking ``the study under subsection (a)'' and inserting ``any report under subsection (a)''; and (3) by adding at the end the following: ``(c) report on alternative methods of increasing the minimum wage in american samoa.--not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this subsection, the government accountability office shall transmit to congress a report on alternative ways of increasing the minimum wage in american samoa to keep pace with the cost of living in american samoa and to eventually equal the minimum wage set forth in section 6(a)(1) of the fair labor standards act of 1938 (29 u.s.c. 206(a)(1)).''. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from michigan (mr. bishop) and the gentleman from the northern mariana islands (mr. sablan) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from michigan. general leave mr. bishop of michigan. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous materials on h.r. 2617. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from michigan? there was no objection. mr. bishop of michigan. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise today in support of h.r. 2617. this legislation is simple and straightforward. it would delay for 15 months a minimum wage increase that will take effect in american samoa in just 2 days. if this increase takes effect, it will harm the very people it was intended to help, the hard-working men and women of american samoa. the reason we are here today is also quite simple. we are here because the local government in american samoa is urging us to do this. we are here because the employers in american samoa, who are few and far between, are urging us to do this. and, most importantly, we are here because the [[page h6282]] workers in american samoa are urging us to do this. you don't have to take my word for it. those are the facts that have been reported by the nonpartisan government accountability office. for years, the territory has been plagued by a weak economy, fewer jobs, and higher inflation. the tuna canning industry, an essential part of the american samoa economy, has been hit especially hard. according to our own independent government watchdog, previous wage increases have forced employers to delay expansion, limit overtime, and cut labor costs, which means that they have ultimately had to lay off workers. many fear these tough challenges will only get worse if we fail to act now. it should be noted that this isn't the first time we have had to take this step. when our democratic colleagues were in control a few years back, they passed legislation delaying the arbitrary wage increase they set in motion. that effort passed with strong bipartisan support, and i expect today's legislation will as well. i also want to note that the legislation will help us end a dangerous pattern of uncertainty and last-minute delays. under the bill, the government accountability office is required to report on alternatives to setting the minimum wage in american samoa. no doubt there are a number of alternatives congress could consider. for example, local leaders have proposed bestowing upon them the responsibility for setting wages in their local communities. while this is certainly an interesting idea, it is a debate for another day. today let's do the right thing by passing this important legislation. in closing, i wish to thank my colleague from american samoa, delegate amata radewagen, for authoring this legislative proposal and for her tireless leadership on behalf of her constituents. i urge all of my colleagues to stand with the people of american samoa and support this legislation. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. sablan. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, reducing the income inequality between the people i represent in the northern mariana islands and americans in the rest of our nation is one of my key goals as a member of congress. household median income in the marianas was just $20,000 in the last census compared to $53,000 nationwide. for that reason, i have always supported the decision made in the 110th congress to raise the minimum wage in the marianas to the u.s. level in a series of graduated steps. when that decision was enacted in public law 110-28, the locally set minimum wage in the mariana islands was just $3.05 per hour and the minimum wage had been stuck at that level since the 1990s. today the minimum wage has effectively doubled to $6.05 and will increase to $6.55 a year from now. that doubling of the minimum wage has occurred during a period of economic difficulty for the mariana islands. gross domestic product was dropping by 8 percent, 12 percent, 19 percent in the first 3 years of minimum wage increase. i should say, however, that these drops had nothing to do with the wage and everything to do with the loss of manufacturing because of the general agreement of tariffs and trade and because of a loss of tourism. in the most recent year for which gdp data is available for our islands, we had economic growth of 4.4 percent, even as the minimum wage continued to rise. the u.s. bureau of economic analysis says that this economic growth reflects a growth in tourism, especially an increase in tourism from china. but it also reflects a growth in consumption because workers who are paid more can spend more, and that is good for the economy. so i look forward to next year's increase of another 50 cents in the minimum wage in the mariana islands. i look forward to reaching the national minimum wage in 2019, and i support legislation raising the national minimum wage because i have now seen in my district that increasing wages can have a positive impact on economic activity and improve people's lives. at the same time, i recognize that there is such a thing as economic reality. raising the minimum wage too quickly could have a detrimental effect, could cause employment to shrink. for that reason, over the last 7 years that i have been in congress, i worked with members on both sides of the aisle to tailor the minimum wage increases to the specific economic realities in my district. instead of raising it by 50

employers on the island and to workers because workers also understand that increasing wages too quickly could jeopardize their jobs. we also listened carefully to the government accountability office experts who look at the effect of these minimum wage increases periodically and report back to congress. i think that, so far, as least, we have successfully walked the fine line. we have kept the minimum wage increasing--faster than prices, gao tells us--without disrupting the economy. i am very grateful to both democrats here in congress, who agreed to slow down the increases, and to republicans, who agreed to let the minimum wage keep going up. they did so, i think, because of a recognition that a relatively isolated island economy might need special consideration and because, when it comes to a decision that only affects a member's own district, there is a tradition of deference here in congress to the views of that member. this is a very long way around to saying that i support h.r. 2617, the bill now under consideration. the gentlewoman from american samoa (mrs. radewagen) has made the determination that what is best for her constituents is to delay further

minutes to the gentlewoman from american samoa (mrs. radewagen). mrs. radewagen. mr. speaker, it is an honor and a privilege for me to serve the people of american samoa in the u.s. house of representatives. my home district of american samoa, an isolated group of islands, is 6 hours by plane south of hawaii. sometimes we jokingly refer to our three main exports as canned tuna, military

while agreeing to further reduce the united states fishing effort on the high seas. after that, in 2014, the united states agreed to an inexcusable deal, to the detriment of american samoa, reducing the amount of fishing days available in kiribati waters to the united states fleet from 4,313 to just 300 days in just 1 year. kiribati waters are typically the most productive purse seine fishing grounds in close proximity to pago pago. however, the american samoa-based purse seine vessels are now forced to travel great distances, making pago pago canneries less desirable and increasing

the american samoa-based purse seine fleet, lending to the dire situation facing american samoa's local canneries. these are waters that have been fished by our people for many centuries. like other small island developing states and territories in the pacific, american samoa and the fishing industry it supports should be afforded special recognition, not crushed by the worst aspects of capitalism--and i say this as a devout capitalist. until we begin to safeguard our fishery interests in the region, american samoa's tuna fisheries will continue to wither, creating economic ruin in american samoa, the other pacific territories, and even hawaii, leaving the united states as a passive observer in the world's largest tuna fishery, leaving other nations such as china to run roughshod over fisheries to the detriment of not only the people, but the environment as well. we must reverse some of the missteps the united states has taken over the years which have left the american samoa economy in this highly vulnerable position. the closing off of large swaths of ocean, under the guise of national monuments, which cover thousands of square miles of traditional fishing grounds that our people have used for centuries, to the reduction in allotted fishing days that have gone from over 4,000 to under 500 in just 1 year, this is certainly not the time to put further pressure on an industry that is seemingly under attack from all sides, a local industry that operates at a loss in comparison to its competitors when it comes to labor, due to their longstanding relationship with the people of american samoa, for which we are very grateful. mr. speaker, i have heard some concern about congress continuing to kick the can down the road on this issue. to those,

(b) GAO Audit.--The Comptroller General of the United States shall periodically audit U.S. Customs and Border Protection operations at rail crossings on the northern and southern international borders to ensure rail shipments are targeted, examined, and the results of such examinations properly documented. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Vela) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona. General Leave Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Arizona? There was no objection. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2786, the Cross-Border Rail Security Act of 2015. First, I would like to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Vela), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security, for introducing this thoughtful bill and working in a collaborative manner as this legislation moved through the committee process. Mr. Speaker, this legislation requires the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection to submit a report to Congress that outlines how and when high-risk rail shipments entering the United States are scanned for potential risks. The impetus for this legislation was a recent inspector general report that found CBP was inadequately targeting high-risk rail shipments arriving in the U.S. from Canada and Mexico. This bill will help Congress better understand the frequency and location of such high-risk shipments and detail the current state of radiation detection equipment on our international railways. Mr. Speaker, as many of my colleagues who also live along the border know, each year approximately 2.7 million containers enter the United States by rail. While most of the commodities transferred by rail do not pose significant homeland security threats, we must ensure that we are properly identifying and targeting those shipments which are high risk and conduct physical scanning when necessary. To ensure proper oversight, it is very important to understand the capabilities of CBP, including the number, location, and type of detection equipment used at each cross-border rail crossing. We also need to understand what additional equipment and training is necessary to ensure our rail cargo system is secure. As we know, proper training is an important force multiplier which will help maximize effectiveness of our Customs and Border Protection Officers, reducing wait times and increasing security. Finally, H.R. 2786 requires the Government Accountability Office to perform a series of audits over CBP's targeting of cross-border rail shipments. Mr. Speaker, rail cargo is expected to increase over the next 10 years. This bill will ensure CBP adequately addresses this vulnerability and implements proper standards of screening and targeting for rail cargo. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2786. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2786, the Cross-Border Rail Security Act. Mr. Speaker, in March of this year, the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general released a report on high-risk cross- border rail cargo. The report concluded that U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, did not always use the required radiation detection equipment to examine shipments it determined to be high risk. Additionally, some ports of entry lacked the appropriate equipment to conduct these screenings, and training and oversight of targeting and examining such shipments was lacking. In response to these troubling findings, my bill would require the CBP Commissioner to submit to the relevant congressional committees within 180 days of enactment a report regarding high-risk cross-border rail cargo shipments entering the United States. Mr. Speaker, my bill would require the report to include information on the number of high-risk shipments crossing the border by rail, details on the radiation detection units at rail crossings, an assessment of whether additional equipment is necessary, and a plan for ensuring that all relevant CBP personnel receive appropriate training to appropriately target, examine, and record the disposition of such shipments. The bill requires the Government Accountability Office to audit periodically CBP operations at rail crossings to ensure rail shipments are being appropriately targeted, examined, and documented. The community I represent has a vested interest in securing cross- border rail cargo. This past August, I was proud to be a part of the opening of the West Rail Bypass International Bridge located in Brownsville, Texas, the first international new rail crossing between the U.S. and Mexico in over a century. Both of our land borders are dotted with these crossings, and, in fact, the majority of them are located on the northern border. The cargo that crosses by rail is destined for locations all over the United States, making the effective targeting and examining of high- risk shipments a national concern. Mr. Speaker, my committee colleagues unanimously supported this bill, and I urge all of my colleagues to help strengthen the cross-border rail security by supporting H.R. 2786. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. {time} 1715 Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2786. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, I rise in support of H.R. 2786, the ``Cross-Border Rail Security Act of 2015,'' which directs U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to report to Congress on its inspection of high-risk shipments entering the United States by rail. [[Page H6285]] Specifically, H.R. 2786 requires the CBP to report on the following matters related to homeland security: the number of high-risk rail shipments annually entering the country; the status of radiation detection units at each border rail crossing; and an assessment of whether additional radiation detection equipment is necessary. The bill also requires CBP to develop a plan for ensuring that all relevant CBP personnel receive adequate training and guidance on the proper use of CBP's Automated Targeting System for such shipments, and in the use of appropriate radiation detection equipment for shipment examination, and requirements for recording examination results. H.R. 2786 bill also requires the General Accountability Office to periodically audit CBP operations at rail crossings on borders to ensure rail shipments are targeted, examined, and the examination results are well documented. Mr. Speaker, this bill is good for our nation and for my congressional district, which is centered in Houston, Texas. Houston has been the hub of railroad hub of Texas since the 1880s and is known as the place ``where 17 railroads meet the sea.'' It is also the ``the energy capital of the world.'' Freight from the Houston area goes by railroad to destinations all over the United States, including Los Angeles, Long Beach, New York City, Charleston, and Savannah. Over 1 billion tons of freight travels through Houston area each year; no other state comes close to the level of trade the metropolitan Houston region experiences. One billion tons of freight leaves the Houston area each year, nearly two/ thirds of which (645 million tons) involve goods come from foreign sources. The top foreign freight origination point for the City of Houston is Mexico. Mexico supplies over 50% of all international freight in the Houston area. Europe and Canada are Houston's second largest foreign freight trading partners, accounting for over 27% of international freight in the Houston area. Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in supporting H.R. 2786 because the safety of rail transit is critical to the security of the homeland and strength of our economy. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2786. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered.

my bill would require the cbp commissioner to submit to the relevant congressional committees within 180 days of enactment a report regarding high-risk cross-border rail cargo shipments entering the united states. mr. speaker, my bill would require the report to include information on the number of high-risk shipments crossing the border by rail, details on the radiation detection units at rail crossings, an assessment of whether additional equipment is necessary, and a plan for ensuring that all relevant cbp personnel receive appropriate training to appropriately target, examine, and record the disposition of such shipments. the bill requires the government accountability office to audit periodically cbp operations at rail crossings to ensure rail shipments are being appropriately targeted, examined, and documented. the community i represent has a vested interest in securing cross- border rail cargo. this past august, i was proud to be a part of the opening of the west rail bypass international bridge located in brownsville, texas, the first international new rail crossing between the u.s. and mexico in over a century. both of our land borders are dotted with these crossings, and, in fact, the majority of them are located on the northern border. the cargo that crosses by rail is destined for locations all over the united states, making the effective targeting and examining of high- risk shipments a national concern. mr. speaker, my committee colleagues unanimously supported this bill, and i urge all of my colleagues to help strengthen the cross-border rail security by supporting h.r. 2786. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. {time} 1715 ms. mcsally. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i once again urge my colleagues to support h.r. 2786. i yield back the balance of my time. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, as a senior member of the homeland security committee, i rise in support of h.r. 2786, the ``cross-border rail security act of 2015,'' which directs u.s. customs and border protection (cbp) to report to congress on its inspection of high-risk shipments entering the united states by rail. [[page h6285]] specifically, h.r. 2786 requires the cbp to report on the following matters related to homeland security: the number of high-risk rail shipments annually entering the country; the status of radiation detection units at each border rail crossing; and an assessment of whether additional radiation detection equipment is necessary. the bill also requires cbp to develop a plan for ensuring that all relevant cbp personnel receive adequate training and guidance on the proper use of cbp's automated targeting system for such shipments, and in the use of appropriate radiation detection equipment for shipment examination, and requirements for recording examination results. h.r. 2786 bill also requires the general accountability office to periodically audit cbp operations at rail crossings on borders to ensure rail shipments are targeted, examined, and the examination results are well documented. mr. speaker, this bill is good for our nation and for my congressional district, which is centered in houston, texas. houston has been the hub of railroad hub of texas since the 1880s and is known as the place ``where 17 railroads meet the sea.'' it is also the ``the energy capital of the world.'' freight from the houston area goes by railroad to destinations all over the united states, including los angeles, long beach, new york city, charleston, and savannah. over 1 billion tons of freight travels through houston area each year; no other state comes close to the level of trade the metropolitan houston region experiences. one billion tons of freight leaves the houston area each year, nearly two/ thirds of which (645 million tons) involve goods come from foreign sources. the top foreign freight origination point for the city of houston is mexico. mexico supplies over 50% of all international freight in the houston area. europe and canada are houston's second largest foreign freight trading partners, accounting for over 27% of international freight in the houston area. mr. speaker, i ask that my colleagues join me in supporting h.r. 2786 because the safety of rail transit is critical to the security of the homeland and strength of our economy. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from arizona (ms. mcsally) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 2786. the question was taken. the speaker pro tempore. in the opinion of the chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. mr. vela. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",10820

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Arizona? There was no objection. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 2835, the Border Jobs for Veterans [[Page H6286]] Act of 2015. This bill, which I introduced in June, seeks to increase the hiring of military veterans for Customs and Border Protection officer positions vital to our security here at home. The Border Jobs for Veterans Act addresses two critical priorities: ensuring full staffing at our ports of entry and helping separating servicemembers transition to civilian life. My district includes over 80 miles of the U.S. border as well as several ports of entry. I visited our ports in Nogales and Douglas numerous times to hear about their operations firsthand and have seen the critical law enforcement duties carried out by CBP officers at these ports, such as screening visitors, returning U.S. citizens, and cargo entering the United States. In June, the Port Authority chair for the Mariposa port of entry in Nogales, just outside my district, reported that, while staffing numbers have grown nationally, ``staffing numbers at Nogales and the Tucson Sector have remained essentially stagnant in recent memory while demand continues to grow.'' The port also estimates that CBP's Tucson field office is currently operating at a 20-percent staffing deficit. While new hires have occurred since then, CBP estimates the Tucson field office still needs to fill roughly 200 officer positions. In my conversations with CBP officers, they have repeatedly told me that inadequate staffing levels hamper their ability to do their jobs. They cite problems with recruiting and retention of new officers as well as lengthy and cumbersome hiring process, including delays due to backlogs of the necessary background checks. After a recent reduction in that process by roughly 50 percent, it still takes 180 days to hire a new officer at ports where there is a strong need now. These hurdles to hiring acts as an impediment to cross-border trade that powers both Arizona and the Nation's economy. According to the Arizona-Mexico Commission, more than 41.6 billion dollars' worth of trade flows through Arizona's ports of entry, $16 billion of which is attributed to bilateral trade with Mexico. But inadequate staffing at these ports of entry slows the flow of trade coming across the border, costing businesses millions of dollars, and ultimately hurts our attractiveness as a transportation and trade hub, something we simply cannot afford. Each year approximately 250,000 to 300,000 members of the Armed Forces separate from military service. I recently visited the Veterans One-Stop Center in Pima County in my district, which helps veterans find employment after they leave the military, and I listened to their challenges and their stories firsthand. Who better to address this shortfall and help to secure our ports than the highly trained patriotic Americans who just recently separated from the Armed Forces? That is why H.R. 2835 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to work with the Department of Defense to enhance our efforts to recruit members of the military who are separating to serve as Customs and Border Protection officers. These efforts must include participation in relevant job fairs, transition programs, partnerships between CBP field offices and local military bases, and the identification of ways to streamline the transfer of background checks and security clearances. This bill offers the men and women of our military another opportunity to serve the Nation. All DHS has to do is make sure that they are aware of the opportunities available at our Nation's 329 ports of entry. I want to thank my colleagues, Senators Flake, McCain, Johnson, and Schumer, and their staffs for working on the Senate companion legislation and their help on the text of this bill. I also want to thank Chairman Thornberry and his staff for working with us to move this bill forward. I urge all Members to join me in supporting the Border Jobs for Veterans Act of 2015. I reserve the balance of my time. Committee on Armed Services, House of Representatives, Washington, DC, September 25, 2015. Hon. Michael McCaul, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: I write concerning H.R. 2835, the Border Jobs for Veterans Act of 2015, which has been referred to the Committee on Armed Services. In order to expedite this legislation for floor consideration, the committee will forgo action on this bill. The committee's waiver is conditional on our mutual understanding that you will amend H.R. 2835 to reflect the changes agreed to by our staffs. Forgoing consideration of the bill does not prejudice the committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the provisions contained in the bill or similar legislation that fall within the committee's Rule X jurisdiction. I request that you urge the Speaker to appoint members of the committee to any conference committee convened to consider such provisions. Please place a copy of this letter and your response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the committee report on H.R. 2835 and into the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Sincerely, William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC, September 28, 2015. Hon. Mac Thornberry, Chairman, House Armed Services Committee, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Thornberry: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 2835, the ``Border Jobs for Veterans Act of 2015.'' I appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the House Armed Services Committee will forego action on the bill. The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual understanding that the language in the bill reflects the negotiations between our staffs and that by foregoing consideration of this bill at this time, the House Armed Services Committee does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the House Armed Services Committee represented on the conference committee. I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, Michael T. McCaul, Chairman. Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H.R. 2835, the Border Jobs for Veterans Act of 2015. First of all, I would like to thank my colleague, Congresswoman McSally, for introducing this wonderful piece of legislation. It not only helps us expedite the flow of traffic in trade at our borders, but it also helps and assists with our veterans we all represent. H.R. 2835, the Border Jobs for Veterans Act of 2015, would require the Secretary of Homeland Security to consider expediting the hiring of qualified veterans to serve as U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers. The bill also authorizes DHS to enhance its efforts to recruit members of the Armed Forces who are separating from military service to serve as CBP officers and requires DHS to report to Congress on its efforts. Through their service, our Nation's veterans have demonstrated their unwavering commitment to our country and its security. CBP would benefit greatly from their service within the agency's ranks. At the same time, expediting the hiring of qualified veterans could help alleviate the continued shortage of CBP officers at our ports of entry, helping to better secure our borders while facilitating legitimate trade and travel. With that in mind, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2835, to facilitate the recruitment and hiring of America's military veterans for new careers serving our country as U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2835. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2835, ``Border Jobs for Veterans Act of 2015.'' which would guarantee more jobs for our many deserving veterans. This bill requires the Homeland Security Department to prioritize the hiring of U.S. veterans as Custom and Border Protection (CBP) officers. [[Page H6287]] The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the unemployment rate for our veterans is 7.2%, which is roughly 573,000 unemployed veterans nationally. A study commissioned by the Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration found that in 2008, delays at POEs at the U.S.- Mexico border cost the U.S. economy 26,000 jobs, $600 million in lost tax revenue, and $5.8 billion in lost economic output. According to CBP, 2,000 additional CBPOs will lead to the creation of approximately 66,000 new jobs and increase the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the U.S. by up to $4 billion. The bill will ensure that: CBP officials will be at recruiting events and jobs fairs for armed service members; Partnerships are fostered between military bases in regions where CBP Officers work; Opportunities for the expedited hiring of certain service members with qualifications needed by CBP are prioritized; and Transfers of relevant background investigations and security clearances are streamlined to facilitate transitions from military life to employment at the CBP. Mr. Speaker, I introduced H.R. 76, the ``Helping to Encourage Real Opportunity for Veterans Transitioning from Battlespace to Workplace Act of 2015,'' the HEROS Act, which is very similar to spirit to the bill before the House. Studies have shown that more than 80% of veterans transitioning from military service to the civilian sector regard employer-provided Veterans support programs as ``critical'' or ``important'' to their success. The ``HERO Transitioning from Battlespace to Workplace Act of 2014'' addressed these problems by providing strong incentives for employers to hire, retain, and employ veterans in positions that take maximum advantage of their skills and experience. Nearly 90% of veterans believe they have the general skills needed to land their ideal job such as problem solving, leadership, ethics, and time management and most believe they possess specific marketable skills, such as information technology, health care, mechanical, and aviation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2835, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Ms. McSally. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6285-H6287] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BORDER JOBS FOR VETERANS ACT OF 2015 Ms. McSALLY.

With that in mind, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2835, to facilitate the recruitment and hiring of America's military veterans for new careers serving our country as U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2835. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2835, ``Border Jobs for Veterans Act of 2015.'' which would guarantee more jobs for our many deserving veterans. This bill requires the Homeland Security Department to prioritize the hiring of U.S. veterans as Custom and Border Protection (CBP) officers. [[Page H6287]] The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the unemployment rate for our veterans is 7.2%, which is roughly 573,000 unemployed veterans nationally. A study commissioned by the Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration found that in 2008, delays at POEs at the U.S.- Mexico border cost the U.S. economy 26,000 jobs, $600 million in lost tax revenue, and $5.8 billion in lost economic output. According to CBP, 2,000 additional CBPOs will lead to the creation of approximately 66,000 new jobs and increase the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the U.S. by up to $4 billion. The bill will ensure that: CBP officials will be at recruiting events and jobs fairs for armed service members; Partnerships are fostered between military bases in regions where CBP Officers work; Opportunities for the expedited hiring of certain service members with qualifications needed by CBP are prioritized; and Transfers of relevant background investigations and security clearances are streamlined to facilitate transitions from military life to employment at the CBP. Mr. Speaker, I introduced H.R. 76, the ``Helping to Encourage Real Opportunity for Veterans Transitioning from Battlespace to Workplace Act of 2015,'' the HEROS Act, which is very similar to spirit to the bill before the House. Studies have shown that more than 80% of veterans transitioning from military service to the civilian sector regard employer-provided Veterans support programs as ``critical'' or ``important'' to their success. The ``HERO Transitioning from Battlespace to Workplace Act of 2014'' addressed these problems by providing strong incentives for employers to hire, retain, and employ veterans in positions that take maximum advantage of their skills and experience. Nearly 90% of veterans believe they have the general skills needed to land their ideal job such as problem solving, leadership, ethics, and time management and most believe they possess specific marketable skills, such as information technology, health care, mechanical, and aviation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2835, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Ms. McSally. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6285-H6287] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BORDER JOBS FOR VETERANS ACT OF 2015 Ms. McSALLY.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Arizona? There was no objection. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 2835, the Border Jobs for Veterans [[Page H6286]] Act of 2015. This bill, which I introduced in June, seeks to increase the hiring of military veterans for Customs and Border Protection officer positions vital to our security here at home. The Border Jobs for Veterans Act addresses two critical priorities: ensuring full staffing at our ports of entry and helping separating servicemembers transition to civilian life. My district includes over 80 miles of the U.S. border as well as several ports of entry. I visited our ports in Nogales and Douglas numerous times to hear about their operations firsthand and have seen the critical law enforcement duties carried out by CBP officers at these ports, such as screening visitors, returning U.S. citizens, and cargo entering the United States. In June, the Port Authority chair for the Mariposa port of entry in Nogales, just outside my district, reported that, while staffing numbers have grown nationally, ``staffing numbers at Nogales and the Tucson Sector have remained essentially stagnant in recent memory while demand continues to grow.'' The port also estimates that CBP's Tucson field office is currently operating at a 20-percent staffing deficit. While new hires have occurred since then, CBP estimates the Tucson field office still needs to fill roughly 200 officer positions. In my conversations with CBP officers, they have repeatedly told me that inadequate staffing levels hamper their ability to do their jobs. They cite problems with recruiting and retention of new officers as well as lengthy and cumbersome hiring process, including delays due to backlogs of the necessary background checks. After a recent reduction in that process by roughly 50 percent, it still takes 180 days to hire a new officer at ports where there is a strong need now. These hurdles to hiring acts as an impediment to cross-border trade that powers both Arizona and the Nation's economy. According to the Arizona-Mexico Commission, more than 41.6 billion dollars' worth of trade flows through Arizona's ports of entry, $16 billion of which is attributed to bilateral trade with Mexico. But inadequate staffing at these ports of entry slows the flow of trade coming across the border, costing businesses millions of dollars, and ultimately hurts our attractiveness as a transportation and trade hub, something we simply cannot afford. Each year approximately 250,000 to 300,000 members of the Armed Forces separate from military service. I recently visited the Veterans One-Stop Center in Pima County in my district, which helps veterans find employment after they leave the military, and I listened to their challenges and their stories firsthand. Who better to address this shortfall and help to secure our ports than the highly trained patriotic Americans who just recently separated from the Armed Forces? That is why H.R. 2835 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to work with the Department of Defense to enhance our efforts to recruit members of the military who are separating to serve as Customs and Border Protection officers. These efforts must include participation in relevant job fairs, transition programs, partnerships between CBP field offices and local military bases, and the identification of ways to streamline the transfer of background checks and security clearances. This bill offers the men and women of our military another opportunity to serve the Nation. All DHS has to do is make sure that they are aware of the opportunities available at our Nation's 329 ports of entry. I want to thank my colleagues, Senators Flake, McCain, Johnson, and Schumer, and their staffs for working on the Senate companion legislation and their help on the text of this bill. I also want to thank Chairman Thornberry and his staff for working with us to move this bill forward. I urge all Members to join me in supporting the Border Jobs for Veterans Act of 2015. I reserve the balance of my time. Committee on Armed Services, House of Representatives, Washington, DC, September 25, 2015. Hon. Michael McCaul, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: I write concerning H.R. 2835, the Border Jobs for Veterans Act of 2015, which has been referred to the Committee on Armed Services. In order to expedite this legislation for floor consideration, the committee will forgo action on this bill. The committee's waiver is conditional on our mutual understanding that you will amend H.R. 2835 to reflect the changes agreed to by our staffs. Forgoing consideration of the bill does not prejudice the committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the provisions contained in the bill or similar legislation that fall within the committee's Rule X jurisdiction. I request that you urge the Speaker to appoint members of the committee to any conference committee convened to consider such provisions. Please place a copy of this letter and your response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the committee report on H.R. 2835 and into the Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Sincerely, William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC, September 28, 2015. Hon. Mac Thornberry, Chairman, House Armed Services Committee, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Thornberry: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 2835, the ``Border Jobs for Veterans Act of 2015.'' I appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the House Armed Services Committee will forego action on the bill. The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual understanding that the language in the bill reflects the negotiations between our staffs and that by foregoing consideration of this bill at this time, the House Armed Services Committee does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the House Armed Services Committee represented on the conference committee. I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, Michael T. McCaul, Chairman. Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in strong support of H.R. 2835, the Border Jobs for Veterans Act of 2015. First of all, I would like to thank my colleague, Congresswoman McSally, for introducing this wonderful piece of legislation. It not only helps us expedite the flow of traffic in trade at our borders, but it also helps and assists with our veterans we all represent. H.R. 2835, the Border Jobs for Veterans Act of 2015, would require the Secretary of Homeland Security to consider expediting the hiring of qualified veterans to serve as U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers. The bill also authorizes DHS to enhance its efforts to recruit members of the Armed Forces who are separating from military service to serve as CBP officers and requires DHS to report to Congress on its efforts. Through their service, our Nation's veterans have demonstrated their unwavering commitment to our country and its security. CBP would benefit greatly from their service within the agency's ranks. At the same time, expediting the hiring of qualified veterans could help alleviate the continued shortage of CBP officers at our ports of entry, helping to better secure our borders while facilitating legitimate trade and travel.

[[page h6287]] the bureau of labor statistics reports that the unemployment rate for our veterans is 7.2%, which is roughly 573,000 unemployed veterans nationally. a study commissioned by the department of commerce's international trade administration found that in 2008, delays at poes at the u.s.- mexico border cost the u.s. economy 26,000 jobs, $600 million in lost tax revenue, and $5.8 billion in lost economic output. according to cbp, 2,000 additional cbpos will lead to the creation of approximately 66,000 new jobs and increase the gross domestic product (gdp) of the u.s. by up to $4 billion. the bill will ensure that: cbp officials will be at recruiting events and jobs fairs for armed service members; partnerships are fostered between military bases in regions where cbp officers work; opportunities for the expedited hiring of certain service members with qualifications needed by cbp are prioritized; and transfers of relevant background investigations and security clearances are streamlined to facilitate transitions from military life to employment at the cbp. mr. speaker, i introduced h.r. 76, the ``helping to encourage real opportunity for veterans transitioning from battlespace to workplace act of 2015,'' the heros act, which is very similar to spirit to the bill before the house. studies have shown that more than 80% of veterans transitioning from military service to the civilian sector regard employer-provided veterans support programs as ``critical'' or ``important'' to their success. the ``hero transitioning from battlespace to workplace act of 2014'' addressed these problems by providing strong incentives for employers to hire, retain, and employ veterans in positions that take maximum advantage of their skills and experience. nearly 90% of veterans believe they have the general skills needed to land their ideal job such as problem solving, leadership, ethics, and time management and most believe they possess specific marketable skills, such as information technology, health care, mechanical, and aviation. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from arizona (ms. mcsally) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 2835, as amended. the question was taken. the speaker pro tempore. in the opinion of the chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. ms. mcsally. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",18015

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Peterson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. General Leave Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 2051, the Agriculture Reauthorizations Act of 2015. Mr. Speaker, on June 9, the House passed three individual bills: the Mandatory Price Reporting Act of 2015; the United States Grain Standards Reauthorization Act of 2015; and the National Forest Foundation Reauthorization Act of 2015. For each of these, the Committee on Agriculture held hearings and business meetings, and the House acted in a timely manner to ensure the continuation of these critical programs. I am proud of the fact that the House worked its will in a bipartisan manner following regular order throughout. Just last week the other body worked its will, combining these three bills into a single bill before us. Though modifications were made that I do not agree with, it is imperative that the House pass this legislation in advance of the authority for price reporting and grain inspection expiring on Wednesday evening. Failure to enact this legislation today will have devastating impacts on our Nation's meat industries and grain exporters. I urge the House to adopt this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2051, a bill to reauthorize the Mandatory Price Reporting Act, the United States Grain Standards Act, and the National Forest Foundation Act. Legislative language to reauthorize each of these was introduced, reported by the House Agriculture Committee, and passed by the House on voice vote as standalone measures on June 10th of this year. The first two, the Mandatory Price Reporting Act and the Grain Standards Act authorities are set to expire in just a few days. As passed by the House, each of these measures enjoyed wide bipartisan support from Members as well as support from each of the impacted industries. Unfortunately, after passing through the other chamber, we are left with bill language that is somewhat less than ideal, but at least maintains these critical program authorities for 5 more years. In the development of the Mandatory Price Reporting Act and with each of its subsequent reauthorizations, we have asked the impacted industries to work together in a cooperative spirit to develop their legislative proposals and submit only those that are unanimously supported. The meat and livestock industries did just that this past spring. Those proposals were reviewed in a hearing in the Subcommittee on Livestock and Foreign Agriculture on April 22nd, bill language was introduced in the House, a business meeting was held, and the House unanimously passed the bill. Unfortunately, a demand was made in the other body that the bill be modified to remove language of critical importance to our constituents. Thus, we have before us today a bill that is less than what our constituents requested. Yet if we fail to act, a program of critical importance to the meat and livestock industries would expire leaving these industries in a quandary. It is a shame that politics must interfere with policy on even the simplest measures, but we must move forward. The United States Grain Standards Act reauthorization faced similar challenges in the other body. As my colleagues will recall, last summer amid an ongoing labor dispute, the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) discontinued mandatory grain weighing and grading services. In statements issued at the time, WSDA acknowledged that they withheld inspection services because of their belief that the ``continued provision of inspections services appears to have been unhelpful in leading to any foreseeable resolution'' of the labor dispute. Instead of fulfilling their statutory obligation, the leadership of the U.S. Department of Agriculture politicized this situation when the agency declined to fulfill its statutory responsibility to resume inspection and weighing services. Services were eventually restored, but not before significant costs accrued to all parties involved. We have worked hard to gain access to overseas markets. We are shooting ourselves in the foot when we cannot ship our products to these markets because State and Federal agencies are unable or unwilling to comply with their obligations. To not be able to ship our grain because there are no inspectors at a facility does a disservice to our farmers, and it harms our economy. To address this situation, the House could have been punitive. In fact, there were some in the industry that would have preferred that. But that is not what we were interested in doing. We simply wanted to develop a safeguard mechanism to avoid this situation being repeated. To do that, we worked with the Washington State delegation, the Washington State Department of Agriculture, labor unions, industry and even the USDA. What we developed was bipartisan consensus on a workable safeguard provision. Nevertheless, the bill as adopted in the other body provides little safeguard against future abuses of discretion. I cannot emphasize this enough--it is imperative that these inspection and weighing services are provided in a reliable, uninterrupted, consistent and cost-effective manner. To ensure that we fulfill this obligation, we must learn the lessons of history or it is doomed to repeat itself. To this end, the Secretary of Agriculture is instructed to take prompt action to provide for restoration of official grain inspection service as soon as he receives notice or otherwise learns about the impending disruption from a delegated State agency. In this regard, as a way of not allowing the Secretary to sit on his hands after learning that a disruption in official service was imminent, the Secretary is required to: [[Page H6290]] 1. Immediately take such actions as are necessary to address the disruption and resume inspection and weighing services; and 2. Not later than 24 hours after receiving notice or otherwise learning of the impending disruption of such inspection or weighing, or after the start of such disruption in official service, whichever is earlier, submit to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry of the Senate a report that describes the disruptions and any actions necessary to address the concerns of the Secretary relating to the disruption so that inspections or weighings may resume. On a positive note, another critical element of the House bill was retained wherein the Secretary will be obligated to waive official weighing and inspection requirements in both cases of emergency as well as other circumstances as long as the waiver does not impair the underlying objectives of the statute and the buyers and sellers agree and provide documentation of the agreement to the Secretary. This waiver requirement is intended to provide certainty to trading partners as well as U.S. suppliers. Since its charter in 1993, the National Forest Foundation provides the ability to leverage private and federal dollars to support our Nation's great forests in a variety of ways. In recent years, the Foundation has leveraged funds at over a 4 to 1 ratio and plans to continue on this success to raise at least $125 million for forest restoration activities. Simply put, the National Forest Foundation works, and this is a common-sense reauthorization. While I recognize that concessions were made resulting in less than ideal bill text, at the end of the day, H.R. 2051 provides certainty to American agriculture, and I would urge my colleagues to support it. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2051. This bipartisan legislation reauthorizes the Mandatory Price Reporting Act, the National Forest Foundation Act, and the U.S. Grain Standards Act. This bill continues the tradition of bipartisan, bicameral work done by the Agriculture Committees. Important livestock price reporting programs will be continued under the bill's mandatory price reporting provisions. Producers rely on access to transparent, accurate, and timely market information, and H.R. 2051 will provide that certainty. The National Forest Foundation Act is the type of public-private collaboration we should all be able to support, giving private groups and stakeholders a chance to help in the stewardship and management of our national forests and grasslands. H.R. 2051 will ensure that this partnership can continue. Finally, the U.S. Grain Standards Reauthorization Act will allow the Federal Grain Inspection Service to continue official weighing and inspection services. Both grain buyers and sellers rely on a gold standard quality assurance, backed by the Federal Government, when conducting business. Again, this is good, commonsense legislation, a bipartisan bill. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank my colleague, my ranking member, Collin Peterson. Throughout this work, he and all the Members on both sides of the aisle of the committee worked well together. It is a tribute to the way bipartisan work ought to be done in the House, and I am proud of the work the Agriculture Committee has done. I urge Members to join me in support of this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway) that the House suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 2051. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the Senate amendment was concurred in. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6287-H6290] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MANDATORY PRICE REPORTING ACT OF 2015 Mr. CONAWAY.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Peterson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. General Leave Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 2051, the Agriculture Reauthorizations Act of 2015. Mr. Speaker, on June 9, the House passed three individual bills: the Mandatory Price Reporting Act of 2015; the United States Grain Standards Reauthorization Act of 2015; and the National Forest Foundation Reauthorization Act of 2015. For each of these, the Committee on Agriculture held hearings and business meetings, and the House acted in a timely manner to ensure the continuation of these critical programs. I am proud of the fact that the House worked its will in a bipartisan manner following regular order throughout. Just last week the other body worked its will, combining these three bills into a single bill before us. Though modifications were made that I do not agree with, it is imperative that the House pass this legislation in advance of the authority for price reporting and grain inspection expiring on Wednesday evening. Failure to enact this legislation today will have devastating impacts on our Nation's meat industries and grain exporters. I urge the House to adopt this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2051, a bill to reauthorize the Mandatory Price Reporting Act, the United States Grain Standards Act, and the National Forest Foundation Act. Legislative language to reauthorize each of these was introduced, reported by the House Agriculture Committee, and passed by the House on voice vote as standalone measures on June 10th of this year. The first two, the Mandatory Price Reporting Act and the Grain Standards Act authorities are set to expire in just a few days. As passed by the House, each of these measures enjoyed wide bipartisan support from Members as well as support from each of the impacted industries. Unfortunately, after passing through the other chamber, we are left with bill language that is somewhat less than ideal, but at least maintains these critical program authorities for 5 more years. In the development of the Mandatory Price Reporting Act and with each of its subsequent reauthorizations, we have asked the impacted industries to work together in a cooperative spirit to develop their legislative proposals and submit only those that are unanimously supported. The meat and livestock industries did just that this past spring. Those proposals were reviewed in a hearing in the Subcommittee on Livestock and Foreign Agriculture on April 22nd, bill language was introduced in the House, a business meeting was held, and the House unanimously passed the bill. Unfortunately, a demand was made in the other body that the bill be modified to remove language of critical importance to our constituents. Thus, we have before us today a bill that is less than what our constituents requested. Yet if we fail to act, a program of critical importance to the meat and livestock industries would expire leaving these industries in a quandary. It is a shame that politics must interfere with policy on even the simplest measures, but we must move forward. The United States Grain Standards Act reauthorization faced similar challenges in the other body. As my colleagues will recall, last summer amid an ongoing labor dispute, the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) discontinued mandatory grain weighing and grading services. In statements issued at the time, WSDA acknowledged that they withheld inspection services because of their belief that the ``continued provision of inspections services appears to have been unhelpful in leading to any foreseeable resolution'' of the labor dispute. Instead of fulfilling their statutory obligation, the leadership of the U.S. Department of Agriculture politicized this situation when the agency declined to fulfill its statutory responsibility to resume inspection and weighing services. Services were eventually restored, but not before significant costs accrued to all parties involved. We have worked hard to gain access to overseas markets. We are shooting ourselves in the foot when we cannot ship our products to these markets because State and Federal agencies are unable or unwilling to comply with their obligations. To not be able to ship our grain because there are no inspectors at a facility does a disservice to our farmers, and it harms our economy. To address this situation, the House could have been punitive. In fact, there were some in the industry that would have preferred that. But that is not what we were interested in doing. We simply wanted to develop a safeguard mechanism to avoid this situation being repeated. To do that, we worked with the Washington State delegation, the Washington State Department of Agriculture, labor unions, industry and even the USDA. What we developed was bipartisan consensus on a workable safeguard provision. Nevertheless, the bill as adopted in the other body provides little safeguard against future abuses of discretion. I cannot emphasize this enough--it is imperative that these inspection and weighing services are provided in a reliable, uninterrupted, consistent and cost-effective manner. To ensure that we fulfill this obligation, we must learn the lessons of history or it is doomed to repeat itself. To this end, the Secretary of Agriculture is instructed to take prompt action to provide for restoration of official grain inspection service as soon as he receives notice or otherwise learns about the impending disruption from a delegated State agency. In this regard, as a way of not allowing the Secretary to sit on his hands after learning that a disruption in official service was imminent, the Secretary is required to: [[Page H6290]] 1. Immediately take such actions as are necessary to address the disruption and resume inspection and weighing services; and 2. Not later than 24 hours after receiving notice or otherwise learning of the impending disruption of such inspection or weighing, or after the start of such disruption in official service, whichever is earlier, submit to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry of the Senate a report that describes the disruptions and any actions necessary to address the concerns of the Secretary relating to the disruption so that inspections or weighings may resume. On a positive note, another critical element of the House bill was retained wherein the Secretary will be obligated to waive official weighing and inspection requirements in both cases of emergency as well as other circumstances as long as the waiver does not impair the underlying objectives of the statute and the buyers and sellers agree and provide documentation of the agreement to the Secretary. This waiver requirement is intended to provide certainty to trading partners as well as U.S. suppliers. Since its charter in 1993, the National Forest Foundation provides the ability to leverage private and federal dollars to support our Nation's great forests in a variety of ways. In recent years, the Foundation has leveraged funds at over a 4 to 1 ratio and plans to continue on this success to raise at least $125 million for forest restoration activities. Simply put, the National Forest Foundation works, and this is a common-sense reauthorization. While I recognize that concessions were made resulting in less than ideal bill text, at the end of the day, H.R. 2051 provides certainty to American agriculture, and I would urge my colleagues to support it. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2051. This bipartisan legislation reauthorizes the Mandatory Price Reporting Act, the National Forest Foundation Act, and the U.S. Grain Standards Act. This bill continues the tradition of bipartisan, bicameral work done by the Agriculture Committees. Important livestock price reporting programs will be continued under the bill's mandatory price reporting provisions. Producers rely on access to transparent, accurate, and timely market information, and H.R. 2051 will provide that certainty. The National Forest Foundation Act is the type of public-private collaboration we should all be able to support, giving private groups and stakeholders a chance to help in the stewardship and management of our national forests and grasslands. H.R. 2051 will ensure that this partnership can continue. Finally, the U.S. Grain Standards Reauthorization Act will allow the Federal Grain Inspection Service to continue official weighing and inspection services. Both grain buyers and sellers rely on a gold standard quality assurance, backed by the Federal Government, when conducting business. Again, this is good, commonsense legislation, a bipartisan bill. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank my colleague, my ranking member, Collin Peterson. Throughout this work, he and all the Members on both sides of the aisle of the committee worked well together. It is a tribute to the way bipartisan work ought to be done in the House, and I am proud of the work the Agriculture Committee has done. I urge Members to join me in support of this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway) that the House suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 2051. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the Senate amendment was concurred in. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6287-H6290] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MANDATORY PRICE REPORTING ACT OF 2015 Mr. CONAWAY.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Peterson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. General Leave Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 2051, the Agriculture Reauthorizations Act of 2015. Mr. Speaker, on June 9, the House passed three individual bills: the Mandatory Price Reporting Act of 2015; the United States Grain Standards Reauthorization Act of 2015; and the National Forest Foundation Reauthorization Act of 2015. For each of these, the Committee on Agriculture held hearings and business meetings, and the House acted in a timely manner to ensure the continuation of these critical programs. I am proud of the fact that the House worked its will in a bipartisan manner following regular order throughout. Just last week the other body worked its will, combining these three bills into a single bill before us. Though modifications were made that I do not agree with, it is imperative that the House pass this legislation in advance of the authority for price reporting and grain inspection expiring on Wednesday evening. Failure to enact this legislation today will have devastating impacts on our Nation's meat industries and grain exporters. I urge the House to adopt this legislation. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2051, a bill to reauthorize the Mandatory Price Reporting Act, the United States Grain Standards Act, and the National Forest Foundation Act. Legislative language to reauthorize each of these was introduced, reported by the House Agriculture Committee, and passed by the House on voice vote as standalone measures on June 10th of this year. The first two, the Mandatory Price Reporting Act and the Grain Standards Act authorities are set to expire in just a few days. As passed by the House, each of these measures enjoyed wide bipartisan support from Members as well as support from each of the impacted industries. Unfortunately, after passing through the other chamber, we are left with bill language that is somewhat less than ideal, but at least maintains these critical program authorities for 5 more years. In the development of the Mandatory Price Reporting Act and with each of its subsequent reauthorizations, we have asked the impacted industries to work together in a cooperative spirit to develop their legislative proposals and submit only those that are unanimously supported. The meat and livestock industries did just that this past spring. Those proposals were reviewed in a hearing in the Subcommittee on Livestock and Foreign Agriculture on April 22nd, bill language was introduced in the House, a business meeting was held, and the House unanimously passed the bill. Unfortunately, a demand was made in the other body that the bill be modified to remove language of critical importance to our constituents. Thus, we have before us today a bill that is less than what our constituents requested. Yet if we fail to act, a program of critical importance to the meat and livestock industries would expire leaving these industries in a quandary. It is a shame that politics must interfere with policy on even the simplest measures, but we must move forward. The United States Grain Standards Act reauthorization faced similar challenges in the other body. As my colleagues will recall, last summer amid an ongoing labor dispute, the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) discontinued mandatory grain weighing and grading services. In statements issued at the time, WSDA acknowledged that they withheld inspection services because of their belief that the ``continued provision of inspections services appears to have been unhelpful in leading to any foreseeable resolution'' of the labor dispute. Instead of fulfilling their statutory obligation, the leadership of the U.S. Department of Agriculture politicized this situation when the agency declined to fulfill its statutory responsibility to resume inspection and weighing services. Services were eventually restored, but not before significant costs accrued to all parties involved. We have worked hard to gain access to overseas markets. We are shooting ourselves in the foot when we cannot ship our products to these markets because State and Federal agencies are unable or unwilling to comply with their obligations. To not be able to ship our grain because there are no inspectors at a facility does a disservice to our farmers, and it harms our economy. To address this situation, the House could have been punitive. In fact, there were some in the industry that would have preferred that. But that is not what we were interested in doing. We simply wanted to develop a safeguard mechanism to avoid this situation being repeated. To do that, we worked with the Washington State delegation, the Washington State Department of Agriculture, labor unions, industry and even the USDA. What we developed was bipartisan consensus on a workable safeguard provision. Nevertheless, the bill as adopted in the other body provides little safeguard against future abuses of discretion. I cannot emphasize this enough--it is imperative that these inspection and weighing services are provided in a reliable, uninterrupted, consistent and cost-effective manner. To ensure that we fulfill this obligation, we must learn the lessons of history or it is doomed to repeat itself. To this end, the Secretary of Agriculture is instructed to take prompt action to provide for restoration of official grain inspection service as soon as he receives notice or otherwise learns about the impending disruption from a delegated State agency. In this regard, as a way of not allowing the Secretary to sit on his hands after learning that a disruption in official service was imminent, the Secretary is required to: [[Page H6290]] 1. Immediately take such actions as are necessary to address the disruption and resume inspection and weighing services; and 2. Not later than 24 hours after receiving notice or otherwise learning of the impending disruption of such inspection or weighing, or after the start of such disruption in official service, whichever is earlier, submit to the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry of the Senate a report that describes the disruptions and any actions necessary to address the concerns of the Secretary relating to the disruption so that inspections or weighings may resume. On a positive note, another critical element of the House bill was retained wherein the Secretary will be obligated to waive official weighing and inspection requirements in both cases of emergency as well as other circumstances as long as the waiver does not impair the underlying objectives of the statute and the buyers and sellers agree and provide documentation of the agreement to the Secretary. This waiver requirement is intended to provide certainty to trading partners as well as U.S. suppliers. Since its charter in 1993, the National Forest Foundation provides the ability to leverage private and federal dollars to support our Nation's great forests in a variety of ways. In recent years, the Foundation has leveraged funds at over a 4 to 1 ratio and plans to continue on this success to raise at least $125 million for forest restoration activities. Simply put, the National Forest Foundation works, and this is a common-sense reauthorization. While I recognize that concessions were made resulting in less than ideal bill text, at the end of the day, H.R. 2051 provides certainty to American agriculture, and I would urge my colleagues to support it. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2051. This bipartisan legislation reauthorizes the Mandatory Price Reporting Act, the National Forest Foundation Act, and the U.S. Grain Standards Act. This bill continues the tradition of bipartisan, bicameral work done by the Agriculture Committees. Important livestock price reporting programs will be continued under the bill's mandatory price reporting provisions. Producers rely on access to transparent, accurate, and timely market information, and H.R. 2051 will provide that certainty. The National Forest Foundation Act is the type of public-private collaboration we should all be able to support, giving private groups and stakeholders a chance to help in the stewardship and management of our national forests and grasslands. H.R. 2051 will ensure that this partnership can continue. Finally, the U.S. Grain Standards Reauthorization Act will allow the Federal Grain Inspection Service to continue official weighing and inspection services. Both grain buyers and sellers rely on a gold standard quality assurance, backed by the Federal Government, when conducting business. Again, this is good, commonsense legislation, a bipartisan bill. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank my colleague, my ranking member, Collin Peterson. Throughout this work, he and all the Members on both sides of the aisle of the committee worked well together. It is a tribute to the way bipartisan work ought to be done in the House, and I am proud of the work the Agriculture Committee has done. I urge Members to join me in support of this bill. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway) that the House suspend the rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 2051. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the Senate amendment was concurred in. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_54.csv,31192,31192,31264,"[congressional record volume 161, number 140 (monday, september 28, 2015)] [house] [pages h6287-h6290] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] mandatory price reporting act of 2015 mr. conaway. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and concur in the senate amendment to the bill (h.r. 2051) to amend the agricultural marketing act of 1946 to extend the livestock mandatory price reporting requirements, and for other purposes. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the senate amendment is as follows: senate amendment: strike out all after the enacting clause and insert: section 1. short title; table of contents.

trade obligations; and (2) any actions the executive branch is taking to remedy the policy barriers so as to put united states grain producers on equal footing with grain producers in countries imposing the barriers. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from texas (mr. conaway) and the gentleman from minnesota (mr. peterson) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from texas. general leave mr. conaway. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from texas? there was no objection. mr. conaway. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in support of h.r. 2051, the agriculture reauthorizations act of 2015. mr. speaker, on june 9, the house passed three individual bills: the mandatory price reporting act of 2015; the united states grain standards reauthorization act of 2015; and the national forest foundation reauthorization act of 2015. for each of these, the committee on agriculture held hearings and business meetings, and the house acted in a timely manner to ensure the continuation of these critical programs. i am proud of the fact that the house worked its will in a bipartisan manner following regular order throughout. just last week the other body worked its will, combining these three bills into a single bill before us. though modifications were made that i do not agree with, it is imperative that the house pass this legislation in advance of the authority for price reporting and grain inspection expiring on wednesday evening. failure to enact this legislation today will have devastating impacts on our nation's meat industries and grain exporters. i urge the house to adopt this legislation. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h.r. 2051, a bill to reauthorize the mandatory price reporting act, the united states grain standards act, and the national forest foundation act. legislative language to reauthorize each of these was introduced, reported by the house agriculture committee, and passed by the house on voice vote as standalone measures on june 10th of this year. the first two, the mandatory price reporting act and the grain standards act authorities are set to expire in just a few days. as passed by the house, each of these measures enjoyed wide bipartisan support from members as well as support from each of the impacted industries. unfortunately, after passing through the other chamber, we are left with bill language that is somewhat less than ideal, but at least maintains these critical program authorities for 5 more years. in the development of the mandatory price reporting act and with each of its subsequent reauthorizations, we have asked the impacted industries to work together in a cooperative spirit to develop their legislative proposals and submit only those that are unanimously supported. the meat and livestock industries did just that this past spring. those proposals were reviewed in a hearing in the subcommittee on livestock and foreign agriculture on april 22nd, bill language was introduced in the house, a business meeting was held, and the house unanimously passed the bill. unfortunately, a demand was made in the other body that the bill be modified to remove language of critical importance to our constituents. thus, we have before us today a bill that is less than what our constituents requested. yet if we fail to act, a program of critical importance to the meat and livestock industries would expire leaving these industries in a quandary. it is a shame that politics must interfere with policy on even the simplest measures, but we must move forward. the united states grain standards act reauthorization faced similar challenges in the other body. as my colleagues will recall, last summer amid an ongoing labor dispute, the washington state department of agriculture (wsda) discontinued mandatory grain weighing and grading services. in statements issued at the time, wsda acknowledged that they withheld inspection services because of their belief that the ``continued provision of inspections services appears to have been unhelpful in leading to any foreseeable resolution'' of the labor dispute. instead of fulfilling their statutory obligation, the leadership of the u.s. department of agriculture politicized this situation when the agency declined to fulfill its statutory responsibility to resume inspection and weighing services. services were eventually restored, but not before significant costs accrued to all parties involved. we have worked hard to gain access to overseas markets. we are shooting ourselves in the foot when we cannot ship our products to these markets because state and federal agencies are unable or unwilling to comply with their obligations. to not be able to ship our grain because there are no inspectors at a facility does a disservice to our farmers, and it harms our economy. to address this situation, the house could have been punitive. in fact, there were some in the industry that would have preferred that. but that is not what we were interested in doing. we simply wanted to develop a safeguard mechanism to avoid this situation being repeated. to do that, we worked with the washington state delegation, the washington state department of agriculture, labor unions, industry and even the usda. what we developed was bipartisan consensus on a workable safeguard provision. nevertheless, the bill as adopted in the other body provides little safeguard against future abuses of discretion. i cannot emphasize this enough--it is imperative that these inspection and weighing services are provided in a reliable, uninterrupted, consistent and cost-effective manner. to ensure that we fulfill this obligation, we must learn the lessons of history or it is doomed to repeat itself. to this end, the secretary of agriculture is instructed to take prompt action to provide for restoration of official grain inspection service as soon as he receives notice or otherwise learns about the impending disruption from a delegated state agency. in this regard, as a way of not allowing the secretary to sit on his hands after learning that a disruption in official service was imminent, the secretary is required to: [[page h6290]] 1. immediately take such actions as are necessary to address the disruption and resume inspection and weighing services; and 2. not later than 24 hours after receiving notice or otherwise learning of the impending disruption of such inspection or weighing, or after the start of such disruption in official service, whichever is earlier, submit to the committee on agriculture of the house of representatives and the committee on agriculture, nutrition and forestry of the senate a report that describes the disruptions and any actions necessary to address the concerns of the secretary relating to the disruption so that inspections or weighings may resume. on a positive note, another critical element of the house bill was retained wherein the secretary will be obligated to waive official weighing and inspection requirements in both cases of emergency as well as other circumstances as long as the waiver does not impair the underlying objectives of the statute and the buyers and sellers agree and provide documentation of the agreement to the secretary. this waiver requirement is intended to provide certainty to trading partners as well as u.s. suppliers. since its charter in 1993, the national forest foundation provides the ability to leverage private and federal dollars to support our nation's great forests in a variety of ways. in recent years, the foundation has leveraged funds at over a 4 to 1 ratio and plans to continue on this success to raise at least $125 million for forest restoration activities. simply put, the national forest foundation works, and this is a common-sense reauthorization. while i recognize that concessions were made resulting in less than ideal bill text, at the end of the day, h.r. 2051 provides certainty to american agriculture, and i would urge my colleagues to support it. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. peterson. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of h.r. 2051. this bipartisan legislation reauthorizes the mandatory price reporting act, the national forest foundation act, and the u.s. grain standards act. this bill continues the tradition of bipartisan, bicameral work done by the agriculture committees. important livestock price reporting programs will be continued under the bill's mandatory price reporting provisions. producers rely on access to transparent, accurate, and timely market information, and h.r. 2051 will provide that certainty. the national forest foundation act is the type of public-private collaboration we should all be able to support, giving private groups and stakeholders a chance to help in the stewardship and management of our national forests and grasslands. h.r. 2051 will ensure that this partnership can continue. finally, the u.s. grain standards reauthorization act will allow the federal grain inspection service to continue official weighing and inspection services. both grain buyers and sellers rely on a gold standard quality assurance, backed by the federal government, when conducting business. again, this is good, commonsense legislation, a bipartisan bill. i urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' i yield back the balance of my time. mr. conaway. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i also want to thank my colleague, my ranking member, collin peterson. throughout this work, he and all the members on both sides of the aisle of the committee worked well together. it is a tribute to the way bipartisan work ought to be done in the house, and i am proud of the work the agriculture committee has done. i urge members to join me in support of this bill. i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from texas (mr. conaway) that the house suspend the rules and concur in the senate amendment to the bill, h.r. 2051. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the senate amendment was concurred in. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",31192

Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of a nonprofit organization in my district that is providing a valuable service to the region. The organization, Ricky's Wheels, is dedicated to providing electric wheelchairs to those in need. Rick Worthy and his wife, Diane, created Ricky's Wheels after the death of their son Ricky in 2009, following a brief battle with melanoma. After donating Ricky's wheelchair to a local couple, Rick and Diane noticed a need across their community, especially since Medicare will not pay for a chair once someone is accepted into hospice. Since its founding 6 years ago, Ricky's Wheels has grown from a few donated electric wheelchairs in the Worthys' garage to a warehouse filled with mobility assistance devices, along with push chairs, walkers, and baby strollers. Mr. Speaker, Ricky's Wheels recently was named a local Jefferson Award recipient, after being nominated by the local television station, WJAC. This award, which was created by the American Institute for Public Service, honors ordinary people who do extraordinary things without expectation of recognition. Mr. Speaker, I believe that Rick and Diane are more than worthy of recognition for their efforts. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [House] [Page H6292] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RICKY'S WHEELS (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of a nonprofit organization in my district that is providing a valuable service to the region. The organization, Ricky's Wheels, is dedicated to providing electric wheelchairs to those in need. Rick Worthy and his wife, Diane, created Ricky's Wheels after the death of their son Ricky in 2009, following a brief battle with melanoma. After donating Ricky's wheelchair to a local couple, Rick and Diane noticed a need across their community, especially since Medicare will not pay for a chair once someone is accepted into hospice. Since its founding 6 years ago, Ricky's Wheels has grown from a few donated electric wheelchairs in the Worthys' garage to a warehouse filled with mobility assistance devices, along with push chairs, walkers, and baby strollers.

CREC-2015-09-28-pt1-PgH6292-2,CREC-2015-09-28,114,JEB BUSH SHOULD CONSIDER THE POPE'S CALL TO PRESERVE OUR ENVIRONMENT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [House] [Page H6292] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] JEB BUSH SHOULD CONSIDER THE POPE'S CALL TO PRESERVE OUR ENVIRONMENT (Mr. FOSTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have continually reminded us that they are not scientists. We have also heard this from several of the Republican candidates seeking our Nation's highest office. As a scientist myself, I appreciate their candor. But what I don't as much appreciate is when they use this mantra of ``I am not a scientist'' to preface statements that are factually wrong.

Tragically, we have seen these first responders give their lives in service to others. This past Sunday the 2015 Minnesota Fallen Firefighter Memorial Service took place on the State Capitol grounds to honor the 9 Minnesota firefighters--and 216 nationwide--that have passed away in the line of duty this year. The event honors the sacrifice that these firefighters have made and also provides support for their families who are coping with a profound loss. As policymakers, it is important that we recognize what our first responders go through on a daily basis and support them. Earlier this year Congress passed my legislation, which is now law, that ensures that survivor benefits for families of those killed in the line of duty are not taxed.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, thank you very much. I am very privileged tonight to lead the Special Order of the Members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Let me thank our chairman, Chairman G.K. Butterfield, for continuing this tradition and for his continued leadership, encouragement, and avocation for Members and for the stories of those who have been such leaders in our Nation and such major issues that we have been able to contribute to for the understanding of our colleagues. Let me also make mention of my colleagues, Congresswoman Kelly and Congressman Payne, who have led us on this Special Order for the Congressional Black Caucus. I thank them for their leadership and service. A very special thanks to those of you who are watching at home and have often watched at home and have followed the Congressional Black Caucus through social media, social network, and also know that our major issues of criminal justice reform, civil rights, the restoration of the Voting Rights Act, and many others have been to speak to the vulnerable. Tonight we again speak to you, but we speak of those heroes that we have lost over the last couple of months. Tonight we pay tribute to Amelia Boynton Robinson, Congressman Lou Stokes, and, of course, Julian Bond. Our Nation was built on the values of dealing with the issues of freedom, justice and equality, values and principles that were perfectly embodied by the service and sacrifices of these three leaders. Mr. Speaker, over the last week we have watched the Pope make his way through a number of American cities and use words that are music to the ears of Members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Let me take just one of many citations that I will utilize to characterize these three individuals: ``The complexities of history,'' said Pope Francis, ``and the reality of human weakness notwithstanding, these men and women, for all their many differences and limitations, were able, by hard work and self- sacrifice, some at the cost of their lives, to build a better future.'' I would offer to say that Amelia Boynton Robinson, Congressman Lou Stokes, and Julian Bond, through the sacrifice of their individual families and their lives, were able to make a better future for us. We know the civil rights activist Amelia Boynton Robinson, 1965, was a leader of the Bloody Sunday march and personified the optimism, determination, and courage that are at the heart of the American spirit. She truly made our lives better. Known as the matriarch of our Nation's civil rights movement, Ms. Boynton Robinson fought courageously to ensure that every American citizen had the right to vote. Her drive to secure universal voting rights was amazing, and certainly she risked her life when she crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge. In her words, her son said civil rights was her entire life. [[Page H6294]] We now understand that Congressman Lou Stokes made an amazing and impactful statement legislatively and throughout his life. He was a consummate public servant, a trailblazer who broke down barriers for generations of African Americans. He was the first African American Congressman from Ohio who served 30 years. Representing a portion of Cleveland, he prioritized the advancement of our Nation's most vulnerable populations. He advocated for more funding of education, housing, development projects, access to health care. He was one of the fiercest advocates for public housing. Mr. Stokes was a major proponent and leader that asked the Housing and Urban Development to assess the poor, deleterious, horrible conditions that children were living in as housing impacted their health. In fact, just recently I presented my housing authority a lead poisoning grant which was instigated, was encouraged, was advocated for by Congressman Lou Stokes. He has saved thousands upon thousands of lives. I thank him for organizing the Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust, and I want to thank him personally for allowing me work for him as a staff member of the Select Committee on Assassinations, which he ultimately chaired. We thank him for his amazing service. He once said, ``I am going to keep on denouncing the inequities of this system, but I am going to work within it. To go outside the system would be to deny myself, to deny my own existence. I have beaten the system. I have proved it can be done. So have a lot of others.'' This is, of course, the kind of leader that Lou Stokes was. Our friend, Julian Bond, was a civil rights icon. He was a leader in the fight for equality, freedom, and equal justice and opportunity. He inspired generations of Americans to build a better future for all people. Julian Bond was considered the young one in the movement with Dr. Martin Luther King. He stood as not only an original, but a fierce advocate of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the founding president of the Southern Poverty Law Center. Elected to office, of course, he himself fought against discrimination. He was discriminated himself. When he was refused a seat in the Georgia State Legislature, it did not in any way demean or undermine his courage or inspiration. He went on to be seated and to do great things. Tonight we are privileged to be able to honor and pay tribute to these three heroes. We are called to follow the example they set, to fight to ensure that all Americans have access to equal opportunity so they will have a fair shot at economic prosperity, have the right to vote, be free from mass incarceration, and do the things that America bestows upon them. Again, these individuals, at the cost of their lives or their own futures, built a better future for us. With that, I am delighted to yield to the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Mr. G.K. Butterfield, a former high superior court judge--I am calling him all kinds of names--but, in any event, a dynamic leader of the Congressional Black Caucus. Again, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee for her friendship, for her leadership, and I certainly thank her for yielding time tonight. Let me also thank the other Members who are on the floor this evening to help in honoring the lives of Louis Stokes, Amelia Boynton Robinson, and Julian Bond. These three are icons, absolute icons, of the civil rights movement, who in their own way paved the way for so many. I had the high honor of calling Lou Stokes and Julian Bond personal friends. As the first African American to represent Ohio in Congress, Representative Lou Stokes was a pioneer in public service. He broke down numerous barriers for African Americans during his extraordinary career as an elected official on the local, State, and Federal levels. First elected to Congress in 1969 and serving for 30 long years in the U.S. House, he was a founder of the Congressional Black Caucus and the first African American to serve on the House Appropriations Committee. He was the founder of the CBC Health Braintrust, which remains active today in protecting health, equity, and reducing health disparities. Congressman Stokes was the embodiment of a public servant. He selflessly used his elected positions to increase opportunities for millions of African Americans. We will miss our dear friend Lou Stokes. But the impact of his legacy of service and commitment to his constituents and to the African American community will be remembered for generations. Often referred to as the matriarch of the movement, Amelia Boynton Robinson's role in Bloody Sunday, as you have already heard, and the march from Selma to Montgomery is immortalized in the Oscar-nominated film ``Selma.'' She also made history in 1964 by becoming the first African American woman from Alabama to run for Congress. In her congressional election that year, Mrs. Boynton Robinson garnered 10 percent of the vote despite the fact that African Americans only made up 1 percent of the voting population in Alabama's Seventh Congressional District. Forty-six years later the CBC's very own representative, Terri Sewell, whom we will hear from in just a few moments, now holds that seat here in Congress. This year, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, we remember the selfless actions of individuals like Amelia Boynton Robinson who fought against systems of injustice so that future generations would have opportunities that were not possible to generations past. Tonight we honor Mrs. Boynton Robinson for her legacy which continues in each of us. Finally, Mr. Speaker, tonight we honor Julian Bond, a forefather of America's civil rights movement and one of our country's greatest advocates for freedom and equality and equitable treatment for all people. From his work as a student leader during the 1960s to his service in the Georgia House of Representatives and the State Senate, Julian Bond was a leader in the fight against racism and segregation. {time} 1930 I first met Julian Bond at the funeral of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in 1968. As the founding president of the Southern Poverty Law Center and chairman of the board of the NAACP, Julian Bond continued his work educating citizens around the world of the struggles of African Americans and the history of civil rights here in America. Julian Bond spent his lifetime in public service, calling for equal civil and human rights not only for African Americans, but for every American. Until his untimely death, he was an advocate, activist, and dedicated champion who fought for the most vulnerable individuals and communities among us. We celebrate his life and his lasting legacy. I want to thank Ms. Jackson Lee for her leadership and thank her for yielding. I thank the Members for coming to the floor this evening. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman for his very thoughtful statement and for leading us off today and setting the tone for the Congressional Black Caucus that we will never forget our icons, but we also know that to pay tribute is the highest honor for all of us because we are here because of all of them. I thank Mr. Butterfield for his leadership. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege now to yield to Representative Charles Rangel, who does not need a long introduction. It is important to note that he has led on so many issues. He was not only the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, but also a dear friend of Congressman Lou Stokes and one of the founders of the Congressional Black Caucus. If Congressman Rangel had not done what he did, we would not be here today. I am delighted to yield to him at this time. Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Jackson Lee for pulling together this tribute. It is moving and emotional that we do this after the visit to these Chambers by the Pope, who made it abundantly clear how all of us, no matter how ordinary we are, [[Page H6295]] can do extraordinary things when we make a commitment to do the right thing. As some of the older Members know, it is almost unbelievable how people that you know on an everyday basis that go through life with their own problems still can find the time to try to improve the quality of life for so many people. I feel almost awkward looking at the Representative from Selma, Alabama, this evening because, after Bloody Sunday, there was a call all over the world for people to come to Selma. I was one of those called, and I was one of those that did not think that me going to Selma with my bad feet could make a contribution to anything, and this is especially so after seeing what happened on Bloody Sunday. But I did go down because of John Lewis and Andrew Young and Martin Luther King and Ralph Bunche, because they said that if I could just come down for the press conference, it would be appreciated. So I dressed up and I went down for the press conference. I had a round trip ticket back to New York. I was dressed pretty well, not ever thinking that I would be going any further than Selma. It started to rain, and I felt that this would be the appropriate time for me to get a cab and to go to the airport. When I saw these older people like Amelia Robinson putting plastic on their shoes and starting to sing and starting to march, I said, well, maybe I could go a couple of blocks. I did that, except I found out in Selma there weren't any couple of blocks. There were no television cameras. There was no one that recognized me down there. I marched 54 miles, cussing every step of the way, trying to figure out what the devil I was doing in Selma. Congresswoman Sewell, it just proves that if you attempt just to do the right thing, God can push you to do the rest. I never did believe, like John Lewis, that that Supreme Court would give us the voting rights and the civil rights. I never thought that President Johnson would ever support these things. Today I tell this very embarrassing story because you don't have to be a hero to be counted on if you just try to start to do the right thing, and just maybe God will push you to go further. Certainly when a woman like Amelia Boynton Robinson is beaten unconscious and someone like John Lewis, who constantly put his life on the line, and of course the late Dr. Martin Luther King, who gave up his life, and God doesn't ask us to do these extraordinary things, but I do believe that the courage that these people have, that each of us have just a grain of it that would allow us to contribute, as the Pope said, to show our respect for God, allowing us to inherit this great Earth to try to make the quality of life better. Of course, when it comes to a young guy going to Morehouse, as Julian Bond did, dropping out of school, coming from a professional family where education had a higher standard than some of us from the inner cities, it must have broken their heart to know that he was joining a group that would then provide the leadership for our country for people Black and White. There is nothing that my heart would allow me to say about Lou Stokes. I came to Congress not knowing that in the Congress was a giant of a man from Cleveland, Lou Stokes, who motivated the 13 of us, who led us to form the Congressional Black Caucus. I have walked in the shadows of his giant footsteps since I have been privileged to serve in this House. Ms. Jackson Lee and members of the Congressional Black Caucus, it is really extraordinary how God has given us the opportunity to say thank you for the blessings that we have, and I do hope that maybe on both sides of the aisle people can talk about those who allowed this country to be so great, the sacrifices that so many people have made, and you just don't have to be a giant to appreciate the fact that God has blessed us all. I thank her for her effort at bringing us together, not just tonight, but on every committee, on every bill, and this floor. Sheila Jackson Lee is here to continue to inspire all of us. I thank her for that. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, we are so grateful for the special wisdom and insight that Mr. Rangel brings to all of what we do. I know that the late Lou Stokes, the late Amelia Boynton Robinson, and the late Julian Bond are grateful that they knew him and that he is here to tell his story. Even if he considers it embarrassing, I think it is a wonderful testimony for anybody who has said, ``I can't do it.'' We want him to keep telling us that wonderful statement over and over again. I thank him so very much for what he provides to the Congressional Black Caucus. I thank him for the kind words he mentioned of Representative Terri Sewell. I just say to Ms. Sewell, I don't know what kind of phone message that she had to the Vatican, but I repeat now the words of Pope Francis, as I yield to her. This is Pope Francis, as he spoke just a few days ago at that very podium: Here, too, I think of the march which Martin Luther King led from Selma to Montgomery 50 years ago as part of the campaign to fulfill his dream of full civil rights and political rights for African Americans. Representative Sewell, let me thank you for bringing and infusing life into the wonderful city of Selma, all the wonderful people there, including your dearly beloved mother and father, and having us walk with you every step of the way. As I yield to her, let me say that we should make a commitment right here today, as we make changes in leadership, that we commit ourselves to the restoration of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which she is leading on. It is my delight to yield to her at this time. Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I thank our leader of the CBC, Congressman Butterfield, so much for his exemplary leadership and the courage that he exemplifies every day in fighting for the causes that we all hold so dear. I want to thank Congresswoman Jackson Lee for those wonderful words. Sheila Jackson Lee has not only been an amazing Member of Congress, but she has been a great mentor to me. I want to thank her for all she does for so many of us and the mentoring she continues to provide the younger generation. What can I say to Charlie Rangel? To even have him know my name is an honor. I know that, but for the remarkable lives of the three people that we celebrate their lives and their legacies today, I would not be in this auspicious Chamber, and but for his leadership and his courage, I would not know how to behave in this Chamber. I thank him for doing such a great job and continuing to serve the great people of Harlem and New York, but also the great people of America--black, white, green, yellow, all of us. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join with my CBC colleagues in paying tribute to the life and legacy of three great giants in American history: Representative Louis Stokes, Amelia Boynton Robinson, and Julian Bond. Our Nation collectively mourns the loss of each of these trailblazing figures who departed from us way too soon this summer. Their journeys paved the way for myself and so many others serving in this august body. While our hearts are heavy today, we honor them for their historic and notable contributions to this Nation. Congressman Louis Stokes was the first African American to represent the State of Ohio in Congress, where he served for more than 30 years. He rose to prominence by breaking numerous barriers as the first in so many areas. This included being named the first African American to serve as chairman of the prestigious House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. As an African American who now sits on that committee, I am deeply honored to follow in Louis Stokes' footsteps. During his tenure on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, he stepped into the national spotlight as a vocal critic of the Reagan administration's foreign policy. He spoke boldly on issues of national security and created a legacy of being a fierce advocate for the homeland. In honoring his memory, we must also commit ourselves collectively to continue the fight to promote diversity within the intelligence community. We must also be committed to supporting policies that promote our national security in the face of growing threats. It was Congressman Lou Stokes who taught us that our Nation deserves nothing less. [[Page H6296]] Today we also honor an American treasure and one of my personal heroes, the courageous Mrs. Amelia Boynton Robinson. Mrs. Robinson passed away on August 26, 2015, at the age of 110--yes, 110, Mr. Speaker. Mrs. Amelia Boynton Robinson was a key figure in the voting rights movement in Selma, Alabama. She is often remembered for her critical role in Bloody Sunday. On that solemn day on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, Robinson was savagely beaten. A photo taken of her shortly after she was attacked and posted in The New York Times became a powerful symbol of the injustices suffered by those who were attempting simply to vote. Yet this tireless, fearless foot soldier continued her work as a leader on the front lines of securing the right to vote for all Americans. Amelia is best known as the matriarch of the voting rights movement, and it was her courage, along with John Lewis and so many other known and unknown foot soldiers which led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Amelia was such an integral part of the process that the contents of the bill, the voting rights bill, were drafted on her kitchen table in Selma, Alabama, in 1965. Ms. Boynton not only trailblazed as a voting rights advocate, she put her money where her mouth was and she, herself, ran for Congress. On May 5, 1964, Amelia Boynton broke yet another barrier, when she became the first woman in the State of Alabama and the first African American woman in the State of Alabama to run for Congress. In 1964, she garnered 10.7 percent of the vote during a time when very few Blacks were registered to vote. Actually, only 1 percent of the registered voters were African Americans at that time. Her historic run further solidified her impact on the movement for human rights and voting rights in Alabama and in this Nation. Without her courageous campaign for the Seventh Congressional District of Alabama in 1964, I know that my election to this seat in 2010, some 50 years later, would not have been possible. {time} 1945 Her sacrifices paved the way for me to walk the Halls of Congress, and I will carry my love and admiration for her in my heart each and every day, for I get to do what she could not, and that is vote on behalf of the members of the Seventh Congressional District of Alabama. For that, I am eternally grateful. In fact, one of my most memorable moments in this Chamber is the night that she served as my special guest at the State of the Union on January 20, 2015, this past year. I am grateful for the memories of her greeting President Obama that night. I am so blessed to not only have called her my constituent, but a beloved mentor and friend. As she is remembered, and she reminds us every day by her life, there is still much work to be done. Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would also like to remember the shining legacy of yet another giant figure in the fight for civil and human rights: Mr. Julian Bond. This courageous voice held several titles over the course of his impactful life, but he is most remembered for his service as the NAACP chairman and the cofounder of the Southern Poverty Law Center. He was also one of the original leaders of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, SNCC, while he was a student at Morehouse College. He later served in the Georgia General Assembly for more than 20 years. He was first elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1965. However, because of his longstanding legacy of fighting White supremacy, White statehouse members tried unsuccessfully to block him from taking his seat. This brave spirit was undeterred. He spearheaded efforts to draft landmark legislation that spoke to the need of Blacks in the State of Georgia. In addition to his time as an eloquent speaker, he was a celebrated writer, poet, television commentator, community advocate, as well as a communication specialist. He did so much for the Southern Poverty Law Center to set it on its course and so much for the lives of so many. All three of these wonderful giants tell a story, a story of how ordinary people can do extraordinary things. Working collectively, we as a nation can achieve amazing heights, even if we don't think so. As Congressman Rangel's story best exemplified, if we just take one step, hopefully the Lord will give us the strength to take many, many more towards that fight for justice and equality. In closing, I am reminded of what Amelia Boynton would often say when I and others would come up to her and say: ``We stand on your shoulders. We stand on your shoulders.'' Well, Ms. Amelia Boynton was so infamously known for saying, after hearing it over and over again: ``Get off my shoulders. There is plenty of work to be done.'' ``Do your own work,'' is what she said. And so I say to my colleagues gathered here tonight, my colleagues in this wonderful body called the House of Representatives: We have plenty of work to do. We have plenty of work to do. And while we walk in the footsteps of giants such as Amelia Boynton and Louis Stokes and Julian Bond, let us never forget that they, too, had to take a first step. And as we follow in their footsteps, let us all take many steps towards providing justice and liberty for all Americans, especially those that are most vulnerable. Ms. JACKSON LEE. I think we can leave this evening with the words that Congresswoman Sewell has just said, and we thank her so very much, ``do our own work.'' That message should carry for whether we are Republicans or Democrats or Independents. Congresswoman Sewell, we look forward to doing our own work on the restoration of the Voting Rights Act, section 5, which you are leading and all of us have signed onto. We thank you so much for that eloquent statement and that statement of passion. Speaking of passion, it is my privilege to introduce a Member who has her own storied civil rights history, someone who has served as the Commissioner on the EEOC, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and someone who has been in the trenches in civil rights, dealing with voting rights cases, dealing with the right to vote in her own District of Columbia. I think she will be the Florence Nightingale, she will be the champion battler; because I believe that this Delegate, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, will be successful as we fight for the voting rights of the District through her leadership. I yield to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton). Ms. NORTON. I thank my good friend, Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, first, for her kind and generous words, but especially today for her leadership of this Special Order, which is characteristic of her leadership in this Congress. I am so pleased that our chair Rep. G.K. Butterfield has been here and spoken and that we have heard from several other Members. I just want to say a few words about this troika of African Americans who have written their signatures across our time. You have heard their biographies. I don't want to recount their extraordinary bios, because that is not the only reason we are honoring them with this Special Order. I just want to say something about what they meant to me. Two of them I knew personally: Representative Louis Stokes, whose many years in the Congress happened to overlap with my first years here; and, of course, Julian Bond, whom I knew best. I was not fortunate to know Amelia Boynton. She may have been the most courageous woman in the movement of the 1960s, who insisted upon facing death, if necessary, in that march from Selma to Montgomery, and nearly lost her life. I was privileged to be in her presence, as so many Members of Congress were, when we went to Selma this past summer. That was a privilege in and of itself. I was fortunate to know Congressman Louis Stokes, who was a founder of the Congressional Black Caucus long before I served. This was a man of great accomplishment. Yes, he can speak about his firsts, and much more. He is the first African American to serve in Congress from his hometown of Cleveland, as one of the two famous Stokes brothers--his brother, Carl, the first African American mayor. There is something about the way those men were raised and showed themselves in public life. But it is Rep. Stokes' career in Congress that stands out for me. [[Page H6297]] I am not certain there has ever been a more distinguished Member of this body. It looks as if when they were trying to ask somebody to do something hard, they looked to Louis Stokes. He was the first African American to serve on the Appropriations Committee. My heavens. And then look at the committees he has chaired-- hard ones--the Ethics Committee, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Then they needed someone to do something else that was difficult, and that was to serve on the Iran Contra Committee, and House Select Committee on Assassinations, nothing was more difficult than that. If you were looking for a Member whom the public would trust and who this body would trust, who do you go to? They went to Louis Stokes. So if you are trying to find out how to serve, recall the life of Representative Louis Stokes. In the District, we recall his life and his work. Much of his work was done in the field of health. The Howard University Louis Stokes Health Science Library is named for him here in the District of Columbia at Howard University. So we will never forget him. Of the three, the one I knew best, of course, was my colleague and friend in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, later a client of sorts, and then finally--for 25 years, a constituent. I met Julian several years after he founded, along with a handful of other students, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. You have got to understand that that group was as different from any student group since. They were not an offshoot of the civil rights movement. They were a group that stood on its own. I would go down in the summers. I was in law school. SNCC was the equivalent of major civil rights organizations, every single one, right alongside them. That is why John Lewis got to speak on the March on Washington. The reason that SNCC stood out is the quality of its leadership in those early years. Julian became the spokesman. The reason he was the spokesman was his way with words. He was a poet and a writer, and he could explain what we were doing. He served a most valuable role in these early years. So no one should be surprised that he went after the zenith of the civil rights movement to serve in the Georgia House of Representatives. What you may be surprised to learn is that when he moved on to the senate, the Georgia Senate, they refused to seat him because he had endorsed a SNCC statement opposing the Vietnam war. Imagine denying a seat to a member duly elected because of a statement he had made on an issue of great moment. This case was taken all the way to the Supreme Court. At that point, I was a constitutional lawyer working for the American Civil Liberties Union in New York. I got to write the amicus brief. We took very few amicus briefs to the Supreme Court, but this one seemed to have the makings of a landmark case. Indeed, it did become a landmark case. You do not see anybody denying anyone else the right to sit in his seat--or her seat, today--because of that person's views. The Julian Bond case settled the matter. What was Julian Bond to do with the rest of his life? First of all, SNCC broke a fair number of people. And though they gave much to the movement, you may not have heard about many of them since. What Julian did was to give the rest of his life to the movement. For every single day of his life as a man, after he left public service in the Georgia Legislature, he was devoted to the civil rights movement he had entered as a very young man. He moved to the District of Columbia with his wife, taught at American University and the University of Virginia, and became--and this is a matter that makes me chuckle--became the chairman of the NAACP. At SNCC we thought the NAACP was way too conservative for us, the young and foolish. It tells you how Julian grew. He grew to be the long-time and devoted chairman of the NAACP. He carried out his devotion to civil rights magnificently. Throughout his entire life, he remained a major spokesman for the civil rights movement and for progressive causes, his entire life speaking all around the country, carrying the message. When he moved here, I had a Black Caucus event with Julian and with John Lewis simply discussing their lives as young men in the civil rights movement. That was to be one of the most memorable moments since I have been in Congress. Just last February, during Black History Month, I asked Julian to come to Howard University, where he and I engaged in an intergenerational conversation with Howard students about the police shootings in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City and what they meant to this generation and how this generation had to have its own issues and move in its own direction. One of the things we indicated was that for all of the work of the youth of the civil rights movement of our day, we never touched racial profiling. It remained alive and kicking for a new generation, which has taken it on. I am, finally, particularly grateful that when Julian moved to the District of Columbia, he really became a part of this city, lending his civil rights celebrity to the great cause of this city for full citizenship, for D.C. voting rights, yes, and for statehood for the District of Columbia. If you came into the District by taxis a few years ago, there was an advertisement. Julian was speaking in a cab, informing you that you were coming to the District of Columbia, where the residents were trying to get their full citizenship. Wherever he was, he had a way of touching upon the issue of freedom of the day and of the people around him. I will always miss him. This country will always miss him. We are grateful for the life he led. We are grateful, especially, for this Congressional Black Caucus evening devoted to his life and to the lives of two others, very divergent lives but, in other ways, very similar. I thank my good friend, Representative Jackson Lee, again, for her leadership here. {time} 2000 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me thank my good friend, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, for giving these three legends the vitality and vibrance of a personal story. And to just add to his coming to students at Howard University, I want you to know that, at the University of Virginia, where he was, he was the most popular professor with people standing in line because the students sensed his passion and commitment, but they sensed his realness. Thank you so very much for that very vibrant and informative presentation. Mr. Speaker, as I introduce this next gentleman, who has his own history, let me quote, again, as I indicated, Pope Francis from last week, which captures all of what we are saying tonight: to respond in a way which is always humane, just and fraternal. We need to avoid a common temptation nowadays to disregard whatever proves troublesome. Let us remember the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. The gentleman that I am going to yield to, Mr. Bobby Scott, is a former chairman of the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, now the ranking member on the Committee on Education and the Workforce, and has led his professional, at least his Congressional life, as I have known it, to be a champion for criminal justice reform, but, more importantly, has been one who has said to us over and over again that: We must do unto others as we would like them to do unto us. We must change this criminal justice system to have it be a fair monitoring of how we inspire and restore people's lives. I yield now to the gentleman from Virginia, Congressman Bobby Scott. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in honor of the lives of three civil rights luminaries. I thank the gentlewoman from Houston for giving us this opportunity to honor their lives: Congressman Louis Stokes, statesman and educator Julian Bond, both of whom I knew personally, and activist Amelia Robinson. These champions of social and economic justice lived their lives just as Pope Francis challenged Members of Congress to do. Specifically, the Pope reminded us of the Golden Rule--do unto others as you would have them do unto you--and that that rule points us in the right direction. He specifically reminded Congress that, if we want opportunities, [[Page H6298]] then let us provide opportunities. The lives we honor today are the personification of the Pope's call. Congressman Stokes, the beloved son of the State of Ohio, was affectionately called ``Lou'' when I served with him in the House. His motto was to aim high, which he did even before he was a Member of Congress when he argued the Supreme Court case challenging the abusive stop-and-frisk policies and practices in the Terry v. Ohio case. Lou's integrity was why he was selected to serve on the House Select Committee on Assassinations of President Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the House investigation of the illegal arm sales during the Iran-contra affair and, of course, his service on the Ethics Committee. His strive for social and economic justice was on full display when he became the first African American to serve on the House Appropriations Committee. There he directed Federal dollars to eradicate injustice and inequities by funding programs such as healthcare facilities for veterans, supporting the National Science Foundation, and creating the first office of minority health at the National Institutes of Health. Statesman and educator Julian Bond dedicated his entire life to this cause of social justice and equity. As a founding member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, or SNCC, he led protests against segregation. In 1965, Julian Bond was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives, but was denied a seat at the State House because of his opposition to the Vietnam war. In 1966, the Supreme Court ruled 9-0 that the Georgia House's refusal to seat Julian Bond violated the United States Constitution. He was subsequently elected for several terms, including service in the Georgia Senate, despite efforts to redraw his district. He was also the first African American nominated at a major-party convention as a candidate for Vice President of the United States. Beginning in the 1980s, Julian Bond taught at several universities, including Harvard, Drexel, University of Virginia, and American University. For more than 20 years at UVA and American University, he taught thousands of students about the role of the civil rights movement as a seminal part of America's history. He stated that the ``humanity of all Americans is diminished when any group is denied rights granted to others.'' He served as chairman of the NAACP from 1998 to 2009. At the 2009 commencement at Virginia State University, he told the graduates that, ``We all hope that you do well, but I also hope that you do good.'' Activist Amelia Robinson was among the many foot soldiers who fought for civil rights. As a girl, she championed the right to vote for women. As an adult, she opened her home to Martin Luther King and James Bevel and members of SNCC and others to help organize and strategize for civil rights and the right to vote. Despite the brutal beating she endured during the march for voting rights in Selma, Alabama, 50 years ago, she was unwavering in her fight to end segregation and achieve full voting rights for all. Reflecting on her life as an activist, she stated that, ``I have been called rabble-rouser, agitator. But because of my fighting, I was able to hand to the entire country the right for people to vote.'' These three American giants--the legislator, the educator, the activist--were all driven to push towards a more just and equal society. I am honored to recognize their lives and the gifts they gave to our Nation. Again, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Houston for organizing this Special Order so that we could pay appropriate tribute to these fine Americans. Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman from Virginia for citing, in particular, the case law that Julian Bond particularly generated from the horrific denial of his right to be seated. Let me also indicate the importance of members of the Congressional Black Caucus sharing the history of these icons, which I hope my colleagues will appreciate these giants, for many times the history is not remembered or it is not understood. Certainly, it is my privilege to now yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio, who has firsthand knowledge because she can say that she comes from the State of which Lou Stokes and Carl Stokes were native sons. She is, of course, an inspirational leader for her district in Columbus, but, more importantly, someone who brings a wealth of experience from her previous service in the Ohio State Legislature and someone who has a passion for the improvement of lives of all people. I believe, as Lou Stokes has said, she understands the value and importance of improving the health of African Americans and all Americans. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield to the gentlewoman from Columbus, Ohio (Mrs. Beatty). Mrs. BEATTY. Thank you so much, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. Mr. Speaker, tonight the Congressional Black Caucus honors the life and legacy of three civil rights leaders, Congressman Lou Stokes, Amelia Boynton Robinson, and Julian Bond, who dedicated their lives to making our Nation a better place. Countless more follow in their footsteps and continue to push for civil rights and voting rights today. We have come to these chambers tonight, Mr. Speaker, to continue their work as members of the Congressional Black Caucus. We call on Congress to immediately pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2015. The American people deserve to have real voting rights. Thank you, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, not only for your leadership tonight, but for being a leader, for walking in their shoes, and for hosting the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order honoring three giants. This year is the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act. Leaders espoused words in 1965 that still hold true today, words because of the work of these three giants, works like: We have proved that great progress is possible. We know how much still remains to be done. And if our efforts continue, if our will is strong, if our hearts are right, and if courage remains our constant companion, then my fellow Americans, I am confident we shall overcome. Our objective must be to assure that all Americans play by the same rules, and all Americans play against the same odds. Who amongst us would claim that that is true today? Just last week His Holiness, Pope Francis, delivered a historic, profound, provocative address to the Joint Session of Congress. This address reminded us that the nation is ``considered great'' when ``it fosters a culture which enables people to dream of full rights for all their brothers and sisters.'' At the White House, he quoted from Martin Luther King, to use a telling phrase of the Reverend Martin Luther King: ``We can say that we have defaulted on a promissory note, and now is the time to honor it.'' These three individuals we honor tonight tirelessly contributed to this culture of full rights and equality we are committed to achieving. Tonight's roll call: Congressman Lou Stokes. I am honored to be the third African American from Ohio to follow in his footsteps, following my mentor and dear friend, Stephanie Tubbs Jones, my colleague, mentor and friend, Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, who said at his footsteps: I don't salute or get excited about a one hit wonder because Lou Stokes was far from that. Lou Stokes loved people. He loved the law. He loved the legislative process. He loved his family. And he loved Cleveland, Ohio. You have heard so much about him, I won't repeat it. I will submit it for the Record, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, if that is okay. But I will forever be grateful for his encouragement, his friendship, his wisdom, and his leadership. I can't think of a time or a decision in my life that I didn't pick up the phone and call Lou Stokes. Love you, Lou Stokes. Let me just briefly say we also salute Amelia Boynton Robinson, and much has been said about her. I stand on her shoulders. And then Julian Bond, another great civil rights icon, whose passion and dedication to equality and justice propelled him to the Georgia Legislature, the NAACP, and the Southern Poverty Law Center, which he co-founded. [[Page H6299]] His commitment to ending discrimination and injustice continues to inspire us, and his legacy will guide us and the next generation of civil rights leaders and activists to greatness. He, like the other individuals we pay tribute to tonight, helped change this country for the better. Thank you, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. Thank you to all my colleagues with the Congressional Black Caucus for capturing and reflecting on the lives of three great civil warriors as we took a walk in their footsteps of greatness. Tonight the Congressional Black Caucus honors the life and legacy of three Civil Rights leaders--Congressman Louis Stokes, Amelia Boynton Robinson and Julian Bond who dedicated their lives to making our nation a better place. Countless more follow in their footsteps and continue to push for civil rights and voting rights today. We have come to these chambers to continue their work as Members of the Congressional Black Caucus; we call on Congress to immediately pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2015. The American people deserve to have real voting rights now. Thank you Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee for hosting the CBC's Special Order Hour paying tribute to Congressman Louis Stokes, Amelia Boynton Robinson, and Julian Bond. This year is the 50th Anniversary of Voting Rights Act. Leaders . . . espoused words in 1965 that still hold true today. Words like: We have proved that great progress is possible. We know how much still remains to be done. And if our efforts continue, and if our will is strong, and if our hearts are right, and if courage remains our constant companion, then my fellow Americans, I am confident, we shall overcome. Our objective must be to assure that all Americans play by the same rules, and all Americans play against the same odds. Who among us would claim that that is true today? Just last week, His Holiness Pope Francis delivered a historic, profound, and provocative address to a Joint Session of Congress. This address reminded us that a nation is ``considered great'' when ``it fosters a culture which enables people to dream of full rights for all their brothers and sisters.'' At the White House, he quoted words from MLK . . . to use a telling phrase of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. . . . we can say that we have defaulted on a promissory note and now is the time to honor it. The three individuals we honor tonight tirelessly contributed to this culture of full rights and equality we are committed to achieving. Congressman Stokes I am honored to be the third African-American from Ohio to follow Congressman Louis Stokes who served for 30 years in Congress. I am forever grateful for his encouragement, friendship, wisdom, and leadership. He earned a seat on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, the first person of color to ever do so, and focused on improving housing and urban development for veterans, seniors, and the poor. In 1971, along with our esteemed Dean of the House, Congressman John Conyers, Congressman Stokes helped found the Congressional Black Caucus to promote economic, educational, and social issues important to African Americans: this is a purpose the CBC continues to fulfill to this day, and a purpose I am honored to advance. His indelible mark in history will continue to live on. Amelia Boynton Robinson It is also an honor to pay tribute to Amelia Boynton Robinson--the matriarch of the voting rights movement. As an African-American female serving in the U.S. Congress, I stand on the shoulders of Mrs. Boynton Robinson. Mrs. Boynton Robinson helped organize the Selma-to-Montgomery marches, and walked at the front of the line that fateful day on March 7, 1965, which we now know as ``Bloody Sunday''. On August 6, 1965, she was the guest of honor at the White House when President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 into law. I had the privilege to join Mrs. Boynton Robinson this past March, as thousands of Americans marched once again over the Edmund Pettus Bridge, remembering the struggles and recommitting ourselves to restoring voting rights protections, equality, and justice. Julian Bond Julian Bond was a civil rights icon whose passion and dedication to equality and justice propelled him to the Georgia legislature, the NAACP, and the Southern Poverty Law Center, which he co-founded. His commitment to ending discrimination and injustice continues to inspire us and his legacy will guide the next generation of civil rights leaders and activists to greatness. He, like the other individuals we pay tribute to tonight, helped changed this country for the better. Thank you CBC for capturing and reflecting on the lives of three great civil rights warriors as we took a walk in their footsteps of greatness. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Congresswoman Beatty, thank you for letting us know whose footsteps we walk in and for that celebratory statement. Mr. Speaker, it is certainly my pleasure to yield to the gentlewoman from the U.S. Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett), who has come with the expertise of a renowned and trained lawyer, one who is a collaborator. Ms. PLASKETT. Thank you so much to my colleague, Sheila Jackson Lee. I want to thank you and the Congressional Black Caucus for this Special Order Hour, a special tribute to the lives and legacy of Representative Louis Stokes, Amelia Boynton Robinson, and Julian Bond. Thank you, Ms. Jackson Lee, for your work here in Congress, your tireless efforts to raise awareness to issues which many Americans may have forgotten or not given thought to. Thank you for your mentorship to us younger members here and your tireless efforts to support not only the people of Houston, but the people of America. Thank you for allowing us this most important opportunity to pay tribute to these remarkable individuals. Mr. Speaker, today we gather in reverence and in solemn reflection to honor the lives and legacies of some exceptional people, some exceptional Americans, who we have lost in these recent months. These were civil rights activists, statesmen and women, trailblazers, members of a great generation of individuals who gave so much of themselves to the Civil Rights Movement and to the advancement of minorities in our country. They are former Congressman Louis Stokes, former chairman of the NAACP and Georgia State Senator Julian Bond, and civil rights icon Mrs. Amelia Boynton Robinson. A centenarian--Mrs. Robinson's 110 years of life, that in itself is a great honor--she was dedicated to education, fighting state-sanctioned discriminatory practices against African Americans, and voter disenfranchisement. {time} 2015 One can make the argument that her role in Selma's civil rights demonstrations, including the infamous march on Bloody Sunday where she was beaten unconscious by State police, paved the way, through the subsequent passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, for both Congressman Stokes and State Representative Bond to serve in elected office. As the first African American elected to Congress from the State of Ohio, Congressman Stokes was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus and spent his 30-year career in Congress advocating issues of importance to Ohioans and to African Americans across the country. Julian Bond, that great statesman from Georgia, was one of 11 African Americans elected to the Georgia House of Representatives after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Bond served 20 years in both legislative chambers in the State of Georgia and served as the first president of the Southern Poverty Law Center. He also served as chairman of the NAACP. These individuals have impacted the lives of so many African Americans and have undoubtedly advanced the rights and interests of minorities in both our States' and our Nation's governments. Similarly, I would like to just take a moment to recognize two individuals from my own home district of the Virgin Islands who, like Congressman Stokes, Julian Bond, and Amelia Robinson, have changed the landscape of the Virgin Islands through their advocacy and education. I would like to recognize a former judge and Lieutenant Governor of the Virgin Islands, the late Julio A. Brady, who, like Julian Bond and Congressman Stokes, used his training as an attorney to contribute to his community outside of the courtroom. As a U.S. attorney, judge, and attorney general, Judge Brady fought to remove barriers of injustice. He was laid to rest this week. Like Congressman Stokes and [[Page H6300]] Amelia Robinson, Judge Brady's legacy of service will carry on. Ursula Krigger was also a centenarian, like Amelia Robinson, and, at age 113 was the oldest living Virgin Islander until her passing this month. She was a griot, an educator whose longevity afforded a unique perspective of witnessing the modern advancement of our territory. The lives and legacies of these individuals are etched in the annals of our history and their impact forever ingrained in the minds and hearts of the many lives they touched. I am a better person; and, indeed, we are a better nation through the work of these individuals. I have listened to my colleagues tonight speak about Representative Louis Stokes, Amelia Boynton Robinson, and Julian Bond and the personal impact these individuals had on the work of my colleagues with whom they served and have known personally. Understand, that while many like myself may not have had the great honor and pleasure of toiling and working with them shoulder to shoulder in the struggle for civil rights and the advancement of minorities in our country, Americans like myself understand and appreciate their sacrifice, and we understand the work that must still be done. We will continue their legacy here today and in Congress in the future. Thank you so much, Congressional Black Caucus, for this time. And thank you again to my colleague from Texas, Sheila Jackson Lee, for the time that I have been afforded to speak on behalf of these great Americans. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Congresswoman Plaskett, thank you so very much for laying the groundwork for those who now step into those footsteps, and you have done so with such leadership and certainly such passion. Thank you so very much. Mr. Speaker, what is my time remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Russell). The gentlewoman from Texas has 2 minutes remaining. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me conclude by thanking the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus and my colleagues. It is so important for the Congressional Black Caucus to be able to talk to America-- Representative Butterfield, Representative Rangel, Representative Sewell, Delegate Holmes Norton, Representative Bobby Scott, Representative Joyce Beatty, and, of course, Congresswoman Plaskett--to be able to give life to why we are here representing all of America. We have those special people that, without our voices, would not be able to be heard. I simply want to add these words of the Pope, again, to be able to remind everyone why these icons that we are speaking of tonight in the Congressional Black Caucus--46 of us, along with Senator Booker--have a vital role in this place. As the Pope indicated, I would encourage you to keep in mind all those people around us who are trapped in the cycle of poverty. They, too, need to be given hope. The fight against poverty and hunger must be fought constantly on many fronts, especially in its causes. I know that Americans today, as in the past, are working to deal with this problem. That is the essence of Julian Bond, who never stopped giving; that is the essence of Amelia Boynton Robinson, who continued to fight for civil rights up until her death at the age of 104 on August 6, 2015; that is the essence of Congressman Lou Stokes, a legislative giant, the chairman of an appropriations subcommittee, a person who went to public housing and places where children were and told America that your children are dying because they are living in substandard housing, lead poisoning was killing them, which gave me the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, as I said before, to give a grant to my public housing just this past week on helping with lead poisoning. I worked for Lou Stokes, and I am very glad to note that, working for him, I can say, truly a gentleman, truly a leader. To this Congress, I beg of you, let us look at these icons and celebrate not only their lives, but commit to the passion and justice of their lives, and, as well, the words of Pope Francis that tell us to do unto others as we would like them to do unto us. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to again thank the members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to speak in praise of Louis Stokes, one of the greatest and most respected Members ever to serve in this body, who died on Tuesday, August 18, 2015, at his home near Cleveland, Ohio at the age of 90. It is not unusual in these days for commentators and politicians to talk of something called ``American Exceptionalism.'' But what is meant by the term? Mr. Speaker, one way to understand the term: America is exceptional because it produces and finds persons like Louis Stokes and affords them the opportunity to utilize their talents to the fullest in the service of their community and their country. Think about it: in what other nation does a little African American boy born in 1925 on the east side of Cleveland and raised in the Outhwaite Homes housing project by a mother who worked as a domestic go on to become a lawyer who argues and wins a landmark criminal justice reform case (Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968)) in the United States Supreme Court; become the first African American elected to Congress; is selected to chair the powerful Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, the Select Committee on Assassinations, and an Appropriations Subcommittee responsible for more than $90 billion annually in federal outlays? Yes, America is an exceptional nation and Louis Stokes was an exceptional human being. Mr. Speaker, Louis Stokes was born on February 23, 1925, in Cleveland, Ohio, to Charles and Louise Cinthy (nee Stone) Stokes. When he was three years old, his father, who worked in a laundromat, died leaving young Louis and his younger brother, Carl, to be raised by their mother, who worked as a domestic for affluent families in the wealthy Cleveland suburbs. Louis Stokes' maternal grandmother played a critical role in his life because she took care of the Stokes boys while their mother was at work and instilled in them ``the idea that work with your hands is the hard way of doing things'' and encouraged them over and over ``to learn to use their heads.'' Louis Stokes took the advice to heart so after attending Cleveland's Central High School and serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, he returned home to attend what is now Case Western Reserve University on the G.I. Bill at night while working during the day for the Veterans Administration and the Department of the Treasury. After graduating from college in two years where he excelled as a student, Louis Stokes was accepted for admission to Cleveland Marshall School of Law, from which he graduated in 1953; three years later, his brother Carl would also graduate from Cleveland Marshall School of Law and the two of them would go on to form the law firm of Stokes & Stokes specializing in the areas of civil rights and criminal law. In 1964, the Supreme Court decided the landmark case of Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964), which established the principle of ``one person, one vote'' governing the reapportionment of legislative boundaries. The following year, working on behalf of the local branch of the NAACP, Louis Stokes led the legal challenge to the Ohio legislature's congressional redistricting, which had the effect of diluting African American voting strength in Cleveland. The challenge was unsuccessful in the federal district court but undeterred, Louis Stokes, joined by Charles Lucas, an African American Republican, successfully appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which in an order handed down in 1967 ruled the redistricting plan unconstitutional and ordered it redrawn, resulting in the creation of Ohio's first majority-black district, the 21st Congressional District of Ohio. Ironically, Louis Stokes would defeat his one-time ally Charles Lucas to win that seat in November 1968, capturing 75% of the vote, the closest of his 15 successful elections to the U.S. House of Representatives. For the next 30 years, from 1969 to 1999, Congressman Stokes tirelessly fought for his constituents in Cleveland and for the best interests of the people of Ohio and the United States. Louis Stokes, a founding member and Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus from 1972-74, was the epitome of a public servant. In his second term in Congress, he won appointment to the powerful House Appropriations Committee, where he served for 28 years, later becoming the second African American ``Cardinal'' in history when he was selected to chair the VA, HUD, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. Because of the esteem in which he was held by his colleagues and the leadership, Louis Stokes would also later be selected to Chair the House Permanent Select Committee [[Page H6301]] on Intelligence and the Select Committee charged with investigating the assassinations of President Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. As Chairman of the House Ethics Committee and a person of unquestioned integrity, Louis Stokes oversaw the committee's investigation of the corruption scandal known as ABSCAM in 1979-80, which eventually led to convictions of a senator and six House members. Mr. Speaker, Louis Stokes perhaps is best known for the national attention he attracted in 1987 as a member of the House Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms Transactions with Iran/(``Iran- Contra''), the scandal involving the illegal sale of military weapons to the Ayatollah Khomeini's Iran to generate money to fund the illegal contra war in Nicaragua. In response to the claim by Colonel Oliver North that he acted out of patriotism in engineering the illegal weapons sales and diverting the proceeds to fund the contras, a stern Louis Stokes lectured the misguided Colonel North on the rule of law, the true meaning of patriotism, and, in the process American exceptionalism: ``I suppose that what has been most disturbing to me about your testimony is the ugly part. In fact, it has been more than ugly. It has been chilling, and, in fact, frightening. I'm not just talking about your part in this, but the entire scenario, about government officials who plotted and conspired, who set up a straw man, a fall guy. Officials who lied, misrepresented and deceived. Officials who planned to superimpose upon our government a layer outside of our government, shrouded in secrecy and only accountable to the conspirators. ``Colonel, as I sit here this morning looking at you in your uniform, I cannot help but remember that I wore the uniform of this country in World War II in a segregated Army. I wore it as proudly as you do, even though our government required black and white soldiers in the same Army to live, sleep, eat and travel separate and apart, while fighting and dying for our country. But because of the rule of law, today's servicemen in America suffer no such indignity. ``My mother, a widow, raised two boys. She had an eighth-grade education. She was a domestic worker who scrubbed floors. One son became the first black mayor of a major American city. The other sits today as chairman of a House intelligence committee. Only in America, Col. North. Only in America. And while I admire your love for America, I hope that you will never forget that others too love America just as much as you do and that others will die for America, just as quick as you will.'' Louis Stokes never wavered in his belief that America could fulfill the promise of its Founders or his dedication to the principles of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, stating: ``I'm going to keep on denouncing the inequities of this system, but I'm going to work within it. To go outside the system would be to deny myself--to deny my own existence. I've beaten the system. I've proved it can be done--so have a lot of others. ``But the problem is that a black man has to be extra special to win in this system. Why should you have to be a super black to get someplace? That's what's wrong in the society. The ordinary black man doesn't have the same chance as the ordinary white man does.'' Mr. Speaker, Louis Stokes' commitment to fairness and equal treatment started long before he was elected to Congress. As a lawyer for the NAACP, he brought anti-discrimination lawsuits, represented demonstrators arrested in antidiscrimination marches and sit-ins, and took the cases of poor persons charged with crimes. One of those criminal cases he took is known to every lawyer in America and appreciated by every person who cherishes the protections guaranteed by the 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. I am speaking of the famous case of Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968) won by Louis Stokes in which the Supreme Court held that a police officer could ``stop and frisk'' an individual only where he could articulate a reasonable basis that the person was, or was about to be, engaged in criminal activity. As a result of Terry v. Ohio, a police officer has the right to stop, frisk, and question an individual he reasonably suspects to be engaged in criminal activity, but cannot seize items from that person if the pat down of the suspect's outer clothing does not reveal any weapons posing a threat to the officer's safety. Because of Louis Stokes' exceptional advocacy in Terry v. Ohio, the right of every individual to secure from unreasonable searches and seizures was preserved while at the same not impeding the ability of law enforcement officers to perform their duties safely. Mr. Speaker, every citizen benefits from this ruling and communities that have a history of being harassed by law enforcement protected by the Constitution from arbitrary and abusive treatment by law enforcement. But the fight for a criminal justice system that respects the rights of all persons is not over. That is why I am proud to be the Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations and a leader in the effort to reform the criminal justice system so that all persons receive fair and equal treatment regardless of their race, gender, religion, or national origin. Louis Stokes fought tirelessly to fulfill the promise of the 14th Amendment that ``no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.'' It is a fight I am proud to continue today. Mr. Speaker, Louis Stokes will be mourned by friends and colleagues on both sides of the aisle who had the privilege to serve alongside him. He was a mentor to me and I will always remember his commanding presence and cherish the assistance he provided me and the example he set for new Members to follow. My thoughts and prayers are with his Jay, Louis' beloved wife of 55 years; to his children, Shelly, Louis, Angela, and Lorene; his grandchildren; and the untold thousands of persons who touched and whose lives were touched by one of Cleveland's greatest sons. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to observe a moment of silence in memory of Louis Stokes, an exceptional American, and the gentleman from Ohio who served in this chamber for three decades with honor, integrity, and distinction. [From cleveland.com] Lou Stokes Put Health Impacts of Substandard Housing on the National Agenda, and in Cleveland: Terry Allan, Dorr Dearborn and Dave Jacobs (Opinion) In this file photo from 2012, Timothy Benner, then 8, looks outside from his Maurice Avenuue home in Cleveland. After Timothy and some of his siblings tested positive for lead poisoning, traced to the soil around their home, their mother restricted their outdoor play time. U.S. Rep. Lou Stokes, who died earlier this month, championed national attention and funding to address the problem of lead poisoning in inner- city children. Recent stories and opinion pieces have eulogized the many accomplishments of the late U.S. Rep. Louis Stokes, from civil-rights champion to accomplished litigator, statesman and lawmaker. We believe that Louis Stokes should also be recognized as a national leader who clearly understood the connection between substandard housing and health, and acted to address the problem, at a time when very few did. Back in the 1980s, the scope and magnitude of the childhood lead-poisoning problem and its impact on our nation's children was not fully recognized or well understood. Subsequent efforts to increase blood screening in early childhood revealed that Greater Cleveland had among the highest rates of lead poisoning in the country, adding to the compounding disadvantages of children living in poverty in our community and across the United States. Some of us have vivid memories from 1991, when Congressman Stokes held up a Newsweek magazine cover story on threats posed to children by lead paint, passionately advocating for the voiceless in our society while educating the community about this silent epidemic. He wanted all of us to understand the debilitating consequences of childhood lead exposure in the home environment and its impact on the life trajectory of these vulnerable kids. Congressman Stokes turned that message into action, by using his formidiable legislative acumen to establish the first Healthy Homes program in the country within the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. When he recognized in 1998 that young infants in his district were suffering from sometimes fatal lung bleeding associated with water-damaged, moldy homes, he asked HUD to address the impact of inner-city homes on children's health. He understood that houses are systems, and that independently addressing lead paint problems, moisture intrusion and mold, injury risks and other housing hazards was inefficient and costly. He also had the vision to recognize that treating children at the hospital, only to release them back into the same substandard home that made them sick, created a vicious circle with major public health consequences. He knew these homes needed to be fixed. The HUD Office of Lead Hazard Control had shown interest in applying the experience of lead-poisoning prevention to include other health hazards in the home, such as plumbing problems and leaky basements, but lacked the authority. Through his vision, the Congressman invited us and others to testify at the House Subcommittee on HUD appropriations to see what could be done. Lou Stokes convinced his fellow committee members to provide the very first appropriation of $10 million to HUD for `Healthy Homes' prevention programs in low-income housing. His legacy has resulted in millions of homes that are safer and healthier as a direct result of that investment in our children. Since that time, [[Page H6302]] the HUD Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes has provided more than $175 million in competitively awarded grants to communities across the nation to investigate and address health hazards in homes. The asthma home-visit program in Cleveland that decreases the hospitalization rate of children with asthma, highlighted in The Plain Dealer in June, is a direct outgrowth of Congressman Stokes' work. In 2012, HUD created the Louis Stokes Healthy Homes Award and presented the first one to him at the City Club of Cleveland. When he received the award, he pointed out that much has been achieved and that much more remains to be done. He also said that he really didn't know what all the fuss was about, as he was just a kid who grew up in public housing, who wanted to do the right thing for our children. He was an inspiration to us all. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to speak in praise of Julian Bond, one of the leading lights of the Civil Rights Movement, who died on Saturday, August 15, 2015, at the age of 75. While Julian lost his battle to the illness that claimed his life, it is the struggle for civil rights and human dignity he helped to win that he will forever remembered and revered. Horace Julian Bond was born January 14, 1940 in Nashville, Tennessee to Julia Agnes and Horace Mann Bond. Julian's father was the first African-American President of Lincoln University of Pennsylvania, the same institution attended by Thurgood Marshall and Langston Hughes who would both go on to make substantial contributions to the Civil Rights Movement and the advancement of African-Americans. Julian's father later became president of Atlanta University and Julian decided to attend Morehouse College, one of the leading black colleges in the nation. Julian Bond, who came from a long line of educators, determined at an early age to put his journalistic and organizing talents in service of the cause of civil rights and racial equality. While a student at Morehouse College, Julian helped found The Pegasus, a literary magazine, and led nonviolent student protests against segregation in Atlanta parks, restaurants, and movie theaters. Mr. Speaker, today it is difficult to imagine there once was a time in our country when blacks and whites could not eat together in public restaurants, use the same public restrooms, stay at the same hotels, or attend the same schools. Julian Bond answered the call to action and put his studies on hold to devote all of his energies and efforts to ending segregation and racial discrimination. Mr. Speaker, it is not unusual these days for us to think of a champion as someone who receives the highest accolades in sports. Julian Bond was a champion of the people. His success is measured not in the numbers of trophies, medals, ribbons, and championship banners, but in the number of doors and opportunities he helped to open for those who had been neglected, marginalized, and disenfranchised. Julian Bond knew that to bring about non-violent social change it was necessary to organize so he co-founded the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). SNCC, which organized and mobilized the participation of students and young people in the Civil Rights Movement, conceived the Freedom Rides that challenged the practice of racial segregation in interstate transportation and the Mississippi Freedom Summer project that undertook the dangerous work of helping African Americans register to vote in the state most committed to maintaining White supremacy by any means necessary. SNCC was not the first leadership role history and circumstance would call upon Julian Bond to assume; nor would it be the last. In 1965, after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Julian Bond was elected to represent the residents of the 32nd district in Georgia House of Representatives. But on January 10, 1966, his white colleagues in the Georgia House voted 184-12 not to seat him because he had publicly expressed his opposition to the Vietnam War. Julian Bond challenged the refusal of the Georgia House to seat him and took his case all the way to the United States Supreme Court, which ruled in the unanimous decision of Bond v. Floyd, 385 U.S. 116 (1966), that expressing opposition to the Vietnam War was speech protected by the First Amendment and directed that he be seated as a duly elected member of the state legislature. Julian Bond would go on to serve three more terms in the George House, where he co-founded the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus, and six terms in the Georgia State Senate. In 1971, Julian Bond co-founded and served as president of the Southern Poverty Law Center that tracks the actions of hate groups to better inform and prepare communities about the dangers these groups pose. Julian Bond consistently identified issues of civil inequality and provided solutions by gathering groups of community leaders, professionals, and educators to protect what the laws and policies would not, our basic civil rights. In 1998, Julian Bond's commitment to justice and equality led him to answer the call to serve and accept the position of Chairman of the NAACP, a post he held until 2010. Julian Bond was able to bring the earnest fight to achieve equality into the modern era as he watched African-Americans achieve the highest awards in their professions and continued to break down barriers. In November 2008, Julian Bond witnessed the election of the first African American President of the United States, a feat thought impossible just a decade earlier. Mr. Speaker, because of trailblazers like Julian Bond millions of Americans gained access to opportunities previously denied to members of their communities. Julian Bond spent 5 years with SNCC, 8 years as president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, 12 years as the president of NAACP, 20 years as a state representative, and 75 years an unwavering champion of civil rights for all people, including the LGBT community. My thoughts and prayers are with Julian's beloved wife Pamela, his children and grandchildren; and the untold millions of persons whose lives were touched by one of America's greatest sons. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to observe a moment of silence in memory of Julian Bond, a tireless and eloquent voice for justice, equality, and human dignity who did so much to close the gap between the promise of America's founding ideals and the reality of people's lives. Civil Rights Giant Julian Bond Never Stopped Giving (Posted By Edna Kane-Williams on August 31, 2015) President Obama described him as a ``hero'' who ``helped changed this country for the better.'' The Rev. Jesse Jackson called him a ``leader with strength, character.'' NAACP Chairman Roslyn Brock said he ``inspired a generation of civil rights leaders.'' Teresa Sullivan, president of the University of Virginia, where he taught history for many years, called him a beloved retired professor who ``shaped the course of history through his life and work.'' How ever you choose to describe Julian Bond, one thing is for sure: He taught us all how to stand for what we believe. And he believed in freedom, justice and equality. For me, one of the most remarkable attributes of this civil rights giant is the fact that he never stopped giving. Even at the time of his brief illness and death on Aug. 15 at the age of 75, he was still serving faithfully as chairman emeritus on the NAACP board. Even after he retired from the professorship at the University of Virginia, he continued to mentor and remained a role model for students and others. A writer, poet, television commentator, lecturer and college teacher--and as a former politician--Julian Bond was one of those rare people whose work became legendary while he was still doing it. In fact, the Library of Congress once called him a ``living legend.'' And because of the magnitude of his work, he leaves many treasures that will simply keep on giving. UVA, where his papers are housed, has announced its goal to establish a Julian Bond Professorship in Civil Rights and Social Justice, which ``will continue Bond's scholarly legacy.'' There will certainly be many more designations in honor of his life's work. And surely some will rise, seeking to follow in his footsteps. Mr. Bond believed in young people's ability to take the civil rights and social justice baton and run with it. Earlier this year, he told a group of Howard University students, ``I think you know what the problems are. You know what the solutions are, and I'm sure we will be glad to help. But don't depend on us to tell you what to do. Just go out and do it.'' Well, he left an amazing road map. From his pioneering civil rights work as a cofounder of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to all of his work and contributions thereafter, Julian Bond was a model for anyone who aims to make an impact and leave the world a better place. In that regard, he was a role model for us all. What a life. What a legacy. Amelia Boynton was born on August 18, 1911, in Savannah, Georgia. Her early activism included holding black voter registration drives in Selma, Boynton spent her first two years of college at Georgia State College (now Savannah State University), then transferred to the Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University) in Alabama. She graduated from Tuskegee with a home economics degree before further pursuing her education at Tennessee State University, Virginia State University and Temple University. In the 1930's, Boynton Robinson began her activist career by registering African Americans to vote. In 1964, she ran for Congress to represent Alabama. She was the first woman to have run for this Democratic seat, and although she did not win, she received 10% of [[Page H6303]] votes. As the civil rights movement picked up, Boynton asked Martin Luther King Jr., who had witnessed her arrest in January 1965 for seeking to register Black voters, to visit Selma and empower the community. King accepted, and joined Boynton Robinson and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in planning the march from Selma to Montgomery on March 17th, 1965. As approximately 600 marchers walked across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, they were confronted by 200 state troopers and Alabama policemen, who shot teargas and beat the non-violent protesters. This horrific event came to be known as Bloody Sunday. At least 17 protesters were sent to the hospital, including Boynton Robinson. A picture of her unconscious body lying on the ground after an officer shot tear gas into her throat spread through every news media outlet across the globe, and quickly became a symbol for race relations in the United States at the time. The Selma to Montgomery march was a pivotal demonstration in the civil rights movement, leading to future victories such as the Voting Rights Acts of 1965 signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Amelia Boynton Robinson was an incredible activist, leader, and woman, and is remembered for her courage and strength throughout the civil rights movement. She worked for equality for all until her last day on this earth. [From the Two-Way, Aug. 26, 2015] (By Bill Chappell) Amelia Boynton Robinson, Survivor of `Bloody Sunday,' Dies at 104 Amelia Boynton Robinson, who went from being beaten on a bridge in Selma, Ala., in 1965 to being pushed across the bridge in a wheelchair alongside the president of the United States, has died at age 104. Her daughter, Germaine Bowser, confirmed to Troy Public Radio's Kyle Gassiott that Boynton Robinson died early Wednesday morning. She had been hospitalized after suffering several strokes this summer. Born in Savannah, Ga., Boynton Robinson was a pioneer in the voting rights movement who took part in the event that came to be known as ``Bloody Sunday,'' when she and other activists were attacked by state troopers as they tried to march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Along with Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., Boynton Robinson held hands with President Obama as the men walked across the bridge this past March, marking the 50th anniversary of the march in Selma. The Montgomery Advertiser reports: ``Boynton Robinson asked Martin Luther King Jr. to come to Selma to mobilize the local community in the civil rights movement. She worked with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and helped plan the Selma to Montgomery march. Her role in the event was recaptured in the movie ``Selma,'' where she was portrayed by actress Lorraine Toussaint. She was invited as a guest of honor to attend the signing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by President Lyndon B. Johnson.'' Boynton Robinson also ``made history in 1964 as the first African-American to run for Congress in Alabama,'' Alabama Public Radio reported earlier this year, when the civil rights legend attended Obama's 2015 State of the Union address in Washington, DC. She was the guest of Rep. Terri Sewell, Alabama's first elected African-American congresswoman. general leave Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order. What a grand opportunity to cite these great Americans: Amelia Boynton Robinson, Congressman Lou Stokes, and Julian Bond. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Texas? There was no objection. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, Amelia Boyton Robinson was an American hero who devoted her entire life to the fight for equal rights for all. She was a child suffragette, who alongside her mother, advocated for the women's vote and then as a young woman fought for the right of blacks to have their say at the ballot box. After bold run to represent Alabama in Congress, Mrs. Robinson helped organize the Bloody Sunday March from Selma to Montgomery. She was hospitalized after being knocked unconscious by a white officer on that perilous day, which left her undaunted and even more determined to fight for the African- American vote. It was my honor to nominate her for a Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Phoenix Award earlier this year, but sadly, she died before I could present it to her. Thankfully, however, Mrs. Robinson was able to share enough stories about her courageous experiences to fill a history book and resonate for generations to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6293-H6303] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] A TRIBUTE TO AMELIA BOYNTON ROBINSON, CONGRESSMAN LOUIS STOKES, AND JULIAN BOND The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rouzer). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, thank you very much. I am very privileged tonight to lead the Special Order of the Members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Let me thank our chairman, Chairman G.K. Butterfield, for continuing this tradition and for his continued leadership, encouragement, and avocation for Members and for the stories of those who have been such leaders in our Nation and such major issues that we have been able to contribute to for the understanding of our colleagues. Let me also make mention of my colleagues, Congresswoman Kelly and Congressman Payne, who have led us on this Special Order for the Congressional Black Caucus. I thank them for their leadership and service. A very special thanks to those of you who are watching at home and have often watched at home and have followed the Congressional Black Caucus through social media, social network, and also know that our major issues of criminal justice reform, civil rights, the restoration of the Voting Rights Act, and many others have been to speak to the vulnerable. Tonight we again speak to you, but we speak of those heroes that we have lost over the last couple of months. Tonight we pay tribute to Amelia Boynton Robinson, Congressman Lou Stokes, and, of course, Julian Bond. Our Nation was built on the values of dealing with the issues of freedom, justice and equality, values and principles that were perfectly embodied by the service and sacrifices of these three leaders. Mr. Speaker, over the last week we have watched the Pope make his way through a number of American cities and use words that are music to the ears of Members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Let me take just one of many citations that I will utilize to characterize these three individuals: ``The complexities of history,'' said Pope Francis, ``and the reality of human weakness notwithstanding, these men and women, for all their many differences and limitations, were able, by hard work and self- sacrifice, some at the cost of their lives, to build a better future.'' I would offer to say that Amelia Boynton Robinson, Congressman Lou Stokes, and Julian Bond, through the sacrifice of their individual families and their lives, were able to make a better future for us. We know the civil rights activist Amelia Boynton Robinson, 1965, was a leader of the Bloody Sunday march and personified the optimism, determination, and courage that are at the heart of the American spirit. She truly made our lives better. Known as the matriarch of our Nation's civil rights movement, Ms. Boynton Robinson fought courageously to ensure that every American citizen had the right to vote. Her drive to secure universal voting rights was amazing, and certainly she risked her life when she crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge. In her words, her son said civil rights was her entire life. [[Page H6294]] We now understand that Congressman Lou Stokes made an amazing and impactful statement legislatively and throughout his life. He was a consummate public servant, a trailblazer who broke down barriers for generations of African Americans. He was the first African American Congressman from Ohio who served 30 years. Representing a portion of Cleveland, he prioritized the advancement of our Nation's most vulnerable populations. He advocated for more funding of education, housing, development projects, access to health care. He was one of the fiercest advocates for public housing. Mr. Stokes was a major proponent and leader that asked the Housing and Urban Development to assess the poor, deleterious, horrible conditions that children were living in as housing impacted their health. In fact, just recently I presented my housing authority a lead poisoning grant which was instigated, was encouraged, was advocated for by Congressman Lou Stokes. He has saved thousands upon thousands of lives. I thank him for organizing the Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust, and I want to thank him personally for allowing me work for him as a staff member of the Select Committee on Assassinations, which he ultimately chaired. We thank him for his amazing service. He once said, ``I am going to keep on denouncing the inequities of this system, but I am going to work within it. To go outside the system would be to deny myself, to deny my own existence. I have beaten the system. I have proved it can be done. So have a lot of others.'' This is, of course, the kind of leader that Lou Stokes was. Our friend, Julian Bond, was a civil rights icon. He was a leader in the fight for equality, freedom, and equal justice and opportunity. He inspired generations of Americans to build a better future for all people. Julian Bond was considered the young one in the movement with Dr. Martin Luther King. He stood as not only an original, but a fierce advocate of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the founding president of the Southern Poverty Law Center. Elected to office, of course, he himself fought against discrimination. He was discriminated himself. When he was refused a seat in the Georgia State Legislature, it did not in any way demean or undermine his courage or inspiration. He went on to be seated and to do great things. Tonight we are privileged to be able to honor and pay tribute to these three heroes. We are called to follow the example they set, to fight to ensure that all Americans have access to equal opportunity so they will have a fair shot at economic prosperity, have the right to vote, be free from mass incarceration, and do the things that America bestows upon them. Again, these individuals, at the cost of their lives or their own futures, built a better future for us. With that, I am delighted to yield to the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Mr. G.K. Butterfield, a former high superior court judge--I am calling him all kinds of names--but, in any event, a dynamic leader of the Congressional Black Caucus. Again, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee for her friendship, for her leadership, and I certainly thank her for yielding time tonight. Let me also thank the other Members who are on the floor this evening to help in honoring the lives of Louis Stokes, Amelia Boynton Robinson, and Julian Bond. These three are icons, absolute icons, of the civil rights movement, who in their own way paved the way for so many. I had the high honor of calling Lou Stokes and Julian Bond personal friends. As the first African American to represent Ohio in Congress, Representative Lou Stokes was a pioneer in public service. He broke down numerous barriers for African Americans during his extraordinary career as an elected official on the local, State, and Federal levels. First elected to Congress in 1969 and serving for 30 long years in the U.S. House, he was a founder of the Congressional Black Caucus and the first African American to serve on the House Appropriations Committee. He was the founder of the CBC Health Braintrust, which remains active today in protecting health, equity, and reducing health disparities. Congressman Stokes was the embodiment of a public servant. He selflessly used his elected positions to increase opportunities for millions of African Americans. We will miss our dear friend Lou Stokes. But the impact of his legacy of service and commitment to his constituents and to the African American community will be remembered for generations. Often referred to as the matriarch of the movement, Amelia Boynton Robinson's role in Bloody Sunday, as you have already heard, and the march from Selma to Montgomery is immortalized in the Oscar-nominated film ``Selma.'' She also made history in 1964 by becoming the first African American woman from Alabama to run for Congress. In her congressional election that year, Mrs. Boynton Robinson garnered 10 percent of the vote despite the fact that African Americans only made up 1 percent of the voting population in Alabama's Seventh Congressional District. Forty-six years later the CBC's very own representative, Terri Sewell, whom we will hear from in just a few moments, now holds that seat here in Congress. This year, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, we remember the selfless actions of individuals like Amelia Boynton Robinson who fought against systems of injustice so that future generations would have opportunities that were not possible to generations past. Tonight we honor Mrs. Boynton Robinson for her legacy which continues in each of us. Finally, Mr. Speaker, tonight we honor Julian Bond, a forefather of America's civil rights movement and one of our country's greatest advocates for freedom and equality and equitable treatment for all people. From his work as a student leader during the 1960s to his service in the Georgia House of Representatives and the State Senate, Julian Bond was a leader in the fight against racism and segregation. {time} 1930 I first met Julian Bond at the funeral of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in 1968. As the founding president of the Southern Poverty Law Center and chairman of the board of the NAACP, Julian Bond continued his work educating citizens around the world of the struggles of African Americans and the history of civil rights here in America. Julian Bond spent his lifetime in public service, calling for equal civil and human rights not only for African Americans, but for every American. Until his untimely death, he was an advocate, activist, and dedicated champion who fought for the most vulnerable individuals and communities among us. We celebrate his life and his lasting legacy. I want to thank Ms. Jackson Lee for her leadership and thank her for yielding. I thank the Members for coming to the floor this evening. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman for his very thoughtful statement and for leading us off today and setting the tone for the Congressional Black Caucus that we will never forget our icons, but we also know that to pay tribute is the highest honor for all of us because we are here because of all of them. I thank Mr. Butterfield for his leadership. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege now to yield to Representative Charles Rangel, who does not need a long introduction. It is important to note that he has led on so many issues. He was not only the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, but also a dear friend of Congressman Lou Stokes and one of the founders of the Congressional Black Caucus. If Congressman Rangel had not done what he did, we would not be here today. I am delighted to yield to him at this time. Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Jackson Lee for pulling together this tribute. It is moving and emotional that we do this after the visit to these Chambers by the Pope, who made it abundantly clear how all of us, no matter how ordinary we are, [[Page H6295]] can do extraordinary things when we make a commitment to do the right thing. As some of the older Members know, it is almost unbelievable how people that you know on an everyday basis that go through life with their own problems still can find the time to try to improve the quality of life for so many people. I feel almost awkward looking at the Representative from Selma, Alabama, this evening because, after Bloody Sunday, there was a call all over the world for people to come to Selma. I was one of those called, and I was one of those that did not think that me going to Selma with my bad feet could make a contribution to anything, and this is especially so after seeing what happened on Bloody Sunday. But I did go down because of John Lewis and Andrew Young and Martin Luther King and Ralph Bunche, because they said that if I could just come down for the press conference, it would be appreciated. So I dressed up and I went down for the press conference. I had a round trip ticket back to New York. I was dressed pretty well, not ever thinking that I would be going any further than Selma. It started to rain, and I felt that this would be the appropriate time for me to get a cab and to go to the airport. When I saw these older people like Amelia Robinson putting plastic on their shoes and starting to sing and starting to march, I said, well, maybe I could go a couple of blocks. I did that, except I found out in Selma there weren't any couple of blocks. There were no television cameras. There was no one that recognized me down there. I marched 54 miles, cussing every step of the way, trying to figure out what the devil I was doing in Selma. Congresswoman Sewell, it just proves that if you attempt just to do the right thing, God can push you to do the rest. I never did believe, like John Lewis, that that Supreme Court would give us the voting rights and the civil rights. I never thought that President Johnson would ever support these things. Today I tell this very embarrassing story because you don't have to be a hero to be counted on if you just try to start to do the right thing, and just maybe God will push you to go further. Certainly when a woman like Amelia Boynton Robinson is beaten unconscious and someone like John Lewis, who constantly put his life on the line, and of course the late Dr. Martin Luther King, who gave up his life, and God doesn't ask us to do these extraordinary things, but I do believe that the courage that these people have, that each of us have just a grain of it that would allow us to contribute, as the Pope said, to show our respect for God, allowing us to inherit this great Earth to try to make the quality of life better. Of course, when it comes to a young guy going to Morehouse, as Julian Bond did, dropping out of school, coming from a professional family where education had a higher standard than some of us from the inner cities, it must have broken their heart to know that he was joining a group that would then provide the leadership for our country for people Black and White. There is nothing that my heart would allow me to say about Lou Stokes. I came to Congress not knowing that in the Congress was a giant of a man from Cleveland, Lou Stokes, who motivated the 13 of us, who led us to form the Congressional Black Caucus. I have walked in the shadows of his giant footsteps since I have been privileged to serve in this House. Ms. Jackson Lee and members of the Congressional Black Caucus, it is really extraordinary how God has given us the opportunity to say thank you for the blessings that we have, and I do hope that maybe on both sides of the aisle people can talk about those who allowed this country to be so great, the sacrifices that so many people have made, and you just don't have to be a giant to appreciate the fact that God has blessed us all. I thank her for her effort at bringing us together, not just tonight, but on every committee, on every bill, and this floor. Sheila Jackson Lee is here to continue to inspire all of us. I thank her for that. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, we are so grateful for the special wisdom and insight that Mr. Rangel brings to all of what we do. I know that the late Lou Stokes, the late Amelia Boynton Robinson, and the late Julian Bond are grateful that they knew him and that he is here to tell his story. Even if he considers it embarrassing, I think it is a wonderful testimony for anybody who has said, ``I can't do it.'' We want him to keep telling us that wonderful statement over and over again. I thank him so very much for what he provides to the Congressional Black Caucus. I thank him for the kind words he mentioned of Representative Terri Sewell. I just say to Ms. Sewell, I don't know what kind of phone message that she had to the Vatican, but I repeat now the words of Pope Francis, as I yield to her. This is Pope Francis, as he spoke just a few days ago at that very podium: Here, too, I think of the march which Martin Luther King led from Selma to Montgomery 50 years ago as part of the campaign to fulfill his dream of full civil rights and political rights for African Americans. Representative Sewell, let me thank you for bringing and infusing life into the wonderful city of Selma, all the wonderful people there, including your dearly beloved mother and father, and having us walk with you every step of the way. As I yield to her, let me say that we should make a commitment right here today, as we make changes in leadership, that we commit ourselves to the restoration of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which she is leading on. It is my delight to yield to her at this time. Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I thank our leader of the CBC, Congressman Butterfield, so much for his exemplary leadership and the courage that he exemplifies every day in fighting for the causes that we all hold so dear. I want to thank Congresswoman Jackson Lee for those wonderful words. Sheila Jackson Lee has not only been an amazing Member of Congress, but she has been a great mentor to me. I want to thank her for all she does for so many of us and the mentoring she continues to provide the younger generation. What can I say to Charlie Rangel? To even have him know my name is an honor. I know that, but for the remarkable lives of the three people that we celebrate their lives and their legacies today, I would not be in this auspicious Chamber, and but for his leadership and his courage, I would not know how to behave in this Chamber. I thank him for doing such a great job and continuing to serve the great people of Harlem and New York, but also the great people of America--black, white, green, yellow, all of us. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join with my CBC colleagues in paying tribute to the life and legacy of three great giants in American history: Representative Louis Stokes, Amelia Boynton Robinson, and Julian Bond. Our Nation collectively mourns the loss of each of these trailblazing figures who departed from us way too soon this summer. Their journeys paved the way for myself and so many others serving in this august body. While our hearts are heavy today, we honor them for their historic and notable contributions to this Nation. Congressman Louis Stokes was the first African American to represent the State of Ohio in Congress, where he served for more than 30 years. He rose to prominence by breaking numerous barriers as the first in so many areas. This included being named the first African American to serve as chairman of the prestigious House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. As an African American who now sits on that committee, I am deeply honored to follow in Louis Stokes' footsteps. During his tenure on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, he stepped into the national spotlight as a vocal critic of the Reagan administration's foreign policy. He spoke boldly on issues of national security and created a legacy of being a fierce advocate for the homeland. In honoring his memory, we must also commit ourselves collectively to continue the fight to promote diversity within the intelligence community. We must also be committed to supporting policies that promote our national security in the face of growing threats. It was Congressman Lou Stokes who taught us that our Nation deserves nothing less. [[Page H6296]] Today we also honor an American treasure and one of my personal heroes, the courageous Mrs. Amelia Boynton Robinson. Mrs. Robinson passed away on August 26, 2015, at the age of 110--yes, 110, Mr. Speaker. Mrs. Amelia Boynton Robinson was a key figure in the voting rights movement in Selma, Alabama. She is often remembered for her critical role in Bloody Sunday. On that solemn day on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, Robinson was savagely beaten. A photo taken of her shortly after she was attacked and posted in The New York Times became a powerful symbol of the injustices suffered by those who were attempting simply to vote. Yet this tireless, fearless foot soldier continued her work as a leader on the front lines of securing the right to vote for all Americans. Amelia is best known as the matriarch of the voting rights movement, and it was her courage, along with John Lewis and so many other known and unknown foot soldiers which led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Amelia was such an integral part of the process that the contents of the bill, the voting rights bill, were drafted on her kitchen table in Selma, Alabama, in 1965. Ms. Boynton not only trailblazed as a voting rights advocate, she put her money where her mouth was and she, herself, ran for Congress. On May 5, 1964, Amelia Boynton broke yet another barrier, when she became the first woman in the State of Alabama and the first African American woman in the State of Alabama to run for Congress. In 1964, she garnered 10.7 percent of the vote during a time when very few Blacks were registered to vote. Actually, only 1 percent of the registered voters were African Americans at that time. Her historic run further solidified her impact on the movement for human rights and voting rights in Alabama and in this Nation. Without her courageous campaign for the Seventh Congressional District of Alabama in 1964, I know that my election to this seat in 2010, some 50 years later, would not have been possible. {time} 1945 Her sacrifices paved the way for me to walk the Halls of Congress, and I will carry my love and admiration for her in my heart each and every day, for I get to do what she could not, and that is vote on behalf of the members of the Seventh Congressional District of Alabama. For that, I am eternally grateful. In fact, one of my most memorable moments in this Chamber is the night that she served as my special guest at the State of the Union on January 20, 2015, this past year. I am grateful for the memories of her greeting President Obama that night. I am so blessed to not only have called her my constituent, but a beloved mentor and friend. As she is remembered, and she reminds us every day by her life, there is still much work to be done. Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would also like to remember the shining legacy of yet another giant figure in the fight for civil and human rights: Mr. Julian Bond. This courageous voice held several titles over the course of his impactful life, but he is most remembered for his service as the NAACP chairman and the cofounder of the Southern Poverty Law Center. He was also one of the original leaders of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, SNCC, while he was a student at Morehouse College. He later served in the Georgia General Assembly for more than 20 years. He was first elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1965. However, because of his longstanding legacy of fighting White supremacy, White statehouse members tried unsuccessfully to block him from taking his seat. This brave spirit was undeterred. He spearheaded efforts to draft landmark legislation that spoke to the need of Blacks in the State of Georgia. In addition to his time as an eloquent speaker, he was a celebrated writer, poet, television commentator, community advocate, as well as a communication specialist. He did so much for the Southern Poverty Law Center to set it on its course and so much for the lives of so many. All three of these wonderful giants tell a story, a story of how ordinary people can do extraordinary things. Working collectively, we as a nation can achieve amazing heights, even if we don't think so. As Congressman Rangel's story best exemplified, if we just take one step, hopefully the Lord will give us the strength to take many, many more towards that fight for justice and equality. In closing, I am reminded of what Amelia Boynton would often say when I and others would come up to her and say: ``We stand on your shoulders. We stand on your shoulders.'' Well, Ms. Amelia Boynton was so infamously known for saying, after hearing it over and over again: ``Get off my shoulders. There is plenty of work to be done.'' ``Do your own work,'' is what she said. And so I say to my colleagues gathered here tonight, my colleagues in this wonderful body called the House of Representatives: We have plenty of work to do. We have plenty of work to do. And while we walk in the footsteps of giants such as Amelia Boynton and Louis Stokes and Julian Bond, let us never forget that they, too, had to take a first step. And as we follow in their footsteps, let us all take many steps towards providing justice and liberty for all Americans, especially those that are most vulnerable. Ms. JACKSON LEE. I think we can leave this evening with the words that Congresswoman Sewell has just said, and we thank her so very much, ``do our own work.'' That message should carry for whether we are Republicans or Democrats or Independents. Congresswoman Sewell, we look forward to doing our own work on the restoration of the Voting Rights Act, section 5, which you are leading and all of us have signed onto. We thank you so much for that eloquent statement and that statement of passion. Speaking of passion, it is my privilege to introduce a Member who has her own storied civil rights history, someone who has served as the Commissioner on the EEOC, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and someone who has been in the trenches in civil rights, dealing with voting rights cases, dealing with the right to vote in her own District of Columbia. I think she will be the Florence Nightingale, she will be the champion battler; because I believe that this Delegate, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, will be successful as we fight for the voting rights of the District through her leadership. I yield to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton). Ms. NORTON. I thank my good friend, Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, first, for her kind and generous words, but especially today for her leadership of this Special Order, which is characteristic of her leadership in this Congress. I am so pleased that our chair Rep. G.K. Butterfield has been here and spoken and that we have heard from several other Members. I just want to say a few words about this troika of African Americans who have written their signatures across our time. You have heard their biographies. I don't want to recount their extraordinary bios, because that is not the only reason we are honoring them with this Special Order. I just want to say something about what they meant to me. Two of them I knew personally: Representative Louis Stokes, whose many years in the Congress happened to overlap with my first years here; and, of course, Julian Bond, whom I knew best. I was not fortunate to know Amelia Boynton. She may have been the most courageous woman in the movement of the 1960s, who insisted upon facing death, if necessary, in that march from Selma to Montgomery, and nearly lost her life. I was privileged to be in her presence, as so many Members of Congress were, when we went to Selma this past summer. That was a privilege in and of itself. I was fortunate to know Congressman Louis Stokes, who was a founder of the Congressional Black Caucus long before I served. This was a man of great accomplishment. Yes, he can speak about his firsts, and much more. He is the first African American to serve in Congress from his hometown of Cleveland, as one of the two famous Stokes brothers--his brother, Carl, the first African American mayor. There is something about the way those men were raised and showed themselves in public life. But it is Rep. Stokes' career in Congress that stands out for me. [[Page H6297]] I am not certain there has ever been a more distinguished Member of this body. It looks as if when they were trying to ask somebody to do something hard, they looked to Louis Stokes. He was the first African American to serve on the Appropriations Committee. My heavens. And then look at the committees he has chaired-- hard ones--the Ethics Committee, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Then they needed someone to do something else that was difficult, and that was to serve on the Iran Contra Committee, and House Select Committee on Assassinations, nothing was more difficult than that. If you were looking for a Member whom the public would trust and who this body would trust, who do you go to? They went to Louis Stokes. So if you are trying to find out how to serve, recall the life of Representative Louis Stokes. In the District, we recall his life and his work. Much of his work was done in the field of health. The Howard University Louis Stokes Health Science Library is named for him here in the District of Columbia at Howard University. So we will never forget him. Of the three, the one I knew best, of course, was my colleague and friend in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, later a client of sorts, and then finally--for 25 years, a constituent. I met Julian several years after he founded, along with a handful of other students, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. You have got to understand that that group was as different from any student group since. They were not an offshoot of the civil rights movement. They were a group that stood on its own. I would go down in the summers. I was in law school. SNCC was the equivalent of major civil rights organizations, every single one, right alongside them. That is why John Lewis got to speak on the March on Washington. The reason that SNCC stood out is the quality of its leadership in those early years. Julian became the spokesman. The reason he was the spokesman was his way with words. He was a poet and a writer, and he could explain what we were doing. He served a most valuable role in these early years. So no one should be surprised that he went after the zenith of the civil rights movement to serve in the Georgia House of Representatives. What you may be surprised to learn is that when he moved on to the senate, the Georgia Senate, they refused to seat him because he had endorsed a SNCC statement opposing the Vietnam war. Imagine denying a seat to a member duly elected because of a statement he had made on an issue of great moment. This case was taken all the way to the Supreme Court. At that point, I was a constitutional lawyer working for the American Civil Liberties Union in New York. I got to write the amicus brief. We took very few amicus briefs to the Supreme Court, but this one seemed to have the makings of a landmark case. Indeed, it did become a landmark case. You do not see anybody denying anyone else the right to sit in his seat--or her seat, today--because of that person's views. The Julian Bond case settled the matter. What was Julian Bond to do with the rest of his life? First of all, SNCC broke a fair number of people. And though they gave much to the movement, you may not have heard about many of them since. What Julian did was to give the rest of his life to the movement. For every single day of his life as a man, after he left public service in the Georgia Legislature, he was devoted to the civil rights movement he had entered as a very young man. He moved to the District of Columbia with his wife, taught at American University and the University of Virginia, and became--and this is a matter that makes me chuckle--became the chairman of the NAACP. At SNCC we thought the NAACP was way too conservative for us, the young and foolish. It tells you how Julian grew. He grew to be the long-time and devoted chairman of the NAACP. He carried out his devotion to civil rights magnificently. Throughout his entire life, he remained a major spokesman for the civil rights movement and for progressive causes, his entire life speaking all around the country, carrying the message. When he moved here, I had a Black Caucus event with Julian and with John Lewis simply discussing their lives as young men in the civil rights movement. That was to be one of the most memorable moments since I have been in Congress. Just last February, during Black History Month, I asked Julian to come to Howard University, where he and I engaged in an intergenerational conversation with Howard students about the police shootings in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City and what they meant to this generation and how this generation had to have its own issues and move in its own direction. One of the things we indicated was that for all of the work of the youth of the civil rights movement of our day, we never touched racial profiling. It remained alive and kicking for a new generation, which has taken it on. I am, finally, particularly grateful that when Julian moved to the District of Columbia, he really became a part of this city, lending his civil rights celebrity to the great cause of this city for full citizenship, for D.C. voting rights, yes, and for statehood for the District of Columbia. If you came into the District by taxis a few years ago, there was an advertisement. Julian was speaking in a cab, informing you that you were coming to the District of Columbia, where the residents were trying to get their full citizenship. Wherever he was, he had a way of touching upon the issue of freedom of the day and of the people around him. I will always miss him. This country will always miss him. We are grateful for the life he led. We are grateful, especially, for this Congressional Black Caucus evening devoted to his life and to the lives of two others, very divergent lives but, in other ways, very similar. I thank my good friend, Representative Jackson Lee, again, for her leadership here. {time} 2000 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me thank my good friend, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, for giving these three legends the vitality and vibrance of a personal story. And to just add to his coming to students at Howard University, I want you to know that, at the University of Virginia, where he was, he was the most popular professor with people standing in line because the students sensed his passion and commitment, but they sensed his realness. Thank you so very much for that very vibrant and informative presentation. Mr. Speaker, as I introduce this next gentleman, who has his own history, let me quote, again, as I indicated, Pope Francis from last week, which captures all of what we are saying tonight: to respond in a way which is always humane, just and fraternal. We need to avoid a common temptation nowadays to disregard whatever proves troublesome. Let us remember the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. The gentleman that I am going to yield to, Mr. Bobby Scott, is a former chairman of the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, now the ranking member on the Committee on Education and the Workforce, and has led his professional, at least his Congressional life, as I have known it, to be a champion for criminal justice reform, but, more importantly, has been one who has said to us over and over again that: We must do unto others as we would like them to do unto us. We must change this criminal justice system to have it be a fair monitoring of how we inspire and restore people's lives. I yield now to the gentleman from Virginia, Congressman Bobby Scott. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in honor of the lives of three civil rights luminaries. I thank the gentlewoman from Houston for giving us this opportunity to honor their lives: Congressman Louis Stokes, statesman and educator Julian Bond, both of whom I knew personally, and activist Amelia Robinson. These champions of social and economic justice lived their lives just as Pope Francis challenged Members of Congress to do. Specifically, the Pope reminded us of the Golden Rule--do unto others as you would have them do unto you--and that that rule points us in the right direction. He specifically reminded Congress that, if we want opportunities, [[Page H6298]] then let us provide opportunities. The lives we honor today are the personification of the Pope's call. Congressman Stokes, the beloved son of the State of Ohio, was affectionately called ``Lou'' when I served with him in the House. His motto was to aim high, which he did even before he was a Member of Congress when he argued the Supreme Court case challenging the abusive stop-and-frisk policies and practices in the Terry v. Ohio case. Lou's integrity was why he was selected to serve on the House Select Committee on Assassinations of President Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the House investigation of the illegal arm sales during the Iran-contra affair and, of course, his service on the Ethics Committee. His strive for social and economic justice was on full display when he became the first African American to serve on the House Appropriations Committee. There he directed Federal dollars to eradicate injustice and inequities by funding programs such as healthcare facilities for veterans, supporting the National Science Foundation, and creating the first office of minority health at the National Institutes of Health. Statesman and educator Julian Bond dedicated his entire life to this cause of social justice and equity. As a founding member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, or SNCC, he led protests against segregation. In 1965, Julian Bond was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives, but was denied a seat at the State House because of his opposition to the Vietnam war. In 1966, the Supreme Court ruled 9-0 that the Georgia House's refusal to seat Julian Bond violated the United States Constitution. He was subsequently elected for several terms, including service in the Georgia Senate, despite efforts to redraw his district. He was also the first African American nominated at a major-party convention as a candidate for Vice President of the United States. Beginning in the 1980s, Julian Bond taught at several universities, including Harvard, Drexel, University of Virginia, and American University. For more than 20 years at UVA and American University, he taught thousands of students about the role of the civil rights movement as a seminal part of America's history. He stated that the ``humanity of all Americans is diminished when any group is denied rights granted to others.'' He served as chairman of the NAACP from 1998 to 2009. At the 2009 commencement at Virginia State University, he told the graduates that, ``We all hope that you do well, but I also hope that you do good.'' Activist Amelia Robinson was among the many foot soldiers who fought for civil rights. As a girl, she championed the right to vote for women. As an adult, she opened her home to Martin Luther King and James Bevel and members of SNCC and others to help organize and strategize for civil rights and the right to vote. Despite the brutal beating she endured during the march for voting rights in Selma, Alabama, 50 years ago, she was unwavering in her fight to end segregation and achieve full voting rights for all. Reflecting on her life as an activist, she stated that, ``I have been called rabble-rouser, agitator. But because of my fighting, I was able to hand to the entire country the right for people to vote.'' These three American giants--the legislator, the educator, the activist--were all driven to push towards a more just and equal society. I am honored to recognize their lives and the gifts they gave to our Nation. Again, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Houston for organizing this Special Order so that we could pay appropriate tribute to these fine Americans. Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman from Virginia for citing, in particular, the case law that Julian Bond particularly generated from the horrific denial of his right to be seated. Let me also indicate the importance of members of the Congressional Black Caucus sharing the history of these icons, which I hope my colleagues will appreciate these giants, for many times the history is not remembered or it is not understood. Certainly, it is my privilege to now yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio, who has firsthand knowledge because she can say that she comes from the State of which Lou Stokes and Carl Stokes were native sons. She is, of course, an inspirational leader for her district in Columbus, but, more importantly, someone who brings a wealth of experience from her previous service in the Ohio State Legislature and someone who has a passion for the improvement of lives of all people. I believe, as Lou Stokes has said, she understands the value and importance of improving the health of African Americans and all Americans. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield to the gentlewoman from Columbus, Ohio (Mrs. Beatty). Mrs. BEATTY. Thank you so much, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. Mr. Speaker, tonight the Congressional Black Caucus honors the life and legacy of three civil rights leaders, Congressman Lou Stokes, Amelia Boynton Robinson, and Julian Bond, who dedicated their lives to making our Nation a better place. Countless more follow in their footsteps and continue to push for civil rights and voting rights today. We have come to these chambers tonight, Mr. Speaker, to continue their work as members of the Congressional Black Caucus. We call on Congress to immediately pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2015. The American people deserve to have real voting rights. Thank you, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, not only for your leadership tonight, but for being a leader, for walking in their shoes, and for hosting the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order honoring three giants. This year is the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act. Leaders espoused words in 1965 that still hold true today, words because of the work of these three giants, works like: We have proved that great progress is possible. We know how much still remains to be done. And if our efforts continue, if our will is strong, if our hearts are right, and if courage remains our constant companion, then my fellow Americans, I am confident we shall overcome. Our objective must be to assure that all Americans play by the same rules, and all Americans play against the same odds. Who amongst us would claim that that is true today? Just last week His Holiness, Pope Francis, delivered a historic, profound, provocative address to the Joint Session of Congress. This address reminded us that the nation is ``considered great'' when ``it fosters a culture which enables people to dream of full rights for all their brothers and sisters.'' At the White House, he quoted from Martin Luther King, to use a telling phrase of the Reverend Martin Luther King: ``We can say that we have defaulted on a promissory note, and now is the time to honor it.'' These three individuals we honor tonight tirelessly contributed to this culture of full rights and equality we are committed to achieving. Tonight's roll call: Congressman Lou Stokes. I am honored to be the third African American from Ohio to follow in his footsteps, following my mentor and dear friend, Stephanie Tubbs Jones, my colleague, mentor and friend, Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, who said at his footsteps: I don't salute or get excited about a one hit wonder because Lou Stokes was far from that. Lou Stokes loved people. He loved the law. He loved the legislative process. He loved his family. And he loved Cleveland, Ohio. You have heard so much about him, I won't repeat it. I will submit it for the Record, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, if that is okay. But I will forever be grateful for his encouragement, his friendship, his wisdom, and his leadership. I can't think of a time or a decision in my life that I didn't pick up the phone and call Lou Stokes. Love you, Lou Stokes. Let me just briefly say we also salute Amelia Boynton Robinson, and much has been said about her. I stand on her shoulders. And then Julian Bond, another great civil rights icon, whose passion and dedication to equality and justice propelled him to the Georgia Legislature, the NAACP, and the Southern Poverty Law Center, which he co-founded. [[Page H6299]] His commitment to ending discrimination and injustice continues to inspire us, and his legacy will guide us and the next generation of civil rights leaders and activists to greatness. He, like the other individuals we pay tribute to tonight, helped change this country for the better. Thank you, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. Thank you to all my colleagues with the Congressional Black Caucus for capturing and reflecting on the lives of three great civil warriors as we took a walk in their footsteps of greatness. Tonight the Congressional Black Caucus honors the life and legacy of three Civil Rights leaders--Congressman Louis Stokes, Amelia Boynton Robinson and Julian Bond who dedicated their lives to making our nation a better place. Countless more follow in their footsteps and continue to push for civil rights and voting rights today. We have come to these chambers to continue their work as Members of the Congressional Black Caucus; we call on Congress to immediately pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2015. The American people deserve to have real voting rights now. Thank you Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee for hosting the CBC's Special Order Hour paying tribute to Congressman Louis Stokes, Amelia Boynton Robinson, and Julian Bond. This year is the 50th Anniversary of Voting Rights Act. Leaders . . . espoused words in 1965 that still hold true today. Words like: We have proved that great progress is possible. We know how much still remains to be done. And if our efforts continue, and if our will is strong, and if our hearts are right, and if courage remains our constant companion, then my fellow Americans, I am confident, we shall overcome. Our objective must be to assure that all Americans play by the same rules, and all Americans play against the same odds. Who among us would claim that that is true today? Just last week, His Holiness Pope Francis delivered a historic, profound, and provocative address to a Joint Session of Congress. This address reminded us that a nation is ``considered great'' when ``it fosters a culture which enables people to dream of full rights for all their brothers and sisters.'' At the White House, he quoted words from MLK . . . to use a telling phrase of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. . . . we can say that we have defaulted on a promissory note and now is the time to honor it. The three individuals we honor tonight tirelessly contributed to this culture of full rights and equality we are committed to achieving. Congressman Stokes I am honored to be the third African-American from Ohio to follow Congressman Louis Stokes who served for 30 years in Congress. I am forever grateful for his encouragement, friendship, wisdom, and leadership. He earned a seat on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, the first person of color to ever do so, and focused on improving housing and urban development for veterans, seniors, and the poor. In 1971, along with our esteemed Dean of the House, Congressman John Conyers, Congressman Stokes helped found the Congressional Black Caucus to promote economic, educational, and social issues important to African Americans: this is a purpose the CBC continues to fulfill to this day, and a purpose I am honored to advance. His indelible mark in history will continue to live on. Amelia Boynton Robinson It is also an honor to pay tribute to Amelia Boynton Robinson--the matriarch of the voting rights movement. As an African-American female serving in the U.S. Congress, I stand on the shoulders of Mrs. Boynton Robinson. Mrs. Boynton Robinson helped organize the Selma-to-Montgomery marches, and walked at the front of the line that fateful day on March 7, 1965, which we now know as ``Bloody Sunday''. On August 6, 1965, she was the guest of honor at the White House when President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 into law. I had the privilege to join Mrs. Boynton Robinson this past March, as thousands of Americans marched once again over the Edmund Pettus Bridge, remembering the struggles and recommitting ourselves to restoring voting rights protections, equality, and justice. Julian Bond Julian Bond was a civil rights icon whose passion and dedication to equality and justice propelled him to the Georgia legislature, the NAACP, and the Southern Poverty Law Center, which he co-founded. His commitment to ending discrimination and injustice continues to inspire us and his legacy will guide the next generation of civil rights leaders and activists to greatness. He, like the other individuals we pay tribute to tonight, helped changed this country for the better. Thank you CBC for capturing and reflecting on the lives of three great civil rights warriors as we took a walk in their footsteps of greatness. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Congresswoman Beatty, thank you for letting us know whose footsteps we walk in and for that celebratory statement. Mr. Speaker, it is certainly my pleasure to yield to the gentlewoman from the U.S. Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett), who has come with the expertise of a renowned and trained lawyer, one who is a collaborator. Ms. PLASKETT. Thank you so much to my colleague, Sheila Jackson Lee. I want to thank you and the Congressional Black Caucus for this Special Order Hour, a special tribute to the lives and legacy of Representative Louis Stokes, Amelia Boynton Robinson, and Julian Bond. Thank you, Ms. Jackson Lee, for your work here in Congress, your tireless efforts to raise awareness to issues which many Americans may have forgotten or not given thought to. Thank you for your mentorship to us younger members here and your tireless efforts to support not only the people of Houston, but the people of America. Thank you for allowing us this most important opportunity to pay tribute to these remarkable individuals. Mr. Speaker, today we gather in reverence and in solemn reflection to honor the lives and legacies of some exceptional people, some exceptional Americans, who we have lost in these recent months. These were civil rights activists, statesmen and women, trailblazers, members of a great generation of individuals who gave so much of themselves to the Civil Rights Movement and to the advancement of minorities in our country. They are former Congressman Louis Stokes, former chairman of the NAACP and Georgia State Senator Julian Bond, and civil rights icon Mrs. Amelia Boynton Robinson. A centenarian--Mrs. Robinson's 110 years of life, that in itself is a great honor--she was dedicated to education, fighting state-sanctioned discriminatory practices against African Americans, and voter disenfranchisement. {time} 2015 One can make the argument that her role in Selma's civil rights demonstrations, including the infamous march on Bloody Sunday where she was beaten unconscious by State police, paved the way, through the subsequent passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, for both Congressman Stokes and State Representative Bond to serve in elected office. As the first African American elected to Congress from the State of Ohio, Congressman Stokes was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus and spent his 30-year career in Congress advocating issues of importance to Ohioans and to African Americans across the country. Julian Bond, that great statesman from Georgia, was one of 11 African Americans elected to the Georgia House of Representatives after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Bond served 20 years in both legislative chambers in the State of Georgia and served as the first president of the Southern Poverty Law Center. He also served as chairman of the NAACP. These individuals have impacted the lives of so many African Americans and have undoubtedly advanced the rights and interests of minorities in both our States' and our Nation's governments. Similarly, I would like to just take a moment to recognize two individuals from my own home district of the Virgin Islands who, like Congressman Stokes, Julian Bond, and Amelia Robinson, have changed the landscape of the Virgin Islands through their advocacy and education. I would like to recognize a former judge and Lieutenant Governor of the Virgin Islands, the late Julio A. Brady, who, like Julian Bond and Congressman Stokes, used his training as an attorney to contribute to his community outside of the courtroom. As a U.S. attorney, judge, and attorney general, Judge Brady fought to remove barriers of injustice. He was laid to rest this week. Like Congressman Stokes and [[Page H6300]] Amelia Robinson, Judge Brady's legacy of service will carry on. Ursula Krigger was also a centenarian, like Amelia Robinson, and, at age 113 was the oldest living Virgin Islander until her passing this month. She was a griot, an educator whose longevity afforded a unique perspective of witnessing the modern advancement of our territory. The lives and legacies of these individuals are etched in the annals of our history and their impact forever ingrained in the minds and hearts of the many lives they touched. I am a better person; and, indeed, we are a better nation through the work of these individuals. I have listened to my colleagues tonight speak about Representative Louis Stokes, Amelia Boynton Robinson, and Julian Bond and the personal impact these individuals had on the work of my colleagues with whom they served and have known personally. Understand, that while many like myself may not have had the great honor and pleasure of toiling and working with them shoulder to shoulder in the struggle for civil rights and the advancement of minorities in our country, Americans like myself understand and appreciate their sacrifice, and we understand the work that must still be done. We will continue their legacy here today and in Congress in the future. Thank you so much, Congressional Black Caucus, for this time. And thank you again to my colleague from Texas, Sheila Jackson Lee, for the time that I have been afforded to speak on behalf of these great Americans. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Congresswoman Plaskett, thank you so very much for laying the groundwork for those who now step into those footsteps, and you have done so with such leadership and certainly such passion. Thank you so very much. Mr. Speaker, what is my time remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Russell). The gentlewoman from Texas has 2 minutes remaining. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me conclude by thanking the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus and my colleagues. It is so important for the Congressional Black Caucus to be able to talk to America-- Representative Butterfield, Representative Rangel, Representative Sewell, Delegate Holmes Norton, Representative Bobby Scott, Representative Joyce Beatty, and, of course, Congresswoman Plaskett--to be able to give life to why we are here representing all of America. We have those special people that, without our voices, would not be able to be heard. I simply want to add these words of the Pope, again, to be able to remind everyone why these icons that we are speaking of tonight in the Congressional Black Caucus--46 of us, along with Senator Booker--have a vital role in this place. As the Pope indicated, I would encourage you to keep in mind all those people around us who are trapped in the cycle of poverty. They, too, need to be given hope. The fight against poverty and hunger must be fought constantly on many fronts, especially in its causes. I know that Americans today, as in the past, are working to deal with this problem. That is the essence of Julian Bond, who never stopped giving; that is the essence of Amelia Boynton Robinson, who continued to fight for civil rights up until her death at the age of 104 on August 6, 2015; that is the essence of Congressman Lou Stokes, a legislative giant, the chairman of an appropriations subcommittee, a person who went to public housing and places where children were and told America that your children are dying because they are living in substandard housing, lead poisoning was killing them, which gave me the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, as I said before, to give a grant to my public housing just this past week on helping with lead poisoning. I worked for Lou Stokes, and I am very glad to note that, working for him, I can say, truly a gentleman, truly a leader. To this Congress, I beg of you, let us look at these icons and celebrate not only their lives, but commit to the passion and justice of their lives, and, as well, the words of Pope Francis that tell us to do unto others as we would like them to do unto us. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to again thank the members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to speak in praise of Louis Stokes, one of the greatest and most respected Members ever to serve in this body, who died on Tuesday, August 18, 2015, at his home near Cleveland, Ohio at the age of 90. It is not unusual in these days for commentators and politicians to talk of something called ``American Exceptionalism.'' But what is meant by the term? Mr. Speaker, one way to understand the term: America is exceptional because it produces and finds persons like Louis Stokes and affords them the opportunity to utilize their talents to the fullest in the service of their community and their country. Think about it: in what other nation does a little African American boy born in 1925 on the east side of Cleveland and raised in the Outhwaite Homes housing project by a mother who worked as a domestic go on to become a lawyer who argues and wins a landmark criminal justice reform case (Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968)) in the United States Supreme Court; become the first African American elected to Congress; is selected to chair the powerful Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, the Select Committee on Assassinations, and an Appropriations Subcommittee responsible for more than $90 billion annually in federal outlays? Yes, America is an exceptional nation and Louis Stokes was an exceptional human being. Mr. Speaker, Louis Stokes was born on February 23, 1925, in Cleveland, Ohio, to Charles and Louise Cinthy (nee Stone) Stokes. When he was three years old, his father, who worked in a laundromat, died leaving young Louis and his younger brother, Carl, to be raised by their mother, who worked as a domestic for affluent families in the wealthy Cleveland suburbs. Louis Stokes' maternal grandmother played a critical role in his life because she took care of the Stokes boys while their mother was at work and instilled in them ``the idea that work with your hands is the hard way of doing things'' and encouraged them over and over ``to learn to use their heads.'' Louis Stokes took the advice to heart so after attending Cleveland's Central High School and serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, he returned home to attend what is now Case Western Reserve University on the G.I. Bill at night while working during the day for the Veterans Administration and the Department of the Treasury. After graduating from college in two years where he excelled as a student, Louis Stokes was accepted for admission to Cleveland Marshall School of Law, from which he graduated in 1953; three years later, his brother Carl would also graduate from Cleveland Marshall School of Law and the two of them would go on to form the law firm of Stokes & Stokes specializing in the areas of civil rights and criminal law. In 1964, the Supreme Court decided the landmark case of Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964), which established the principle of ``one person, one vote'' governing the reapportionment of legislative boundaries. The following year, working on behalf of the local branch of the NAACP, Louis Stokes led the legal challenge to the Ohio legislature's congressional redistricting, which had the effect of diluting African American voting strength in Cleveland. The challenge was unsuccessful in the federal district court but undeterred, Louis Stokes, joined by Charles Lucas, an African American Republican, successfully appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which in an order handed down in 1967 ruled the redistricting plan unconstitutional and ordered it redrawn, resulting in the creation of Ohio's first majority-black district, the 21st Congressional District of Ohio. Ironically, Louis Stokes would defeat his one-time ally Charles Lucas to win that seat in November 1968, capturing 75% of the vote, the closest of his 15 successful elections to the U.S. House of Representatives. For the next 30 years, from 1969 to 1999, Congressman Stokes tirelessly fought for his constituents in Cleveland and for the best interests of the people of Ohio and the United States. Louis Stokes, a founding member and Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus from 1972-74, was the epitome of a public servant. In his second term in Congress, he won appointment to the powerful House Appropriations Committee, where he served for 28 years, later becoming the second African American ``Cardinal'' in history when he was selected to chair the VA, HUD, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. Because of the esteem in which he was held by his colleagues and the leadership, Louis Stokes would also later be selected to Chair the House Permanent Select Committee [[Page H6301]] on Intelligence and the Select Committee charged with investigating the assassinations of President Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. As Chairman of the House Ethics Committee and a person of unquestioned integrity, Louis Stokes oversaw the committee's investigation of the corruption scandal known as ABSCAM in 1979-80, which eventually led to convictions of a senator and six House members. Mr. Speaker, Louis Stokes perhaps is best known for the national attention he attracted in 1987 as a member of the House Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms Transactions with Iran/(``Iran- Contra''), the scandal involving the illegal sale of military weapons to the Ayatollah Khomeini's Iran to generate money to fund the illegal contra war in Nicaragua. In response to the claim by Colonel Oliver North that he acted out of patriotism in engineering the illegal weapons sales and diverting the proceeds to fund the contras, a stern Louis Stokes lectured the misguided Colonel North on the rule of law, the true meaning of patriotism, and, in the process American exceptionalism: ``I suppose that what has been most disturbing to me about your testimony is the ugly part. In fact, it has been more than ugly. It has been chilling, and, in fact, frightening. I'm not just talking about your part in this, but the entire scenario, about government officials who plotted and conspired, who set up a straw man, a fall guy. Officials who lied, misrepresented and deceived. Officials who planned to superimpose upon our government a layer outside of our government, shrouded in secrecy and only accountable to the conspirators. ``Colonel, as I sit here this morning looking at you in your uniform, I cannot help but remember that I wore the uniform of this country in World War II in a segregated Army. I wore it as proudly as you do, even though our government required black and white soldiers in the same Army to live, sleep, eat and travel separate and apart, while fighting and dying for our country. But because of the rule of law, today's servicemen in America suffer no such indignity. ``My mother, a widow, raised two boys. She had an eighth-grade education. She was a domestic worker who scrubbed floors. One son became the first black mayor of a major American city. The other sits today as chairman of a House intelligence committee. Only in America, Col. North. Only in America. And while I admire your love for America, I hope that you will never forget that others too love America just as much as you do and that others will die for America, just as quick as you will.'' Louis Stokes never wavered in his belief that America could fulfill the promise of its Founders or his dedication to the principles of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, stating: ``I'm going to keep on denouncing the inequities of this system, but I'm going to work within it. To go outside the system would be to deny myself--to deny my own existence. I've beaten the system. I've proved it can be done--so have a lot of others. ``But the problem is that a black man has to be extra special to win in this system. Why should you have to be a super black to get someplace? That's what's wrong in the society. The ordinary black man doesn't have the same chance as the ordinary white man does.'' Mr. Speaker, Louis Stokes' commitment to fairness and equal treatment started long before he was elected to Congress. As a lawyer for the NAACP, he brought anti-discrimination lawsuits, represented demonstrators arrested in antidiscrimination marches and sit-ins, and took the cases of poor persons charged with crimes. One of those criminal cases he took is known to every lawyer in America and appreciated by every person who cherishes the protections guaranteed by the 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. I am speaking of the famous case of Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968) won by Louis Stokes in which the Supreme Court held that a police officer could ``stop and frisk'' an individual only where he could articulate a reasonable basis that the person was, or was about to be, engaged in criminal activity. As a result of Terry v. Ohio, a police officer has the right to stop, frisk, and question an individual he reasonably suspects to be engaged in criminal activity, but cannot seize items from that person if the pat down of the suspect's outer clothing does not reveal any weapons posing a threat to the officer's safety. Because of Louis Stokes' exceptional advocacy in Terry v. Ohio, the right of every individual to secure from unreasonable searches and seizures was preserved while at the same not impeding the ability of law enforcement officers to perform their duties safely. Mr. Speaker, every citizen benefits from this ruling and communities that have a history of being harassed by law enforcement protected by the Constitution from arbitrary and abusive treatment by law enforcement. But the fight for a criminal justice system that respects the rights of all persons is not over. That is why I am proud to be the Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations and a leader in the effort to reform the criminal justice system so that all persons receive fair and equal treatment regardless of their race, gender, religion, or national origin. Louis Stokes fought tirelessly to fulfill the promise of the 14th Amendment that ``no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.'' It is a fight I am proud to continue today. Mr. Speaker, Louis Stokes will be mourned by friends and colleagues on both sides of the aisle who had the privilege to serve alongside him. He was a mentor to me and I will always remember his commanding presence and cherish the assistance he provided me and the example he set for new Members to follow. My thoughts and prayers are with his Jay, Louis' beloved wife of 55 years; to his children, Shelly, Louis, Angela, and Lorene; his grandchildren; and the untold thousands of persons who touched and whose lives were touched by one of Cleveland's greatest sons. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to observe a moment of silence in memory of Louis Stokes, an exceptional American, and the gentleman from Ohio who served in this chamber for three decades with honor, integrity, and distinction. [From cleveland.com] Lou Stokes Put Health Impacts of Substandard Housing on the National Agenda, and in Cleveland: Terry Allan, Dorr Dearborn and Dave Jacobs (Opinion) In this file photo from 2012, Timothy Benner, then 8, looks outside from his Maurice Avenuue home in Cleveland. After Timothy and some of his siblings tested positive for lead poisoning, traced to the soil around their home, their mother restricted their outdoor play time. U.S. Rep. Lou Stokes, who died earlier this month, championed national attention and funding to address the problem of lead poisoning in inner- city children. Recent stories and opinion pieces have eulogized the many accomplishments of the late U.S. Rep. Louis Stokes, from civil-rights champion to accomplished litigator, statesman and lawmaker. We believe that Louis Stokes should also be recognized as a national leader who clearly understood the connection between substandard housing and health, and acted to address the problem, at a time when very few did. Back in the 1980s, the scope and magnitude of the childhood lead-poisoning problem and its impact on our nation's children was not fully recognized or well understood. Subsequent efforts to increase blood screening in early childhood revealed that Greater Cleveland had among the highest rates of lead poisoning in the country, adding to the compounding disadvantages of children living in poverty in our community and across the United States. Some of us have vivid memories from 1991, when Congressman Stokes held up a Newsweek magazine cover story on threats posed to children by lead paint, passionately advocating for the voiceless in our society while educating the community about this silent epidemic. He wanted all of us to understand the debilitating consequences of childhood lead exposure in the home environment and its impact on the life trajectory of these vulnerable kids. Congressman Stokes turned that message into action, by using his formidiable legislative acumen to establish the first Healthy Homes program in the country within the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. When he recognized in 1998 that young infants in his district were suffering from sometimes fatal lung bleeding associated with water-damaged, moldy homes, he asked HUD to address the impact of inner-city homes on children's health. He understood that houses are systems, and that independently addressing lead paint problems, moisture intrusion and mold, injury risks and other housing hazards was inefficient and costly. He also had the vision to recognize that treating children at the hospital, only to release them back into the same substandard home that made them sick, created a vicious circle with major public health consequences. He knew these homes needed to be fixed. The HUD Office of Lead Hazard Control had shown interest in applying the experience of lead-poisoning prevention to include other health hazards in the home, such as plumbing problems and leaky basements, but lacked the authority. Through his vision, the Congressman invited us and others to testify at the House Subcommittee on HUD appropriations to see what could be done. Lou Stokes convinced his fellow committee members to provide the very first appropriation of $10 million to HUD for `Healthy Homes' prevention programs in low-income housing. His legacy has resulted in millions of homes that are safer and healthier as a direct result of that investment in our children. Since that time, [[Page H6302]] the HUD Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes has provided more than $175 million in competitively awarded grants to communities across the nation to investigate and address health hazards in homes. The asthma home-visit program in Cleveland that decreases the hospitalization rate of children with asthma, highlighted in The Plain Dealer in June, is a direct outgrowth of Congressman Stokes' work. In 2012, HUD created the Louis Stokes Healthy Homes Award and presented the first one to him at the City Club of Cleveland. When he received the award, he pointed out that much has been achieved and that much more remains to be done. He also said that he really didn't know what all the fuss was about, as he was just a kid who grew up in public housing, who wanted to do the right thing for our children. He was an inspiration to us all. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to speak in praise of Julian Bond, one of the leading lights of the Civil Rights Movement, who died on Saturday, August 15, 2015, at the age of 75. While Julian lost his battle to the illness that claimed his life, it is the struggle for civil rights and human dignity he helped to win that he will forever remembered and revered. Horace Julian Bond was born January 14, 1940 in Nashville, Tennessee to Julia Agnes and Horace Mann Bond. Julian's father was the first African-American President of Lincoln University of Pennsylvania, the same institution attended by Thurgood Marshall and Langston Hughes who would both go on to make substantial contributions to the Civil Rights Movement and the advancement of African-Americans. Julian's father later became president of Atlanta University and Julian decided to attend Morehouse College, one of the leading black colleges in the nation. Julian Bond, who came from a long line of educators, determined at an early age to put his journalistic and organizing talents in service of the cause of civil rights and racial equality. While a student at Morehouse College, Julian helped found The Pegasus, a literary magazine, and led nonviolent student protests against segregation in Atlanta parks, restaurants, and movie theaters. Mr. Speaker, today it is difficult to imagine there once was a time in our country when blacks and whites could not eat together in public restaurants, use the same public restrooms, stay at the same hotels, or attend the same schools. Julian Bond answered the call to action and put his studies on hold to devote all of his energies and efforts to ending segregation and racial discrimination. Mr. Speaker, it is not unusual these days for us to think of a champion as someone who receives the highest accolades in sports. Julian Bond was a champion of the people. His success is measured not in the numbers of trophies, medals, ribbons, and championship banners, but in the number of doors and opportunities he helped to open for those who had been neglected, marginalized, and disenfranchised. Julian Bond knew that to bring about non-violent social change it was necessary to organize so he co-founded the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). SNCC, which organized and mobilized the participation of students and young people in the Civil Rights Movement, conceived the Freedom Rides that challenged the practice of racial segregation in interstate transportation and the Mississippi Freedom Summer project that undertook the dangerous work of helping African Americans register to vote in the state most committed to maintaining White supremacy by any means necessary. SNCC was not the first leadership role history and circumstance would call upon Julian Bond to assume; nor would it be the last. In 1965, after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Julian Bond was elected to represent the residents of the 32nd district in Georgia House of Representatives. But on January 10, 1966, his white colleagues in the Georgia House voted 184-12 not to seat him because he had publicly expressed his opposition to the Vietnam War. Julian Bond challenged the refusal of the Georgia House to seat him and took his case all the way to the United States Supreme Court, which ruled in the unanimous decision of Bond v. Floyd, 385 U.S. 116 (1966), that expressing opposition to the Vietnam War was speech protected by the First Amendment and directed that he be seated as a duly elected member of the state legislature. Julian Bond would go on to serve three more terms in the George House, where he co-founded the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus, and six terms in the Georgia State Senate. In 1971, Julian Bond co-founded and served as president of the Southern Poverty Law Center that tracks the actions of hate groups to better inform and prepare communities about the dangers these groups pose. Julian Bond consistently identified issues of civil inequality and provided solutions by gathering groups of community leaders, professionals, and educators to protect what the laws and policies would not, our basic civil rights. In 1998, Julian Bond's commitment to justice and equality led him to answer the call to serve and accept the position of Chairman of the NAACP, a post he held until 2010. Julian Bond was able to bring the earnest fight to achieve equality into the modern era as he watched African-Americans achieve the highest awards in their professions and continued to break down barriers. In November 2008, Julian Bond witnessed the election of the first African American President of the United States, a feat thought impossible just a decade earlier. Mr. Speaker, because of trailblazers like Julian Bond millions of Americans gained access to opportunities previously denied to members of their communities. Julian Bond spent 5 years with SNCC, 8 years as president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, 12 years as the president of NAACP, 20 years as a state representative, and 75 years an unwavering champion of civil rights for all people, including the LGBT community. My thoughts and prayers are with Julian's beloved wife Pamela, his children and grandchildren; and the untold millions of persons whose lives were touched by one of America's greatest sons. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to observe a moment of silence in memory of Julian Bond, a tireless and eloquent voice for justice, equality, and human dignity who did so much to close the gap between the promise of America's founding ideals and the reality of people's lives. Civil Rights Giant Julian Bond Never Stopped Giving (Posted By Edna Kane-Williams on August 31, 2015) President Obama described him as a ``hero'' who ``helped changed this country for the better.'' The Rev. Jesse Jackson called him a ``leader with strength, character.'' NAACP Chairman Roslyn Brock said he ``inspired a generation of civil rights leaders.'' Teresa Sullivan, president of the University of Virginia, where he taught history for many years, called him a beloved retired professor who ``shaped the course of history through his life and work.'' How ever you choose to describe Julian Bond, one thing is for sure: He taught us all how to stand for what we believe. And he believed in freedom, justice and equality. For me, one of the most remarkable attributes of this civil rights giant is the fact that he never stopped giving. Even at the time of his brief illness and death on Aug. 15 at the age of 75, he was still serving faithfully as chairman emeritus on the NAACP board. Even after he retired from the professorship at the University of Virginia, he continued to mentor and remained a role model for students and others. A writer, poet, television commentator, lecturer and college teacher--and as a former politician--Julian Bond was one of those rare people whose work became legendary while he was still doing it. In fact, the Library of Congress once called him a ``living legend.'' And because of the magnitude of his work, he leaves many treasures that will simply keep on giving. UVA, where his papers are housed, has announced its goal to establish a Julian Bond Professorship in Civil Rights and Social Justice, which ``will continue Bond's scholarly legacy.'' There will certainly be many more designations in honor of his life's work. And surely some will rise, seeking to follow in his footsteps. Mr. Bond believed in young people's ability to take the civil rights and social justice baton and run with it. Earlier this year, he told a group of Howard University students, ``I think you know what the problems are. You know what the solutions are, and I'm sure we will be glad to help. But don't depend on us to tell you what to do. Just go out and do it.'' Well, he left an amazing road map. From his pioneering civil rights work as a cofounder of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to all of his work and contributions thereafter, Julian Bond was a model for anyone who aims to make an impact and leave the world a better place. In that regard, he was a role model for us all. What a life. What a legacy. Amelia Boynton was born on August 18, 1911, in Savannah, Georgia. Her early activism included holding black voter registration drives in Selma, Boynton spent her first two years of college at Georgia State College (now Savannah State University), then transferred to the Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University) in Alabama. She graduated from Tuskegee with a home economics degree before further pursuing her education at Tennessee State University, Virginia State University and Temple University. In the 1930's, Boynton Robinson began her activist career by registering African Americans to vote. In 1964, she ran for Congress to represent Alabama. She was the first woman to have run for this Democratic seat, and although she did not win, she received 10% of [[Page H6303]] votes. As the civil rights movement picked up, Boynton asked Martin Luther King Jr., who had witnessed her arrest in January 1965 for seeking to register Black voters, to visit Selma and empower the community. King accepted, and joined Boynton Robinson and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in planning the march from Selma to Montgomery on March 17th, 1965. As approximately 600 marchers walked across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, they were confronted by 200 state troopers and Alabama policemen, who shot teargas and beat the non-violent protesters. This horrific event came to be known as Bloody Sunday. At least 17 protesters were sent to the hospital, including Boynton Robinson. A picture of her unconscious body lying on the ground after an officer shot tear gas into her throat spread through every news media outlet across the globe, and quickly became a symbol for race relations in the United States at the time. The Selma to Montgomery march was a pivotal demonstration in the civil rights movement, leading to future victories such as the Voting Rights Acts of 1965 signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Amelia Boynton Robinson was an incredible activist, leader, and woman, and is remembered for her courage and strength throughout the civil rights movement. She worked for equality for all until her last day on this earth. [From the Two-Way, Aug. 26, 2015] (By Bill Chappell) Amelia Boynton Robinson, Survivor of `Bloody Sunday,' Dies at 104 Amelia Boynton Robinson, who went from being beaten on a bridge in Selma, Ala., in 1965 to being pushed across the bridge in a wheelchair alongside the president of the United States, has died at age 104. Her daughter, Germaine Bowser, confirmed to Troy Public Radio's Kyle Gassiott that Boynton Robinson died early Wednesday morning. She had been hospitalized after suffering several strokes this summer. Born in Savannah, Ga., Boynton Robinson was a pioneer in the voting rights movement who took part in the event that came to be known as ``Bloody Sunday,'' when she and other activists were attacked by state troopers as they tried to march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Along with Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., Boynton Robinson held hands with President Obama as the men walked across the bridge this past March, marking the 50th anniversary of the march in Selma. The Montgomery Advertiser reports: ``Boynton Robinson asked Martin Luther King Jr. to come to Selma to mobilize the local community in the civil rights movement. She worked with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and helped plan the Selma to Montgomery march. Her role in the event was recaptured in the movie ``Selma,'' where she was portrayed by actress Lorraine Toussaint. She was invited as a guest of honor to attend the signing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by President Lyndon B. Johnson.'' Boynton Robinson also ``made history in 1964 as the first African-American to run for Congress in Alabama,'' Alabama Public Radio reported earlier this year, when the civil rights legend attended Obama's 2015 State of the Union address in Washington, DC. She was the guest of Rep. Terri Sewell, Alabama's first elected African-American congresswoman. general leave Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order. What a grand opportunity to cite these great Americans: Amelia Boynton Robinson, Congressman Lou Stokes, and Julian Bond. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Texas? There was no objection. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, Amelia Boyton Robinson was an American hero who devoted her entire life to the fight for equal rights for all. She was a child suffragette, who alongside her mother, advocated for the women's vote and then as a young woman fought for the right of blacks to have their say at the ballot box. After bold run to represent Alabama in Congress, Mrs. Robinson helped organize the Bloody Sunday March from Selma to Montgomery. She was hospitalized after being knocked unconscious by a white officer on that perilous day, which left her undaunted and even more determined to fight for the African- American vote. It was my honor to nominate her for a Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Phoenix Award earlier this year, but sadly, she died before I could present it to her. Thankfully, however, Mrs. Robinson was able to share enough stories about her courageous experiences to fill a history book and resonate for generations to come. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6293-H6303] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] A TRIBUTE TO AMELIA BOYNTON ROBINSON, CONGRESSMAN LOUIS STOKES, AND JULIAN BOND The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rouzer). Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, thank you very much. I am very privileged tonight to lead the Special Order of the Members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Let me thank our chairman, Chairman G.K. Butterfield, for continuing this tradition and for his continued leadership, encouragement, and avocation for Members and for the stories of those who have been such leaders in our Nation and such major issues that we have been able to contribute to for the understanding of our colleagues. Let me also make mention of my colleagues, Congresswoman Kelly and Congressman Payne, who have led us on this Special Order for the Congressional Black Caucus. I thank them for their leadership and service. A very special thanks to those of you who are watching at home and have often watched at home and have followed the Congressional Black Caucus through social media, social network, and also know that our major issues of criminal justice reform, civil rights, the restoration of the Voting Rights Act, and many others have been to speak to the vulnerable. Tonight we again speak to you, but we speak of those heroes that we have lost over the last couple of months. Tonight we pay tribute to Amelia Boynton Robinson, Congressman Lou Stokes, and, of course, Julian Bond. Our Nation was built on the values of dealing with the issues of freedom, justice and equality, values and principles that were perfectly embodied by the service and sacrifices of these three leaders. Mr. Speaker, over the last week we have watched the Pope make his way through a number of American cities and use words that are music to the ears of Members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Let me take just one of many citations that I will utilize to characterize these three individuals: ``The complexities of history,'' said Pope Francis, ``and the reality of human weakness notwithstanding, these men and women, for all their many differences and limitations, were able, by hard work and self- sacrifice, some at the cost of their lives, to build a better future.'' I would offer to say that Amelia Boynton Robinson, Congressman Lou Stokes, and Julian Bond, through the sacrifice of their individual families and their lives, were able to make a better future for us. We know the civil rights activist Amelia Boynton Robinson, 1965, was a leader of the Bloody Sunday march and personified the optimism, determination, and courage that are at the heart of the American spirit. She truly made our lives better. Known as the matriarch of our Nation's civil rights movement, Ms. Boynton Robinson fought courageously to ensure that every American citizen had the right to vote. Her drive to secure universal voting rights was amazing, and certainly she risked her life when she crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge. In her words, her son said civil rights was her entire life. [[Page H6294]] We now understand that Congressman Lou Stokes made an amazing and impactful statement legislatively and throughout his life. He was a consummate public servant, a trailblazer who broke down barriers for generations of African Americans. He was the first African American Congressman from Ohio who served 30 years. Representing a portion of Cleveland, he prioritized the advancement of our Nation's most vulnerable populations. He advocated for more funding of education, housing, development projects, access to health care. He was one of the fiercest advocates for public housing. Mr. Stokes was a major proponent and leader that asked the Housing and Urban Development to assess the poor, deleterious, horrible conditions that children were living in as housing impacted their health. In fact, just recently I presented my housing authority a lead poisoning grant which was instigated, was encouraged, was advocated for by Congressman Lou Stokes. He has saved thousands upon thousands of lives. I thank him for organizing the Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust, and I want to thank him personally for allowing me work for him as a staff member of the Select Committee on Assassinations, which he ultimately chaired. We thank him for his amazing service. He once said, ``I am going to keep on denouncing the inequities of this system, but I am going to work within it. To go outside the system would be to deny myself, to deny my own existence. I have beaten the system. I have proved it can be done. So have a lot of others.'' This is, of course, the kind of leader that Lou Stokes was. Our friend, Julian Bond, was a civil rights icon. He was a leader in the fight for equality, freedom, and equal justice and opportunity. He inspired generations of Americans to build a better future for all people. Julian Bond was considered the young one in the movement with Dr. Martin Luther King. He stood as not only an original, but a fierce advocate of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the founding president of the Southern Poverty Law Center. Elected to office, of course, he himself fought against discrimination. He was discriminated himself. When he was refused a seat in the Georgia State Legislature, it did not in any way demean or undermine his courage or inspiration. He went on to be seated and to do great things. Tonight we are privileged to be able to honor and pay tribute to these three heroes. We are called to follow the example they set, to fight to ensure that all Americans have access to equal opportunity so they will have a fair shot at economic prosperity, have the right to vote, be free from mass incarceration, and do the things that America bestows upon them. Again, these individuals, at the cost of their lives or their own futures, built a better future for us. With that, I am delighted to yield to the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Mr. G.K. Butterfield, a former high superior court judge--I am calling him all kinds of names--but, in any event, a dynamic leader of the Congressional Black Caucus. Again, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee for her friendship, for her leadership, and I certainly thank her for yielding time tonight. Let me also thank the other Members who are on the floor this evening to help in honoring the lives of Louis Stokes, Amelia Boynton Robinson, and Julian Bond. These three are icons, absolute icons, of the civil rights movement, who in their own way paved the way for so many. I had the high honor of calling Lou Stokes and Julian Bond personal friends. As the first African American to represent Ohio in Congress, Representative Lou Stokes was a pioneer in public service. He broke down numerous barriers for African Americans during his extraordinary career as an elected official on the local, State, and Federal levels. First elected to Congress in 1969 and serving for 30 long years in the U.S. House, he was a founder of the Congressional Black Caucus and the first African American to serve on the House Appropriations Committee. He was the founder of the CBC Health Braintrust, which remains active today in protecting health, equity, and reducing health disparities. Congressman Stokes was the embodiment of a public servant. He selflessly used his elected positions to increase opportunities for millions of African Americans. We will miss our dear friend Lou Stokes. But the impact of his legacy of service and commitment to his constituents and to the African American community will be remembered for generations. Often referred to as the matriarch of the movement, Amelia Boynton Robinson's role in Bloody Sunday, as you have already heard, and the march from Selma to Montgomery is immortalized in the Oscar-nominated film ``Selma.'' She also made history in 1964 by becoming the first African American woman from Alabama to run for Congress. In her congressional election that year, Mrs. Boynton Robinson garnered 10 percent of the vote despite the fact that African Americans only made up 1 percent of the voting population in Alabama's Seventh Congressional District. Forty-six years later the CBC's very own representative, Terri Sewell, whom we will hear from in just a few moments, now holds that seat here in Congress. This year, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, we remember the selfless actions of individuals like Amelia Boynton Robinson who fought against systems of injustice so that future generations would have opportunities that were not possible to generations past. Tonight we honor Mrs. Boynton Robinson for her legacy which continues in each of us. Finally, Mr. Speaker, tonight we honor Julian Bond, a forefather of America's civil rights movement and one of our country's greatest advocates for freedom and equality and equitable treatment for all people. From his work as a student leader during the 1960s to his service in the Georgia House of Representatives and the State Senate, Julian Bond was a leader in the fight against racism and segregation. {time} 1930 I first met Julian Bond at the funeral of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in 1968. As the founding president of the Southern Poverty Law Center and chairman of the board of the NAACP, Julian Bond continued his work educating citizens around the world of the struggles of African Americans and the history of civil rights here in America. Julian Bond spent his lifetime in public service, calling for equal civil and human rights not only for African Americans, but for every American. Until his untimely death, he was an advocate, activist, and dedicated champion who fought for the most vulnerable individuals and communities among us. We celebrate his life and his lasting legacy. I want to thank Ms. Jackson Lee for her leadership and thank her for yielding. I thank the Members for coming to the floor this evening. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman for his very thoughtful statement and for leading us off today and setting the tone for the Congressional Black Caucus that we will never forget our icons, but we also know that to pay tribute is the highest honor for all of us because we are here because of all of them. I thank Mr. Butterfield for his leadership. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege now to yield to Representative Charles Rangel, who does not need a long introduction. It is important to note that he has led on so many issues. He was not only the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, but also a dear friend of Congressman Lou Stokes and one of the founders of the Congressional Black Caucus. If Congressman Rangel had not done what he did, we would not be here today. I am delighted to yield to him at this time. Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Jackson Lee for pulling together this tribute. It is moving and emotional that we do this after the visit to these Chambers by the Pope, who made it abundantly clear how all of us, no matter how ordinary we are, [[Page H6295]] can do extraordinary things when we make a commitment to do the right thing. As some of the older Members know, it is almost unbelievable how people that you know on an everyday basis that go through life with their own problems still can find the time to try to improve the quality of life for so many people. I feel almost awkward looking at the Representative from Selma, Alabama, this evening because, after Bloody Sunday, there was a call all over the world for people to come to Selma. I was one of those called, and I was one of those that did not think that me going to Selma with my bad feet could make a contribution to anything, and this is especially so after seeing what happened on Bloody Sunday. But I did go down because of John Lewis and Andrew Young and Martin Luther King and Ralph Bunche, because they said that if I could just come down for the press conference, it would be appreciated. So I dressed up and I went down for the press conference. I had a round trip ticket back to New York. I was dressed pretty well, not ever thinking that I would be going any further than Selma. It started to rain, and I felt that this would be the appropriate time for me to get a cab and to go to the airport. When I saw these older people like Amelia Robinson putting plastic on their shoes and starting to sing and starting to march, I said, well, maybe I could go a couple of blocks. I did that, except I found out in Selma there weren't any couple of blocks. There were no television cameras. There was no one that recognized me down there. I marched 54 miles, cussing every step of the way, trying to figure out what the devil I was doing in Selma. Congresswoman Sewell, it just proves that if you attempt just to do the right thing, God can push you to do the rest. I never did believe, like John Lewis, that that Supreme Court would give us the voting rights and the civil rights. I never thought that President Johnson would ever support these things. Today I tell this very embarrassing story because you don't have to be a hero to be counted on if you just try to start to do the right thing, and just maybe God will push you to go further. Certainly when a woman like Amelia Boynton Robinson is beaten unconscious and someone like John Lewis, who constantly put his life on the line, and of course the late Dr. Martin Luther King, who gave up his life, and God doesn't ask us to do these extraordinary things, but I do believe that the courage that these people have, that each of us have just a grain of it that would allow us to contribute, as the Pope said, to show our respect for God, allowing us to inherit this great Earth to try to make the quality of life better. Of course, when it comes to a young guy going to Morehouse, as Julian Bond did, dropping out of school, coming from a professional family where education had a higher standard than some of us from the inner cities, it must have broken their heart to know that he was joining a group that would then provide the leadership for our country for people Black and White. There is nothing that my heart would allow me to say about Lou Stokes. I came to Congress not knowing that in the Congress was a giant of a man from Cleveland, Lou Stokes, who motivated the 13 of us, who led us to form the Congressional Black Caucus. I have walked in the shadows of his giant footsteps since I have been privileged to serve in this House. Ms. Jackson Lee and members of the Congressional Black Caucus, it is really extraordinary how God has given us the opportunity to say thank you for the blessings that we have, and I do hope that maybe on both sides of the aisle people can talk about those who allowed this country to be so great, the sacrifices that so many people have made, and you just don't have to be a giant to appreciate the fact that God has blessed us all. I thank her for her effort at bringing us together, not just tonight, but on every committee, on every bill, and this floor. Sheila Jackson Lee is here to continue to inspire all of us. I thank her for that. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, we are so grateful for the special wisdom and insight that Mr. Rangel brings to all of what we do. I know that the late Lou Stokes, the late Amelia Boynton Robinson, and the late Julian Bond are grateful that they knew him and that he is here to tell his story. Even if he considers it embarrassing, I think it is a wonderful testimony for anybody who has said, ``I can't do it.'' We want him to keep telling us that wonderful statement over and over again. I thank him so very much for what he provides to the Congressional Black Caucus. I thank him for the kind words he mentioned of Representative Terri Sewell. I just say to Ms. Sewell, I don't know what kind of phone message that she had to the Vatican, but I repeat now the words of Pope Francis, as I yield to her. This is Pope Francis, as he spoke just a few days ago at that very podium: Here, too, I think of the march which Martin Luther King led from Selma to Montgomery 50 years ago as part of the campaign to fulfill his dream of full civil rights and political rights for African Americans. Representative Sewell, let me thank you for bringing and infusing life into the wonderful city of Selma, all the wonderful people there, including your dearly beloved mother and father, and having us walk with you every step of the way. As I yield to her, let me say that we should make a commitment right here today, as we make changes in leadership, that we commit ourselves to the restoration of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which she is leading on. It is my delight to yield to her at this time. Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, I thank our leader of the CBC, Congressman Butterfield, so much for his exemplary leadership and the courage that he exemplifies every day in fighting for the causes that we all hold so dear. I want to thank Congresswoman Jackson Lee for those wonderful words. Sheila Jackson Lee has not only been an amazing Member of Congress, but she has been a great mentor to me. I want to thank her for all she does for so many of us and the mentoring she continues to provide the younger generation. What can I say to Charlie Rangel? To even have him know my name is an honor. I know that, but for the remarkable lives of the three people that we celebrate their lives and their legacies today, I would not be in this auspicious Chamber, and but for his leadership and his courage, I would not know how to behave in this Chamber. I thank him for doing such a great job and continuing to serve the great people of Harlem and New York, but also the great people of America--black, white, green, yellow, all of us. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join with my CBC colleagues in paying tribute to the life and legacy of three great giants in American history: Representative Louis Stokes, Amelia Boynton Robinson, and Julian Bond. Our Nation collectively mourns the loss of each of these trailblazing figures who departed from us way too soon this summer. Their journeys paved the way for myself and so many others serving in this august body. While our hearts are heavy today, we honor them for their historic and notable contributions to this Nation. Congressman Louis Stokes was the first African American to represent the State of Ohio in Congress, where he served for more than 30 years. He rose to prominence by breaking numerous barriers as the first in so many areas. This included being named the first African American to serve as chairman of the prestigious House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. As an African American who now sits on that committee, I am deeply honored to follow in Louis Stokes' footsteps. During his tenure on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, he stepped into the national spotlight as a vocal critic of the Reagan administration's foreign policy. He spoke boldly on issues of national security and created a legacy of being a fierce advocate for the homeland. In honoring his memory, we must also commit ourselves collectively to continue the fight to promote diversity within the intelligence community. We must also be committed to supporting policies that promote our national security in the face of growing threats. It was Congressman Lou Stokes who taught us that our Nation deserves nothing less. [[Page H6296]] Today we also honor an American treasure and one of my personal heroes, the courageous Mrs. Amelia Boynton Robinson. Mrs. Robinson passed away on August 26, 2015, at the age of 110--yes, 110, Mr. Speaker. Mrs. Amelia Boynton Robinson was a key figure in the voting rights movement in Selma, Alabama. She is often remembered for her critical role in Bloody Sunday. On that solemn day on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, Robinson was savagely beaten. A photo taken of her shortly after she was attacked and posted in The New York Times became a powerful symbol of the injustices suffered by those who were attempting simply to vote. Yet this tireless, fearless foot soldier continued her work as a leader on the front lines of securing the right to vote for all Americans. Amelia is best known as the matriarch of the voting rights movement, and it was her courage, along with John Lewis and so many other known and unknown foot soldiers which led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Amelia was such an integral part of the process that the contents of the bill, the voting rights bill, were drafted on her kitchen table in Selma, Alabama, in 1965. Ms. Boynton not only trailblazed as a voting rights advocate, she put her money where her mouth was and she, herself, ran for Congress. On May 5, 1964, Amelia Boynton broke yet another barrier, when she became the first woman in the State of Alabama and the first African American woman in the State of Alabama to run for Congress. In 1964, she garnered 10.7 percent of the vote during a time when very few Blacks were registered to vote. Actually, only 1 percent of the registered voters were African Americans at that time. Her historic run further solidified her impact on the movement for human rights and voting rights in Alabama and in this Nation. Without her courageous campaign for the Seventh Congressional District of Alabama in 1964, I know that my election to this seat in 2010, some 50 years later, would not have been possible. {time} 1945 Her sacrifices paved the way for me to walk the Halls of Congress, and I will carry my love and admiration for her in my heart each and every day, for I get to do what she could not, and that is vote on behalf of the members of the Seventh Congressional District of Alabama. For that, I am eternally grateful. In fact, one of my most memorable moments in this Chamber is the night that she served as my special guest at the State of the Union on January 20, 2015, this past year. I am grateful for the memories of her greeting President Obama that night. I am so blessed to not only have called her my constituent, but a beloved mentor and friend. As she is remembered, and she reminds us every day by her life, there is still much work to be done. Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would also like to remember the shining legacy of yet another giant figure in the fight for civil and human rights: Mr. Julian Bond. This courageous voice held several titles over the course of his impactful life, but he is most remembered for his service as the NAACP chairman and the cofounder of the Southern Poverty Law Center. He was also one of the original leaders of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, SNCC, while he was a student at Morehouse College. He later served in the Georgia General Assembly for more than 20 years. He was first elected to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1965. However, because of his longstanding legacy of fighting White supremacy, White statehouse members tried unsuccessfully to block him from taking his seat. This brave spirit was undeterred. He spearheaded efforts to draft landmark legislation that spoke to the need of Blacks in the State of Georgia. In addition to his time as an eloquent speaker, he was a celebrated writer, poet, television commentator, community advocate, as well as a communication specialist. He did so much for the Southern Poverty Law Center to set it on its course and so much for the lives of so many. All three of these wonderful giants tell a story, a story of how ordinary people can do extraordinary things. Working collectively, we as a nation can achieve amazing heights, even if we don't think so. As Congressman Rangel's story best exemplified, if we just take one step, hopefully the Lord will give us the strength to take many, many more towards that fight for justice and equality. In closing, I am reminded of what Amelia Boynton would often say when I and others would come up to her and say: ``We stand on your shoulders. We stand on your shoulders.'' Well, Ms. Amelia Boynton was so infamously known for saying, after hearing it over and over again: ``Get off my shoulders. There is plenty of work to be done.'' ``Do your own work,'' is what she said. And so I say to my colleagues gathered here tonight, my colleagues in this wonderful body called the House of Representatives: We have plenty of work to do. We have plenty of work to do. And while we walk in the footsteps of giants such as Amelia Boynton and Louis Stokes and Julian Bond, let us never forget that they, too, had to take a first step. And as we follow in their footsteps, let us all take many steps towards providing justice and liberty for all Americans, especially those that are most vulnerable. Ms. JACKSON LEE. I think we can leave this evening with the words that Congresswoman Sewell has just said, and we thank her so very much, ``do our own work.'' That message should carry for whether we are Republicans or Democrats or Independents. Congresswoman Sewell, we look forward to doing our own work on the restoration of the Voting Rights Act, section 5, which you are leading and all of us have signed onto. We thank you so much for that eloquent statement and that statement of passion. Speaking of passion, it is my privilege to introduce a Member who has her own storied civil rights history, someone who has served as the Commissioner on the EEOC, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and someone who has been in the trenches in civil rights, dealing with voting rights cases, dealing with the right to vote in her own District of Columbia. I think she will be the Florence Nightingale, she will be the champion battler; because I believe that this Delegate, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, will be successful as we fight for the voting rights of the District through her leadership. I yield to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton). Ms. NORTON. I thank my good friend, Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, first, for her kind and generous words, but especially today for her leadership of this Special Order, which is characteristic of her leadership in this Congress. I am so pleased that our chair Rep. G.K. Butterfield has been here and spoken and that we have heard from several other Members. I just want to say a few words about this troika of African Americans who have written their signatures across our time. You have heard their biographies. I don't want to recount their extraordinary bios, because that is not the only reason we are honoring them with this Special Order. I just want to say something about what they meant to me. Two of them I knew personally: Representative Louis Stokes, whose many years in the Congress happened to overlap with my first years here; and, of course, Julian Bond, whom I knew best. I was not fortunate to know Amelia Boynton. She may have been the most courageous woman in the movement of the 1960s, who insisted upon facing death, if necessary, in that march from Selma to Montgomery, and nearly lost her life. I was privileged to be in her presence, as so many Members of Congress were, when we went to Selma this past summer. That was a privilege in and of itself. I was fortunate to know Congressman Louis Stokes, who was a founder of the Congressional Black Caucus long before I served. This was a man of great accomplishment. Yes, he can speak about his firsts, and much more. He is the first African American to serve in Congress from his hometown of Cleveland, as one of the two famous Stokes brothers--his brother, Carl, the first African American mayor. There is something about the way those men were raised and showed themselves in public life. But it is Rep. Stokes' career in Congress that stands out for me. [[Page H6297]] I am not certain there has ever been a more distinguished Member of this body. It looks as if when they were trying to ask somebody to do something hard, they looked to Louis Stokes. He was the first African American to serve on the Appropriations Committee. My heavens. And then look at the committees he has chaired-- hard ones--the Ethics Committee, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Then they needed someone to do something else that was difficult, and that was to serve on the Iran Contra Committee, and House Select Committee on Assassinations, nothing was more difficult than that. If you were looking for a Member whom the public would trust and who this body would trust, who do you go to? They went to Louis Stokes. So if you are trying to find out how to serve, recall the life of Representative Louis Stokes. In the District, we recall his life and his work. Much of his work was done in the field of health. The Howard University Louis Stokes Health Science Library is named for him here in the District of Columbia at Howard University. So we will never forget him. Of the three, the one I knew best, of course, was my colleague and friend in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, later a client of sorts, and then finally--for 25 years, a constituent. I met Julian several years after he founded, along with a handful of other students, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. You have got to understand that that group was as different from any student group since. They were not an offshoot of the civil rights movement. They were a group that stood on its own. I would go down in the summers. I was in law school. SNCC was the equivalent of major civil rights organizations, every single one, right alongside them. That is why John Lewis got to speak on the March on Washington. The reason that SNCC stood out is the quality of its leadership in those early years. Julian became the spokesman. The reason he was the spokesman was his way with words. He was a poet and a writer, and he could explain what we were doing. He served a most valuable role in these early years. So no one should be surprised that he went after the zenith of the civil rights movement to serve in the Georgia House of Representatives. What you may be surprised to learn is that when he moved on to the senate, the Georgia Senate, they refused to seat him because he had endorsed a SNCC statement opposing the Vietnam war. Imagine denying a seat to a member duly elected because of a statement he had made on an issue of great moment. This case was taken all the way to the Supreme Court. At that point, I was a constitutional lawyer working for the American Civil Liberties Union in New York. I got to write the amicus brief. We took very few amicus briefs to the Supreme Court, but this one seemed to have the makings of a landmark case. Indeed, it did become a landmark case. You do not see anybody denying anyone else the right to sit in his seat--or her seat, today--because of that person's views. The Julian Bond case settled the matter. What was Julian Bond to do with the rest of his life? First of all, SNCC broke a fair number of people. And though they gave much to the movement, you may not have heard about many of them since. What Julian did was to give the rest of his life to the movement. For every single day of his life as a man, after he left public service in the Georgia Legislature, he was devoted to the civil rights movement he had entered as a very young man. He moved to the District of Columbia with his wife, taught at American University and the University of Virginia, and became--and this is a matter that makes me chuckle--became the chairman of the NAACP. At SNCC we thought the NAACP was way too conservative for us, the young and foolish. It tells you how Julian grew. He grew to be the long-time and devoted chairman of the NAACP. He carried out his devotion to civil rights magnificently. Throughout his entire life, he remained a major spokesman for the civil rights movement and for progressive causes, his entire life speaking all around the country, carrying the message. When he moved here, I had a Black Caucus event with Julian and with John Lewis simply discussing their lives as young men in the civil rights movement. That was to be one of the most memorable moments since I have been in Congress. Just last February, during Black History Month, I asked Julian to come to Howard University, where he and I engaged in an intergenerational conversation with Howard students about the police shootings in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City and what they meant to this generation and how this generation had to have its own issues and move in its own direction. One of the things we indicated was that for all of the work of the youth of the civil rights movement of our day, we never touched racial profiling. It remained alive and kicking for a new generation, which has taken it on. I am, finally, particularly grateful that when Julian moved to the District of Columbia, he really became a part of this city, lending his civil rights celebrity to the great cause of this city for full citizenship, for D.C. voting rights, yes, and for statehood for the District of Columbia. If you came into the District by taxis a few years ago, there was an advertisement. Julian was speaking in a cab, informing you that you were coming to the District of Columbia, where the residents were trying to get their full citizenship. Wherever he was, he had a way of touching upon the issue of freedom of the day and of the people around him. I will always miss him. This country will always miss him. We are grateful for the life he led. We are grateful, especially, for this Congressional Black Caucus evening devoted to his life and to the lives of two others, very divergent lives but, in other ways, very similar. I thank my good friend, Representative Jackson Lee, again, for her leadership here. {time} 2000 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me thank my good friend, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, for giving these three legends the vitality and vibrance of a personal story. And to just add to his coming to students at Howard University, I want you to know that, at the University of Virginia, where he was, he was the most popular professor with people standing in line because the students sensed his passion and commitment, but they sensed his realness. Thank you so very much for that very vibrant and informative presentation. Mr. Speaker, as I introduce this next gentleman, who has his own history, let me quote, again, as I indicated, Pope Francis from last week, which captures all of what we are saying tonight: to respond in a way which is always humane, just and fraternal. We need to avoid a common temptation nowadays to disregard whatever proves troublesome. Let us remember the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. The gentleman that I am going to yield to, Mr. Bobby Scott, is a former chairman of the Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, now the ranking member on the Committee on Education and the Workforce, and has led his professional, at least his Congressional life, as I have known it, to be a champion for criminal justice reform, but, more importantly, has been one who has said to us over and over again that: We must do unto others as we would like them to do unto us. We must change this criminal justice system to have it be a fair monitoring of how we inspire and restore people's lives. I yield now to the gentleman from Virginia, Congressman Bobby Scott. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in honor of the lives of three civil rights luminaries. I thank the gentlewoman from Houston for giving us this opportunity to honor their lives: Congressman Louis Stokes, statesman and educator Julian Bond, both of whom I knew personally, and activist Amelia Robinson. These champions of social and economic justice lived their lives just as Pope Francis challenged Members of Congress to do. Specifically, the Pope reminded us of the Golden Rule--do unto others as you would have them do unto you--and that that rule points us in the right direction. He specifically reminded Congress that, if we want opportunities, [[Page H6298]] then let us provide opportunities. The lives we honor today are the personification of the Pope's call. Congressman Stokes, the beloved son of the State of Ohio, was affectionately called ``Lou'' when I served with him in the House. His motto was to aim high, which he did even before he was a Member of Congress when he argued the Supreme Court case challenging the abusive stop-and-frisk policies and practices in the Terry v. Ohio case. Lou's integrity was why he was selected to serve on the House Select Committee on Assassinations of President Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the House investigation of the illegal arm sales during the Iran-contra affair and, of course, his service on the Ethics Committee. His strive for social and economic justice was on full display when he became the first African American to serve on the House Appropriations Committee. There he directed Federal dollars to eradicate injustice and inequities by funding programs such as healthcare facilities for veterans, supporting the National Science Foundation, and creating the first office of minority health at the National Institutes of Health. Statesman and educator Julian Bond dedicated his entire life to this cause of social justice and equity. As a founding member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, or SNCC, he led protests against segregation. In 1965, Julian Bond was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives, but was denied a seat at the State House because of his opposition to the Vietnam war. In 1966, the Supreme Court ruled 9-0 that the Georgia House's refusal to seat Julian Bond violated the United States Constitution. He was subsequently elected for several terms, including service in the Georgia Senate, despite efforts to redraw his district. He was also the first African American nominated at a major-party convention as a candidate for Vice President of the United States. Beginning in the 1980s, Julian Bond taught at several universities, including Harvard, Drexel, University of Virginia, and American University. For more than 20 years at UVA and American University, he taught thousands of students about the role of the civil rights movement as a seminal part of America's history. He stated that the ``humanity of all Americans is diminished when any group is denied rights granted to others.'' He served as chairman of the NAACP from 1998 to 2009. At the 2009 commencement at Virginia State University, he told the graduates that, ``We all hope that you do well, but I also hope that you do good.'' Activist Amelia Robinson was among the many foot soldiers who fought for civil rights. As a girl, she championed the right to vote for women. As an adult, she opened her home to Martin Luther King and James Bevel and members of SNCC and others to help organize and strategize for civil rights and the right to vote. Despite the brutal beating she endured during the march for voting rights in Selma, Alabama, 50 years ago, she was unwavering in her fight to end segregation and achieve full voting rights for all. Reflecting on her life as an activist, she stated that, ``I have been called rabble-rouser, agitator. But because of my fighting, I was able to hand to the entire country the right for people to vote.'' These three American giants--the legislator, the educator, the activist--were all driven to push towards a more just and equal society. I am honored to recognize their lives and the gifts they gave to our Nation. Again, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Houston for organizing this Special Order so that we could pay appropriate tribute to these fine Americans. Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman from Virginia for citing, in particular, the case law that Julian Bond particularly generated from the horrific denial of his right to be seated. Let me also indicate the importance of members of the Congressional Black Caucus sharing the history of these icons, which I hope my colleagues will appreciate these giants, for many times the history is not remembered or it is not understood. Certainly, it is my privilege to now yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio, who has firsthand knowledge because she can say that she comes from the State of which Lou Stokes and Carl Stokes were native sons. She is, of course, an inspirational leader for her district in Columbus, but, more importantly, someone who brings a wealth of experience from her previous service in the Ohio State Legislature and someone who has a passion for the improvement of lives of all people. I believe, as Lou Stokes has said, she understands the value and importance of improving the health of African Americans and all Americans. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield to the gentlewoman from Columbus, Ohio (Mrs. Beatty). Mrs. BEATTY. Thank you so much, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. Mr. Speaker, tonight the Congressional Black Caucus honors the life and legacy of three civil rights leaders, Congressman Lou Stokes, Amelia Boynton Robinson, and Julian Bond, who dedicated their lives to making our Nation a better place. Countless more follow in their footsteps and continue to push for civil rights and voting rights today. We have come to these chambers tonight, Mr. Speaker, to continue their work as members of the Congressional Black Caucus. We call on Congress to immediately pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2015. The American people deserve to have real voting rights. Thank you, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, not only for your leadership tonight, but for being a leader, for walking in their shoes, and for hosting the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order honoring three giants. This year is the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act. Leaders espoused words in 1965 that still hold true today, words because of the work of these three giants, works like: We have proved that great progress is possible. We know how much still remains to be done. And if our efforts continue, if our will is strong, if our hearts are right, and if courage remains our constant companion, then my fellow Americans, I am confident we shall overcome. Our objective must be to assure that all Americans play by the same rules, and all Americans play against the same odds. Who amongst us would claim that that is true today? Just last week His Holiness, Pope Francis, delivered a historic, profound, provocative address to the Joint Session of Congress. This address reminded us that the nation is ``considered great'' when ``it fosters a culture which enables people to dream of full rights for all their brothers and sisters.'' At the White House, he quoted from Martin Luther King, to use a telling phrase of the Reverend Martin Luther King: ``We can say that we have defaulted on a promissory note, and now is the time to honor it.'' These three individuals we honor tonight tirelessly contributed to this culture of full rights and equality we are committed to achieving. Tonight's roll call: Congressman Lou Stokes. I am honored to be the third African American from Ohio to follow in his footsteps, following my mentor and dear friend, Stephanie Tubbs Jones, my colleague, mentor and friend, Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, who said at his footsteps: I don't salute or get excited about a one hit wonder because Lou Stokes was far from that. Lou Stokes loved people. He loved the law. He loved the legislative process. He loved his family. And he loved Cleveland, Ohio. You have heard so much about him, I won't repeat it. I will submit it for the Record, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, if that is okay. But I will forever be grateful for his encouragement, his friendship, his wisdom, and his leadership. I can't think of a time or a decision in my life that I didn't pick up the phone and call Lou Stokes. Love you, Lou Stokes. Let me just briefly say we also salute Amelia Boynton Robinson, and much has been said about her. I stand on her shoulders. And then Julian Bond, another great civil rights icon, whose passion and dedication to equality and justice propelled him to the Georgia Legislature, the NAACP, and the Southern Poverty Law Center, which he co-founded. [[Page H6299]] His commitment to ending discrimination and injustice continues to inspire us, and his legacy will guide us and the next generation of civil rights leaders and activists to greatness. He, like the other individuals we pay tribute to tonight, helped change this country for the better. Thank you, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. Thank you to all my colleagues with the Congressional Black Caucus for capturing and reflecting on the lives of three great civil warriors as we took a walk in their footsteps of greatness. Tonight the Congressional Black Caucus honors the life and legacy of three Civil Rights leaders--Congressman Louis Stokes, Amelia Boynton Robinson and Julian Bond who dedicated their lives to making our nation a better place. Countless more follow in their footsteps and continue to push for civil rights and voting rights today. We have come to these chambers to continue their work as Members of the Congressional Black Caucus; we call on Congress to immediately pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2015. The American people deserve to have real voting rights now. Thank you Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee for hosting the CBC's Special Order Hour paying tribute to Congressman Louis Stokes, Amelia Boynton Robinson, and Julian Bond. This year is the 50th Anniversary of Voting Rights Act. Leaders . . . espoused words in 1965 that still hold true today. Words like: We have proved that great progress is possible. We know how much still remains to be done. And if our efforts continue, and if our will is strong, and if our hearts are right, and if courage remains our constant companion, then my fellow Americans, I am confident, we shall overcome. Our objective must be to assure that all Americans play by the same rules, and all Americans play against the same odds. Who among us would claim that that is true today? Just last week, His Holiness Pope Francis delivered a historic, profound, and provocative address to a Joint Session of Congress.

At the White House, he quoted words from MLK . . . to use a telling phrase of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. . . . we can say that we have defaulted on a promissory note and now is the time to honor it. The three individuals we honor tonight tirelessly contributed to this culture of full rights and equality we are committed to achieving. Congressman Stokes I am honored to be the third African-American from Ohio to follow Congressman Louis Stokes who served for 30 years in Congress. I am forever grateful for his encouragement, friendship, wisdom, and leadership. He earned a seat on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, the first person of color to ever do so, and focused on improving housing and urban development for veterans, seniors, and the poor. In 1971, along with our esteemed Dean of the House, Congressman John Conyers, Congressman Stokes helped found the Congressional Black Caucus to promote economic, educational, and social issues important to African Americans: this is a purpose the CBC continues to fulfill to this day, and a purpose I am honored to advance. His indelible mark in history will continue to live on. Amelia Boynton Robinson It is also an honor to pay tribute to Amelia Boynton Robinson--the matriarch of the voting rights movement. As an African-American female serving in the U.S. Congress, I stand on the shoulders of Mrs. Boynton Robinson. Mrs. Boynton Robinson helped organize the Selma-to-Montgomery marches, and walked at the front of the line that fateful day on March 7, 1965, which we now know as ``Bloody Sunday''. On August 6, 1965, she was the guest of honor at the White House when President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 into law. I had the privilege to join Mrs. Boynton Robinson this past March, as thousands of Americans marched once again over the Edmund Pettus Bridge, remembering the struggles and recommitting ourselves to restoring voting rights protections, equality, and justice. Julian Bond Julian Bond was a civil rights icon whose passion and dedication to equality and justice propelled him to the Georgia legislature, the NAACP, and the Southern Poverty Law Center, which he co-founded. His commitment to ending discrimination and injustice continues to inspire us and his legacy will guide the next generation of civil rights leaders and activists to greatness. He, like the other individuals we pay tribute to tonight, helped changed this country for the better. Thank you CBC for capturing and reflecting on the lives of three great civil rights warriors as we took a walk in their footsteps of greatness. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Congresswoman Beatty, thank you for letting us know whose footsteps we walk in and for that celebratory statement. Mr. Speaker, it is certainly my pleasure to yield to the gentlewoman from the U.S. Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett), who has come with the expertise of a renowned and trained lawyer, one who is a collaborator. Ms. PLASKETT. Thank you so much to my colleague, Sheila Jackson Lee. I want to thank you and the Congressional Black Caucus for this Special Order Hour, a special tribute to the lives and legacy of Representative Louis Stokes, Amelia Boynton Robinson, and Julian Bond. Thank you, Ms. Jackson Lee, for your work here in Congress, your tireless efforts to raise awareness to issues which many Americans may have forgotten or not given thought to. Thank you for your mentorship to us younger members here and your tireless efforts to support not only the people of Houston, but the people of America. Thank you for allowing us this most important opportunity to pay tribute to these remarkable individuals. Mr. Speaker, today we gather in reverence and in solemn reflection to honor the lives and legacies of some exceptional people, some exceptional Americans, who we have lost in these recent months. These were civil rights activists, statesmen and women, trailblazers, members of a great generation of individuals who gave so much of themselves to the Civil Rights Movement and to the advancement of minorities in our country. They are former Congressman Louis Stokes, former chairman of the NAACP and Georgia State Senator Julian Bond, and civil rights icon Mrs. Amelia Boynton Robinson. A centenarian--Mrs. Robinson's 110 years of life, that in itself is a great honor--she was dedicated to education, fighting state-sanctioned discriminatory practices against African Americans, and voter disenfranchisement. {time} 2015 One can make the argument that her role in Selma's civil rights demonstrations, including the infamous march on Bloody Sunday where she was beaten unconscious by State police, paved the way, through the subsequent passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, for both Congressman Stokes and State Representative Bond to serve in elected office. As the first African American elected to Congress from the State of Ohio, Congressman Stokes was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus and spent his 30-year career in Congress advocating issues of importance to Ohioans and to African Americans across the country. Julian Bond, that great statesman from Georgia, was one of 11 African Americans elected to the Georgia House of Representatives after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Bond served 20 years in both legislative chambers in the State of Georgia and served as the first president of the Southern Poverty Law Center. He also served as chairman of the NAACP. These individuals have impacted the lives of so many African Americans and have undoubtedly advanced the rights and interests of minorities in both our States' and our Nation's governments. Similarly, I would like to just take a moment to recognize two individuals from my own home district of the Virgin Islands who, like Congressman Stokes, Julian Bond, and Amelia Robinson, have changed the landscape of the Virgin Islands through their advocacy and education. I would like to recognize a former judge and Lieutenant Governor of the Virgin Islands, the late Julio A. Brady, who, like Julian Bond and Congressman Stokes, used his training as an attorney to contribute to his community outside of the courtroom. As a U.S. attorney, judge, and attorney general, Judge Brady fought to remove barriers of injustice. He was laid to rest this week. Like Congressman Stokes and [[Page H6300]] Amelia Robinson, Judge Brady's legacy of service will carry on. Ursula Krigger was also a centenarian, like Amelia Robinson, and, at age 113 was the oldest living Virgin Islander until her passing this month. She was a griot, an educator whose longevity afforded a unique perspective of witnessing the modern advancement of our territory. The lives and legacies of these individuals are etched in the annals of our history and their impact forever ingrained in the minds and hearts of the many lives they touched. I am a better person; and, indeed, we are a better nation through the work of these individuals. I have listened to my colleagues tonight speak about Representative Louis Stokes, Amelia Boynton Robinson, and Julian Bond and the personal impact these individuals had on the work of my colleagues with whom they served and have known personally. Understand, that while many like myself may not have had the great honor and pleasure of toiling and working with them shoulder to shoulder in the struggle for civil rights and the advancement of minorities in our country, Americans like myself understand and appreciate their sacrifice, and we understand the work that must still be done. We will continue their legacy here today and in Congress in the future. Thank you so much, Congressional Black Caucus, for this time. And thank you again to my colleague from Texas, Sheila Jackson Lee, for the time that I have been afforded to speak on behalf of these great Americans. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Congresswoman Plaskett, thank you so very much for laying the groundwork for those who now step into those footsteps, and you have done so with such leadership and certainly such passion. Thank you so very much. Mr. Speaker, what is my time remaining? The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Russell). The gentlewoman from Texas has 2 minutes remaining. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me conclude by thanking the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus and my colleagues. It is so important for the Congressional Black Caucus to be able to talk to America-- Representative Butterfield, Representative Rangel, Representative Sewell, Delegate Holmes Norton, Representative Bobby Scott, Representative Joyce Beatty, and, of course, Congresswoman Plaskett--to be able to give life to why we are here representing all of America. We have those special people that, without our voices, would not be able to be heard. I simply want to add these words of the Pope, again, to be able to remind everyone why these icons that we are speaking of tonight in the Congressional Black Caucus--46 of us, along with Senator Booker--have a vital role in this place. As the Pope indicated, I would encourage you to keep in mind all those people around us who are trapped in the cycle of poverty. They, too, need to be given hope. The fight against poverty and hunger must be fought constantly on many fronts, especially in its causes. I know that Americans today, as in the past, are working to deal with this problem. That is the essence of Julian Bond, who never stopped giving; that is the essence of Amelia Boynton Robinson, who continued to fight for civil rights up until her death at the age of 104 on August 6, 2015; that is the essence of Congressman Lou Stokes, a legislative giant, the chairman of an appropriations subcommittee, a person who went to public housing and places where children were and told America that your children are dying because they are living in substandard housing, lead poisoning was killing them, which gave me the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, as I said before, to give a grant to my public housing just this past week on helping with lead poisoning. I worked for Lou Stokes, and I am very glad to note that, working for him, I can say, truly a gentleman, truly a leader. To this Congress, I beg of you, let us look at these icons and celebrate not only their lives, but commit to the passion and justice of their lives, and, as well, the words of Pope Francis that tell us to do unto others as we would like them to do unto us. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to again thank the members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to speak in praise of Louis Stokes, one of the greatest and most respected Members ever to serve in this body, who died on Tuesday, August 18, 2015, at his home near Cleveland, Ohio at the age of 90. It is not unusual in these days for commentators and politicians to talk of something called ``American Exceptionalism.'' But what is meant by the term? Mr. Speaker, one way to understand the term: America is exceptional because it produces and finds persons like Louis Stokes and affords them the opportunity to utilize their talents to the fullest in the service of their community and their country. Think about it: in what other nation does a little African American boy born in 1925 on the east side of Cleveland and raised in the Outhwaite Homes housing project by a mother who worked as a domestic go on to become a lawyer who argues and wins a landmark criminal justice reform case (Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968)) in the United States Supreme Court; become the first African American elected to Congress; is selected to chair the powerful Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, the Select Committee on Assassinations, and an Appropriations Subcommittee responsible for more than $90 billion annually in federal outlays? Yes, America is an exceptional nation and Louis Stokes was an exceptional human being. Mr. Speaker, Louis Stokes was born on February 23, 1925, in Cleveland, Ohio, to Charles and Louise Cinthy (nee Stone) Stokes. When he was three years old, his father, who worked in a laundromat, died leaving young Louis and his younger brother, Carl, to be raised by their mother, who worked as a domestic for affluent families in the wealthy Cleveland suburbs. Louis Stokes' maternal grandmother played a critical role in his life because she took care of the Stokes boys while their mother was at work and instilled in them ``the idea that work with your hands is the hard way of doing things'' and encouraged them over and over ``to learn to use their heads.'' Louis Stokes took the advice to heart so after attending Cleveland's Central High School and serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, he returned home to attend what is now Case Western Reserve University on the G.I. Bill at night while working during the day for the Veterans Administration and the Department of the Treasury. After graduating from college in two years where he excelled as a student, Louis Stokes was accepted for admission to Cleveland Marshall School of Law, from which he graduated in 1953; three years later, his brother Carl would also graduate from Cleveland Marshall School of Law and the two of them would go on to form the law firm of Stokes & Stokes specializing in the areas of civil rights and criminal law. In 1964, the Supreme Court decided the landmark case of Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964), which established the principle of ``one person, one vote'' governing the reapportionment of legislative boundaries. The following year, working on behalf of the local branch of the NAACP, Louis Stokes led the legal challenge to the Ohio legislature's congressional redistricting, which had the effect of diluting African American voting strength in Cleveland. The challenge was unsuccessful in the federal district court but undeterred, Louis Stokes, joined by Charles Lucas, an African American Republican, successfully appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which in an order handed down in 1967 ruled the redistricting plan unconstitutional and ordered it redrawn, resulting in the creation of Ohio's first majority-black district, the 21st Congressional District of Ohio. Ironically, Louis Stokes would defeat his one-time ally Charles Lucas to win that seat in November 1968, capturing 75% of the vote, the closest of his 15 successful elections to the U.S. House of Representatives. For the next 30 years, from 1969 to 1999, Congressman Stokes tirelessly fought for his constituents in Cleveland and for the best interests of the people of Ohio and the United States. Louis Stokes, a founding member and Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus from 1972-74, was the epitome of a public servant. In his second term in Congress, he won appointment to the powerful House Appropriations Committee, where he served for 28 years, later becoming the second African American ``Cardinal'' in history when he was selected to chair the VA, HUD, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. Because of the esteem in which he was held by his colleagues and the leadership, Louis Stokes would also later be selected to Chair the House Permanent Select Committee [[Page H6301]] on Intelligence and the Select Committee charged with investigating the assassinations of President Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. As Chairman of the House Ethics Committee and a person of unquestioned integrity, Louis Stokes oversaw the committee's investigation of the corruption scandal known as ABSCAM in 1979-80, which eventually led to convictions of a senator and six House members. Mr. Speaker, Louis Stokes perhaps is best known for the national attention he attracted in 1987 as a member of the House Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms Transactions with Iran/(``Iran- Contra''), the scandal involving the illegal sale of military weapons to the Ayatollah Khomeini's Iran to generate money to fund the illegal contra war in Nicaragua. In response to the claim by Colonel Oliver North that he acted out of patriotism in engineering the illegal weapons sales and diverting the proceeds to fund the contras, a stern Louis Stokes lectured the misguided Colonel North on the rule of law, the true meaning of patriotism, and, in the process American exceptionalism: ``I suppose that what has been most disturbing to me about your testimony is the ugly part. In fact, it has been more than ugly. It has been chilling, and, in fact, frightening. I'm not just talking about your part in this, but the entire scenario, about government officials who plotted and conspired, who set up a straw man, a fall guy. Officials who lied, misrepresented and deceived. Officials who planned to superimpose upon our government a layer outside of our government, shrouded in secrecy and only accountable to the conspirators. ``Colonel, as I sit here this morning looking at you in your uniform, I cannot help but remember that I wore the uniform of this country in World War II in a segregated Army. I wore it as proudly as you do, even though our government required black and white soldiers in the same Army to live, sleep, eat and travel separate and apart, while fighting and dying for our country. But because of the rule of law, today's servicemen in America suffer no such indignity. ``My mother, a widow, raised two boys. She had an eighth-grade education. She was a domestic worker who scrubbed floors. One son became the first black mayor of a major American city. The other sits today as chairman of a House intelligence committee. Only in America, Col. North. Only in America. And while I admire your love for America, I hope that you will never forget that others too love America just as much as you do and that others will die for America, just as quick as you will.'' Louis Stokes never wavered in his belief that America could fulfill the promise of its Founders or his dedication to the principles of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, stating: ``I'm going to keep on denouncing the inequities of this system, but I'm going to work within it. To go outside the system would be to deny myself--to deny my own existence. I've beaten the system. I've proved it can be done--so have a lot of others. ``But the problem is that a black man has to be extra special to win in this system. Why should you have to be a super black to get someplace? That's what's wrong in the society. The ordinary black man doesn't have the same chance as the ordinary white man does.'' Mr. Speaker, Louis Stokes' commitment to fairness and equal treatment started long before he was elected to Congress. As a lawyer for the NAACP, he brought anti-discrimination lawsuits, represented demonstrators arrested in antidiscrimination marches and sit-ins, and took the cases of poor persons charged with crimes. One of those criminal cases he took is known to every lawyer in America and appreciated by every person who cherishes the protections guaranteed by the 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. I am speaking of the famous case of Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968) won by Louis Stokes in which the Supreme Court held that a police officer could ``stop and frisk'' an individual only where he could articulate a reasonable basis that the person was, or was about to be, engaged in criminal activity. As a result of Terry v. Ohio, a police officer has the right to stop, frisk, and question an individual he reasonably suspects to be engaged in criminal activity, but cannot seize items from that person if the pat down of the suspect's outer clothing does not reveal any weapons posing a threat to the officer's safety. Because of Louis Stokes' exceptional advocacy in Terry v. Ohio, the right of every individual to secure from unreasonable searches and seizures was preserved while at the same not impeding the ability of law enforcement officers to perform their duties safely. Mr. Speaker, every citizen benefits from this ruling and communities that have a history of being harassed by law enforcement protected by the Constitution from arbitrary and abusive treatment by law enforcement. But the fight for a criminal justice system that respects the rights of all persons is not over. That is why I am proud to be the Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations and a leader in the effort to reform the criminal justice system so that all persons receive fair and equal treatment regardless of their race, gender, religion, or national origin. Louis Stokes fought tirelessly to fulfill the promise of the 14th Amendment that ``no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.'' It is a fight I am proud to continue today. Mr. Speaker, Louis Stokes will be mourned by friends and colleagues on both sides of the aisle who had the privilege to serve alongside him. He was a mentor to me and I will always remember his commanding presence and cherish the assistance he provided me and the example he set for new Members to follow. My thoughts and prayers are with his Jay, Louis' beloved wife of 55 years; to his children, Shelly, Louis, Angela, and Lorene; his grandchildren; and the untold thousands of persons who touched and whose lives were touched by one of Cleveland's greatest sons. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to observe a moment of silence in memory of Louis Stokes, an exceptional American, and the gentleman from Ohio who served in this chamber for three decades with honor, integrity, and distinction. [From cleveland.com] Lou Stokes Put Health Impacts of Substandard Housing on the National Agenda, and in Cleveland: Terry Allan, Dorr Dearborn and Dave Jacobs (Opinion) In this file photo from 2012, Timothy Benner, then 8, looks outside from his Maurice Avenuue home in Cleveland. After Timothy and some of his siblings tested positive for lead poisoning, traced to the soil around their home, their mother restricted their outdoor play time. U.S. Rep. Lou Stokes, who died earlier this month, championed national attention and funding to address the problem of lead poisoning in inner- city children. Recent stories and opinion pieces have eulogized the many accomplishments of the late U.S. Rep. Louis Stokes, from civil-rights champion to accomplished litigator, statesman and lawmaker. We believe that Louis Stokes should also be recognized as a national leader who clearly understood the connection between substandard housing and health, and acted to address the problem, at a time when very few did. Back in the 1980s, the scope and magnitude of the childhood lead-poisoning problem and its impact on our nation's children was not fully recognized or well understood. Subsequent efforts to increase blood screening in early childhood revealed that Greater Cleveland had among the highest rates of lead poisoning in the country, adding to the compounding disadvantages of children living in poverty in our community and across the United States. Some of us have vivid memories from 1991, when Congressman Stokes held up a Newsweek magazine cover story on threats posed to children by lead paint, passionately advocating for the voiceless in our society while educating the community about this silent epidemic. He wanted all of us to understand the debilitating consequences of childhood lead exposure in the home environment and its impact on the life trajectory of these vulnerable kids. Congressman Stokes turned that message into action, by using his formidiable legislative acumen to establish the first Healthy Homes program in the country within the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. When he recognized in 1998 that young infants in his district were suffering from sometimes fatal lung bleeding associated with water-damaged, moldy homes, he asked HUD to address the impact of inner-city homes on children's health. He understood that houses are systems, and that independently addressing lead paint problems, moisture intrusion and mold, injury risks and other housing hazards was inefficient and costly. He also had the vision to recognize that treating children at the hospital, only to release them back into the same substandard home that made them sick, created a vicious circle with major public health consequences. He knew these homes needed to be fixed. The HUD Office of Lead Hazard Control had shown interest in applying the experience of lead-poisoning prevention to include other health hazards in the home, such as plumbing problems and leaky basements, but lacked the authority. Through his vision, the Congressman invited us and others to testify at the House Subcommittee on HUD appropriations to see what could be done. Lou Stokes convinced his fellow committee members to provide the very first appropriation of $10 million to HUD for `Healthy Homes' prevention programs in low-income housing. His legacy has resulted in millions of homes that are safer and healthier as a direct result of that investment in our children. Since that time, [[Page H6302]] the HUD Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes has provided more than $175 million in competitively awarded grants to communities across the nation to investigate and address health hazards in homes. The asthma home-visit program in Cleveland that decreases the hospitalization rate of children with asthma, highlighted in The Plain Dealer in June, is a direct outgrowth of Congressman Stokes' work. In 2012, HUD created the Louis Stokes Healthy Homes Award and presented the first one to him at the City Club of Cleveland. When he received the award, he pointed out that much has been achieved and that much more remains to be done. He also said that he really didn't know what all the fuss was about, as he was just a kid who grew up in public housing, who wanted to do the right thing for our children. He was an inspiration to us all. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to speak in praise of Julian Bond, one of the leading lights of the Civil Rights Movement, who died on Saturday, August 15, 2015, at the age of 75. While Julian lost his battle to the illness that claimed his life, it is the struggle for civil rights and human dignity he helped to win that he will forever remembered and revered. Horace Julian Bond was born January 14, 1940 in Nashville, Tennessee to Julia Agnes and Horace Mann Bond. Julian's father was the first African-American President of Lincoln University of Pennsylvania, the same institution attended by Thurgood Marshall and Langston Hughes who would both go on to make substantial contributions to the Civil Rights Movement and the advancement of African-Americans. Julian's father later became president of Atlanta University and Julian decided to attend Morehouse College, one of the leading black colleges in the nation. Julian Bond, who came from a long line of educators, determined at an early age to put his journalistic and organizing talents in service of the cause of civil rights and racial equality. While a student at Morehouse College, Julian helped found The Pegasus, a literary magazine, and led nonviolent student protests against segregation in Atlanta parks, restaurants, and movie theaters. Mr. Speaker, today it is difficult to imagine there once was a time in our country when blacks and whites could not eat together in public restaurants, use the same public restrooms, stay at the same hotels, or attend the same schools. Julian Bond answered the call to action and put his studies on hold to devote all of his energies and efforts to ending segregation and racial discrimination. Mr. Speaker, it is not unusual these days for us to think of a champion as someone who receives the highest accolades in sports. Julian Bond was a champion of the people. His success is measured not in the numbers of trophies, medals, ribbons, and championship banners, but in the number of doors and opportunities he helped to open for those who had been neglected, marginalized, and disenfranchised. Julian Bond knew that to bring about non-violent social change it was necessary to organize so he co-founded the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). SNCC, which organized and mobilized the participation of students and young people in the Civil Rights Movement, conceived the Freedom Rides that challenged the practice of racial segregation in interstate transportation and the Mississippi Freedom Summer project that undertook the dangerous work of helping African Americans register to vote in the state most committed to maintaining White supremacy by any means necessary. SNCC was not the first leadership role history and circumstance would call upon Julian Bond to assume; nor would it be the last. In 1965, after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Julian Bond was elected to represent the residents of the 32nd district in Georgia House of Representatives. But on January 10, 1966, his white colleagues in the Georgia House voted 184-12 not to seat him because he had publicly expressed his opposition to the Vietnam War. Julian Bond challenged the refusal of the Georgia House to seat him and took his case all the way to the United States Supreme Court, which ruled in the unanimous decision of Bond v. Floyd, 385 U.S. 116 (1966), that expressing opposition to the Vietnam War was speech protected by the First Amendment and directed that he be seated as a duly elected member of the state legislature. Julian Bond would go on to serve three more terms in the George House, where he co-founded the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus, and six terms in the Georgia State Senate. In 1971, Julian Bond co-founded and served as president of the Southern Poverty Law Center that tracks the actions of hate groups to better inform and prepare communities about the dangers these groups pose. Julian Bond consistently identified issues of civil inequality and provided solutions by gathering groups of community leaders, professionals, and educators to protect what the laws and policies would not, our basic civil rights. In 1998, Julian Bond's commitment to justice and equality led him to answer the call to serve and accept the position of Chairman of the NAACP, a post he held until 2010. Julian Bond was able to bring the earnest fight to achieve equality into the modern era as he watched African-Americans achieve the highest awards in their professions and continued to break down barriers. In November 2008, Julian Bond witnessed the election of the first African American President of the United States, a feat thought impossible just a decade earlier. Mr. Speaker, because of trailblazers like Julian Bond millions of Americans gained access to opportunities previously denied to members of their communities. Julian Bond spent 5 years with SNCC, 8 years as president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, 12 years as the president of NAACP, 20 years as a state representative, and 75 years an unwavering champion of civil rights for all people, including the LGBT community. My thoughts and prayers are with Julian's beloved wife Pamela, his children and grandchildren; and the untold millions of persons whose lives were touched by one of America's greatest sons. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to observe a moment of silence in memory of Julian Bond, a tireless and eloquent voice for justice, equality, and human dignity who did so much to close the gap between the promise of America's founding ideals and the reality of people's lives. Civil Rights Giant Julian Bond Never Stopped Giving (Posted By Edna Kane-Williams on August 31, 2015) President Obama described him as a ``hero'' who ``helped changed this country for the better.'' The Rev. Jesse Jackson called him a ``leader with strength, character.'' NAACP Chairman Roslyn Brock said he ``inspired a generation of civil rights leaders.'' Teresa Sullivan, president of the University of Virginia, where he taught history for many years, called him a beloved retired professor who ``shaped the course of history through his life and work.'' How ever you choose to describe Julian Bond, one thing is for sure: He taught us all how to stand for what we believe. And he believed in freedom, justice and equality. For me, one of the most remarkable attributes of this civil rights giant is the fact that he never stopped giving. Even at the time of his brief illness and death on Aug. 15 at the age of 75, he was still serving faithfully as chairman emeritus on the NAACP board. Even after he retired from the professorship at the University of Virginia, he continued to mentor and remained a role model for students and others. A writer, poet, television commentator, lecturer and college teacher--and as a former politician--Julian Bond was one of those rare people whose work became legendary while he was still doing it. In fact, the Library of Congress once called him a ``living legend.'' And because of the magnitude of his work, he leaves many treasures that will simply keep on giving. UVA, where his papers are housed, has announced its goal to establish a Julian Bond Professorship in Civil Rights and Social Justice, which ``will continue Bond's scholarly legacy.'' There will certainly be many more designations in honor of his life's work. And surely some will rise, seeking to follow in his footsteps. Mr. Bond believed in young people's ability to take the civil rights and social justice baton and run with it. Earlier this year, he told a group of Howard University students, ``I think you know what the problems are. You know what the solutions are, and I'm sure we will be glad to help. But don't depend on us to tell you what to do. Just go out and do it.'' Well, he left an amazing road map. From his pioneering civil rights work as a cofounder of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee to all of his work and contributions thereafter, Julian Bond was a model for anyone who aims to make an impact and leave the world a better place. In that regard, he was a role model for us all. What a life. What a legacy. Amelia Boynton was born on August 18, 1911, in Savannah, Georgia. Her early activism included holding black voter registration drives in Selma, Boynton spent her first two years of college at Georgia State College (now Savannah State University), then transferred to the Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee University) in Alabama. She graduated from Tuskegee with a home economics degree before further pursuing her education at Tennessee State University, Virginia State University and Temple University. In the 1930's, Boynton Robinson began her activist career by registering African Americans to vote. In 1964, she ran for Congress to represent Alabama. She was the first woman to have run for this Democratic seat, and although she did not win, she received 10% of [[Page H6303]] votes. As the civil rights movement picked up, Boynton asked Martin Luther King Jr., who had witnessed her arrest in January 1965 for seeking to register Black voters, to visit Selma and empower the community. King accepted, and joined Boynton Robinson and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in planning the march from Selma to Montgomery on March 17th, 1965. As approximately 600 marchers walked across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, they were confronted by 200 state troopers and Alabama policemen, who shot teargas and beat the non-violent protesters. This horrific event came to be known as Bloody Sunday. At least 17 protesters were sent to the hospital, including Boynton Robinson. A picture of her unconscious body lying on the ground after an officer shot tear gas into her throat spread through every news media outlet across the globe, and quickly became a symbol for race relations in the United States at the time. The Selma to Montgomery march was a pivotal demonstration in the civil rights movement, leading to future victories such as the Voting Rights Acts of 1965 signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Amelia Boynton Robinson was an incredible activist, leader, and woman, and is remembered for her courage and strength throughout the civil rights movement. She worked for equality for all until her last day on this earth. [From the Two-Way, Aug. 26, 2015] (By Bill Chappell) Amelia Boynton Robinson, Survivor of `Bloody Sunday,' Dies at 104 Amelia Boynton Robinson, who went from being beaten on a bridge in Selma, Ala., in 1965 to being pushed across the bridge in a wheelchair alongside the president of the United States, has died at age 104. Her daughter, Germaine Bowser, confirmed to Troy Public Radio's Kyle Gassiott that Boynton Robinson died early Wednesday morning. She had been hospitalized after suffering several strokes this summer. Born in Savannah, Ga., Boynton Robinson was a pioneer in the voting rights movement who took part in the event that came to be known as ``Bloody Sunday,'' when she and other activists were attacked by state troopers as they tried to march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Along with Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., Boynton Robinson held hands with President Obama as the men walked across the bridge this past March, marking the 50th anniversary of the march in Selma. The Montgomery Advertiser reports: ``Boynton Robinson asked Martin Luther King Jr. to come to Selma to mobilize the local community in the civil rights movement. She worked with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and helped plan the Selma to Montgomery march. Her role in the event was recaptured in the movie ``Selma,'' where she was portrayed by actress Lorraine Toussaint. She was invited as a guest of honor to attend the signing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by President Lyndon B. Johnson.'' Boynton Robinson also ``made history in 1964 as the first African-American to run for Congress in Alabama,'' Alabama Public Radio reported earlier this year, when the civil rights legend attended Obama's 2015 State of the Union address in Washington, DC. She was the guest of Rep. Terri Sewell, Alabama's first elected African-American congresswoman. general leave Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order. What a grand opportunity to cite these great Americans: Amelia Boynton Robinson, Congressman Lou Stokes, and Julian Bond. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Texas? There was no objection. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, Amelia Boyton Robinson was an American hero who devoted her entire life to the fight for equal rights for all. She was a child suffragette, who alongside her mother, advocated for the women's vote and then as a young woman fought for the right of blacks to have their say at the ballot box. After bold run to represent Alabama in Congress, Mrs. Robinson helped organize the Bloody Sunday March from Selma to Montgomery. She was hospitalized after being knocked unconscious by a white officer on that perilous day, which left her undaunted and even more determined to fight for the African- American vote. It was my honor to nominate her for a Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Phoenix Award earlier this year, but sadly, she died before I could present it to her. Thankfully, however, Mrs. Robinson was able to share enough stories about her courageous experiences to fill a history book and resonate for generations to come. ____________________",package_114_54.csv,86369,86369,86441,"[congressional record volume 161, number 140 (monday, september 28, 2015)] [house] [pages h6293-h6303] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] a tribute to amelia boynton robinson, congressman louis stokes, and julian bond the speaker pro tempore (mr. rouzer). under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from texas (ms. jackson lee) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, thank you very much. i am very privileged tonight to lead the special order of the members of the congressional black caucus. let me thank our chairman, chairman g.k. butterfield, for continuing this tradition and for his continued leadership, encouragement, and avocation for members and for the stories of those who have been such leaders in our nation and such major issues that we have been able to contribute to for the understanding of our colleagues. let me also make mention of my colleagues, congresswoman kelly and congressman payne, who have led us on this special order for the congressional black caucus. i thank them for their leadership and service. a very special thanks to those of you who are watching at home and have often watched at home and have followed the congressional black caucus through social media, social network, and also know that our major issues of criminal justice reform, civil rights, the restoration of the voting rights act, and many others have been to speak to the vulnerable. tonight we again speak to you, but we speak of those heroes that we have lost over the last couple of months. tonight we pay tribute to amelia boynton robinson, congressman lou stokes, and, of course, julian bond. our nation was built on the values of dealing with the issues of freedom, justice and equality, values and principles that were perfectly embodied by the service and sacrifices of these three leaders. mr. speaker, over the last week we have watched the pope make his way through a number of american cities and use words that are music to the ears of members of the congressional black caucus. let me take just one of many citations that i will utilize to characterize these three individuals: ``the complexities of history,'' said pope francis, ``and the reality of human weakness notwithstanding, these men and women, for all their many differences and limitations, were able, by hard work and self- sacrifice, some at the cost of their lives, to build a better future.'' i would offer to say that amelia boynton robinson, congressman lou stokes, and julian bond, through the sacrifice of their individual families and their lives, were able to make a better future for us. we know the civil rights activist amelia boynton robinson, 1965, was a leader of the bloody sunday march and personified the optimism, determination, and courage that are at the heart of the american spirit. she truly made our lives better. known as the matriarch of our nation's civil rights movement, ms. boynton robinson fought courageously to ensure that every american citizen had the right to vote. her drive to secure universal voting rights was amazing, and certainly she risked her life when she crossed the edmund pettus bridge. in her words, her son said civil rights was her entire life. [[page h6294]] we now understand that congressman lou stokes made an amazing and impactful statement legislatively and throughout his life. he was a consummate public servant, a trailblazer who broke down barriers for generations of african americans. he was the first african american congressman from ohio who served 30 years. representing a portion of cleveland, he prioritized the advancement of our nation's most vulnerable populations. he advocated for more funding of education, housing, development projects, access to health care. he was one of the fiercest advocates for public housing. mr. stokes was a major proponent and leader that asked the housing and urban development to assess the poor, deleterious, horrible conditions that children were living in as housing impacted their health. in fact, just recently i presented my housing authority a lead poisoning grant which was instigated, was encouraged, was advocated for by congressman lou stokes. he has saved thousands upon thousands of lives. i thank him for organizing the congressional black caucus health braintrust, and i want to thank him personally for allowing me work for him as a staff member of the select committee on assassinations, which he ultimately chaired. we thank him for his amazing service. he once said, ``i am going to keep on denouncing the inequities of this system, but i am going to work within it. to go outside the system would be to deny myself, to deny my own existence. i have beaten the system. i have proved it can be done. so have a lot of others.'' this is, of course, the kind of leader that lou stokes was. our friend, julian bond, was a civil rights icon. he was a leader in the fight for equality, freedom, and equal justice and opportunity. he inspired generations of americans to build a better future for all people. julian bond was considered the young one in the movement with dr. martin luther king. he stood as not only an original, but a fierce advocate of the student nonviolent coordinating committee and the founding president of the southern poverty law center. elected to office, of course, he himself fought against discrimination. he was discriminated himself. when he was refused a seat in the georgia state legislature, it did not in any way demean or undermine his courage or inspiration. he went on to be seated and to do great things. tonight we are privileged to be able to honor and pay tribute to these three heroes. we are called to follow the example they set, to fight to ensure that all americans have access to equal opportunity so they will have a fair shot at economic prosperity, have the right to vote, be free from mass incarceration, and do the things that america bestows upon them. again, these individuals, at the cost of their lives or their own futures, built a better future for us. with that, i am delighted to yield to the chair of the congressional black caucus, mr. g.k. butterfield, a former high superior court judge--i am calling him all kinds of names--but, in any event, a dynamic leader of the congressional black caucus. again, i yield to the gentleman from north carolina. mr. butterfield. mr. speaker, i thank congresswoman sheila jackson lee for her friendship, for her leadership, and i certainly thank her for yielding time tonight. let me also thank the other members who are on the floor this evening to help in honoring the lives of louis stokes, amelia boynton robinson, and julian bond. these three are icons, absolute icons, of the civil rights movement, who in their own way paved the way for so many. i had the high honor of calling lou stokes and julian bond personal friends. as the first african american to represent ohio in congress, representative lou stokes was a pioneer in public service. he broke down numerous barriers for african americans during his extraordinary career as an elected official on the local, state, and federal levels. first elected to congress in 1969 and serving for 30 long years in the u.s. house, he was a founder of the congressional black caucus and the first african american to serve on the house appropriations committee. he was the founder of the cbc health braintrust, which remains active today in protecting health, equity, and reducing health disparities. congressman stokes was the embodiment of a public servant. he selflessly used his elected positions to increase opportunities for millions of african americans. we will miss our dear friend lou stokes. but the impact of his legacy of service and commitment to his constituents and to the african american community will be remembered for generations. often referred to as the matriarch of the movement, amelia boynton robinson's role in bloody sunday, as you have already heard, and the march from selma to montgomery is immortalized in the oscar-nominated film ``selma.'' she also made history in 1964 by becoming the first african american woman from alabama to run for congress. in her congressional election that year, mrs. boynton robinson garnered 10 percent of the vote despite the fact that african americans only made up 1 percent of the voting population in alabama's seventh congressional district. forty-six years later the cbc's very own representative, terri sewell, whom we will hear from in just a few moments, now holds that seat here in congress. this year, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the voting rights act of 1965, we remember the selfless actions of individuals like amelia boynton robinson who fought against systems of injustice so that future generations would have opportunities that were not possible to generations past. tonight we honor mrs. boynton robinson for her legacy which continues in each of us. finally, mr. speaker, tonight we honor julian bond, a forefather of america's civil rights movement and one of our country's greatest advocates for freedom and equality and equitable treatment for all people. from his work as a student leader during the 1960s to his service in the georgia house of representatives and the state senate, julian bond was a leader in the fight against racism and segregation. {time} 1930 i first met julian bond at the funeral of dr. martin luther king, jr., in 1968. as the founding president of the southern poverty law center and chairman of the board of the naacp, julian bond continued his work educating citizens around the world of the struggles of african americans and the history of civil rights here in america. julian bond spent his lifetime in public service, calling for equal civil and human rights not only for african americans, but for every american. until his untimely death, he was an advocate, activist, and dedicated champion who fought for the most vulnerable individuals and communities among us. we celebrate his life and his lasting legacy. i want to thank ms. jackson lee for her leadership and thank her for yielding. i thank the members for coming to the floor this evening. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, let me thank the gentleman for his very thoughtful statement and for leading us off today and setting the tone for the congressional black caucus that we will never forget our icons, but we also know that to pay tribute is the highest honor for all of us because we are here because of all of them. i thank mr. butterfield for his leadership. mr. speaker, it is my privilege now to yield to representative charles rangel, who does not need a long introduction. it is important to note that he has led on so many issues. he was not only the chairman of the committee on ways and means, but also a dear friend of congressman lou stokes and one of the founders of the congressional black caucus. if congressman rangel had not done what he did, we would not be here today. i am delighted to yield to him at this time. mr. rangel. mr. speaker, i thank congresswoman jackson lee for pulling together this tribute. it is moving and emotional that we do this after the visit to these chambers by the pope, who made it abundantly clear how all of us, no matter how ordinary we are, [[page h6295]] can do extraordinary things when we make a commitment to do the right thing. as some of the older members know, it is almost unbelievable how people that you know on an everyday basis that go through life with their own problems still can find the time to try to improve the quality of life for so many people. i feel almost awkward looking at the representative from selma, alabama, this evening because, after bloody sunday, there was a call all over the world for people to come to selma. i was one of those called, and i was one of those that did not think that me going to selma with my bad feet could make a contribution to anything, and this is especially so after seeing what happened on bloody sunday. but i did go down because of john lewis and andrew young and martin luther king and ralph bunche, because they said that if i could just come down for the press conference, it would be appreciated. so i dressed up and i went down for the press conference. i had a round trip ticket back to new york. i was dressed pretty well, not ever thinking that i would be going any further than selma. it started to rain, and i felt that this would be the appropriate time for me to get a cab and to go to the airport. when i saw these older people like amelia robinson putting plastic on their shoes and starting to sing and starting to march, i said, well, maybe i could go a couple of blocks. i did that, except i found out in selma there weren't any couple of blocks. there were no television cameras. there was no one that recognized me down there. i marched 54 miles, cussing every step of the way, trying to figure out what the devil i was doing in selma. congresswoman sewell, it just proves that if you attempt just to do the right thing, god can push you to do the rest. i never did believe, like john lewis, that that supreme court would give us the voting rights and the civil rights. i never thought that president johnson would ever support these things. today i tell this very embarrassing story because you don't have to be a hero to be counted on if you just try to start to do the right thing, and just maybe god will push you to go further. certainly when a woman like amelia boynton robinson is beaten unconscious and someone like john lewis, who constantly put his life on the line, and of course the late dr. martin luther king, who gave up his life, and god doesn't ask us to do these extraordinary things, but i do believe that the courage that these people have, that each of us have just a grain of it that would allow us to contribute, as the pope said, to show our respect for god, allowing us to inherit this great earth to try to make the quality of life better. of course, when it comes to a young guy going to morehouse, as julian bond did, dropping out of school, coming from a professional family where education had a higher standard than some of us from the inner cities, it must have broken their heart to know that he was joining a group that would then provide the leadership for our country for people black and white. there is nothing that my heart would allow me to say about lou stokes. i came to congress not knowing that in the congress was a giant of a man from cleveland, lou stokes, who motivated the 13 of us, who led us to form the congressional black caucus. i have walked in the shadows of his giant footsteps since i have been privileged to serve in this house. ms. jackson lee and members of the congressional black caucus, it is really extraordinary how god has given us the opportunity to say thank you for the blessings that we have, and i do hope that maybe on both sides of the aisle people can talk about those who allowed this country to be so great, the sacrifices that so many people have made, and you just don't have to be a giant to appreciate the fact that god has blessed us all. i thank her for her effort at bringing us together, not just tonight, but on every committee, on every bill, and this floor. sheila jackson lee is here to continue to inspire all of us. i thank her for that. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, we are so grateful for the special wisdom and insight that mr. rangel brings to all of what we do. i know that the late lou stokes, the late amelia boynton robinson, and the late julian bond are grateful that they knew him and that he is here to tell his story. even if he considers it embarrassing, i think it is a wonderful testimony for anybody who has said, ``i can't do it.'' we want him to keep telling us that wonderful statement over and over again. i thank him so very much for what he provides to the congressional black caucus. i thank him for the kind words he mentioned of representative terri sewell. i just say to ms. sewell, i don't know what kind of phone message that she had to the vatican, but i repeat now the words of pope francis, as i yield to her. this is pope francis, as he spoke just a few days ago at that very podium: here, too, i think of the march which martin luther king led from selma to montgomery 50 years ago as part of the campaign to fulfill his dream of full civil rights and political rights for african americans. representative sewell, let me thank you for bringing and infusing life into the wonderful city of selma, all the wonderful people there, including your dearly beloved mother and father, and having us walk with you every step of the way. as i yield to her, let me say that we should make a commitment right here today, as we make changes in leadership, that we commit ourselves to the restoration of section 5 of the voting rights act, which she is leading on. it is my delight to yield to her at this time. ms. sewell of alabama. mr. speaker, i thank our leader of the cbc, congressman butterfield, so much for his exemplary leadership and the courage that he exemplifies every day in fighting for the causes that we all hold so dear. i want to thank congresswoman jackson lee for those wonderful words. sheila jackson lee has not only been an amazing member of congress, but she has been a great mentor to me. i want to thank her for all she does for so many of us and the mentoring she continues to provide the younger generation. what can i say to charlie rangel? to even have him know my name is an honor. i know that, but for the remarkable lives of the three people that we celebrate their lives and their legacies today, i would not be in this auspicious chamber, and but for his leadership and his courage, i would not know how to behave in this chamber. i thank him for doing such a great job and continuing to serve the great people of harlem and new york, but also the great people of america--black, white, green, yellow, all of us. mr. speaker, i rise today to join with my cbc colleagues in paying tribute to the life and legacy of three great giants in american history: representative louis stokes, amelia boynton robinson, and julian bond. our nation collectively mourns the loss of each of these trailblazing figures who departed from us way too soon this summer. their journeys paved the way for myself and so many others serving in this august body. while our hearts are heavy today, we honor them for their historic and notable contributions to this nation. congressman louis stokes was the first african american to represent the state of ohio in congress, where he served for more than 30 years. he rose to prominence by breaking numerous barriers as the first in so many areas. this included being named the first african american to serve as chairman of the prestigious house permanent select committee on intelligence. as an african american who now sits on that committee, i am deeply honored to follow in louis stokes' footsteps. during his tenure on the permanent select committee on intelligence, he stepped into the national spotlight as a vocal critic of the reagan administration's foreign policy. he spoke boldly on issues of national security and created a legacy of being a fierce advocate for the homeland. in honoring his memory, we must also commit ourselves collectively to continue the fight to promote diversity within the intelligence community. we must also be committed to supporting policies that promote our national security in the face of growing threats. it was congressman lou stokes who taught us that our nation deserves nothing less. [[page h6296]] today we also honor an american treasure and one of my personal heroes, the courageous mrs. amelia boynton robinson. mrs. robinson passed away on august 26, 2015, at the age of 110--yes, 110, mr. speaker. mrs. amelia boynton robinson was a key figure in the voting rights movement in selma, alabama. she is often remembered for her critical role in bloody sunday. on that solemn day on the edmund pettus bridge, robinson was savagely beaten. a photo taken of her shortly after she was attacked and posted in the new york times became a powerful symbol of the injustices suffered by those who were attempting simply to vote. yet this tireless, fearless foot soldier continued her work as a leader on the front lines of securing the right to vote for all americans. amelia is best known as the matriarch of the voting rights movement, and it was her courage, along with john lewis and so many other known and unknown foot soldiers which led to the passage of the voting rights act of 1965. amelia was such an integral part of the process that the contents of the bill, the voting rights bill, were drafted on her kitchen table in selma, alabama, in 1965. ms. boynton not only trailblazed as a voting rights advocate, she put her money where her mouth was and she, herself, ran for congress. on may 5, 1964, amelia boynton broke yet another barrier, when she became the first woman in the state of alabama and the first african american woman in the state of alabama to run for congress. in 1964, she garnered 10.7 percent of the vote during a time when very few blacks were registered to vote. actually, only 1 percent of the registered voters were african americans at that time. her historic run further solidified her impact on the movement for human rights and voting rights in alabama and in this nation. without her courageous campaign for the seventh congressional district of alabama in 1964, i know that my election to this seat in 2010, some 50 years later, would not have been possible. {time} 1945 her sacrifices paved the way for me to walk the halls of congress, and i will carry my love and admiration for her in my heart each and every day, for i get to do what she could not, and that is vote on behalf of the members of the seventh congressional district of alabama. for that, i am eternally grateful. in fact, one of my most memorable moments in this chamber is the night that she served as my special guest at the state of the union on january 20, 2015, this past year. i am grateful for the memories of her greeting president obama that night. i am so blessed to not only have called her my constituent, but a beloved mentor and friend. as she is remembered, and she reminds us every day by her life, there is still much work to be done. finally, mr. speaker, i would also like to remember the shining legacy of yet another giant figure in the fight for civil and human rights: mr. julian bond. this courageous voice held several titles over the course of his impactful life, but he is most remembered for his service as the naacp chairman and the cofounder of the southern poverty law center. he was also one of the original leaders of the student nonviolent coordinating committee, sncc, while he was a student at morehouse college. he later served in the georgia general assembly for more than 20 years. he was first elected to the georgia house of representatives in 1965. however, because of his longstanding legacy of fighting white supremacy, white statehouse members tried unsuccessfully to block him from taking his seat. this brave spirit was undeterred. he spearheaded efforts to draft landmark legislation that spoke to the need of blacks in the state of georgia. in addition to his time as an eloquent speaker, he was a celebrated writer, poet, television commentator, community advocate, as well as a communication specialist. he did so much for the southern poverty law center to set it on its course and so much for the lives of so many. all three of these wonderful giants tell a story, a story of how ordinary people can do extraordinary things. working collectively, we as a nation can achieve amazing heights, even if we don't think so. as congressman rangel's story best exemplified, if we just take one step, hopefully the lord will give us the strength to take many, many more towards that fight for justice and equality. in closing, i am reminded of what amelia boynton would often say when i and others would come up to her and say: ``we stand on your shoulders. we stand on your shoulders.'' well, ms. amelia boynton was so infamously known for saying, after hearing it over and over again: ``get off my shoulders. there is plenty of work to be done.'' ``do your own work,'' is what she said. and so i say to my colleagues gathered here tonight, my colleagues in this wonderful body called the house of representatives: we have plenty of work to do. we have plenty of work to do. and while we walk in the footsteps of giants such as amelia boynton and louis stokes and julian bond, let us never forget that they, too, had to take a first step. and as we follow in their footsteps, let us all take many steps towards providing justice and liberty for all americans, especially those that are most vulnerable. ms. jackson lee. i think we can leave this evening with the words that congresswoman sewell has just said, and we thank her so very much, ``do our own work.'' that message should carry for whether we are republicans or democrats or independents. congresswoman sewell, we look forward to doing our own work on the restoration of the voting rights act, section 5, which you are leading and all of us have signed onto. we thank you so much for that eloquent statement and that statement of passion. speaking of passion, it is my privilege to introduce a member who has her own storied civil rights history, someone who has served as the commissioner on the eeoc, the equal employment opportunity commission, and someone who has been in the trenches in civil rights, dealing with voting rights cases, dealing with the right to vote in her own district of columbia. i think she will be the florence nightingale, she will be the champion battler; because i believe that this delegate, congresswoman eleanor holmes norton, will be successful as we fight for the voting rights of the district through her leadership. i yield to the gentlewoman from the district of columbia (ms. norton). ms. norton. i thank my good friend, representative sheila jackson lee, first, for her kind and generous words, but especially today for her leadership of this special order, which is characteristic of her leadership in this congress. i am so pleased that our chair rep. g.k. butterfield has been here and spoken and that we have heard from several other members. i just want to say a few words about this troika of african americans who have written their signatures across our time. you have heard their biographies. i don't want to recount their extraordinary bios, because that is not the only reason we are honoring them with this special order. i just want to say something about what they meant to me. two of them i knew personally: representative louis stokes, whose many years in the congress happened to overlap with my first years here; and, of course, julian bond, whom i knew best. i was not fortunate to know amelia boynton. she may have been the most courageous woman in the movement of the 1960s, who insisted upon facing death, if necessary, in that march from selma to montgomery, and nearly lost her life. i was privileged to be in her presence, as so many members of congress were, when we went to selma this past summer. that was a privilege in and of itself. i was fortunate to know congressman louis stokes, who was a founder of the congressional black caucus long before i served. this was a man of great accomplishment. yes, he can speak about his firsts, and much more. he is the first african american to serve in congress from his hometown of cleveland, as one of the two famous stokes brothers--his brother, carl, the first african american mayor. there is something about the way those men were raised and showed themselves in public life. but it is rep. stokes' career in congress that stands out for me. [[page h6297]] i am not certain there has ever been a more distinguished member of this body. it looks as if when they were trying to ask somebody to do something hard, they looked to louis stokes. he was the first african american to serve on the appropriations committee. my heavens. and then look at the committees he has chaired-- hard ones--the ethics committee, the house permanent select committee on intelligence. then they needed someone to do something else that was difficult, and that was to serve on the iran contra committee, and house select committee on assassinations, nothing was more difficult than that. if you were looking for a member whom the public would trust and who this body would trust, who do you go to? they went to louis stokes. so if you are trying to find out how to serve, recall the life of representative louis stokes. in the district, we recall his life and his work. much of his work was done in the field of health. the howard university louis stokes health science library is named for him here in the district of columbia at howard university. so we will never forget him. of the three, the one i knew best, of course, was my colleague and friend in the student nonviolent coordinating committee, later a client of sorts, and then finally--for 25 years, a constituent. i met julian several years after he founded, along with a handful of other students, the student nonviolent coordinating committee. you have got to understand that that group was as different from any student group since. they were not an offshoot of the civil rights movement. they were a group that stood on its own. i would go down in the summers. i was in law school. sncc was the equivalent of major civil rights organizations, every single one, right alongside them. that is why john lewis got to speak on the march on washington. the reason that sncc stood out is the quality of its leadership in those early years. julian became the spokesman. the reason he was the spokesman was his way with words. he was a poet and a writer, and he could explain what we were doing. he served a most valuable role in these early years. so no one should be surprised that he went after the zenith of the civil rights movement to serve in the georgia house of representatives. what you may be surprised to learn is that when he moved on to the senate, the georgia senate, they refused to seat him because he had endorsed a sncc statement opposing the vietnam war. imagine denying a seat to a member duly elected because of a statement he had made on an issue of great moment. this case was taken all the way to the supreme court. at that point, i was a constitutional lawyer working for the american civil liberties union in new york. i got to write the amicus brief. we took very few amicus briefs to the supreme court, but this one seemed to have the makings of a landmark case. indeed, it did become a landmark case. you do not see anybody denying anyone else the right to sit in his seat--or her seat, today--because of that person's views. the julian bond case settled the matter. what was julian bond to do with the rest of his life? first of all, sncc broke a fair number of people. and though they gave much to the movement, you may not have heard about many of them since. what julian did was to give the rest of his life to the movement. for every single day of his life as a man, after he left public service in the georgia legislature, he was devoted to the civil rights movement he had entered as a very young man. he moved to the district of columbia with his wife, taught at american university and the university of virginia, and became--and this is a matter that makes me chuckle--became the chairman of the naacp. at sncc we thought the naacp was way too conservative for us, the young and foolish. it tells you how julian grew. he grew to be the long-time and devoted chairman of the naacp. he carried out his devotion to civil rights magnificently. throughout his entire life, he remained a major spokesman for the civil rights movement and for progressive causes, his entire life speaking all around the country, carrying the message. when he moved here, i had a black caucus event with julian and with john lewis simply discussing their lives as young men in the civil rights movement. that was to be one of the most memorable moments since i have been in congress. just last february, during black history month, i asked julian to come to howard university, where he and i engaged in an intergenerational conversation with howard students about the police shootings in ferguson, missouri, and new york city and what they meant to this generation and how this generation had to have its own issues and move in its own direction. one of the things we indicated was that for all of the work of the youth of the civil rights movement of our day, we never touched racial profiling. it remained alive and kicking for a new generation, which has taken it on. i am, finally, particularly grateful that when julian moved to the district of columbia, he really became a part of this city, lending his civil rights celebrity to the great cause of this city for full citizenship, for d.c. voting rights, yes, and for statehood for the district of columbia. if you came into the district by taxis a few years ago, there was an advertisement. julian was speaking in a cab, informing you that you were coming to the district of columbia, where the residents were trying to get their full citizenship. wherever he was, he had a way of touching upon the issue of freedom of the day and of the people around him. i will always miss him. this country will always miss him. we are grateful for the life he led. we are grateful, especially, for this congressional black caucus evening devoted to his life and to the lives of two others, very divergent lives but, in other ways, very similar. i thank my good friend, representative jackson lee, again, for her leadership here. {time} 2000 ms. jackson lee. let me thank my good friend, congresswoman eleanor holmes norton, for giving these three legends the vitality and vibrance of a personal story. and to just add to his coming to students at howard university, i want you to know that, at the university of virginia, where he was, he was the most popular professor with people standing in line because the students sensed his passion and commitment, but they sensed his realness. thank you so very much for that very vibrant and informative presentation. mr. speaker, as i introduce this next gentleman, who has his own history, let me quote, again, as i indicated, pope francis from last week, which captures all of what we are saying tonight: to respond in a way which is always humane, just and fraternal. we need to avoid a common temptation nowadays to disregard whatever proves troublesome. let us remember the golden rule: do unto others as you would have them do unto you. the gentleman that i am going to yield to, mr. bobby scott, is a former chairman of the subcommittee on criminal justice, now the ranking member on the committee on education and the workforce, and has led his professional, at least his congressional life, as i have known it, to be a champion for criminal justice reform, but, more importantly, has been one who has said to us over and over again that: we must do unto others as we would like them to do unto us. we must change this criminal justice system to have it be a fair monitoring of how we inspire and restore people's lives. i yield now to the gentleman from virginia, congressman bobby scott. mr. scott of virginia. mr. speaker, i rise to speak in honor of the lives of three civil rights luminaries. i thank the gentlewoman from houston for giving us this opportunity to honor their lives: congressman louis stokes, statesman and educator julian bond, both of whom i knew personally, and activist amelia robinson. these champions of social and economic justice lived their lives just as pope francis challenged members of congress to do. specifically, the pope reminded us of the golden rule--do unto others as you would have them do unto you--and that that rule points us in the right direction. he specifically reminded congress that, if we want opportunities, [[page h6298]] then let us provide opportunities. the lives we honor today are the personification of the pope's call. congressman stokes, the beloved son of the state of ohio, was affectionately called ``lou'' when i served with him in the house. his motto was to aim high, which he did even before he was a member of congress when he argued the supreme court case challenging the abusive stop-and-frisk policies and practices in the terry v. ohio case. lou's integrity was why he was selected to serve on the house select committee on assassinations of president kennedy and dr. martin luther king, jr., and the house investigation of the illegal arm sales during the iran-contra affair and, of course, his service on the ethics committee. his strive for social and economic justice was on full display when he became the first african american to serve on the house appropriations committee. there he directed federal dollars to eradicate injustice and inequities by funding programs such as healthcare facilities for veterans, supporting the national science foundation, and creating the first office of minority health at the national institutes of health. statesman and educator julian bond dedicated his entire life to this cause of social justice and equity. as a founding member of the student nonviolent coordinating committee, or sncc, he led protests against segregation. in 1965, julian bond was elected to the georgia house of representatives, but was denied a seat at the state house because of his opposition to the vietnam war. in 1966, the supreme court ruled 9-0 that the georgia house's refusal to seat julian bond violated the united states constitution. he was subsequently elected for several terms, including service in the georgia senate, despite efforts to redraw his district. he was also the first african american nominated at a major-party convention as a candidate for vice president of the united states. beginning in the 1980s, julian bond taught at several universities, including harvard, drexel, university of virginia, and american university. for more than 20 years at uva and american university, he taught thousands of students about the role of the civil rights movement as a seminal part of america's history. he stated that the ``humanity of all americans is diminished when any group is denied rights granted to others.'' he served as chairman of the naacp from 1998 to 2009. at the 2009 commencement at virginia state university, he told the graduates that, ``we all hope that you do well, but i also hope that you do good.'' activist amelia robinson was among the many foot soldiers who fought for civil rights. as a girl, she championed the right to vote for women. as an adult, she opened her home to martin luther king and james bevel and members of sncc and others to help organize and strategize for civil rights and the right to vote. despite the brutal beating she endured during the march for voting rights in selma, alabama, 50 years ago, she was unwavering in her fight to end segregation and achieve full voting rights for all. reflecting on her life as an activist, she stated that, ``i have been called rabble-rouser, agitator. but because of my fighting, i was able to hand to the entire country the right for people to vote.'' these three american giants--the legislator, the educator, the activist--were all driven to push towards a more just and equal society. i am honored to recognize their lives and the gifts they gave to our nation. again, i want to thank the gentlewoman from houston for organizing this special order so that we could pay appropriate tribute to these fine americans. ms. jackson lee. i thank the gentleman from virginia for citing, in particular, the case law that julian bond particularly generated from the horrific denial of his right to be seated. let me also indicate the importance of members of the congressional black caucus sharing the history of these icons, which i hope my colleagues will appreciate these giants, for many times the history is not remembered or it is not understood. certainly, it is my privilege to now yield to the gentlewoman from ohio, who has firsthand knowledge because she can say that she comes from the state of which lou stokes and carl stokes were native sons. she is, of course, an inspirational leader for her district in columbus, but, more importantly, someone who brings a wealth of experience from her previous service in the ohio state legislature and someone who has a passion for the improvement of lives of all people. i believe, as lou stokes has said, she understands the value and importance of improving the health of african americans and all americans. mr. speaker, it is my privilege to yield to the gentlewoman from columbus, ohio (mrs. beatty). mrs. beatty. thank you so much, congresswoman sheila jackson lee. mr. speaker, tonight the congressional black caucus honors the life and legacy of three civil rights leaders, congressman lou stokes, amelia boynton robinson, and julian bond, who dedicated their lives to making our nation a better place. countless more follow in their footsteps and continue to push for civil rights and voting rights today. we have come to these chambers tonight, mr. speaker, to continue their work as members of the congressional black caucus. we call on congress to immediately pass the voting rights advancement act of 2015. the american people deserve to have real voting rights. thank you, congresswoman sheila jackson lee, not only for your leadership tonight, but for being a leader, for walking in their shoes, and for hosting the congressional black caucus special order honoring three giants. this year is the 50th anniversary of the voting rights act. leaders espoused words in 1965 that still hold true today, words because of the work of these three giants, works like: we have proved that great progress is possible. we know how much still remains to be done. and if our efforts continue, if our will is strong, if our hearts are right, and if courage remains our constant companion, then my fellow americans, i am confident we shall overcome. our objective must be to assure that all americans play by the same rules, and all americans play against the same odds. who amongst us would claim that that is true today? just last week his holiness, pope francis, delivered a historic, profound, provocative address to the joint session of congress. this address reminded us that the nation is ``considered great'' when ``it fosters a culture which enables people to dream of full rights for all their brothers and sisters.'' at the white house, he quoted from martin luther king, to use a telling phrase of the reverend martin luther king: ``we can say that we have defaulted on a promissory note, and now is the time to honor it.'' these three individuals we honor tonight tirelessly contributed to this culture of full rights and equality we are committed to achieving. tonight's roll call: congressman lou stokes. i am honored to be the third african american from ohio to follow in his footsteps, following my mentor and dear friend, stephanie tubbs jones, my colleague, mentor and friend, congresswoman marcia fudge, who said at his footsteps: i don't salute or get excited about a one hit wonder because lou stokes was far from that. lou stokes loved people. he loved the law. he loved the legislative process. he loved his family. and he loved cleveland, ohio. you have heard so much about him, i won't repeat it. i will submit it for the record, congresswoman sheila jackson lee, if that is okay. but i will forever be grateful for his encouragement, his friendship, his wisdom, and his leadership. i can't think of a time or a decision in my life that i didn't pick up the phone and call lou stokes. love you, lou stokes. let me just briefly say we also salute amelia boynton robinson, and much has been said about her. i stand on her shoulders. and then julian bond, another great civil rights icon, whose passion and dedication to equality and justice propelled him to the georgia legislature, the naacp, and the southern poverty law center, which he co-founded. [[page h6299]] his commitment to ending discrimination and injustice continues to inspire us, and his legacy will guide us and the next generation of civil rights leaders and activists to greatness. he, like the other individuals we pay tribute to tonight, helped change this country for the better. thank you, congresswoman sheila jackson lee. thank you to all my colleagues with the congressional black caucus for capturing and reflecting on the lives of three great civil warriors as we took a walk in their footsteps of greatness. tonight the congressional black caucus honors the life and legacy of three civil rights leaders--congressman louis stokes, amelia boynton robinson and julian bond who dedicated their lives to making our nation a better place. countless more follow in their footsteps and continue to push for civil rights and voting rights today. we have come to these chambers to continue their work as members of the congressional black caucus; we call on congress to immediately pass the voting rights advancement act of 2015. the american people deserve to have real voting rights now. thank you congresswoman sheila jackson lee for hosting the cbc's special order hour paying tribute to congressman louis stokes, amelia boynton robinson, and julian bond. this year is the 50th anniversary of voting rights act. leaders . . . espoused words in 1965 that still hold true today. words like: we have proved that great progress is possible. we know how much still remains to be done. and if our efforts continue, and if our will is strong, and if our hearts are right, and if courage remains our constant companion, then my fellow americans, i am confident, we shall overcome. our objective must be to assure that all americans play by the same rules, and all americans play against the same odds. who among us would claim that that is true today? just last week, his holiness pope francis delivered a historic, profound, and provocative address to a joint session of congress. this address reminded us that a nation is ``considered great'' when ``it fosters a culture which enables people to dream of full rights for all their brothers and sisters.'' at the white house, he quoted words from mlk . . . to use a telling phrase of the rev. dr. martin luther king, jr. . . . we can say that we have defaulted on a promissory note and now is the time to honor it. the three individuals we honor tonight tirelessly contributed to this culture of full rights and equality we are committed to achieving. congressman stokes i am honored to be the third african-american from ohio to follow congressman louis stokes who served for 30 years in congress. i am forever grateful for his encouragement, friendship, wisdom, and leadership. he earned a seat on the powerful house appropriations committee, the first person of color to ever do so, and focused on improving housing and urban development for veterans, seniors, and the poor. in 1971, along with our esteemed dean of the house, congressman john conyers, congressman stokes helped found the congressional black caucus to promote economic, educational, and social issues important to african americans: this is a purpose the cbc continues to fulfill to this day, and a purpose i am honored to advance. his indelible mark in history will continue to live on. amelia boynton robinson it is also an honor to pay tribute to amelia boynton robinson--the matriarch of the voting rights movement. as an african-american female serving in the u.s. congress, i stand on the shoulders of mrs. boynton robinson. mrs. boynton robinson helped organize the selma-to-montgomery marches, and walked at the front of the line that fateful day on march 7, 1965, which we now know as ``bloody sunday''. on august 6, 1965, she was the guest of honor at the white house when president johnson signed the voting rights act of 1965 into law. i had the privilege to join mrs. boynton robinson this past march, as thousands of americans marched once again over the edmund pettus bridge, remembering the struggles and recommitting ourselves to restoring voting rights protections, equality, and justice. julian bond julian bond was a civil rights icon whose passion and dedication to equality and justice propelled him to the georgia legislature, the naacp, and the southern poverty law center, which he co-founded. his commitment to ending discrimination and injustice continues to inspire us and his legacy will guide the next generation of civil rights leaders and activists to greatness. he, like the other individuals we pay tribute to tonight, helped changed this country for the better. thank you cbc for capturing and reflecting on the lives of three great civil rights warriors as we took a walk in their footsteps of greatness. ms. jackson lee. congresswoman beatty, thank you for letting us know whose footsteps we walk in and for that celebratory statement. mr. speaker, it is certainly my pleasure to yield to the gentlewoman from the u.s. virgin islands (ms. plaskett), who has come with the expertise of a renowned and trained lawyer, one who is a collaborator. ms. plaskett. thank you so much to my colleague, sheila jackson lee. i want to thank you and the congressional black caucus for this special order hour, a special tribute to the lives and legacy of representative louis stokes, amelia boynton robinson, and julian bond. thank you, ms. jackson lee, for your work here in congress, your tireless efforts to raise awareness to issues which many americans may have forgotten or not given thought to. thank you for your mentorship to us younger members here and your tireless efforts to support not only the people of houston, but the people of america. thank you for allowing us this most important opportunity to pay tribute to these remarkable individuals. mr. speaker, today we gather in reverence and in solemn reflection to honor the lives and legacies of some exceptional people, some exceptional americans, who we have lost in these recent months. these were civil rights activists, statesmen and women, trailblazers, members of a great generation of individuals who gave so much of themselves to the civil rights movement and to the advancement of minorities in our country. they are former congressman louis stokes, former chairman of the naacp and georgia state senator julian bond, and civil rights icon mrs. amelia boynton robinson. a centenarian--mrs. robinson's 110 years of life, that in itself is a great honor--she was dedicated to education, fighting state-sanctioned discriminatory practices against african americans, and voter disenfranchisement. {time} 2015 one can make the argument that her role in selma's civil rights demonstrations, including the infamous march on bloody sunday where she was beaten unconscious by state police, paved the way, through the subsequent passage of the voting rights act of 1965, for both congressman stokes and state representative bond to serve in elected office. as the first african american elected to congress from the state of ohio, congressman stokes was a founding member of the congressional black caucus and spent his 30-year career in congress advocating issues of importance to ohioans and to african americans across the country. julian bond, that great statesman from georgia, was one of 11 african americans elected to the georgia house of representatives after the passage of the civil rights act of 1964 and the voting rights act of 1965. bond served 20 years in both legislative chambers in the state of georgia and served as the first president of the southern poverty law center. he also served as chairman of the naacp. these individuals have impacted the lives of so many african americans and have undoubtedly advanced the rights and interests of minorities in both our states' and our nation's governments. similarly, i would like to just take a moment to recognize two individuals from my own home district of the virgin islands who, like congressman stokes, julian bond, and amelia robinson, have changed the landscape of the virgin islands through their advocacy and education. i would like to recognize a former judge and lieutenant governor of the virgin islands, the late julio a. brady, who, like julian bond and congressman stokes, used his training as an attorney to contribute to his community outside of the courtroom. as a u.s. attorney, judge, and attorney general, judge brady fought to remove barriers of injustice. he was laid to rest this week. like congressman stokes and [[page h6300]] amelia robinson, judge brady's legacy of service will carry on. ursula krigger was also a centenarian, like amelia robinson, and, at age 113 was the oldest living virgin islander until her passing this month. she was a griot, an educator whose longevity afforded a unique perspective of witnessing the modern advancement of our territory. the lives and legacies of these individuals are etched in the annals of our history and their impact forever ingrained in the minds and hearts of the many lives they touched. i am a better person; and, indeed, we are a better nation through the work of these individuals. i have listened to my colleagues tonight speak about representative louis stokes, amelia boynton robinson, and julian bond and the personal impact these individuals had on the work of my colleagues with whom they served and have known personally. understand, that while many like myself may not have had the great honor and pleasure of toiling and working with them shoulder to shoulder in the struggle for civil rights and the advancement of minorities in our country, americans like myself understand and appreciate their sacrifice, and we understand the work that must still be done. we will continue their legacy here today and in congress in the future. thank you so much, congressional black caucus, for this time. and thank you again to my colleague from texas, sheila jackson lee, for the time that i have been afforded to speak on behalf of these great americans. ms. jackson lee. congresswoman plaskett, thank you so very much for laying the groundwork for those who now step into those footsteps, and you have done so with such leadership and certainly such passion. thank you so very much. mr. speaker, what is my time remaining? the speaker pro tempore (mr. russell). the gentlewoman from texas has 2 minutes remaining. ms. jackson lee. let me conclude by thanking the chairman of the congressional black caucus and my colleagues. it is so important for the congressional black caucus to be able to talk to america-- representative butterfield, representative rangel, representative sewell, delegate holmes norton, representative bobby scott, representative joyce beatty, and, of course, congresswoman plaskett--to be able to give life to why we are here representing all of america. we have those special people that, without our voices, would not be able to be heard. i simply want to add these words of the pope, again, to be able to remind everyone why these icons that we are speaking of tonight in the congressional black caucus--46 of us, along with senator booker--have a vital role in this place. as the pope indicated, i would encourage you to keep in mind all those people around us who are trapped in the cycle of poverty. they, too, need to be given hope. the fight against poverty and hunger must be fought constantly on many fronts, especially in its causes. i know that americans today, as in the past, are working to deal with this problem. that is the essence of julian bond, who never stopped giving; that is the essence of amelia boynton robinson, who continued to fight for civil rights up until her death at the age of 104 on august 6, 2015; that is the essence of congressman lou stokes, a legislative giant, the chairman of an appropriations subcommittee, a person who went to public housing and places where children were and told america that your children are dying because they are living in substandard housing, lead poisoning was killing them, which gave me the opportunity, mr. speaker, as i said before, to give a grant to my public housing just this past week on helping with lead poisoning. i worked for lou stokes, and i am very glad to note that, working for him, i can say, truly a gentleman, truly a leader. to this congress, i beg of you, let us look at these icons and celebrate not only their lives, but commit to the passion and justice of their lives, and, as well, the words of pope francis that tell us to do unto others as we would like them to do unto us. mr. speaker, it is my privilege to again thank the members of the congressional black caucus. mr. speaker, it is with a heavy heart that i rise to speak in praise of louis stokes, one of the greatest and most respected members ever to serve in this body, who died on tuesday, august 18, 2015, at his home near cleveland, ohio at the age of 90. it is not unusual in these days for commentators and politicians to talk of something called ``american exceptionalism.'' but what is meant by the term? mr. speaker, one way to understand the term: america is exceptional because it produces and finds persons like louis stokes and affords them the opportunity to utilize their talents to the fullest in the service of their community and their country. think about it: in what other nation does a little african american boy born in 1925 on the east side of cleveland and raised in the outhwaite homes housing project by a mother who worked as a domestic go on to become a lawyer who argues and wins a landmark criminal justice reform case (terry v. ohio, 392 u.s. 1 (1968)) in the united states supreme court; become the first african american elected to congress; is selected to chair the powerful permanent select committee on intelligence, the committee on standards of official conduct, the select committee on assassinations, and an appropriations subcommittee responsible for more than $90 billion annually in federal outlays? yes, america is an exceptional nation and louis stokes was an exceptional human being. mr. speaker, louis stokes was born on february 23, 1925, in cleveland, ohio, to charles and louise cinthy (nee stone) stokes. when he was three years old, his father, who worked in a laundromat, died leaving young louis and his younger brother, carl, to be raised by their mother, who worked as a domestic for affluent families in the wealthy cleveland suburbs. louis stokes' maternal grandmother played a critical role in his life because she took care of the stokes boys while their mother was at work and instilled in them ``the idea that work with your hands is the hard way of doing things'' and encouraged them over and over ``to learn to use their heads.'' louis stokes took the advice to heart so after attending cleveland's central high school and serving in the u.s. army during world war ii, he returned home to attend what is now case western reserve university on the g.i. bill at night while working during the day for the veterans administration and the department of the treasury. after graduating from college in two years where he excelled as a student, louis stokes was accepted for admission to cleveland marshall school of law, from which he graduated in 1953; three years later, his brother carl would also graduate from cleveland marshall school of law and the two of them would go on to form the law firm of stokes & stokes specializing in the areas of civil rights and criminal law. in 1964, the supreme court decided the landmark case of reynolds v. sims, 377 u.s. 533 (1964), which established the principle of ``one person, one vote'' governing the reapportionment of legislative boundaries. the following year, working on behalf of the local branch of the naacp, louis stokes led the legal challenge to the ohio legislature's congressional redistricting, which had the effect of diluting african american voting strength in cleveland. the challenge was unsuccessful in the federal district court but undeterred, louis stokes, joined by charles lucas, an african american republican, successfully appealed the decision to the u.s. supreme court, which in an order handed down in 1967 ruled the redistricting plan unconstitutional and ordered it redrawn, resulting in the creation of ohio's first majority-black district, the 21st congressional district of ohio. ironically, louis stokes would defeat his one-time ally charles lucas to win that seat in november 1968, capturing 75% of the vote, the closest of his 15 successful elections to the u.s. house of representatives. for the next 30 years, from 1969 to 1999, congressman stokes tirelessly fought for his constituents in cleveland and for the best interests of the people of ohio and the united states. louis stokes, a founding member and chair of the congressional black caucus from 1972-74, was the epitome of a public servant. in his second term in congress, he won appointment to the powerful house appropriations committee, where he served for 28 years, later becoming the second african american ``cardinal'' in history when he was selected to chair the va, hud, and related agencies subcommittee. because of the esteem in which he was held by his colleagues and the leadership, louis stokes would also later be selected to chair the house permanent select committee [[page h6301]] on intelligence and the select committee charged with investigating the assassinations of president kennedy and the rev. dr. martin luther king, jr. as chairman of the house ethics committee and a person of unquestioned integrity, louis stokes oversaw the committee's investigation of the corruption scandal known as abscam in 1979-80, which eventually led to convictions of a senator and six house members. mr. speaker, louis stokes perhaps is best known for the national attention he attracted in 1987 as a member of the house select committee to investigate covert arms transactions with iran/(``iran- contra''), the scandal involving the illegal sale of military weapons to the ayatollah khomeini's iran to generate money to fund the illegal contra war in nicaragua. in response to the claim by colonel oliver north that he acted out of patriotism in engineering the illegal weapons sales and diverting the proceeds to fund the contras, a stern louis stokes lectured the misguided colonel north on the rule of law, the true meaning of patriotism, and, in the process american exceptionalism: ``i suppose that what has been most disturbing to me about your testimony is the ugly part. in fact, it has been more than ugly. it has been chilling, and, in fact, frightening. i'm not just talking about your part in this, but the entire scenario, about government officials who plotted and conspired, who set up a straw man, a fall guy. officials who lied, misrepresented and deceived. officials who planned to superimpose upon our government a layer outside of our government, shrouded in secrecy and only accountable to the conspirators. ``colonel, as i sit here this morning looking at you in your uniform, i cannot help but remember that i wore the uniform of this country in world war ii in a segregated army. i wore it as proudly as you do, even though our government required black and white soldiers in the same army to live, sleep, eat and travel separate and apart, while fighting and dying for our country. but because of the rule of law, today's servicemen in america suffer no such indignity. ``my mother, a widow, raised two boys. she had an eighth-grade education. she was a domestic worker who scrubbed floors. one son became the first black mayor of a major american city. the other sits today as chairman of a house intelligence committee. only in america, col. north. only in america. and while i admire your love for america, i hope that you will never forget that others too love america just as much as you do and that others will die for america, just as quick as you will.'' louis stokes never wavered in his belief that america could fulfill the promise of its founders or his dedication to the principles of the declaration of independence and the constitution, stating: ``i'm going to keep on denouncing the inequities of this system, but i'm going to work within it. to go outside the system would be to deny myself--to deny my own existence. i've beaten the system. i've proved it can be done--so have a lot of others. ``but the problem is that a black man has to be extra special to win in this system. why should you have to be a super black to get someplace? that's what's wrong in the society. the ordinary black man doesn't have the same chance as the ordinary white man does.'' mr. speaker, louis stokes' commitment to fairness and equal treatment started long before he was elected to congress. as a lawyer for the naacp, he brought anti-discrimination lawsuits, represented demonstrators arrested in antidiscrimination marches and sit-ins, and took the cases of poor persons charged with crimes. one of those criminal cases he took is known to every lawyer in america and appreciated by every person who cherishes the protections guaranteed by the 4th amendment to the u.s. constitution. i am speaking of the famous case of terry v. ohio, 392 u.s. 1 (1968) won by louis stokes in which the supreme court held that a police officer could ``stop and frisk'' an individual only where he could articulate a reasonable basis that the person was, or was about to be, engaged in criminal activity. as a result of terry v. ohio, a police officer has the right to stop, frisk, and question an individual he reasonably suspects to be engaged in criminal activity, but cannot seize items from that person if the pat down of the suspect's outer clothing does not reveal any weapons posing a threat to the officer's safety. because of louis stokes' exceptional advocacy in terry v. ohio, the right of every individual to secure from unreasonable searches and seizures was preserved while at the same not impeding the ability of law enforcement officers to perform their duties safely. mr. speaker, every citizen benefits from this ruling and communities that have a history of being harassed by law enforcement protected by the constitution from arbitrary and abusive treatment by law enforcement. but the fight for a criminal justice system that respects the rights of all persons is not over. that is why i am proud to be the ranking member of the house judiciary subcommittee on crime, terrorism, homeland security, and investigations and a leader in the effort to reform the criminal justice system so that all persons receive fair and equal treatment regardless of their race, gender, religion, or national origin. louis stokes fought tirelessly to fulfill the promise of the 14th amendment that ``no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.'' it is a fight i am proud to continue today. mr. speaker, louis stokes will be mourned by friends and colleagues on both sides of the aisle who had the privilege to serve alongside him. he was a mentor to me and i will always remember his commanding presence and cherish the assistance he provided me and the example he set for new members to follow. my thoughts and prayers are with his jay, louis' beloved wife of 55 years; to his children, shelly, louis, angela, and lorene; his grandchildren; and the untold thousands of persons who touched and whose lives were touched by one of cleveland's greatest sons. mr. speaker, i ask the house to observe a moment of silence in memory of louis stokes, an exceptional american, and the gentleman from ohio who served in this chamber for three decades with honor, integrity, and distinction. [from cleveland.com] lou stokes put health impacts of substandard housing on the national agenda, and in cleveland: terry allan, dorr dearborn and dave jacobs (opinion) in this file photo from 2012, timothy benner, then 8, looks outside from his maurice avenuue home in cleveland. after timothy and some of his siblings tested positive for lead poisoning, traced to the soil around their home, their mother restricted their outdoor play time. u.s. rep. lou stokes, who died earlier this month, championed national attention and funding to address the problem of lead poisoning in inner- city children. recent stories and opinion pieces have eulogized the many accomplishments of the late u.s. rep. louis stokes, from civil-rights champion to accomplished litigator, statesman and lawmaker. we believe that louis stokes should also be recognized as a national leader who clearly understood the connection between substandard housing and health, and acted to address the problem, at a time when very few did. back in the 1980s, the scope and magnitude of the childhood lead-poisoning problem and its impact on our nation's children was not fully recognized or well understood. subsequent efforts to increase blood screening in early childhood revealed that greater cleveland had among the highest rates of lead poisoning in the country, adding to the compounding disadvantages of children living in poverty in our community and across the united states. some of us have vivid memories from 1991, when congressman stokes held up a newsweek magazine cover story on threats posed to children by lead paint, passionately advocating for the voiceless in our society while educating the community about this silent epidemic. he wanted all of us to understand the debilitating consequences of childhood lead exposure in the home environment and its impact on the life trajectory of these vulnerable kids. congressman stokes turned that message into action, by using his formidiable legislative acumen to establish the first healthy homes program in the country within the u.s. department of housing and urban development. when he recognized in 1998 that young infants in his district were suffering from sometimes fatal lung bleeding associated with water-damaged, moldy homes, he asked hud to address the impact of inner-city homes on children's health. he understood that houses are systems, and that independently addressing lead paint problems, moisture intrusion and mold, injury risks and other housing hazards was inefficient and costly. he also had the vision to recognize that treating children at the hospital, only to release them back into the same substandard home that made them sick, created a vicious circle with major public health consequences. he knew these homes needed to be fixed. the hud office of lead hazard control had shown interest in applying the experience of lead-poisoning prevention to include other health hazards in the home, such as plumbing problems and leaky basements, but lacked the authority. through his vision, the congressman invited us and others to testify at the house subcommittee on hud appropriations to see what could be done. lou stokes convinced his fellow committee members to provide the very first appropriation of $10 million to hud for `healthy homes' prevention programs in low-income housing. his legacy has resulted in millions of homes that are safer and healthier as a direct result of that investment in our children. since that time, [[page h6302]] the hud office of lead hazard control and healthy homes has provided more than $175 million in competitively awarded grants to communities across the nation to investigate and address health hazards in homes. the asthma home-visit program in cleveland that decreases the hospitalization rate of children with asthma, highlighted in the plain dealer in june, is a direct outgrowth of congressman stokes' work. in 2012, hud created the louis stokes healthy homes award and presented the first one to him at the city club of cleveland. when he received the award, he pointed out that much has been achieved and that much more remains to be done. he also said that he really didn't know what all the fuss was about, as he was just a kid who grew up in public housing, who wanted to do the right thing for our children. he was an inspiration to us all. mr. speaker, it is with a heavy heart that i rise to speak in praise of julian bond, one of the leading lights of the civil rights movement, who died on saturday, august 15, 2015, at the age of 75. while julian lost his battle to the illness that claimed his life, it is the struggle for civil rights and human dignity he helped to win that he will forever remembered and revered. horace julian bond was born january 14, 1940 in nashville, tennessee to julia agnes and horace mann bond. julian's father was the first african-american president of lincoln university of pennsylvania, the same institution attended by thurgood marshall and langston hughes who would both go on to make substantial contributions to the civil rights movement and the advancement of african-americans. julian's father later became president of atlanta university and julian decided to attend morehouse college, one of the leading black colleges in the nation. julian bond, who came from a long line of educators, determined at an early age to put his journalistic and organizing talents in service of the cause of civil rights and racial equality. while a student at morehouse college, julian helped found the pegasus, a literary magazine, and led nonviolent student protests against segregation in atlanta parks, restaurants, and movie theaters. mr. speaker, today it is difficult to imagine there once was a time in our country when blacks and whites could not eat together in public restaurants, use the same public restrooms, stay at the same hotels, or attend the same schools. julian bond answered the call to action and put his studies on hold to devote all of his energies and efforts to ending segregation and racial discrimination. mr. speaker, it is not unusual these days for us to think of a champion as someone who receives the highest accolades in sports. julian bond was a champion of the people. his success is measured not in the numbers of trophies, medals, ribbons, and championship banners, but in the number of doors and opportunities he helped to open for those who had been neglected, marginalized, and disenfranchised. julian bond knew that to bring about non-violent social change it was necessary to organize so he co-founded the student nonviolent coordinating committee (sncc). sncc, which organized and mobilized the participation of students and young people in the civil rights movement, conceived the freedom rides that challenged the practice of racial segregation in interstate transportation and the mississippi freedom summer project that undertook the dangerous work of helping african americans register to vote in the state most committed to maintaining white supremacy by any means necessary. sncc was not the first leadership role history and circumstance would call upon julian bond to assume; nor would it be the last. in 1965, after passage of the civil rights act of 1964 and the voting rights act of 1965, julian bond was elected to represent the residents of the 32nd district in georgia house of representatives. but on january 10, 1966, his white colleagues in the georgia house voted 184-12 not to seat him because he had publicly expressed his opposition to the vietnam war. julian bond challenged the refusal of the georgia house to seat him and took his case all the way to the united states supreme court, which ruled in the unanimous decision of bond v. floyd, 385 u.s. 116 (1966), that expressing opposition to the vietnam war was speech protected by the first amendment and directed that he be seated as a duly elected member of the state legislature. julian bond would go on to serve three more terms in the george house, where he co-founded the georgia legislative black caucus, and six terms in the georgia state senate. in 1971, julian bond co-founded and served as president of the southern poverty law center that tracks the actions of hate groups to better inform and prepare communities about the dangers these groups pose. julian bond consistently identified issues of civil inequality and provided solutions by gathering groups of community leaders, professionals, and educators to protect what the laws and policies would not, our basic civil rights. in 1998, julian bond's commitment to justice and equality led him to answer the call to serve and accept the position of chairman of the naacp, a post he held until 2010. julian bond was able to bring the earnest fight to achieve equality into the modern era as he watched african-americans achieve the highest awards in their professions and continued to break down barriers. in november 2008, julian bond witnessed the election of the first african american president of the united states, a feat thought impossible just a decade earlier. mr. speaker, because of trailblazers like julian bond millions of americans gained access to opportunities previously denied to members of their communities. julian bond spent 5 years with sncc, 8 years as president of the southern poverty law center, 12 years as the president of naacp, 20 years as a state representative, and 75 years an unwavering champion of civil rights for all people, including the lgbt community. my thoughts and prayers are with julian's beloved wife pamela, his children and grandchildren; and the untold millions of persons whose lives were touched by one of america's greatest sons. mr. speaker, i ask the house to observe a moment of silence in memory of julian bond, a tireless and eloquent voice for justice, equality, and human dignity who did so much to close the gap between the promise of america's founding ideals and the reality of people's lives. civil rights giant julian bond never stopped giving (posted by edna kane-williams on august 31, 2015) president obama described him as a ``hero'' who ``helped changed this country for the better.'' the rev. jesse jackson called him a ``leader with strength, character.'' naacp chairman roslyn brock said he ``inspired a generation of civil rights leaders.'' teresa sullivan, president of the university of virginia, where he taught history for many years, called him a beloved retired professor who ``shaped the course of history through his life and work.'' how ever you choose to describe julian bond, one thing is for sure: he taught us all how to stand for what we believe. and he believed in freedom, justice and equality. for me, one of the most remarkable attributes of this civil rights giant is the fact that he never stopped giving. even at the time of his brief illness and death on aug. 15 at the age of 75, he was still serving faithfully as chairman emeritus on the naacp board. even after he retired from the professorship at the university of virginia, he continued to mentor and remained a role model for students and others. a writer, poet, television commentator, lecturer and college teacher--and as a former politician--julian bond was one of those rare people whose work became legendary while he was still doing it. in fact, the library of congress once called him a ``living legend.'' and because of the magnitude of his work, he leaves many treasures that will simply keep on giving. uva, where his papers are housed, has announced its goal to establish a julian bond professorship in civil rights and social justice, which ``will continue bond's scholarly legacy.'' there will certainly be many more designations in honor of his life's work. and surely some will rise, seeking to follow in his footsteps. mr. bond believed in young people's ability to take the civil rights and social justice baton and run with it. earlier this year, he told a group of howard university students, ``i think you know what the problems are. you know what the solutions are, and i'm sure we will be glad to help. but don't depend on us to tell you what to do. just go out and do it.'' well, he left an amazing road map. from his pioneering civil rights work as a cofounder of the student nonviolent coordinating committee to all of his work and contributions thereafter, julian bond was a model for anyone who aims to make an impact and leave the world a better place. in that regard, he was a role model for us all. what a life. what a legacy. amelia boynton was born on august 18, 1911, in savannah, georgia. her early activism included holding black voter registration drives in selma, boynton spent her first two years of college at georgia state college (now savannah state university), then transferred to the tuskegee institute (now tuskegee university) in alabama. she graduated from tuskegee with a home economics degree before further pursuing her education at tennessee state university, virginia state university and temple university. in the 1930's, boynton robinson began her activist career by registering african americans to vote. in 1964, she ran for congress to represent alabama. she was the first woman to have run for this democratic seat, and although she did not win, she received 10% of [[page h6303]] votes. as the civil rights movement picked up, boynton asked martin luther king jr., who had witnessed her arrest in january 1965 for seeking to register black voters, to visit selma and empower the community. king accepted, and joined boynton robinson and the southern christian leadership conference in planning the march from selma to montgomery on march 17th, 1965. as approximately 600 marchers walked across the edmund pettus bridge, they were confronted by 200 state troopers and alabama policemen, who shot teargas and beat the non-violent protesters. this horrific event came to be known as bloody sunday. at least 17 protesters were sent to the hospital, including boynton robinson. a picture of her unconscious body lying on the ground after an officer shot tear gas into her throat spread through every news media outlet across the globe, and quickly became a symbol for race relations in the united states at the time. the selma to montgomery march was a pivotal demonstration in the civil rights movement, leading to future victories such as the voting rights acts of 1965 signed by president lyndon b. johnson. amelia boynton robinson was an incredible activist, leader, and woman, and is remembered for her courage and strength throughout the civil rights movement. she worked for equality for all until her last day on this earth. [from the two-way, aug. 26, 2015] (by bill chappell) amelia boynton robinson, survivor of `bloody sunday,' dies at 104 amelia boynton robinson, who went from being beaten on a bridge in selma, ala., in 1965 to being pushed across the bridge in a wheelchair alongside the president of the united states, has died at age 104. her daughter, germaine bowser, confirmed to troy public radio's kyle gassiott that boynton robinson died early wednesday morning. she had been hospitalized after suffering several strokes this summer. born in savannah, ga., boynton robinson was a pioneer in the voting rights movement who took part in the event that came to be known as ``bloody sunday,'' when she and other activists were attacked by state troopers as they tried to march across the edmund pettus bridge. along with rep. john lewis, d-ga., boynton robinson held hands with president obama as the men walked across the bridge this past march, marking the 50th anniversary of the march in selma. the montgomery advertiser reports: ``boynton robinson asked martin luther king jr. to come to selma to mobilize the local community in the civil rights movement. she worked with the southern christian leadership conference and helped plan the selma to montgomery march. her role in the event was recaptured in the movie ``selma,'' where she was portrayed by actress lorraine toussaint. she was invited as a guest of honor to attend the signing of the voting rights act of 1965 by president lyndon b. johnson.'' boynton robinson also ``made history in 1964 as the first african-american to run for congress in alabama,'' alabama public radio reported earlier this year, when the civil rights legend attended obama's 2015 state of the union address in washington, dc. she was the guest of rep. terri sewell, alabama's first elected african-american congresswoman. general leave mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the subject of my special order. what a grand opportunity to cite these great americans: amelia boynton robinson, congressman lou stokes, and julian bond. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from texas? there was no objection. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ms. wilson of florida. mr. speaker, amelia boyton robinson was an american hero who devoted her entire life to the fight for equal rights for all. she was a child suffragette, who alongside her mother, advocated for the women's vote and then as a young woman fought for the right of blacks to have their say at the ballot box. after bold run to represent alabama in congress, mrs. robinson helped organize the bloody sunday march from selma to montgomery. she was hospitalized after being knocked unconscious by a white officer on that perilous day, which left her undaunted and even more determined to fight for the african- american vote. it was my honor to nominate her for a congressional black caucus foundation phoenix award earlier this year, but sadly, she died before i could present it to her. thankfully, however, mrs. robinson was able to share enough stories about her courageous experiences to fill a history book and resonate for generations to come. ____________________",86369
CREC-2015-09-28-pt1-PgH6303,CREC-2015-09-28,114,CHRISTIANS UNDER ATTACK,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6303-H6305] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CHRISTIANS UNDER ATTACK The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) for 30 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I come before this honorable House with an issue that has been rather heartbreaking for so many of us for so long now: In The Middle East, the cradle of Christianity, where it started 2,000 years ago based on the Judeo principles from thousands of years before that, there has been a massive onslaught. Against Jews, it has been going on for some time; but especially in the last several years, it has become untenable for Christians. In an article by Debra Heine, September 20, my sister's birthday, she wrote about ``2,000 Years of Christian Civilization Destroyed on Obama's Watch.'' It says this in the article: ``The Islamic State has managed to destroy two thousand years of Christian civilizations in the Middle East in just a couple of years, Lt. Col. Ralph Peters noted on `The O'Reilly Factor' last week. And he placed the blame squarely on President Obama's . . . policy. ``ISIS has been spreading across the Middle East like a plague of locusts, and as they have spread, they have targeted religious minorities, particularly Christians, for destruction. In Syria, tens of thousands of Assyrian Christians have been attacked and displaced. ``They are forgotten refugees.'' Mr. Speaker, I have met with Christians and Christian leaders from Syria, and the stories they tell and the horrors they talk about, the inhumanity to man that is being inflicted upon Christians in that area is just untenable. It is unconscionable. Women--talk about a war on women. If they are Christian women, it is absolutely horrendous. I ran into the same problem in meeting with family members in Nigeria of girls that were kidnapped by radical Islamists, Boko Haram. That was in Nigeria. I would be interested to talk to the President of Togo tomorrow. I have been to his country before. I have seen the poverty, and I have seen the affliction. But in the Middle East, Christians are not even allowed to be in the area where the Apostle Paul walked. The Apostle Paul planted churches where Christian missionaries were, along the times right after Jesus resurrected. Right in the early days of the church, churches were planted. And now, while the United States is said to be the sole superpower, Christians are being persecuted in greater numbers around the world than ever in history. If there is a God who loves Christians, loves all people but has an affinity for Jews and Christians, then there would have to be a price for any nation that allows this to go on. This article goes on: A Catholic priest who visited Kurdish Iraq last fall described the wounded souls of the Christians who had taken refuge there. They had been forced from their homes in northern Iraq in the summer of 2014. `` `Without question, we are talking about genocide here. Genocide is not only when the people are killed, but also when the soul of a people is destroyed. And that is what is happening in Iraq now,' said Fr. Andrzej Halemba, head of Aid to the Church in Need's Middle East section, said October 28. `It is the most tragic thing that I have ever experienced.' '' This is from the priest. The priest goes on: `` `I have seen people who have been deeply wounded in their soul. In the various crises in this world, I have often seen people who have lost everything. But in Iraq, there are Christians who have had to leave everything and take flight three or four times. They can see no light at the end of the tunnel.' ``Last spring, hundreds of Assyrian Christians fled to Lebanon after ISIS jihadists stormed their villages in Syria's northeastern province of Hasakeh. ``Members of Lebanon's Assyrian community did their best to welcome the new refugees, but the displacement had left them traumatized. `` `The villages of Khabur are empty now, there is no one left except some fighters,' lamented Chorbishop Yatron Koliana, as he oversaw the distribution at his diocese.'' [[Page H6304]] Mr. Speaker, this is tragic. Christian villages 2,000 years old, destroyed. Nothing left but some people trying to fight for just the ground that they are fighting on that once was their home. `` `Our people have experienced a great tragedy in Syria' . . . `They are depressed. Some of them have chronic illnesses. Their lives are difficult.' `` `How can we be comfortable living on aid?' asked 50-year-old Simaan, who fled his village Tal Hormuz. ``He railed against what he called international indifference to the plight of Assyrians under attack by ISIS in Syria and neighboring Iraq. `` `The whole world, from the U.N. to the United States and Russia, is responsible' . . . `They' ''--talking about ISIS--`` `have destroyed our whole civilization . . . and the world is watching.' '' {time} 2030 We hear so many sad stories. Christians are being persecuted on our watch, and we are not talking enough about it. The President certainly isn't. He tells us that we need to take tens or hundreds of thousands of more Muslim refugees. What about the Christians and the massive extermination of churches in the Middle East under this administration? We get it. The Constitution gives the President wide authority and wide latitude on foreign policy. Congress has some say because we can appropriate or defund what the President is doing--if we have leadership with courage to do that. This article goes on: ``In July, 4,000 more Assyrian Christian families were among the 120,000 people who fled Hasakah to escape ISIS forces who had entered the city looking to carry out a mass ethno- religious slaughter. ``Fleeing Muslim persecution, Christian refugees are often targeted and persecuted anew by fleeing Muslim refugees.'' The International Business Times reported: ``Italian police have arrested 15 Muslim immigrants in Palermo, for allegedly having thrown Christian refugees off the rubber boat that was taking them to Italy after a fight for `religious reasons,' according to media reports. ``Those arrested--from Mali, Guinea and Ivory Coast--were part of a group of 100 that were rescued off the Libyan coast by the Italian coast guard. ``The Archbishop of Canterbury, recently warned British Prime Minister David Cameron that his government's refugee policy was discriminating against Christians because Christians are not among the refugees being helped in U.N. camps. They are not in the U.N. camps because they fear persecution from radicalized Muslim refugees. ``The Most Reverend Justin Welby reportedly met the Prime Minister earlier this month with concerns that Christians in Syria will be largely excluded from the 20,000 refugees due to come to the U.K. over the next 5 years. ``The government, in line with European Union policy, is committed to taking in refugees from U.N. camps in Syria and neighboring countries. It cannot discriminate in favor of any one religious group. But the Archbishop has raised concerns that Christians have avoided refugee camps because of fears of persecution from rogue Islamist groups operating inside refugee camps. ``In a speech in the House of Lords last Monday, Archbishop Welby said that, `within the camps there is significant intimidation and radicalization, and many particularly of the Christian population who have been forced to flee are unable to be in the camps.' ``He went on: `What is the government's policy of reaching out to those who are not actually in the camps?' '' Lord Carey, who wrote in the Telegraph about his concern of the plight of Christians, wrote: `` `The frustration for those of us who have been calling for compassion for Syrian victims for many months is that the Christian community is yet again left at the bottom of the heap.' `` `Mr. Cameron's policy inadvertently discriminates against the very Christian communities most victimized by the inhuman butchers of the so-called Islamic State.' `` `Christians are not to be found in the U.N. camps, because they have been attacked and targeted by Islamists and driven from them. They are seeking refuge in private homes, church buildings, and with neighbors and family.' ``Refugees who want to come to the United States will also be required to apply through the U.N. `` `A combination of European cowardice and awful American foreign policy has led to a mass Muslim migration that will affect the whole world.' '' ``Lt. Col. Ralph Peters disagreed somewhat with that assessment.'' He said, `` `I think you were much, much too soft on President Obama and a bit too hard on the E.U.' . . .`If America doesn't lead, it doesn't happen.' '' He went on to say: `` `Just look at a map of the Middle East . . . on George W. Bush's last day in office. There is broad peace across the Middle East and North Africa, Iraq was finally convalescing, and . . . Obama promptly, to please his America-hating base, abandons Iraq, backs the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, gets rid of Qaddafi without a plan for what goes after, threatens Assad . . . then does nothing, doesn't listen to the intelligence community when for years they are telling him about the Islamic State coming--then tries to blame the intelligence community, and launches feckless airstrikes. The combination of his fecklessness and cowardice, his rhetorical bravado and utter incompetence are responsible.' '' He goes on: `` `No. Listen to this. Two thousand years of Christian civilization destroyed on his watch . . . That's on Obama. When America doesn't lead, nothing happens.' '' Well, it is not just on President Obama. I am sure he is mainly responsible for our foreign policy, but we need to stand up to the President. When Iran is out there saying, as they have in the last couple of weeks, that with the $100 billion, $150 billion that President Obama is going to see to Iran getting quickly, and the hundreds of billions of dollars that will flow in subsequent years, they were already announcing they are going to increase their support for Hamas and Hezbollah as they kill Americans, continue to kill Christians, and continue to kill moderate Muslims who are not radicalized, at what point is Congress responsible for not standing up to the President? Mr. Speaker, I would submit that one very important point has come, and right now it is up to the United States Senate to have a backbone on behalf of the millions that stand to be persecuted and killed by the money that they are going to allow to go to Iran by failing to do what they could to stop this world atrocity. There is no question in reasonable, intelligent minds that the Iran deal is a treaty. It is a treaty as anticipated by the Founders. It is a treaty as referred to in the Constitution, article II, section 2, second paragraph, and it requires a vote of two-thirds of the Senate present to go along with it in order for it to be effective. Yes, the Corker bill tried to amend the Constitution. Legislation can't amend the Constitution. Once it is clear--as it is--that the Iran deal is a treaty, then we need desperately to have people in the Senate stand up--some of them have--make clear this is a treaty; it requires two-thirds in order to approve it or it is not ratified, it is not effective, and the President is not allowed to release the 100-plus billion, $150 billion to Iran that will be used for atrocities, especially toward America, toward Christians, toward moderate nonradicalized Muslims, toward Jews, and toward Israel. There is a real responsibility here. It may take courage--I am sure it will--for the Senate to stand up and the Senate majority leader to stand up and say: Sorry, Mr. President, the Iran deal is a treaty. We have listed in our letter to the majority leader in the Senate some of the bases, it is spelled out in our resolution that we filed and talked about here on the floor, it is clearly a treaty. The end of John Quincy Adams' oral argument that capped a couple of days of oral argument in the case can be found online. He was afraid that if he did not do an adequate job as a lawyer, those Africans that he was representing that had been captured by other Africans and sold into slavery, sent to the Caribbean, and then put on the Spanish ship the Amistad, they were able to overtake and overpower the Spanish and take charge of the ship. They landed in America. The lawsuit was over whether or not they were free Africans or whether they were property of the Spanish. [[Page H6305]] I can understand the fear that John Quincy Adams must have had as he stood downstairs in the Old Supreme Court Chamber. One of the Justices had died one night during oral argument, not while he was actually arguing. That final day he knew if he didn't do an adequate job, his clients would wear chains and their children would wear chains all because he didn't do an adequate job as their lawyer. So he finished his oral argument by calling the names of Justices of the Supreme Court who had been on the Supreme Court but had passed away. Chief Justice, Justices, he knew them. He called their names: The Justice that started this case, where is he? Where are all these Justices? Where is the Solicitor General that argued before me? This is around 1821. This is in the late 1830s. He is now arguing in the Supreme Court in their Chamber downstairs. After going through all the Supreme Court Justices that had passed away, he finishes basically by saying they have gone to meet their Judge, and the biggest question is when they met their Maker, their Judge, did they hear the words: ``Well done, good and faithful servant?'' It is very clear, send a message to the Supreme Court. Think about it, Justices. If you died tonight like the other Judge just died in the last couple of nights and you go to meet your Maker, do you want the last thing you did to be having sent wonderful African people out in chains that they would wear and their children would wear--possibly their children and their children--all because you didn't do the right thing as a judge? He won the case, as well he should. I can't help but wonder if John Quincy Adams were here today arguing on behalf of Christian communities all over the Middle East that have been destroyed, refugees that have been sent running, Jews that can no longer populate the area because of threats and violence upon them, and he saw that the United States that he had been President of and was in the House of Representatives after having been President, if he would not be mortified, if he would not challenge us today: Do we want to meet our Maker, our Judge, and we saw and heard about the plight of Christians, Jews, and moderate Muslims around the Middle East and North Africa just being slaughtered, women being raped and torn apart, brutalized in unthinkable ways, and we turned a blind eye to that and said that we are going to bring in massive numbers of refugees who are Muslim, 72 percent of which are male, and we have been told by radicals that they are going to make sure that there are people that want to kill and destroy more Christians, more Jews, more of America, and we are going to bring them in without proper vetting--because you can't vet them properly--all while Christians, Jews, and moderate Muslims are being slaughtered and overrun all through the Middle East as we are credited with being the superpower in the world? {time} 2045 Yet, also, these last few days, the U.N.--where we pay far more than anybody even comes close to in order to keep it going as they continue to become more and more anti-Semitic, anti-Israeli, and anti-American-- they entertain the largest supporter of terrorism in the world, the leader of Iran. And he says this in part, the leader of Iran, the President Rouhani: If we did not have U.S. military invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq and the United States' unwarranted support for the inhumane actions of the Zionist regime against the oppressed nation of Palestine, today the terrorists would not have an excuse for the justification of their crimes. I am taking this from an article by Julian Hattem, 9-28-15, which is interesting. We have heard that throughout the United States, if we just hadn't gone into Iraq, if we hadn't gone into Afghanistan, if we hadn't gone into Afghanistan with the 300 Americans that we embedded-- about 300--we embedded and let the Afghans destroy the Taliban by February of 2002, then we became an overwhelming occupying force in Afghanistan--but at least by February of 2002, if we hadn't gone in and helped them, the Taliban would still be completely controlling Afghanistan. That is the way it is. Now, we went astray when we became occupiers, and this President has only tripled the number of deaths in Afghanistan, even though the war is supposedly over. Over tripled the number of American deaths, even though the real war was during President Bush, because of this President's rules of engagement and disastrous foreign policy. But think about it. This is the head, the President of Iran. He is telling the UN and the world that, if it weren't for the United States' invasion in Afghanistan and in Iraq, there wouldn't be any American terrorists. Mr. Speaker, why in the world should the U.N. listen to a man that is this big a liar or is this stupid? Because you don't have to be all that bright to understand September 11 of 2001 happened before we sent 300 or so into Afghanistan to help them destroy the Taliban and before we went in and took out a brutal dictator in Iraq. In fact, the planning of 9-11-2001 happened during the Clinton administration on President Clinton's watch. And for people that are fools or liars like Rouhani and they don't know or are just lying about it, during the Clinton administration, President Clinton's policies were to run and help persecuted Muslims whenever we found them around the world. And while we were busy helping Muslims, Western Asia, Eastern Europe, wherever we could help them, they were planning the attack on New York City and Washington, D.C., and hoping to wipe out the entire American government here in Washington, D.C. And but for the heroic act of people on a plane that took it down in Pennsylvania, they may well have. We don't need to hear any of these lies about, oh, if America just hadn't invaded Afghanistan and Iraq, regardless of whether you agree with what President Bush ordered with Iraq, the fact is 9/11 was a terrorist attack before and so was the attack on the USS Cole and so were the attacks on our embassies around the world during the 1990s and so was the first World Trade Center attack in 1993 that apparently had some planning back during the former President Bush's administration. And that was an administration that stopped a brutal dictator, Saddam Hussein, who had raided another Muslim country, and we went in and helped Kuwait get their country back. We went to help the Muslims. And how do they reward us? To plan an attack to try to take down the World Trade Centers in '93. It is very clear Christianity, Judaism, Israel, all were under attack and so was America. And our enemies can't believe how stupid Americans are because we are going to reward the biggest supporter of terrorism in the world--Iran--with $100 to $150 billion that they are already saying they are going to use to help Hamas and Hezbollah kill more Christians, more Jews, help wipe out Israel, help the attack against the Great Satan, the United States. Mr. Speaker, it is time for people in the United States Government to stand up and help correct the wayward policies of this administration. We start by having the United States Senate in one voice say the Iranian deal is a treaty and we are taking a vote on it and cloture is set aside with 51 votes. And they won't get the two-thirds to ratify it. It will not become effective against the United States. And thank God we will then have stopped the continued persecution of Christians, moderate Muslims, Jews, Israelis, and the United States, instead of rewarding them and helping them take us out. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair reminds Members to avoid engaging in personalities toward the President. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6303-H6305] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CHRISTIANS UNDER ATTACK The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) for 30 minutes. Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I come before this honorable House with an issue that has been rather heartbreaking for so many of us for so long now: In The Middle East, the cradle of Christianity, where it started 2,000 years ago based on the Judeo principles from thousands of years before that, there has been a massive onslaught. Against Jews, it has been going on for some time; but especially in the last several years, it has become untenable for Christians. In an article by Debra Heine, September 20, my sister's birthday, she wrote about ``2,000 Years of Christian Civilization Destroyed on Obama's Watch.'' It says this in the article: ``The Islamic State has managed to destroy two thousand years of Christian civilizations in the Middle East in just a couple of years, Lt. Col. Ralph Peters noted on `The O'Reilly Factor' last week. And he placed the blame squarely on President Obama's . . . policy. ``ISIS has been spreading across the Middle East like a plague of locusts, and as they have spread, they have targeted religious minorities, particularly Christians, for destruction. In Syria, tens of thousands of Assyrian Christians have been attacked and displaced. ``They are forgotten refugees.'' Mr. Speaker, I have met with Christians and Christian leaders from Syria, and the stories they tell and the horrors they talk about, the inhumanity to man that is being inflicted upon Christians in that area is just untenable. It is unconscionable. Women--talk about a war on women. If they are Christian women, it is absolutely horrendous. I ran into the same problem in meeting with family members in Nigeria of girls that were kidnapped by radical Islamists, Boko Haram. That was in Nigeria. I would be interested to talk to the President of Togo tomorrow. I have been to his country before. I have seen the poverty, and I have seen the affliction. But in the Middle East, Christians are not even allowed to be in the area where the Apostle Paul walked. The Apostle Paul planted churches where Christian missionaries were, along the times right after Jesus resurrected. Right in the early days of the church, churches were planted. And now, while the United States is said to be the sole superpower, Christians are being persecuted in greater numbers around the world than ever in history. If there is a God who loves Christians, loves all people but has an affinity for Jews and Christians, then there would have to be a price for any nation that allows this to go on. This article goes on: A Catholic priest who visited Kurdish Iraq last fall described the wounded souls of the Christians who had taken refuge there. They had been forced from their homes in northern Iraq in the summer of 2014. `` `Without question, we are talking about genocide here. Genocide is not only when the people are killed, but also when the soul of a people is destroyed. And that is what is happening in Iraq now,' said Fr. Andrzej Halemba, head of Aid to the Church in Need's Middle East section, said October 28. `It is the most tragic thing that I have ever experienced.' '' This is from the priest. The priest goes on: `` `I have seen people who have been deeply wounded in their soul. In the various crises in this world, I have often seen people who have lost everything. But in Iraq, there are Christians who have had to leave everything and take flight three or four times. They can see no light at the end of the tunnel.' ``Last spring, hundreds of Assyrian Christians fled to Lebanon after ISIS jihadists stormed their villages in Syria's northeastern province of Hasakeh. ``Members of Lebanon's Assyrian community did their best to welcome the new refugees, but the displacement had left them traumatized. `` `The villages of Khabur are empty now, there is no one left except some fighters,' lamented Chorbishop Yatron Koliana, as he oversaw the distribution at his diocese.'' [[Page H6304]] Mr. Speaker, this is tragic. Christian villages 2,000 years old, destroyed. Nothing left but some people trying to fight for just the ground that they are fighting on that once was their home. `` `Our people have experienced a great tragedy in Syria' . . . `They are depressed. Some of them have chronic illnesses. Their lives are difficult.' `` `How can we be comfortable living on aid?' asked 50-year-old Simaan, who fled his village Tal Hormuz. ``He railed against what he called international indifference to the plight of Assyrians under attack by ISIS in Syria and neighboring Iraq. `` `The whole world, from the U.N. to the United States and Russia, is responsible' . . . `They' ''--talking about ISIS--`` `have destroyed our whole civilization . . . and the world is watching.' '' {time} 2030 We hear so many sad stories. Christians are being persecuted on our watch, and we are not talking enough about it. The President certainly isn't. He tells us that we need to take tens or hundreds of thousands of more Muslim refugees. What about the Christians and the massive extermination of churches in the Middle East under this administration? We get it. The Constitution gives the President wide authority and wide latitude on foreign policy. Congress has some say because we can appropriate or defund what the President is doing--if we have leadership with courage to do that. This article goes on: ``In July, 4,000 more Assyrian Christian families were among the 120,000 people who fled Hasakah to escape ISIS forces who had entered the city looking to carry out a mass ethno- religious slaughter. ``Fleeing Muslim persecution, Christian refugees are often targeted and persecuted anew by fleeing Muslim refugees.'' The International Business Times reported: ``Italian police have arrested 15 Muslim immigrants in Palermo, for allegedly having thrown Christian refugees off the rubber boat that was taking them to Italy after a fight for `religious reasons,' according to media reports. ``Those arrested--from Mali, Guinea and Ivory Coast--were part of a group of 100 that were rescued off the Libyan coast by the Italian coast guard. ``The Archbishop of Canterbury, recently warned British Prime Minister David Cameron that his government's refugee policy was discriminating against Christians because Christians are not among the refugees being helped in U.N. camps. They are not in the U.N. camps because they fear persecution from radicalized Muslim refugees. ``The Most Reverend Justin Welby reportedly met the Prime Minister earlier this month with concerns that Christians in Syria will be largely excluded from the 20,000 refugees due to come to the U.K. over the next 5 years. ``The government, in line with European Union policy, is committed to taking in refugees from U.N. camps in Syria and neighboring countries. It cannot discriminate in favor of any one religious group. But the Archbishop has raised concerns that Christians have avoided refugee camps because of fears of persecution from rogue Islamist groups operating inside refugee camps. ``In a speech in the House of Lords last Monday, Archbishop Welby said that, `within the camps there is significant intimidation and radicalization, and many particularly of the Christian population who have been forced to flee are unable to be in the camps.' ``He went on: `What is the government's policy of reaching out to those who are not actually in the camps?' '' Lord Carey, who wrote in the Telegraph about his concern of the plight of Christians, wrote: `` `The frustration for those of us who have been calling for compassion for Syrian victims for many months is that the Christian community is yet again left at the bottom of the heap.' `` `Mr. Cameron's policy inadvertently discriminates against the very Christian communities most victimized by the inhuman butchers of the so-called Islamic State.' `` `Christians are not to be found in the U.N. camps, because they have been attacked and targeted by Islamists and driven from them. They are seeking refuge in private homes, church buildings, and with neighbors and family.' ``Refugees who want to come to the United States will also be required to apply through the U.N. `` `A combination of European cowardice and awful American foreign policy has led to a mass Muslim migration that will affect the whole world.' '' ``Lt. Col. Ralph Peters disagreed somewhat with that assessment.'' He said, `` `I think you were much, much too soft on President Obama and a bit too hard on the E.U.' . . .`If America doesn't lead, it doesn't happen.' '' He went on to say: `` `Just look at a map of the Middle East . . . on George W. Bush's last day in office.

The Apostle Paul planted churches where Christian missionaries were, along the times right after Jesus resurrected. Right in the early days of the church, churches were planted. And now, while the United States is said to be the sole superpower, Christians are being persecuted in greater numbers around the world than ever in history. If there is a God who loves Christians, loves all people but has an affinity for Jews and Christians, then there would have to be a price for any nation that allows this to go on. This article goes on: A Catholic priest who visited Kurdish Iraq last fall described the wounded souls of the Christians who had taken refuge there. They had been forced from their homes in northern Iraq in the summer of 2014. `` `Without question, we are talking about genocide here. Genocide is not only when the people are killed, but also when the soul of a people is destroyed. And that is what is happening in Iraq now,' said Fr. Andrzej Halemba, head of Aid to the Church in Need's Middle East section, said October 28. `It is the most tragic thing that I have ever experienced.' '' This is from the priest. The priest goes on: `` `I have seen people who have been deeply wounded in their soul. In the various crises in this world, I have often seen people who have lost everything. But in Iraq, there are Christians who have had to leave everything and take flight three or four times. They can see no light at the end of the tunnel.' ``Last spring, hundreds of Assyrian Christians fled to Lebanon after ISIS jihadists stormed their villages in Syria's northeastern province of Hasakeh. ``Members of Lebanon's Assyrian community did their best to welcome the new refugees, but the displacement had left them traumatized. `` `The villages of Khabur are empty now, there is no one left except some fighters,' lamented Chorbishop Yatron Koliana, as he oversaw the distribution at his diocese.'' [[Page H6304]] Mr. Speaker, this is tragic. Christian villages 2,000 years old, destroyed. Nothing left but some people trying to fight for just the ground that they are fighting on that once was their home. `` `Our people have experienced a great tragedy in Syria' . . . `They are depressed. Some of them have chronic illnesses. Their lives are difficult.' `` `How can we be comfortable living on aid?' asked 50-year-old Simaan, who fled his village Tal Hormuz. ``He railed against what he called international indifference to the plight of Assyrians under attack by ISIS in Syria and neighboring Iraq. `` `The whole world, from the U.N. to the United States and Russia, is responsible' . . . `They' ''--talking about ISIS--`` `have destroyed our whole civilization . . . and the world is watching.' '' {time} 2030 We hear so many sad stories. Christians are being persecuted on our watch, and we are not talking enough about it. The President certainly isn't. He tells us that we need to take tens or hundreds of thousands of more Muslim refugees. What about the Christians and the massive extermination of churches in the Middle East under this administration? We get it. The Constitution gives the President wide authority and wide latitude on foreign policy. Congress has some say because we can appropriate or defund what the President is doing--if we have leadership with courage to do that. This article goes on: ``In July, 4,000 more Assyrian Christian families were among the 120,000 people who fled Hasakah to escape ISIS forces who had entered the city looking to carry out a mass ethno- religious slaughter. ``Fleeing Muslim persecution, Christian refugees are often targeted and persecuted anew by fleeing Muslim refugees.'' The International Business Times reported: ``Italian police have arrested 15 Muslim immigrants in Palermo, for allegedly having thrown Christian refugees off the rubber boat that was taking them to Italy after a fight for `religious reasons,' according to media reports. ``Those arrested--from Mali, Guinea and Ivory Coast--were part of a group of 100 that were rescued off the Libyan coast by the Italian coast guard. ``The Archbishop of Canterbury, recently warned British Prime Minister David Cameron that his government's refugee policy was discriminating against Christians because Christians are not among the refugees being helped in U.N. camps. They are not in the U.N. camps because they fear persecution from radicalized Muslim refugees. ``The Most Reverend Justin Welby reportedly met the Prime Minister earlier this month with concerns that Christians in Syria will be largely excluded from the 20,000 refugees due to come to the U.K. over the next 5 years. ``The government, in line with European Union policy, is committed to taking in refugees from U.N. camps in Syria and neighboring countries. It cannot discriminate in favor of any one religious group. But the Archbishop has raised concerns that Christians have avoided refugee camps because of fears of persecution from rogue Islamist groups operating inside refugee camps. ``In a speech in the House of Lords last Monday, Archbishop Welby said that, `within the camps there is significant intimidation and radicalization, and many particularly of the Christian population who have been forced to flee are unable to be in the camps.' ``He went on: `What is the government's policy of reaching out to those who are not actually in the camps?' '' Lord Carey, who wrote in the Telegraph about his concern of the plight of Christians, wrote: `` `The frustration for those of us who have been calling for compassion for Syrian victims for many months is that the Christian community is yet again left at the bottom of the heap.' `` `Mr. Cameron's policy inadvertently discriminates against the very Christian communities most victimized by the inhuman butchers of the so-called Islamic State.' `` `Christians are not to be found in the U.N. camps, because they have been attacked and targeted by Islamists and driven from them. They are seeking refuge in private homes, church buildings, and with neighbors and family.' ``Refugees who want to come to the United States will also be required to apply through the U.N. `` `A combination of European cowardice and awful American foreign policy has led to a mass Muslim migration that will affect the whole world.' '' ``Lt. Col. Ralph Peters disagreed somewhat with that assessment.'' He said, `` `I think you were much, much too soft on President Obama and a bit too hard on the E.U.' . . .`If America doesn't lead, it doesn't happen.' '' He went on to say: `` `Just look at a map of the Middle East . . . on George W. Bush's last day in office. There is broad peace across the Middle East and North Africa, Iraq was finally convalescing, and . . . Obama promptly, to please his America-hating base, abandons Iraq, backs the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, gets rid of Qaddafi without a plan for what goes after, threatens Assad . . . then does nothing, doesn't listen to the intelligence community when for years they are telling him about the Islamic State coming--then tries to blame the intelligence community, and launches feckless airstrikes. The combination of his fecklessness and cowardice, his rhetorical bravado and utter incompetence are responsible.' '' He goes on: `` `No. Listen to this. Two thousand years of Christian civilization destroyed on his watch . . . That's on Obama. When America doesn't lead, nothing happens.' '' Well, it is not just on President Obama. I am sure he is mainly responsible for our foreign policy, but we need to stand up to the President. When Iran is out there saying, as they have in the last couple of weeks, that with the $100 billion, $150 billion that President Obama is going to see to Iran getting quickly, and the hundreds of billions of dollars that will flow in subsequent years, they were already announcing they are going to increase their support for Hamas and Hezbollah as they kill Americans, continue to kill Christians, and continue to kill moderate Muslims who are not radicalized, at what point is Congress responsible for not standing up to the President? Mr. Speaker, I would submit that one very important point has come, and right now it is up to the United States Senate to have a backbone on behalf of the millions that stand to be persecuted and killed by the money that they are going to allow to go to Iran by failing to do what they could to stop this world atrocity. There is no question in reasonable, intelligent minds that the Iran deal is a treaty. It is a treaty as anticipated by the Founders. It is a treaty as referred to in the Constitution, article II, section 2, second paragraph, and it requires a vote of two-thirds of the Senate present to go along with it in order for it to be effective. Yes, the Corker bill tried to amend the Constitution. Legislation can't amend the Constitution. Once it is clear--as it is--that the Iran deal is a treaty, then we need desperately to have people in the Senate stand up--some of them have--make clear this is a treaty; it requires two-thirds in order to approve it or it is not ratified, it is not effective, and the President is not allowed to release the 100-plus billion, $150 billion to Iran that will be used for atrocities, especially toward America, toward Christians, toward moderate nonradicalized Muslims, toward Jews, and toward Israel. There is a real responsibility here. It may take courage--I am sure it will--for the Senate to stand up and the Senate majority leader to stand up and say: Sorry, Mr. President, the Iran deal is a treaty. We have listed in our letter to the majority leader in the Senate some of the bases, it is spelled out in our resolution that we filed and talked about here on the floor, it is clearly a treaty. The end of John Quincy Adams' oral argument that capped a couple of days of oral argument in the case can be found online. He was afraid that if he did not do an adequate job as a lawyer, those Africans that he was representing that had been captured by other Africans and sold into slavery, sent to the Caribbean, and then put on the Spanish ship the Amistad, they were able to overtake and overpower the Spanish and take charge of the ship. They landed in America. The lawsuit was over whether or not they were free Africans or whether they were property of the Spanish. [[Page H6305]] I can understand the fear that John Quincy Adams must have had as he stood downstairs in the Old Supreme Court Chamber. One of the Justices had died one night during oral argument, not while he was actually arguing. That final day he knew if he didn't do an adequate job, his clients would wear chains and their children would wear chains all because he didn't do an adequate job as their lawyer. So he finished his oral argument by calling the names of Justices of the Supreme Court who had been on the Supreme Court but had passed away. Chief Justice, Justices, he knew them. He called their names: The Justice that started this case, where is he? Where are all these Justices? Where is the Solicitor General that argued before me? This is around 1821. This is in the late 1830s. He is now arguing in the Supreme Court in their Chamber downstairs. After going through all the Supreme Court Justices that had passed away, he finishes basically by saying they have gone to meet their Judge, and the biggest question is when they met their Maker, their Judge, did they hear the words: ``Well done, good and faithful servant?'' It is very clear, send a message to the Supreme Court. Think about it, Justices. If you died tonight like the other Judge just died in the last couple of nights and you go to meet your Maker, do you want the last thing you did to be having sent wonderful African people out in chains that they would wear and their children would wear--possibly their children and their children--all because you didn't do the right thing as a judge? He won the case, as well he should. I can't help but wonder if John Quincy Adams were here today arguing on behalf of Christian communities all over the Middle East that have been destroyed, refugees that have been sent running, Jews that can no longer populate the area because of threats and violence upon them, and he saw that the United States that he had been President of and was in the House of Representatives after having been President, if he would not be mortified, if he would not challenge us today: Do we want to meet our Maker, our Judge, and we saw and heard about the plight of Christians, Jews, and moderate Muslims around the Middle East and North Africa just being slaughtered, women being raped and torn apart, brutalized in unthinkable ways, and we turned a blind eye to that and said that we are going to bring in massive numbers of refugees who are Muslim, 72 percent of which are male, and we have been told by radicals that they are going to make sure that there are people that want to kill and destroy more Christians, more Jews, more of America, and we are going to bring them in without proper vetting--because you can't vet them properly--all while Christians, Jews, and moderate Muslims are being slaughtered and overrun all through the Middle East as we are credited with being the superpower in the world? {time} 2045 Yet, also, these last few days, the U.N.--where we pay far more than anybody even comes close to in order to keep it going as they continue to become more and more anti-Semitic, anti-Israeli, and anti-American-- they entertain the largest supporter of terrorism in the world, the leader of Iran. And he says this in part, the leader of Iran, the President Rouhani: If we did not have U.S. military invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq and the United States' unwarranted support for the inhumane actions of the Zionist regime against the oppressed nation of Palestine, today the terrorists would not have an excuse for the justification of their crimes. I am taking this from an article by Julian Hattem, 9-28-15, which is interesting. We have heard that throughout the United States, if we just hadn't gone into Iraq, if we hadn't gone into Afghanistan, if we hadn't gone into Afghanistan with the 300 Americans that we embedded-- about 300--we embedded and let the Afghans destroy the Taliban by February of 2002, then we became an overwhelming occupying force in Afghanistan--but at least by February of 2002, if we hadn't gone in and helped them, the Taliban would still be completely controlling Afghanistan. That is the way it is. Now, we went astray when we became occupiers, and this President has only tripled the number of deaths in Afghanistan, even though the war is supposedly over. Over tripled the number of American deaths, even though the real war was during President Bush, because of this President's rules of engagement and disastrous foreign policy. But think about it. This is the head, the President of Iran. He is telling the UN and the world that, if it weren't for the United States' invasion in Afghanistan and in Iraq, there wouldn't be any American terrorists. Mr. Speaker, why in the world should the U.N. listen to a man that is this big a liar or is this stupid? Because you don't have to be all that bright to understand September 11 of 2001 happened before we sent 300 or so into Afghanistan to help them destroy the Taliban and before we went in and took out a brutal dictator in Iraq. In fact, the planning of 9-11-2001 happened during the Clinton administration on President Clinton's watch. And for people that are fools or liars like Rouhani and they don't know or are just lying about it, during the Clinton administration, President Clinton's policies were to run and help persecuted Muslims whenever we found them around the world. And while we were busy helping Muslims, Western Asia, Eastern Europe, wherever we could help them, they were planning the attack on New York City and Washington, D.C., and hoping to wipe out the entire American government here in Washington, D.C. And but for the heroic act of people on a plane that took it down in Pennsylvania, they may well have. We don't need to hear any of these lies about, oh, if America just hadn't invaded Afghanistan and Iraq, regardless of whether you agree with what President Bush ordered with Iraq, the fact is 9/11 was a terrorist attack before and so was the attack on the USS Cole and so were the attacks on our embassies around the world during the 1990s and so was the first World Trade Center attack in 1993 that apparently had some planning back during the former President Bush's administration. And that was an administration that stopped a brutal dictator, Saddam Hussein, who had raided another Muslim country, and we went in and helped Kuwait get their country back. We went to help the Muslims. And how do they reward us? To plan an attack to try to take down the World Trade Centers in '93. It is very clear Christianity, Judaism, Israel, all were under attack and so was America. And our enemies can't believe how stupid Americans are because we are going to reward the biggest supporter of terrorism in the world--Iran--with $100 to $150 billion that they are already saying they are going to use to help Hamas and Hezbollah kill more Christians, more Jews, help wipe out Israel, help the attack against the Great Satan, the United States. Mr. Speaker, it is time for people in the United States Government to stand up and help correct the wayward policies of this administration. We start by having the United States Senate in one voice say the Iranian deal is a treaty and we are taking a vote on it and cloture is set aside with 51 votes. And they won't get the two-thirds to ratify it. It will not become effective against the United States. And thank God we will then have stopped the continued persecution of Christians, moderate Muslims, Jews, Israelis, and the United States, instead of rewarding them and helping them take us out. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair reminds Members to avoid engaging in personalities toward the President. ____________________",package_114_54.csv,20408,20408,20480,"[congressional record volume 161, number 140 (monday, september 28, 2015)] [house] [pages h6303-h6305] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] christians under attack the speaker pro tempore. under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the chair recognizes the gentleman from texas (mr. gohmert) for 30 minutes. mr. gohmert. mr. speaker, i come before this honorable house with an issue that has been rather heartbreaking for so many of us for so long now: in the middle east, the cradle of christianity, where it started 2,000 years ago based on the judeo principles from thousands of years before that, there has been a massive onslaught. against jews, it has been going on for some time; but especially in the last several years, it has become untenable for christians. in an article by debra heine, september 20, my sister's birthday, she wrote about ``2,000 years of christian civilization destroyed on obama's watch.'' it says this in the article: ``the islamic state has managed to destroy two thousand years of christian civilizations in the middle east in just a couple of years, lt. col. ralph peters noted on `the o'reilly factor' last week. and he placed the blame squarely on president obama's . . . policy. ``isis has been spreading across the middle east like a plague of locusts, and as they have spread, they have targeted religious minorities, particularly christians, for destruction. in syria, tens of thousands of assyrian christians have been attacked and displaced. ``they are forgotten refugees.'' mr. speaker, i have met with christians and christian leaders from syria, and the stories they tell and the horrors they talk about, the inhumanity to man that is being inflicted upon christians in that area is just untenable. it is unconscionable. women--talk about a war on women. if they are christian women, it is absolutely horrendous. i ran into the same problem in meeting with family members in nigeria of girls that were kidnapped by radical islamists, boko haram. that was in nigeria. i would be interested to talk to the president of togo tomorrow. i have been to his country before. i have seen the poverty, and i have seen the affliction. but in the middle east, christians are not even allowed to be in the area where the apostle paul walked. the apostle paul planted churches where christian missionaries were, along the times right after jesus resurrected. right in the early days of the church, churches were planted. and now, while the united states is said to be the sole superpower, christians are being persecuted in greater numbers around the world than ever in history. if there is a god who loves christians, loves all people but has an affinity for jews and christians, then there would have to be a price for any nation that allows this to go on. this article goes on: a catholic priest who visited kurdish iraq last fall described the wounded souls of the christians who had taken refuge there. they had been forced from their homes in northern iraq in the summer of 2014. `` `without question, we are talking about genocide here. genocide is not only when the people are killed, but also when the soul of a people is destroyed. and that is what is happening in iraq now,' said fr. andrzej halemba, head of aid to the church in need's middle east section, said october 28. `it is the most tragic thing that i have ever experienced.'

{time} 2045 yet, also, these last few days, the u.n.--where we pay far more than anybody even comes close to in order to keep it going as they continue to become more and more anti-semitic, anti-israeli, and anti-american-- they entertain the largest supporter of terrorism in the world, the leader of iran. and he says this in part, the leader of iran, the president rouhani: if we did not have u.s. military invasion of afghanistan and iraq and the united states' unwarranted support for the inhumane actions of the zionist regime against the oppressed nation of palestine, today the terrorists would not have an excuse for the justification of their crimes. i am taking this from an article by julian hattem, 9-28-15, which is interesting. we have heard that throughout the united states, if we just hadn't gone into iraq, if we hadn't gone into afghanistan, if we hadn't gone into afghanistan with the 300 americans that we embedded-- about 300--we embedded and let the afghans destroy the taliban by february of 2002, then we became an overwhelming occupying force in afghanistan--but at least by february of 2002, if we hadn't gone in and helped them, the taliban would still be completely controlling afghanistan. that is the way it is. now, we went astray when we became occupiers, and this president has only tripled the number of deaths in afghanistan, even though the war is supposedly over. over tripled the number of american deaths, even though the real war was during president bush, because of this president's rules of engagement and disastrous foreign policy. but think about it. this is the head, the president of iran. he is telling the un and the world that, if it weren't for the united states' invasion in afghanistan and in iraq, there wouldn't be any american terrorists. mr. speaker, why in the world should the u.n. listen to a man that is this big a liar or is this stupid? because you don't have to be all that bright to understand september 11 of 2001 happened before we sent 300 or so into afghanistan to help them destroy the taliban and before we went in and took out a brutal dictator in iraq. in fact, the planning of 9-11-2001 happened during the clinton administration on president clinton's watch. and for people that are fools or liars like rouhani and they don't know or are just lying about it, during the clinton administration, president clinton's policies were to run and help persecuted muslims whenever we found them around the world. and while we were busy helping muslims, western asia, eastern europe, wherever we could help them, they were planning the attack on new york city and washington, d.c., and hoping to wipe out the entire american government here in washington, d.c. and but for the heroic act of people on a plane that took it down in pennsylvania, they may well have. we don't need to hear any of these lies about, oh, if america just hadn't invaded afghanistan and iraq, regardless of whether you agree with what president bush ordered with iraq, the fact is 9/11 was a terrorist attack before and so was the attack on the uss cole and so were the attacks on our embassies around the world during the 1990s and so was the first world trade center attack in 1993 that apparently had some planning back during the former president bush's administration. and that was an administration that stopped a brutal dictator, saddam hussein, who had raided another muslim country, and we went in and helped kuwait get their country back. we went to help the muslims. and how do they reward us? to plan an attack to try to take down the world trade centers in '93. it is very clear christianity, judaism, israel, all were under attack and so was america. and our enemies can't believe how stupid americans are because we are going to reward the biggest supporter of terrorism in the world--iran--with $100 to $150 billion that they are already saying they are going to use to help hamas and hezbollah kill more christians, more jews, help wipe out israel, help the attack against the great satan, the united states. mr. speaker, it is time for people in the united states government to stand up and help correct the wayward policies of this administration. we start by having the united states senate in one voice say the iranian deal is a treaty and we are taking a vote on it and cloture is set aside with 51 votes. and they won't get the two-thirds to ratify it. it will not become effective against the united states. and thank god we will then have stopped the continued persecution of christians, moderate muslims, jews, israelis, and the united states, instead of rewarding them and helping them take us out. i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the chair reminds members to avoid engaging in personalities toward the president. ____________________",20408

Madam President, a new Senate majority came to office this year with a new outlook on government funding from the previous majority. First, we passed a budget. Then we worked across the aisle to pass through the committee the dozen bills necessary to fund the government. That is the first time either of these things has happened in 6 long years. Our commonsense approach represented real hope that with the necessary cooperation from across the aisle, a new and better way of funding the government was actually possible. Democrats initially gave Americans reason to believe they might be ready to offer that bipartisan cooperation. Democrats gave bipartisan committee backing to nearly all of the dozen government funding bills, and a majority of these bills attracted support from at least 70 percent of Democratic Appropriations Committee members. Democrats even bragged about supporting these funding bills in press releases to their constituents. But this was before Democrats hatched their filibuster summer plan-- in other words, block all of the government funding bills in the hopes of provoking a crisis Democrats might exploit to grow the IRS and the DC bureaucracy. As a result, you actually saw Democratic leaders declare that they would use procedural moves to prevent the full Senate from even debating the same funding legislation members of their party had already praised in their press releases to the media. Democrats even voted repeatedly to block the bill that funds our military. Think about that--funds for our military. It would have been cynical enough for our colleagues to block a bipartisan defense spending bill Democrats had hailed as a ``win, win, win'' and a ``victory'' for their States in their press releases, but we are all living in a time of unparalleled international crises. Threats seem to mount less by the day than by the hour. Yet last week Democrats voted again to block the bipartisan bill that funds pay raises and medical care for our troops. It was very extreme. I wish I could say it was the only extreme position our Democratic friends took last week. On Thursday Senators were given a choice between funding women's health or funding a scandal-wracked organization called Planned Parenthood. Republicans stood up for women's health; Democrats stood up for their political friends. I think Democrats will come to regret their continued prioritization of the needs of the far left over women, over our military, and over seemingly everything else. The question before us now is how to keep the government open in the short term, given the realities we face. This is what the president of National Right to Life had to say on the matter: There are two different roads that we can take. One is to insist that no more money go to Planned Parenthood and cause a government shutdown (which [interestingly enough] won't result in actually defunding Planned Parenthood). The other is to take a slightly longer-term approach, taking advantage of the fact that we have the attention of the country as probably never before. . . . Had Democrats not prevented the Senate from passing the same appropriations bills they voted for and praised, we wouldn't be having this discussion right now. But they did. They pursued a deliberate strategy to force our country into another of these unnecessary crises. This leaves the funding legislation before us as the only viable way forward in the short-term. It doesn't represent my 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 23rd choice when it comes to funding the government, but it will keep the government open through the fall and funded at the bipartisan level already agreed to by both parties as we work on the way forward. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S6961] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GOVERNMENT FUNDING Mr. McCONNELL.

Madam President, a path to avert yet another Republican- manufactured shutdown is before us now. This evening the Senate will vote to invoke cloture on a clean continuing resolution that keeps the Federal Government open and funded. We believe debate should continue on this issue, and that is why we are voting the way we are going to vote. Following that vote, the Senate will then proceed to final passage of a clean funding measure--sometime tomorrow or Wednesday. That will take a simple majority. I am pleased that we are on the verge of avoiding another Republican-sponsored shutdown of the Federal Government. We are fortunate cooler heads are prevailing. But I would be remiss if I didn't remind everyone--especially my Republican colleagues--that this last-minute scramble to do our most basic job is as unnecessary as it is reckless. We are 2 days from a shutdown--only 2 days. And why? Because Republicans made it their No. 1 priority to undermine women's health. Keeping the government open, funded, and serving the American people was a secondary concern for these extremists in the Republican Party. My friend the Republican leader, in talking about this choice a few days ago, the choice between--he said Planned Parenthood; I say the health of women-- understand, the Republicans couldn't even get a majority vote on this. They couldn't get a majority vote; they were down in the forties. So even the Republicans think what is going on now is foolish. Keeping government open and funded and serving the American people was a secondary concern for those extremists. That is too bad. So while I am pleased that we now have a path forward to avoid a shutdown, I am nonetheless concerned about the Republican modus operandi of always governing by crisis. Remember, this is the fifth time in 2 years the Republicans have manufactured an unnecessary shutdown crisis. Two years ago they actually shut down the government. For 17 days, Republicans shut down the government, and we were only able to get ourselves out of that morass because--for example, in the House of Representatives, two-thirds of the Republicans in the House voted to keep the government closed. That is unbelievable, but that is the way it was. Here it is now 2 years later, and we are on the verge of another shutdown. Remember this: This is the fifth time in 2 years that Republicans have manufactured an unnecessary showdown crisis--and it is a showdown. Too bad it is leading to a shutdown. Exactly 2 years ago, as I indicated, of course, they shut down the Federal Government because of health care. Seven months ago, Republicans almost shut down the Department of Homeland Security. Why? Over an immigration issue. The Department of Homeland Security--they were going to shut it down. It was saved in the last minute. These are the agencies within this Department that protect us. They protect us from terrorists, and they protect us from those many things that happen in our country that we need protection from. This past spring, it shut down key national security programs that were part of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Why? They were fighting among themselves. The Republican leader wanted a bill for a certain length of time. People within his caucus wanted one for another length of time. There was a fight among them, not among us, but they came close to wreaking havoc. They did wreak some havoc because the program was shut down for a while. More recently, Republicans shut down the Export-Import Bank, endangering the hundreds of thousands of jobs this program supports. It is still closed. Now we are just days from another shutdown--another kind of shutdown but a big one. And although it appears we will sidestep a Republican- manufactured crisis this week, the disaster is looming. We still have a long, difficult road ahead. The continuing resolution will pass this week, but it is for a short term, and it funds our government through December 11. The measure is very shortsighted--December 11. That means within the coming weeks, we will again be negotiating with Republicans to avoid another shutdown. We will also have to find a way to pay our bills to avoid a catastrophic default on our debt. Republicans tried that once. We came within minutes of doing that. The Federal Government--this great country of ours--wouldn't be able to pay its bills. But we see the press. We see all these stories about the Speaker, who is going to step down in 5 weeks, and we hear the Republicans over there. They are joyous. One Republican running for President announced this, and there was cheering. And the person running for President--who serves in the Senate--was part of the cheer. Another Republican Presidential candidate came to the same meeting, and the same thing happened. It is hard to comprehend that people are cheering for this government to be closed. That is what they are doing. We shouldn't pay our debt? The Republican House is in a sad state. Last week the far right showed that it can depose a Speaker and has emerged more powerful than ever, more outspoken than ever. Members of the House will hold their leadership elections in the coming days, and I hope they elect some sensible leaders. I am deeply concerned. I came to the floor on Friday and spoke as honestly as I could of my respect for John Boehner. I think it is unfair that people are piling on. Did I always agree with him? No. But he never misled me and always told me the way it was. I am deeply concerned that even those Republican leaders previously inclined toward compromise have already lost the courage to stand up to the far right when it matters the most, and they have said so in the press. That is too bad. Come November 1, we have no way of knowing what House Republicans will do--this is after their elections to replace Congressman Boehner. We have no idea what they are going to do, whether they will try to again steer our government off a cliff, as numerous House Members have said in the last few days. Do they want to go off that cliff or do they want to recklessly hammer the global economy? Maybe both. We need to get to work immediately to avoid being right back here on December 11 facing another Republican shutdown because if one thing is clear, it is that Republicans see impending catastrophe as a political tool that they need to exploit. The American people don't want another 15 months of Republican brinkmanship. Our constituents don't want every simple legislative task to turn into a doomsday clock. So I invite my Republican colleagues to quit governing by crisis. Let's put the threat of government shutdown to bed now, and then let's turn our attention to something that both sides agree on--getting rid of the dangerous sequester cuts. I have heard speeches given by the senior Senator from Arizona-- someone who knows a little bit about the military--and he says sequester cuts are terrible. I agree with him. These devastating cuts were never supposed to happen. They were meant to drive bipartisan budget negotiations. Getting rid of sequestration has wide bipartisan support in both Chambers, I hope. We should start working right now on a bipartisan budget fix that helps the military, helps the middle class, and puts our country on a more sound economic footing. And let's do it without the threat of a government shutdown. We can do it, but only if Republicans don't divert us to yet another catastrophe. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S6962] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GOVERNING BY CRISIS Mr. REID.

Remember this: This is the fifth time in 2 years that Republicans have manufactured an unnecessary showdown crisis--and it is a showdown. Too bad it is leading to a shutdown. Exactly 2 years ago, as I indicated, of course, they shut down the Federal Government because of health care. Seven months ago, Republicans almost shut down the Department of Homeland Security. Why? Over an immigration issue. The Department of Homeland Security--they were going to shut it down. It was saved in the last minute. These are the agencies within this Department that protect us. They protect us from terrorists, and they protect us from those many things that happen in our country that we need protection from. This past spring, it shut down key national security programs that were part of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Why? They were fighting among themselves. The Republican leader wanted a bill for a certain length of time. People within his caucus wanted one for another length of time. There was a fight among them, not among us, but they came close to wreaking havoc. They did wreak some havoc because the program was shut down for a while. More recently, Republicans shut down the Export-Import Bank, endangering the hundreds of thousands of jobs this program supports. It is still closed. Now we are just days from another shutdown--another kind of shutdown but a big one. And although it appears we will sidestep a Republican- manufactured crisis this week, the disaster is looming. We still have a long, difficult road ahead. The continuing resolution will pass this week, but it is for a short term, and it funds our government through December 11. The measure is very shortsighted--December 11. That means within the coming weeks, we will again be negotiating with Republicans to avoid another shutdown. We will also have to find a way to pay our bills to avoid a catastrophic default on our debt. Republicans tried that once. We came within minutes of doing that. The Federal Government--this great country of ours--wouldn't be able to pay its bills. But we see the press. We see all these stories about the Speaker, who is going to step down in 5 weeks, and we hear the Republicans over there. They are joyous. One Republican running for President announced this, and there was cheering. And the person running for President--who serves in the Senate--was part of the cheer. Another Republican Presidential candidate came to the same meeting, and the same thing happened. It is hard to comprehend that people are cheering for this government to be closed. That is what they are doing. We shouldn't pay our debt? The Republican House is in a sad state. Last week the far right showed that it can depose a Speaker and has emerged more powerful than ever, more outspoken than ever. Members of the House will hold their leadership elections in the coming days, and I hope they elect some sensible leaders. I am deeply concerned. I came to the floor on Friday and spoke as honestly as I could of my respect for John Boehner. I think it is unfair that people are piling on. Did I always agree with him? No. But he never misled me and always told me the way it was. I am deeply concerned that even those Republican leaders previously inclined toward compromise have already lost the courage to stand up to the far right when it matters the most, and they have said so in the press. That is too bad. Come November 1, we have no way of knowing what House Republicans will do--this is after their elections to replace Congressman Boehner. We have no idea what they are going to do, whether they will try to again steer our government off a cliff, as numerous House Members have said in the last few days. Do they want to go off that cliff or do they want to recklessly hammer the global economy? Maybe both. We need to get to work immediately to avoid being right back here on December 11 facing another Republican shutdown because if one thing is clear, it is that Republicans see impending catastrophe as a political tool that they need to exploit. The American people don't want another 15 months of Republican brinkmanship. Our constituents don't want every simple legislative task to turn into a doomsday clock. So I invite my Republican colleagues to quit governing by crisis. Let's put the threat of government shutdown to bed now, and then let's turn our attention to something that both sides agree on--getting rid of the dangerous sequester cuts. I have heard speeches given by the senior Senator from Arizona-- someone who knows a little bit about the military--and he says sequester cuts are terrible. I agree with him. These devastating cuts were never supposed to happen. They were meant to drive bipartisan budget negotiations. Getting rid of sequestration has wide bipartisan support in both Chambers, I hope. We should start working right now on a bipartisan budget fix that helps the military, helps the middle class, and puts our country on a more sound economic footing. And let's do it without the threat of a government shutdown. We can do it, but only if Republicans don't divert us to yet another catastrophe. ____________________",package_114_54.csv,7684,7684,7756,"[congressional record volume 161, number 140 (monday, september 28, 2015)] [senate] [page s6962] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] governing by crisis mr. reid. madam president, a path to avert yet another republican- manufactured shutdown is before us now. this evening the senate will vote to invoke cloture on a clean continuing resolution that keeps the federal government open and funded. we believe debate should continue on this issue, and that is why we are voting the way we are going to vote. following that vote, the senate will then proceed to final passage of a clean funding measure--sometime tomorrow or wednesday. that will take a simple majority. i am pleased that we are on the verge of avoiding another republican-sponsored shutdown of the federal government. we are fortunate cooler heads are prevailing. but i would be remiss if i didn't remind everyone--especially my republican colleagues--that this last-minute scramble to do our most basic job is as unnecessary as it is reckless. we are 2 days from a shutdown--only 2 days. and why? because republicans made it their no. 1 priority to undermine women's health. keeping the government open, funded, and serving the american people was a secondary concern for these extremists in the republican party. my friend the republican leader, in talking about this choice a few days ago, the choice between--he said planned parenthood; i say the health of women-- understand, the republicans couldn't even get a majority vote on this. they couldn't get a majority vote; they were down in the forties. so even the republicans think what is going on now is foolish. keeping government open and funded and serving the american people was a secondary concern for those extremists. that is too bad. so while i am pleased that we now have a path forward to avoid a shutdown, i am nonetheless concerned about the republican modus operandi of always governing by crisis. remember, this is the fifth time in 2 years the republicans have manufactured an unnecessary shutdown crisis. two years ago they actually shut down the government. for 17 days, republicans shut down the government, and we were only able to get ourselves out of that morass because--for example, in the house of representatives, two-thirds of the republicans in the house voted to keep the government closed. that is unbelievable, but that is the way it was. here it is now 2 years later, and we are on the verge of another shutdown. remember this: this is the fifth time in 2 years that republicans have manufactured an unnecessary showdown crisis--and it is a showdown. too bad it is leading to a shutdown. exactly 2 years ago, as i indicated, of course, they shut down the federal government because of health care. seven months ago, republicans almost shut down the department of homeland security. why?

Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of the House message to accompany H.R. 719, which the clerk will report. The bill clerk read as follows: House message to accompany H.R. 719, an act to require the Transportation Security Administration to conform to existing Federal law and regulations regarding criminal investigator positions, and for other purposes. Pending: McConnell motion to concur in the amendment of the House to the amendment of the Senate to the bill, with McConnell (for Cochran) amendment No. 2689, making continuing appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016. McConnell amendment No. 2690 (to amendment No. 2689), to change the enactment date.

McConnell amendment No. 2692 (to (the instructions) amendment No. 2691), of a perfecting nature. McConnell amendment No. 2693 (to amendment No. 2692), of a perfecting nature. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until the cloture vote on the motion to concur with an amendment in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 719 will be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees. The Senator from Illinois. Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, Wednesday night is the deadline. On Wednesday night, the authority of the government of the United States to do business ends. The funding for our government ends. It is a scary time. We don't want that to happen--most of us--because we know it will be catastrophic. There will be people who will suffer if we fail to do our job. Now, this isn't the first time we have been up against a deadline. We have faced them before, and many times we have to buy a little extra time to negotiate the budget. That is understandable. In this circumstance, though, we actually have announced candidates for the Presidency of the United States who are calling for a government shutdown. What happens when our government shuts down? Well, it is pretty obvious. Agencies stop doing business as usual. What we find, though, is that the impact goes far beyond just that simple statement. I went back to Illinois this last weekend, and I went for a visit to Scott Air Force Base. It is the largest single employer in the State of Illinois and downstate. In 2013--the last time we had a government shutdown--the junior Senator from Texas, Senator Ted Cruz, wanted to shut down our government to protest ObamaCare. So he successfully closed down the government and found other Republicans who would join him in that effort, and it went on for a long period of time. In 2013, at Scott Air Force Base, one of the most important defense facilities in our country, in Belleville, IL, we saw two-thirds of the civilian workforce--that is about 3,400 people--sent home immediately without pay. Those who were required to report for duty, including all of the base's 5,000 military personnel, would have been given IOUs rather than paychecks. Scott Air Force Base families were forced to limit their spending and stretch their savings while the Senator from Texas gave speeches on the floor about Dr. Seuss. I am not making this up. This had an impact on the entire region of Southwestern Illinois. Scott Air Force Base has a $1.6 billion economic impact on the local area, including supporting thousands of indirect jobs. Every part of this regional economy felt the impact of this decision to shut down the government 2 years ago--gas stations, restaurants, small businesses, contractors, everybody. Now, this brinksmanship goes far beyond flowery speeches on the floor and press attention. The last shutdown hurt the gross domestic product of the United States of America. Consumer confidence drops when the government shuts down. We saw $2 billion in lost productivity from furloughed employees. Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen said: We have a good recovery in place that's really making progress and to see Congress take actions that would endanger that progress, I think that would be more than unfortunate. So to me that's Congress' job. The CEO of JPMorgan Chase, a man named Jamie Dimon, speaking of the last Republican government shutdown, said, ``Washington has really slowed American down.'' I agree. And if that were the only thing that was happening, it would be bad enough. But there is more. Today I went to a neighborhood in Chicago, the All Saints Episcopal Church in Ravenswood. They are doing a restoration on this beautiful church built back in the 19th century. I met with the pastor there. We were at the food pantry of this church. This Episcopal Church tries to help neighborhood residents who are struggling to find enough to eat. We had a little press conference with the local Congressman, Mike Quigley and Jan Schakowsky, and people who represented the food pantries of Chicago in that area. They are worried about a shutdown and what a shutdown means to them. How would it affect the All Saints Episcopal Church food pantry and the men and women who go in there on a regular basis to pick up some canned goods to get by? Here is what it means. Many of these people are on food stamps. We call it the SNAP program now. The SNAP program, on average, gives a person food worth $7 a day, so the notion that people are going out for steak dinners on food stamps is not quite accurate. Sara--and I won't use her full name--who is 81 years old, came up to talk about what life is like for her. She was a hard-working person, stricken with cancer in 2002, which recurred in 2004, and she had to quit working. She has a walker now and she gets around, but all she has is her Social Security check and food stamps. That is how she survives from week to week and month to month. What happens when there is a government shutdown? They cut off food stamps. Did that happen last time? No. The last time the Senator from Texas shut down the government, it didn't happen because President Obama had a surplus in his recovery fund and he took the surplus and put it in the food stamps so there would be no interruption of service. You see, most of the recipients of food stamps are children. Single moms raising kids and not making enough money supplement their income with food stamps and buy food for their kids. Food stamps are also used by elderly people like Sara who are struggling on a fixed income. This time is different. If these Presidential wannabes who are determined to shut down the government this time are successful, we are going to have problems right away. It turns out the only surplus left in the food stamp or SNAP benefit fund is about $3 billion. That will keep the program going for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, they cut off the food stamps. What does that mean? Well, for a lot of people it means a lot of suffering--primarily for the poorest people among us. Did anyone notice last week what happened in Washington? The city was transformed by the visit of Pope Francis. Congress was in awe of this man who came and spoke to us in very human terms about what he thinks would be our obligation, not just as elected officials but as human beings. One of his highest priorities is that we have some caring and sensitivity for those who struggle--the poor, the people on food stamps. So for all the applause and all of the posing for pictures that went on last week with the Pope, here we are this week discussing a government shutdown. Here we are this week discussing whether we are going to cut off food stamps for poor people in America. It is a sad reality to think of what a government shutdown would do in human terms to those wonderful folks working at Scott Air Force Base in Belleville, IL, or to Sara who will go into the All Saints Episcopal Church food pantry and try to get by, as food stamps are cut off. Why? Why would we do that? How can we possibly be serving this Nation--this great Nation--by stalling our economy and hurting innocent people and punishing those who are serving our country in uniform and otherwise? Some think it is a grand strategy--a great political strategy. It may move [[Page S6964]] them up from the smaller debate to the big-time debate when it comes to running for President. To me it is an indication we have lost our way. In June, I joined with the other leaders on this side of the aisle in sending a letter to the Republican leader saying: Please, don't wait until the end of September to face this budget reality. Sit down now-- back in June--with the President, with the leaders on the Republican side and the Democratic side. Let us compromise in good faith. Let us meet our responsibilities. Well, that is what we face. As Senator Reid said a few minutes earlier, there is a suggestion that maybe as a parting gift to Speaker Boehner we will extend the budget temporarily until December 11, 2 weeks before Christmas, just days before the Hanukkah season--that we would extend the budget until then and then, once again, be up against the deadline and the prospect of shutting down our government. We can do better. We should do better. We need to make certain we keep faith with the people who send us here. We need to make certain we do our job--not just to send a continuing resolution to the President but to resolve this issue. We should not be threatening a government shutdown now or in December when we know how devastating that can be. I hope Congress gets busy taking care of the work we were sent here to do. I think it is time for those bipartisan budget negotiations. It is beyond time. Now is the time for Congress to act responsibly to develop a budget that allows America to thrive. Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I wish to talk about an amendment I plan to offer in a little while, once somebody comes from our side or the other side because they would like to be here to talk about it with me, as I understand it--maybe even to object to it, maybe to agree with it. But I wish to speak about the amendment, if I could, for a moment. Right now, we are debating the continuing resolution. This would be to continue a level of spending from now until December 11. There are a bunch of changes in that from last year's spending, but it is basically a continuation of the previous year until we can work out our differences. It is not the way to govern around here. What we should be doing instead is having individual spending bills come up. There are 12 different appropriations bills. The ideal way to handle this is the way it used to be done, which is that the Appropriations Committee and its subcommittees deal with these individual spending bills. For instance, one is for Commerce, the State Department, and the Justice Department. One is for the Department of Health and Human Services, and one is for the Department of Defense. When we do that, what happens is we have oversight hearings, and we have Congress playing its rightful role of saying: Are these agencies doing the right thing? Are these programs working or aren't they working? We might increase spending with a program that is actually working well, decrease spending from another program, and eliminate a third program that is not working well at all. That is what Congress is supposed to do. That is our job here. Under the Constitution, Congress was given the power of the purse, meaning that every dime has to be appropriated by the Congress. What has happened over the years--particularly in the last several years--is that Congress has not moved forward on these appropriations bills because they have been blocked. In this case, this year we have been trying to bring up appropriations bills and the other side, the Democrats, have been blocking even considering an appropriations bill. We have had this debate here on the floor. Many of us have heard it. But the bottom line is the committees have actually done their work and reported out 12 different appropriations bills. So 12 bills are ready to come to the floor. By the way, most of these bills have been reported out with huge bipartisan majorities. I saw one the other day. It was 24 to 3, for instance. I know the Presiding Officer has been involved in some of these issues over the years. It is typical, actually, that appropriators do their jobs. Senator Mikulski, Senator Cochran, and others work out the differences, but we simply can't get them voted on on the floor. People may say: Why can't you? Well, because it requires 60 votes. We have to overcome a 60-vote hurdle in order to even proceed to the legislation. So we haven't been able to vote on a single appropriations bill before September 30, which is the fiscal year-end and which is coming up this week. It is no way to run a railroad, much less a government--by the way, the government that has the biggest budget of any government in the world, the government of the greatest nation in the world. We can't even bring these individual spending bills up here for a debate and a vote. It is just wrong. Again, when we don't do that, what we don't have is the oversight. I would think both sides would want to have oversight over these agencies and departments so we understand what is working and what is not working and so that those tax dollars are spent wisely. That is the kind of stewardship that we are responsible for. As taxpayers, as representatives of taxpayers, we should want to be sure those dollars are spent in a way that is most effective. Yet, without having these appropriations bills, it is just impossible to do. Instead, we are faced with this possibility of on September 30 not having any of what is called discretionary spending, which is not all of the spending of government, but it is the spending that Congress appropriates every year, and having the possibility of parts of government actually not being able to operate because September 30 is the fiscal year-end. It is just the wrong way to do business. So the amendment I am going to offer later this afternoon is an amendment that simply says: Let's adopt a new bill, new legislation that says: Let's end government shutdowns. How would we do it? We would say that as of September 30, if there is any bill that is not passed, any one of the 12--remember that this year none of the 12 were passed--none of them. But on any year, if any one of those were not passed, then we would simply continue the spending from the previous year, but there would be a reduction in that spending over time. After 120 days there would be a 1-percent reduction, giving 120 days to work with the Appropriations Committee to say: OK, we know you don't want to see the spending cut, and we know you have priorities you would like to fund, but it is going to be cut 1 percent after 120 days, then 1 percent after the next 90 days, 1 percent after the next 90 days, and 1 percent after the next 90 days. So we get to a point where we have to see a reduction in spending every year, which is not necessarily a bad thing because Congress spends more than it takes in every year. But if appropriators and others here in Congress don't want to see that, they would have to get their act together and actually pass appropriations bills. Once an appropriations bill is passed, the End Government Shutdowns Act would not apply. This seems to me to be a really logical bipartisan commonsense solution to the problem that we are facing here. Again, the problem is Congress is not doing its work. We are not getting these appropriations bills done. It is not for lack of work in the committees this year. Again, all 12 bills were reported out of committee. I believe the same is true in the House. Yet we cannot get here on the floor of the Senate the 60 votes needed to come up with the ability to proceed to these appropriations bills. It is called a filibuster. They are being filibustered. We are not even debating them. This is just wrong. I think, again, the way to get around that is to say: OK, if you want to try to block these bills, what is going to happen is we are going to have automatic spending from last year with no increases--in fact, decreases--and decreasing more over time, until Congress gets its act together and actually passes this legislation. This idea is so commonsense that when we had a vote on it a couple of years ago, when I was able to bring it [[Page S6965]] up for a vote--and we will see tonight whether I am permitted to do that--we actually had 46 Senators support it. Now, not everybody supported it on the Appropriations Committee. Some of them obviously had concerns about it. Not every Republican supported it. There were a few Republicans who didn't support it. By the way, one Republican who didn't support it last time is now a cosponsor of the legislation because she has looked at it, she has understood the system is not working, and she has been persuaded it is the right way to go. It was bipartisan last time. Senator Tester and I were the two cosponsors of it. So I hope I will have the opportunity to offer that amendment here this afternoon because I think it makes all the sense in the world. As we are debating a continuing resolution again, the so-called CR--which is the wrong way to govern--let's also pass as part of that a new discipline, a new idea, a new approach that says: Let's not do this again. Let's not ever have the threat of a government shutdown hanging over us. Instead, come September 30, if an appropriations bill isn't done, fine, continue the spending from last year, with a slow ratcheting down of that spending. I think that makes all the sense in the world. It takes away this political football that is being thrown back and forth. It takes away the specter for our economy, for our businesses, and for our families of not knowing whether they are going to have this government operation continue after September 30 in whatever area is affecting our economy or those businesses or those families. I think it makes a lot of sense, and I think it provides an incentive for Congress to get its work done. And Congress should be doing every year all 12 appropriations bills--doing the oversight that goes into that, deciding what gets more money, what gets less money, what gets thrown out altogether. It doesn't make any sense. In the huge bureaucracy of the vast Federal Government, not every program is perfect. Let's be honest; a lot of them need reform. If we don't have this process of the power of the purse--the leverage of the power of the purse to be able to say ``Prove this program is working,'' and when it doesn't, ``We are going to pull the funding away''--you lose the ability for Congress to be an effective partner with the executive branch and the judicial branch the way our Founders set it up. Again, Congress alone has the power of the purse. Every dime has to be appropriated by this Congress, and Congress is not doing its job. This amendment, if we put in place this new practice, would be a tremendous help to get Congress back on track. It wasn't too long ago that this happened. I have been here almost 5 years now or 4\1/2\ years. We haven't had a single year where all the appropriations bills were done. In fact, very few appropriations bills have been voted on at all. This year not a single appropriations bill--zero--has come to the floor of the Senate because they have been blocked. They have all come out of committee now, but not a single one is allowed to get voted on here in the Senate. I do hope that my own leadership on the Republican side will keep bringing these bills up. At least then we have an opportunity to talk about them--what is in the bills and why it is a good idea for us to have the oversight. Again, the reforms to these programs--the spending cuts, the spending increases for programs that are working well, the elimination altogether of programs that aren't working--we should at least have the opportunity to discuss them and talk about it. I was hopeful we would see a colleague from the other side of the aisle show up or a member of the Appropriations Committee. I was told I could give this little talk at 5, and I had the opportunity to offer this amendment. I will have to come back later and offer it again. I don't know if my colleague from Iowa is planning to speak---- Mr. GRASSLEY. No. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, earlier I had the opportunity to talk a little about the amendment I am about to offer. This is an amendment to the underlying bill, which is a continuing resolution. The amendment has to do with a piece of legislation called the End Government Shutdowns Act. Excuse me. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to speak for 5 minutes in order to finish the conversation that we started earlier this evening. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I talked about the fact that here we are, once again, without the appropriations bills done and forced to do a continuing resolution from now until December 11, and that is because later this week, on September 30, when the fiscal year ends and comes to a close, we will not have done the appropriations bills. It is not that we haven't done one or two or three; we haven't done any of them, and there are 12 of them. I think it is time for us to take a new approach; that is, to have an end government shutdowns discipline put before this Congress which says: Any time you get to this point with any of the appropriations bills--including now where we have all of them--that we instead have a continuation of last year's spending but that it ratchets down over time to provide an incentive for all of us in Congress--Democrats and Republicans alike, the Appropriations Committee, and all of us--to get our work done and to do our job under the Constitution. The power of the purse is exclusively delegated to the Congress. It will help us to get our job done if we had this by having the end government shutdowns discipline in place. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment and call up my amendment No. 2702, the end government shutdowns amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. COCHRAN. Reserving the right to object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi. Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if I understand the Senator's suggestion correctly, his amendment would create an automatic continuing resolution to fund the Federal Government in the event an annual appropriations bill is not enacted by the time the fiscal year expires. That may sound harmless enough, but what we are saying is that not only is the power of the Senate suspended and put on hold but the obligations of the committee system are put under a threat--that unless you complete action on legislation that is referred to the committee of jurisdiction by a certain time, you are out of business, and whoever wants to offer an amendment as a substitute gets to offer that and pass it on a majority vote. We are already required to have three-fifths of the Members vote to cut off debate in order to be sure that all Senators--not just a bare majority--get to decide the decisions of the Senate and get to actively participate in the process by offering amendments. My friend's amendment abolishes offering any other alternatives for a full debate--unlimited debate--which is why the Senate is here, to cool down the passions of the moment. A Senator might have a good idea and want to change a law, repeal a resolution, deny access to Federal funds for this, that or the other that goes to a State that is very important, and their interests are just as important. This is a terrible amendment, and it ought to be rejected. I hope the Senator will withhold offering the amendment. We can have hearings on this and see what other Senators may think about it, but at first blush, this seems like this is an amendment whose time has not come. We are not ready to dismantle the rules of the Senate piece by piece. Well, we have the right of unlimited debate, and Senators can talk as long as they wish to. We don't have to go through a rules committee to get permission or get permission from any other Senator. These are direct responsibilities of individual Senators selected by their States to stand up for their interests, not to go to Washington and cave in on something that might be a good-sounding amendment [[Page S6966]] or might have the passions of the moment behind it so that there appears to be a wave of support, but until you have a chance to seriously consider the individual issues involved, until three-fifths of the Senate decides to cut off debate--I strongly object to this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. COCHRAN. I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my friend and my colleague, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I look forward to talking to him more about this. As I said earlier, 46 Senators supported this in the past, including all but two or three Republicans, by the way, and one of them is now a cosponsor of the legislation. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call under rule XXII be waived with respect to today's cloture vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I wish to have 1 minute in order to debate the matter that is before us. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Illinois. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I stand with the Senator from Mississippi. We may be from opposite political parties, but I certainly agree with him that the suggestion by the Senator from Ohio does not serve the best interests of this country. Imagine if his proposal went through and we were faced with inadequate funding for medical care for our veterans. I am sorry to say the Senator from Ohio has suggested that we would have last year's level of funding with potentially a 4-percent cut. It would be the same for fighting fires and the National Institutes of Health. There would be a 4-percent cut in medical research. I think what we are doing, if we accept this approach, is giving up our responsibility that the taxpayers sent us to carry out; that is, to make careful choices when it comes to budgets. I just want to be on the record supporting my colleague from Mississippi. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I hadn't planned to have a debate on this, but I am happy to have one. Let me just be very clear. This is about putting the Appropriations Committee in business, not out of business. This is not about cutting spending; it is about forcing Congress to get its work done. Here we sit about to pass a continuing resolution because none of the 12 appropriations bills has been voted on because each of them has been blocked in the Senate. The committee has done its work. Yet we can't get them to the floor. Yet we have the other side saying: Gosh, this would somehow hurt the process. How can the process be hurt any worse? We want the process to work, and that is why 46 of us, on a bipartisan basis, have supported this idea. What it says is, if at the end of the day, on September 30, appropriations bills have not been passed, then we would simply continue the spending from last year, and, yes, over time we would ratchet it down, giving 120 days for the committee to get its act together that it did not in the previous year when it was supposed to, to get these bills done, to do the oversight, and to make the decisions about NIH, as the Senator has said, and to make the decisions about our veterans. If we truly want to help our veterans, a CR is not the way to do it. The way to do it is to let the VA bill come to the floor, have a debate, and take the committee's good ideas--and, by the way, it came out of committee with a large bipartisan vote. That is how we should be legislating. That is our job. The power of the purse resides exclusively with us. Yet once again this year we are not doing our job. It is not that we are just doing a couple of appropriations bills; we are not doing a single appropriations bill. I think it is time for us to change course and that is what this legislation is about. I am simply saying that in the process of passing the CR, which we now have to do, set up a discipline for the future that provides an incentive for us to get our work done so the good work being done by Senator Cochran and others--including Senator Mikulski--in the Appropriations Committee can come to the floor for a vote, and we can get back to governing. I yield back. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request to waive the mandatory quorum? Mr. DURBIN. No objection. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Cloture Motion Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. The bill clerk read as follows: Cloture Motion We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 719 with an amendment, No. 2689. Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, Orrin G. Hatch, Pat Roberts, Johnny Isakson, Michael B. Enzi, Cory Gardner, John Barrasso, Lindsey Graham, Lamar Alexander, Thad Cochran, Chuck Grassley, Kelly Ayotte, Susan M. Collins, Deb Fischer, Richard Burr. The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 719 with amendment No. 2689, offered by the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Blunt), the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Corker), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Graham), and the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio). The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 77, nays 19, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 271 Leg.] YEAS--77 Alexander Ayotte Baldwin Barrasso Bennet Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Burr Cantwell Capito Cardin Carper Casey Cassidy Cochran Collins Coons Cornyn Donnelly Durbin Enzi Ernst Feinstein Fischer Flake Franken Gardner Gillibrand Grassley Hatch Heinrich Heitkamp Hirono Hoeven Isakson Johnson Kaine King Kirk Klobuchar Leahy Manchin Markey McCain McCaskill McConnell Menendez Merkley Mikulski Murkowski Murphy Murray Nelson Perdue Peters Portman Reed Reid Roberts Rounds Sanders Schatz Schumer Shaheen Stabenow Sullivan Tester Thune Tillis Udall Warner Warren Whitehouse Wicker Wyden NAYS--19 Boozman Coats Cotton Crapo Cruz Daines Heller Inhofe Lankford Lee Moran Paul Risch Sasse Scott Sessions Shelby Toomey Vitter NOT VOTING--4 Blunt Corker Graham Rubio The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 77, the nays are 19. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to. Cloture having been invoked, the motion to refer falls. The Senator from Texas. Vote on Amendment No. 2690 Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I move to table the McConnell amendment No. 2690 for the purpose of offering my own amendment No. 2701, and I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There does not appear to be a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The motion was rejected. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas. [[Page S6967]] Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, there is a reason the American people are fed up with Washington. There is a reason the American people are frustrated. The frustration is not simply mild or passing or ephemeral; it is volcanic. Over and over again, the American people go to the ballot box. Over and over again, the American people rise and say: The direction we are going does not make sense; we want change. Over and over again, the American people win elections--in 2010, a tidal wave election; in 2014, a tidal wave election. Yet nothing changes in Washington. I would like to share with the Presiding Officer and the American people the real story of what is happening in Washington, why it is that our leaders cannot stop bankrupting this country, cannot stop the assault on our constitutional rights, cannot stop America's retreat from leadership in the world. It is a very simple dynamic when you have two sides allegedly in a political battle, one side that is relentlessly, unshakably committed to its principles and the other side that reflectively surrenders at the outset. The outcome is foreordained. I will give President Obama and the Senate Democrats credit. They believe in principles of Big Government. They believe in this relentless assault on our constitutional rights. They are willing to crawl over broken glass with a knife in between their teeth to fight for those principles. Unfortunately, leadership on my side of the aisle does not demonstrate the same commitment to principles. How is it, you might wonder, that a preemptive surrender is put in place? Well, it all begins with a relatively innocuous statement: There shall be no shutdowns. That is a statement leadership in both Houses-- Republican leadership in both Houses has said: We are not going to shut the government down. You can understand--to folks in the private sector, folks at home, that sounds pretty reasonable, except here is the reality in Washington. In today's Washington, there are three kinds of votes. No. 1, there are show votes--votes that are brought up largely to placate the voters, where the outcome is foreordained, where most Republicans will vote one way and most Democrats will vote the other. Republicans will lose, and the conservatives who elected Republican majorities in both Houses are supposed to be thrilled that they have been patted on the head and given their show vote that was destined to lose. We had a vote like that in recent weeks on Planned Parenthood. Leadership told us: You should be thrilled. We voted on it. What else do you want? We voted on it in a context where it would never happen. Indeed, it did not. The second kind of vote is a vote that simply grows government, dramatically expands spending, and expands corporate welfare. Those votes pass because you get a bipartisan coalition of Republican leadership and Democrats, both of whom are convinced that career politicians will get reelected if they keep growing and growing government and in particular handing out corporate welfare to giant corporations. Oh boy. If you have the lobbyists on K Street pushing for something, you can get 60, 70, 80 in this Chamber because Republican leadership loves it and Democrats are always willing to grow government. Then there is the third kind of vote--votes on must-pass legislation. In an era when one side--the Democratic Party--is adamantly committed to continuing down this path that is causing so many millions of Americans to hurt, must-pass votes are the only votes that have real consequence in this Chamber. They typically fall into one of three categories: either a continuing resolution, an omnibus appropriations bill, or a debt ceiling increase. All of those three are deemed must- pass votes. If you actually want to change law, those are the only hopes of doing so. But, as I mentioned before, you have one side who has preemptively surrendered. Republican leadership has said they will never ever shut down the government, and suddenly President Obama understands the easy key to winning every battle: He simply has to utter the word ``shutdown'' and Republican leadership runs to the hills. So President Obama demands of Congress: Fund every bit of ObamaCare--100 percent of it--and do nothing, zero, for the millions of Americans who are hurting, millions of Americans who have lost their jobs, who have lost their health care, who have lost their doctors, who have been forced into part-time work, the millions of young people who have seen their premiums skyrocket. President Obama: You can do nothing for the people who are hurting. Senate Democrats say: We don't care about the people who are hurting. We will do nothing for them. Here is the kicker. President Obama promises: If you try to do anything on ObamaCare, I, Barack Obama, will veto funding for the entire Federal Government and shut it down. Republican leadership compliantly says: OK. Fine. We will fund ObamaCare. President Obama then understands he has got a pretty good trump card here he can pull out at any time. So next he says: OK. Republicans, fund my unconstitutional Executive amnesty. It is contrary to law. It is flouting Federal immigration law. But you, Republicans, fund it anyway or else, I, Barack Obama, will veto funding for the entire Federal Government and shut it down. Republican leadership says at the outset: OK. We will fund amnesty. Now we turn to Planned Parenthood. Barack Obama--this will surprise no one--says: Fund 100 percent of Planned Parenthood with taxpayer money. Mind you, Planned Parenthood is a private organization. It is not even part of the government. But it happens to be politically favored by President Obama and the Democrats. Planned Parenthood is also the subject of multiple criminal investigations for being caught on tape apparently carrying out a pattern of ongoing felonies. In ordinary times, the proposition that we should not be sending your or my Federal taxpayer money to fund a private organization that is under multiple criminal investigations-- that ought to be a 100-to-0 vote. But, as I mentioned before, Barack Obama is absolutely committed to his partisan objectives. He is like the Terminator. He never stops. He never gives up. He moves forward and forward and forward. So what does he say? If you don't fund this one private organization that is not part of the government, that is under multiple criminal investigations, I, Barack Obama, will veto funding for the entire Federal Government and shut it down. What does Republican leadership say? Well, it will surprise no one. Republican leadership says: We surrender. We will fund Planned Parenthood. You know, President Obama has negotiated a catastrophic nuclear deal with Iran. Republican leadership goes on television all the time and rightly says: This is a catastrophic deal. The consequences are that it is the single greatest national security threat to America. Millions of Americans could die. I would suggest that if we actually believed the words that are coming out of our mouths, then we would be willing to use any and all constitutional authority given the Congress to stop a catastrophic deal that sends over $100 billion to Ayatollah Khamenei. Yet President Obama says he will veto the entire budget if we do, and, to the surprise of nobody, Republican leadership surrenders. You know, I will draw an analogy. It is as if at a football game, the beginning of the football game the two team captains go out to flip the coin. One team's coach walks out and says: We forfeit. They do it game after game after game right at the coin flip. Leadership says: We forfeit. We surrender. We, Republicans, will fund every single Big Government liberal priority of the Democrats. If an NFL team did that over 16 games, we know what their record would be; it would be 0 and 16. You know, I am pretty sure the fans who bought tickets and who went to the game would be pretty ticked off as they watched their coach forfeit over and over again. You want to understand the volcanic frustration with Washington? It is that Republican leadership in both Houses will not fight for a single priority we promised the voters we would fight for when we were campaigning less than a year ago. You know, this past week was a big news week in Washington. The Speaker [[Page S6968]] of the House, John Boehner, announced he was going to resign, and there was lots of speculation in the media as to why the Speaker of the House resigned. I am going to tell you why he resigned. It is actually a direct manifestation of this disconnect between the voters back home and Republican leadership. Speaker Boehner and Leader McConnell promised there will be no shutdown. Therefore, they will fund every single priority of Barack Obama. We are right now voting on what is called a clean CR. I would note it is clean only in the parlance of Washington, because what does it do? It funds 100 percent of ObamaCare, 100 percent of Executive amnesty. It funds all of Planned Parenthood, and it funds the Iranian nuclear deal. It is essentially a blank check to Barack Obama. That is not very clean to me. That actually sounds like a very dirty funding bill, funding priorities that are doing enormous damage. In the Senate the votes were always there for a dirty CR, a CR that funded all of Barack Obama's priorities. The Democrats will all vote for it--heck, of course they will. They have the other side funding their priorities. Of course, every Democrat will vote for that over and over and over and twice on Sunday. The simple reality on the Republican side is when leadership joins with the Democrats, about half of the Republican caucus is happy to move over to that side of the aisle. So the votes were always preordained. The motion I made just a moment ago was a motion to table the tree. You remember filling the tree. It is something we heard a lot about in the previous Congress. Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, did it all the time. Senators on this side of the aisle stood over and over and said: It is abuse of process. In fact, we even campaigned with our leadership saying: We are going to have an open amendment process. Yet what has happened here is that Majority Leader McConnell has taken a page out of Leader Reid's playbook and filled the tree. I moved to table the tree, and what you then saw was leadership denying a second. What does ``denying a second'' mean? Denying a recorded vote. Why is that important? When you are breaking the commitments you have made to the men and women who have elected you, the most painful thing in the world is accountability. When you are misleading the men and women who showed up to vote for you, you don't want sunshine making clear that you voted no. A recorded vote means each Senator's name is on it. Now, why did I move to table the tree? Simply to add the amendment that I had, which, No. 1, would have said that not one penny goes to Planned Parenthood, and No. 2, not one penny goes to implementing this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal unless and until they comply with Federal law--the administration complies with Federal law--and hands over the full deal, including the side agreements with Iran. What you saw was that Republican leadership desperately does not want a vote on that. Tomorrow I intend to make that motion again. And when I make that motion again, I would encourage those watching to see which Senators are here to give a second or not and to vote yea or nay. I would note that when you deny a second, which is truly an unprecedented procedural trick--it used to be that was a courtesy that was afforded to all Senators. Indeed, in the opposing party routinely over and over when a Democrat or Republican asked for a second, everyone raised their hand. But leadership has discovered: We can do this in the dark of the night. But I would encourage those watching to see, No. 1, when this motion is offered again, who shows up to offer a second and who either doesn't raise his hand or just doesn't come to the floor. One of the ways you avoid accountability is you are somehow somewhere else doing something very important instead of actually showing up for the battle that is waging right here and now. But I would also encourage people to watch very carefully what happens after that. After that you have a voice vote. A voice vote is still a vote. Let's be clear. Standing on the floor, there were two Senators--Senator Lee and I--who voted aye, who voted to table the tree and take up the amendment barring funding for Planned Parenthood and barring funding for this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. The remaining Senators on the Republican side--Leader McConnell, Whip Cornyn, Senator Alexander, and Senator Cotton--those four Senators loudly voted no. It is still a vote, even though it is not a recorded vote. It is a vote on the Senate floor. So why did Speaker Boehner resign? Well, I mentioned to you that the votes were always cooked here. The Democrats plus Republican leadership and the votes they bring with them ensure plenty of votes for a dirty CR, a CR that funds ObamaCare, that funds amnesty, that funds Planned Parenthood, that funds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. But the House was always the bulwark. The Presiding Officer will remember in 2013 when we had a fight over ObamaCare. The Presiding Officer was serving in the House at the time. In that fight we never had the votes in the Senate. Actually, the Senate was under control of the Democrats. They were going to do everything they could to defend ObamaCare regardless of the millions of people who were hurt. But the House was the bulwark in that fight, and in particular there was a core of 40 or 50 strong, principled conservatives who cared deeply about honoring the commitments they made to the men and women who elected them. That was always the strength we had in that fight. You know, it has been interesting reading some of the press coverage, speculating that there would be some magic parliamentary trick that would somehow stop this corrupt deal. Well, in the Senate there are no magic parliamentary tricks. When you have the Democrats plus Republican leadership and a chunk of the Republicans, those votes can roll over any parliamentary trick you might use. Even with the Blood Moon we just had, there are no mystical powers that allow you to roll over them. But in the House we still have those 30, 40, 50 strong conservatives. So how is it that Speaker Boehner and Leader McConnell could promise there will never, ever be a shutdown? Because, I believe, Speaker Boehner has decided to cut a deal with Leader Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democrats, that this dirty CR is going to be passed out of the Senate and is going to go to the House. The Speaker is going to take it up on the floor and pass it with all the Democrats--just as Leader McConnell did--and a handful of Republicans who will go with Republican leadership. A very significant percentage of Republicans will vote no. But here is the problem: Speaker Boehner has done that more than once. In this instance, there were too many Republicans who were tired of seeing their leadership lead the Democrats rather than lead the Republican Party. I believe if Speaker Boehner had done that--had passed a dirty CR funding Planned Parenthood, funding this Iranian nuclear deal--he would have lost his speakership. A Member of the House had introduced a motion to vacate the Chair because House Republicans were fed up with their leader not leading--at least not leading their party, leading the Democratic Party. So Speaker Boehner faced a conundrum. If he did what he and Leader McConnell promised, which is to fund all of Barack Obama's priorities, he would have lost his job. And so what did he do? He announced that he is resigning as Speaker and resigning as a Member of Congress. That is unsurprising, but it also telegraphs the deal that he has just cut. It is a deal to surrender and join with the Democrats. Notice he said he is going to stay a month. He is going to stay a month in order to join with the Democrats and fund Barack Obama's priorities. Now let's talk about some of the substantive issues that we ought to be talking about. Let's start with Planned Parenthood. In the past couple of months, a series of videos have come out about Planned Parenthood. To some of the people watching this, you may never have seen the videos. Why is that? Because the mainstream media has engaged in a virtual media blackout on them: ABC, NBC, CBS, the last thing they want to do is show these videos. If you watch FOX News, you can see the videos. But the mainstream media, in the great tradition of Pravda, wants [[Page S6969]] to make sure the citizenry doesn't see what is in these videos. I would encourage every American--Republican or Democrat--regardless of where you fall on the right to life, even--and, in fact, especially--if you consider yourself pro-choice--to just watch these videos. Go online and watch them and ask yourself: Are these my values? Is this what I believe? These videos show senior officials from Planned Parenthood laughing, sipping chardonnay and callously harvesting and selling the body parts of unborn children over and over and over. One senior official was caught on video laughing and saying she hopes she sells enough body parts of unborn children to buy herself a Lamborghini. Again, I would suggest to just ask yourself: Are these my values? In another video a lab tech describes a little baby boy--unborn, aborted, about 2 pounds, his heart still beating. She was instructed to insert scissors under his chin to cut open the face of this little boy and harvest his brain because the brain was valuable. Planned Parenthood could sell the brain. This is something out of ``Brave New World.'' These are human beings. That little boy had a heart that was still beating, had a brain that was being harvested. He had a soul given to him by God Almighty. He was made in the image of God. We are now a nation that harvests the body parts of little baby boys and girls. It is the very definition of inhumanity to treat children like agriculture, to be grown and killed for their body parts, to be sold for profit. There is a reason that the media and the Democrats don't want these videos shown, because anyone watching these videos will be horrified. But they are not just horrific; they are also prima facie evidence of criminal activity. There are multiple Federal statutes--criminal statutes--that Planned Parenthood appears to be violating, perhaps on a daily basis. The first and most direct is a prohibition on selling the body parts of unborn children for a profit. Federal criminal law makes that a felony with up to 10 years of jail time. Now these videos show them very clearly selling body parts. They also show them bartering a price. They will argue it wasn't for a profit. But you watch these videos. You watch the undercover buyer saying: How much will you give me for them? And you see the Planned Parenthood official saying: Well, how much can I get? I don't want to bargain against myself. On its face, that is evidence of bargaining for a profit. If you want the highest price you can get, it is not tied to your costs. It is tied to whatever dollars, whatever revenue you can bring in. Planned Parenthood is the largest abortion provider in the country. As another one of these videos reflects, it is a volume business--Planned Parenthood--taking the lives of unborn children and then selling them-- apparently for profit. It is also a Federal criminal offense to alter the means of an abortion for the purpose of harvesting the organs of the unborn child. That is a separate criminal offense. On video after video, you see Planned Parenthood officials saying: OK. What parts would you like? We can perform a different abortion depending on what parts you want us to harvest. On the videos they essentially admit to this crime. They are filmed in the act. There is the third criminal offense that provides that you cannot harvest the organs of an unborn child without informed consent from the mother. Yet again these videos seem to indicate that Planned Parenthood treats informed consent as a technicality that is sometimes complied with and sometimes ignored. Now, I will say as an aside that ordinarily, when a national organization is caught on film committing a pattern of felonies, the next steps are predictable: The Department of Justice opens an investigation; the FBI shows up and seizes their records. Everything on those videos suggests those felonies are still occurring today. What does it say about the Obama Justice Department that no one on the face of the planet believes there is any chance the Justice Department would even begin to investigate Planned Parenthood? What does it say about the most lawless partisan Department of Justice that there is this group that is a political ally of the President, so that is apparently all that matters. If it is an ally of the President, it doesn't matter that they are videotaped committing a felony. The Department of Justice will not even look at it. I am an alumnus of the U.S. Department of Justice. I was an Associate Deputy Attorney General. I spent much of my adult life working in law enforcement. The Department of Justice has a long, distinguished record of remaining outside of partisan politics, of staying above the partisan fray, of being blind to party or ideology and simply enforcing the law and the Constitution. I am sorry to say that under Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch, the Department of Justice has completely besmirched that tradition. No one remotely believes the Obama Justice Department will even begin to investigate this pattern of felonies. You don't see Democrats suggesting it. No one in the media suggests it. And by the way, if this were a Republican administration and the entity that admitted to a pattern of felonies was a private entity that supported Republicans, you would see on CBS, NBC, and ABC an indictment clock every night. You would see the anchors saying: When will this investigation be opened? When will they be indicted? Instead, the media pretends these videos don't exist. In the face of what appears to be a national criminal enterprise, we are faced here with a much simpler question: Will we continue to pay for it? Will we continue to pay for it with your and my tax dollars? Will we send $500 million a year to a private organization to use to fund this ongoing criminal organization? What is the position of the Democrats? Hear no evil, see no evil. They do not care. What Democrat do you see calling for the enforcement of criminal laws against Planned Parenthood? What Democrat do you hear saying, at a minimum, let's not send taxpayer money to fund this? Not one. Not a single Democrat stood up and said that. Let me ask you, Mr. President, what happens if Planned Parenthood gets indicted? Because even though the U.S. Department of Justice under President Obama has become little more than a partisan arm of the Democratic National Committee, there are State and local prosecutors who are investigating Planned Parenthood right now. If Planned Parenthood is indicted, will the Democrats maintain their wall of silence and say: We are going to continue to fund them under indictment. By all indications, that answer is yes. We haven't heard a single Democrat say: Well, if they are indicted, then we will stop. The response from our leadership is that we can't win this fight. That is their response. They say: Well, we can't win the Planned Parenthood fight. Why? Because we don't have 60 votes; because we don't have 67 votes. If that is the standard, then the Republican leadership standard is that we will do only what Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi approve of. That is what it means. You want to understand why the American people are frustrated? We were told: If only we had a Republican House of Representatives, then things would be different. In 2010, millions of us rose up in incredible numbers and won an historic tidal wave election. The Presiding Officer was a youth pastor, called to minister, yet he stood up and said: My country is in crisis. I am going to step forward and serve. The 2010 election was historic, yet very little changed. Then we were told: OK. We have a House of Representatives, but the problem is the Senate. As long as Harry Reid is majority leader, we can't do anything. Over and over again Washington gray beards would go on television, and in gravelly tones they would say: You cannot govern with one-half of one-third of government. The House of Representatives is not enough, but if we had the Senate, then things would be different. The problem is Harry Reid. The Presiding Officer will recall during the fight over ObamaCare a number of Members of this body--Republicans--said: No, no, no, no. We can't fight on ObamaCare. We have to wait until we have a Republican Senate to fight. So the American people obliged. In 2014, millions of us rose up for the second tidal wave election in a period of 4 years. We won nine Senate seats. [[Page S6970]] We retired Harry Reid as majority leader. We won the largest majority in the House of Representatives since the 1920s. It has been now over 9 months since we have had Republican majorities in both Houses, and I ask: What exactly have those Republican majorities accomplished? I have asked that question all over the country in townhalls. I have never been at a townhall where the response, spontaneous, was not absolutely nothing. That is true in every State I visit. And sadly, my response over and over again is: You know, it's worse than that. I wish the answer were absolutely nothing. It would have been better if the Republican majorities had done absolutely nothing because what, in fact, have they done? Well, the very first thing that happened, right after that election in November, is we came back to Washington, and Republican leadership joined up with Harry Reid and the Democrats and passed a trillion dollar CR omnibus bill that was filled with pork, corporate welfare, and grew government, grew the debt. Then Republican leadership took the lead in funding ObamaCare. Then Republican leadership took the lead in funding Executive amnesty. Then Republican leadership took the lead in funding Planned Parenthood. And then, astonishingly, Republican leadership took the lead in confirming Loretta Lynch as Attorney General. Now, I ask: Which one of those decisions is one iota different from what would have happened with Harry Reid and the Democrats in charge of this Chamber? Those decisions are identical. And I would note, by the way, with Loretta Lynch, the Republican majority could have defeated that nomination. The Senate majority leader could have done so. She looked at the Senate Judiciary Committee, and she looked at the Senate, and when asked how she would differ from Eric Holder's Justice Department--the most lawless and partisan Justice Department we would ever see--and she said: No way whatsoever. When asked to point to a single instance in which she would be willing to stand up to President Obama to stop his lawlessness, to stop his abuse of power, she could not identify any circumstance in which she would ever stand up to the President who appointed her. Attorneys general from both parties have done that, for centuries. Now, with Eric Holder, the Senate could be forgiven because his lawlessness manifested primarily after he was confirmed. With Loretta Lynch, she told us beforehand. She looked us in the eyes and said: Hey, I am going to do exactly what my predecessor has done. And Republican leadership confirmed her anyway. Is it any wonder the American people are frustrated out of their minds? We keep winning elections, and the people we put in office don't do what they said they would do. Now, some people across the country ask me: Is Republican leadership just not very capable? Are they not that competent or are they unwilling to fight? Mr. President, it is neither. They are actually quite competent, and they are willing to fight. The question becomes what they are fighting for. There is a disconnect right now. If you or I go to our home State and to any gathering of citizens and we put up a white board and we ask the citizens in the room to give the top priorities they think Republican majorities in Congress should be focusing on, and we wrote the 20 priorities that came from the citizens of Oklahoma or the citizens of Texas or, for that matter, the citizens of any of the 50 States, those top 20 priorities--at least 18 of them--would appear nowhere on the leadership's priority list. On the other hand, if you drive just down the street in Washington to K Street--K Street is the street in Washington where the lobbyists primarily reside, where their offices are--and you get a gathering of corporate lobbyists that represent giant corporations and ask them their top priorities, the list that comes out will not just bear passing similarity but will be identical to the priorities of the Republican leadership. That's the disconnect. Do you know why we are not here fighting on this? Because not giving taxpayer money to Planned Parenthood is not among the priorities of the lobbyists on K Street, so leadership is not interested in doing it. That is the disconnect. Leadership does know how to fight. Just a couple of months ago, in dealing with the Export-Import Bank, we saw leadership in both Chambers go to extraordinary lengths with Herculean procedural steps to reauthorize a classic example of corporate welfare--hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer-guaranteed loans to giant corporations. Now, for that, leadership is incentivized because those corporations hire lobbyists and those lobbyists distribute checks, typically by the wheelbarrow. There is no incentive greater in this body than getting reelected, and the view of leadership is that you get reelected by raking in the cash. How do you think we have gotten an $18 trillion national debt? Because the way you reach bipartisan compromise in this body today, in the broken world of Washington, is you grow and grow and grow government, and you sit around in a room and say: I will spend for your priority, your priority, your priority--another trillion dollars and we are done. The only people to lose are your children and mine. The only people to lose are the next generations who find themselves mired deeper and deeper and deeper in debt. I think of my little girls Caroline and Catherine. They are 7 and 4. If we don't stop what we are doing, your children and my children will face a debt so crushing they will not be able to spend in the future for the priorities of the future--for their needs, for their wants, for whatever crises come up that the next generation confronts. They will spend their whole lives simply working to pay off the debts racked up by their deadbeat parents and grandparents. No generation in history has ever done this to their children and grandchildren. Our parents didn't do it to us. Their parents didn't do it to them. The reason is the corruption of this town, and it boils down to a simple proposition: The Democrats are willing to do anything to push their priorities, and the Republicans, the leadership, are not listening to the men and women who elected us. But it is actually an even deeper problem than that. On the Democratic side, the major donors that fund the Democratic Party, they don't despise their base. The billionaires who write the giant checks that fund President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and the Democrats on that side of the aisle don't despise the radical gay rights movement or the radical environmentalist movement or all the people who knock on doors and get Democrats elected. The simple reality is a very large percentage of the Republican donors actively despise our base--actively despise the men and women who showed up and voted you and me into office. I can tell you, when you sit down and talk with a New York billionaire Republican donor--and I have talked with quite a few New York billionaire Republican donors, California Republican donors--their questions start out as follows. First of all, you have to come out for gay marriage, you need to be pro-choice, and you need to support amnesty. That is where the Republican donors are. You wonder why Republicans will not fight on any of these issues? Because the people writing the checks agree with the Democrats. Now mind you, the people who show up at the polls who elected you and me and who elected this Republican majority--far too many of the Republican donors look down on those voters as a bunch of ignorant hicks and rubes. It is why leadership likes show votes. It wasn't too long ago when the Washington cartel was able to mask it all with a show vote or two, and they told the rubes back home: See, we voted on it; we just don't have the votes. When I was first elected to this body, many times I heard more senior Senators saying some variation of the following: Now, Ted, that is what you tell folks back home. You don't actually do it. Here is what has changed. The voters have gotten more informed. They now understand the difference between show votes and a real vote. They understand the vote we had 1 week ago on Planned Parenthood was designed to lose, to placate those silly folks who think we shouldn't be sending taxpayer funds to a criminal organization that is selling the body parts of unborn children. But on the actual vote that could [[Page S6971]] change policy, leadership has no interest in fighting whatsoever. In the past couple of weeks, one of my colleagues sent me a letter that really embodied the leadership message. This letter said: ``Explain to me how you get 67 votes to defund Planned Parenthood. If you can't produce 67 votes, I won't support it.'' If that is our standard, then we should all be honest with the men and women who elected us: We do not have 67 Republican votes in this Chamber, and there is no realistic prospect of our getting 67 votes any time in the foreseeable future. If the standard is, unless we get 67 votes, Republican leadership will support no policy issue, then each of us when we run should tell the voters: If you vote for me, I will support whatever policy agenda Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi decide because that is my standard. If I don't have 67 votes--do you ever recall Harry Reid and the Democrats saying: How can we get Republican votes? No. Their side is absolutely committed to their principles. You don't see them holding back at all. If the standard is, how do we get 67 votes, name one thing that leadership will fight for. Well, the answer I mentioned, the three types of votes are they will fight for big government, they will fight to grow government, and they will fight to expand corporate welfare. Well, that can indeed get 67 votes. But I have never been to a townhall once where citizens said to me: The problem is we don't have enough corporate welfare. I need more subsidies for Big Business. If 100 percent of the agenda of Republican leadership is more subsidies for Big Business, what the heck are we doing in the Senate in the first place? That certainly wasn't why I ran, and I know it wasn't why you ran either. You don't have to win every fight, you don't have to fight every fight, but you do have to stand for something. Let's look beyond Planned Parenthood for a minute. Let's look to Iran. Of all the decisions the Obama administration has made, there may be none more damaging than this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. If this deal goes through, there will be three consequences: No. 1, the Obama administration will become, quite literally, the world's leading financier of radical Islamic terrorists. Now, when I said that a couple months ago, President Obama got very, very upset. He said it was ridiculous that I would say such a thing, but despite attacking me directly, President Obama didn't actually endeavor to refute the substance of what I said. So let's review the facts: Fact No. 1, Iran is today the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. That fact is undisputed even by this administration. Fact No. 2, if this deal goes through, over $100 billion will go directly to Iran to the Ayatollah Khamenei. Fact No. 3, if that happens, billions of those dollars will go to Hamas, to Hezbollah, to the Houthis, to radical Islamic terrorists across the globe who will use those billions to murder Americans, to murder Israelis, and to murder Europeans. It is worth remembering, 14 years ago this month, the horrific terrorist attack that was carried out on September 11. Osama bin Laden hated America, but he never had billions of dollars. He never had $100 billion. The Ayatollah Khamenei hates America every bit as much as Osama bin Laden did, and this administration is giving him control of over $100 billion. Imagine what bin Laden could have done. Look at the damage he did with 19 terrorists carrying box cutters. Now imagine that same zealotry with billions of dollars behind it. The consequences of this deal could easily be another terrorist attack that dwarfs September 11 in scale, that kills far more than the roughly 3,000 lives that were snuffed out. Who in their right mind would send over $100 billion to a theocratic zealot who chants ``Death to America''? A second consequence of his catastrophic deal is that we are abandoning four hostages--four American hostages--in Iranian jails: Pastor Saeed Abedini, an American citizen whose wife Naghmeh lives in Idaho. I have visited with Naghmeh many times. Pastor Saeed has two little kids who desperately want their daddy to come home. Pastor Saeed was sentenced to 8 years in prison for the crime of preaching the Gospel. Just last week was the 3-year anniversary of Pastor Saeed's imprisonment. Reports are that he is being horribly mistreated, that his health is failing, and yet President Obama cannot bring himself to utter the words ``Pastor Saeed Abedini''--$100 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, and Pastor Saeed Abedini remains in prison. Also in prison is Amir Hekmati, an American marine the President has abandoned. Also in prison is Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post reporter--I note to the reporters in the Gallery, a colleague of yours--abandoned by President Obama in an Iranian prison, thrown in jail for doing his job, reporting on the news--and Robert Levinson, whose whereabouts remain unknown. Why is the President refusing to even utter their names? The third consequence of this deal is this deal will only accelerate Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. The administration claims the deal will prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Why? Because they promised not to do it. We have learned from Iran, they break their promises over and over and over again. And what we do know is that they will have an extra $100 billion to develop nuclear weapons. Now, I will say the administration laughingly suggested: Well, they will use that on infrastructure, to rebuild their roads, to rebuild their energy industry. Right now they are sending vast sums to Hamas and Hezbollah, funding terrorism across the world, and they have those same infrastructure needs. With another $100 billion, you don't think they are going to funnel an awful lot of it to developing nuclear weapons? I would point out, it is not by accident that the Ayatollah Khamenei refers to Israel as the Little Satan and America as the Great Satan. This is the one threat on the face of the Earth that poses a real possibility of millions of Americans being murdered in the flash of an eye. Everything I am saying the Republican leadership has said over and over again. Yet Republican leadership refuses to enforce the terms of the Iran review legislation--Federal law that the administration is defying by not handing over the entire deal. I have laid out a clear path, a detailed path that leadership can follow to stop this deal, and leadership refuses to do so. Instead, we had a show vote that was designed to lose, and it did exactly what we expected. The Democrats, by and large, put party loyalty above the national security of this country, above standing with our friend and ally the nation of Israel, above protecting the lives of millions of Americans. If we truly believed what so many of us have said, that this poses the risk of murdering millions of Americans, is there any higher priority? The most powerful constitutional tool Congress has is the power of the purse. If we had the ability to stop this deal--and we don't--and millions of Americans die, how do we explain that to the men and women who elected us? I am not advocating that we fight willy-nilly. I am advocating that we fight on things that matter. Don't give $500 million to Planned Parenthood, a corrupt organization that is taking the lives of vast numbers of unborn children and selling their body parts, in a criminal conspiracy, directly contrary to Federal law. Don't give $100 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who seeks to murder millions. In both instances, those are defending life. Yet Republican leadership is not willing to lift a finger. If only all the people who might be murdered by a nuclear weapon could create a PAC in Washington and hire some lobbyists, maybe leadership would listen to them. But the truckdriver at home, the waitress at home, the schoolteacher at home, the pastor, the police officer, the working men and women--the Washington cartel does not listen to them. I will note where this deal is headed. In December, when this dirty continuing resolution expires, leadership is already foreshadowing that they plan to bust the budget caps. Why? We talked about it at the beginning. Barack Obama has discovered that when he says the word ``shutdown,'' the Republican leadership screams, surrenders, and runs to the hills. Obama, understanding that quite well, says: If you don't bust the budget caps, I will shut the government down. In this bizarre process, Republican leadership will blame whatever Obama [[Page S6972]] does on other Republicans. You noticed how much energy leader McConnell devotes to attacking conservatives? You notice how much energy Speaker Boehner devotes to attacking conservatives? Just yesterday the Speaker of the House went on national television, and on national television he directed an obscene epithet at me personally. He is welcome to insult whomever he likes. I don't intend to reciprocate. But when has leadership ever shown that level of venom, that level of animosity to President Obama and the Democrats who are bankrupting this country, who are destroying the Constitution, who are endangering the future of our children and grandchildren, who are retreating from leadership and the world, and who have created an environment that has led to the rise of radical Islamic terrorists? One of the dynamics we have seen in fight after fight is that Harry Reid and the Democrats sit back and laugh. Why? Because it is Republican leadership that leads the onslaught, attacking conservatives, saying: No, you can't, and we will not do anything to stop ObamaCare. No, you can't, and we will not do anything to stop amnesty. No, you can't, and we will not do anything to stop Planned Parenthood. No, you can't, and we will not do anything to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. If Republican leadership really believes we can accomplish nothing, then why does it matter if you have a Republican House or Senate? Every 2 years come October, November, we tell the voters it matters intensely. To paraphrase the immortal words of Hillary Clinton, what difference does it make if the standard for Republican leadership is, anything that gets 67 votes we will support. That means Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi remain the de facto leaders of the Senate and the House. I would note, by the way, if leadership goes through with their suggestion to bust the budget caps, they will have done something astonishing. Historically, the three legs of the conservative stool have been fiscal conservatives, social conservatives, and national security conservatives. Between Planned Parenthood, Iran, and the budget caps, leadership will have managed to abandon all three. No wonder the American people are frustrated. No wonder the American people do not understand why leadership isn't listening to them. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's postcloture time has expired. Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my time be extended. The Democrats are objecting to my speaking further, and both the Democrats and Republican leadership are objecting to the American people speaking further. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until the cloture vote on the motion to concur with an amendment in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 719 will be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees. The Senator from Illinois. Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, Wednesday night is the deadline. On Wednesday night, the authority of the government of the United States to do business ends. The funding for our government ends. It is a scary time. We don't want that to happen--most of us--because we know it will be catastrophic. There will be people who will suffer if we fail to do our job. Now, this isn't the first time we have been up against a deadline. We have faced them before, and many times we have to buy a little extra time to negotiate the budget. That is understandable. In this circumstance, though, we actually have announced candidates for the Presidency of the United States who are calling for a government shutdown. What happens when our government shuts down? Well, it is pretty obvious. Agencies stop doing business as usual. What we find, though, is that the impact goes far beyond just that simple statement. I went back to Illinois this last weekend, and I went for a visit to Scott Air Force Base. It is the largest single employer in the State of Illinois and downstate. In 2013--the last time we had a government shutdown--the junior Senator from Texas, Senator Ted Cruz, wanted to shut down our government to protest ObamaCare. So he successfully closed down the government and found other Republicans who would join him in that effort, and it went on for a long period of time. In 2013, at Scott Air Force Base, one of the most important defense facilities in our country, in Belleville, IL, we saw two-thirds of the civilian workforce--that is about 3,400 people--sent home immediately without pay. Those who were required to report for duty, including all of the base's 5,000 military personnel, would have been given IOUs rather than paychecks. Scott Air Force Base families were forced to limit their spending and stretch their savings while the Senator from Texas gave speeches on the floor about Dr. Seuss. I am not making this up. This had an impact on the entire region of Southwestern Illinois. Scott Air Force Base has a $1.6 billion economic impact on the local area, including supporting thousands of indirect jobs. Every part of this regional economy felt the impact of this decision to shut down the government 2 years ago--gas stations, restaurants, small businesses, contractors, everybody. Now, this brinksmanship goes far beyond flowery speeches on the floor and press attention. The last shutdown hurt the gross domestic product of the United States of America. Consumer confidence drops when the government shuts down. We saw $2 billion in lost productivity from furloughed employees. Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen said: We have a good recovery in place that's really making progress and to see Congress take actions that would endanger that progress, I think that would be more than unfortunate. So to me that's Congress' job. The CEO of JPMorgan Chase, a man named Jamie Dimon, speaking of the last Republican government shutdown, said, ``Washington has really slowed American down.'' I agree. And if that were the only thing that was happening, it would be bad enough. But there is more. Today I went to a neighborhood in Chicago, the All Saints Episcopal Church in Ravenswood. They are doing a restoration on this beautiful church built back in the 19th century. I met with the pastor there. We were at the food pantry of this church. This Episcopal Church tries to help neighborhood residents who are struggling to find enough to eat. We had a little press conference with the local Congressman, Mike Quigley and Jan Schakowsky, and people who represented the food pantries of Chicago in that area. They are worried about a shutdown and what a shutdown means to them. How would it affect the All Saints Episcopal Church food pantry and the men and women who go in there on a regular basis to pick up some canned goods to get by? Here is what it means. Many of these people are on food stamps. We call it the SNAP program now. The SNAP program, on average, gives a person food worth $7 a day, so the notion that people are going out for steak dinners on food stamps is not quite accurate. Sara--and I won't use her full name--who is 81 years old, came up to talk about what life is like for her. She was a hard-working person, stricken with cancer in 2002, which recurred in 2004, and she had to quit working. She has a walker now and she gets around, but all she has is her Social Security check and food stamps. That is how she survives from week to week and month to month. What happens when there is a government shutdown? They cut off food stamps. Did that happen last time? No. The last time the Senator from Texas shut down the government, it didn't happen because President Obama had a surplus in his recovery fund and he took the surplus and put it in the food stamps so there would be no interruption of service. You see, most of the recipients of food stamps are children. Single moms raising kids and not making enough money supplement their income with food stamps and buy food for their kids. Food stamps are also used by elderly people like Sara who are struggling on a fixed income. This time is different. If these Presidential wannabes who are determined to shut down the government this time are successful, we are going to have problems right away. It turns out the only surplus left in the food stamp or SNAP benefit fund is about $3 billion. That will keep the program going for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, they cut off the food stamps. What does that mean? Well, for a lot of people it means a lot of suffering--primarily for the poorest people among us. Did anyone notice last week what happened in Washington? The city was transformed by the visit of Pope Francis. Congress was in awe of this man who came and spoke to us in very human terms about what he thinks would be our obligation, not just as elected officials but as human beings. One of his highest priorities is that we have some caring and sensitivity for those who struggle--the poor, the people on food stamps. So for all the applause and all of the posing for pictures that went on last week with the Pope, here we are this week discussing a government shutdown. Here we are this week discussing whether we are going to cut off food stamps for poor people in America. It is a sad reality to think of what a government shutdown would do in human terms to those wonderful folks working at Scott Air Force Base in Belleville, IL, or to Sara who will go into the All Saints Episcopal Church food pantry and try to get by, as food stamps are cut off. Why? Why would we do that? How can we possibly be serving this Nation--this great Nation--by stalling our economy and hurting innocent people and punishing those who are serving our country in uniform and otherwise? Some think it is a grand strategy--a great political strategy. It may move [[Page S6964]] them up from the smaller debate to the big-time debate when it comes to running for President. To me it is an indication we have lost our way. In June, I joined with the other leaders on this side of the aisle in sending a letter to the Republican leader saying: Please, don't wait until the end of September to face this budget reality. Sit down now-- back in June--with the President, with the leaders on the Republican side and the Democratic side. Let us compromise in good faith. Let us meet our responsibilities. Well, that is what we face. As Senator Reid said a few minutes earlier, there is a suggestion that maybe as a parting gift to Speaker Boehner we will extend the budget temporarily until December 11, 2 weeks before Christmas, just days before the Hanukkah season--that we would extend the budget until then and then, once again, be up against the deadline and the prospect of shutting down our government. We can do better. We should do better. We need to make certain we keep faith with the people who send us here. We need to make certain we do our job--not just to send a continuing resolution to the President but to resolve this issue. We should not be threatening a government shutdown now or in December when we know how devastating that can be. I hope Congress gets busy taking care of the work we were sent here to do. I think it is time for those bipartisan budget negotiations. It is beyond time. Now is the time for Congress to act responsibly to develop a budget that allows America to thrive. Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I wish to talk about an amendment I plan to offer in a little while, once somebody comes from our side or the other side because they would like to be here to talk about it with me, as I understand it--maybe even to object to it, maybe to agree with it. But I wish to speak about the amendment, if I could, for a moment. Right now, we are debating the continuing resolution. This would be to continue a level of spending from now until December 11. There are a bunch of changes in that from last year's spending, but it is basically a continuation of the previous year until we can work out our differences. It is not the way to govern around here. What we should be doing instead is having individual spending bills come up. There are 12 different appropriations bills. The ideal way to handle this is the way it used to be done, which is that the Appropriations Committee and its subcommittees deal with these individual spending bills. For instance, one is for Commerce, the State Department, and the Justice Department. One is for the Department of Health and Human Services, and one is for the Department of Defense. When we do that, what happens is we have oversight hearings, and we have Congress playing its rightful role of saying: Are these agencies doing the right thing? Are these programs working or aren't they working? We might increase spending with a program that is actually working well, decrease spending from another program, and eliminate a third program that is not working well at all. That is what Congress is supposed to do. That is our job here. Under the Constitution, Congress was given the power of the purse, meaning that every dime has to be appropriated by the Congress. What has happened over the years--particularly in the last several years--is that Congress has not moved forward on these appropriations bills because they have been blocked. In this case, this year we have been trying to bring up appropriations bills and the other side, the Democrats, have been blocking even considering an appropriations bill. We have had this debate here on the floor. Many of us have heard it. But the bottom line is the committees have actually done their work and reported out 12 different appropriations bills. So 12 bills are ready to come to the floor. By the way, most of these bills have been reported out with huge bipartisan majorities. I saw one the other day. It was 24 to 3, for instance. I know the Presiding Officer has been involved in some of these issues over the years. It is typical, actually, that appropriators do their jobs. Senator Mikulski, Senator Cochran, and others work out the differences, but we simply can't get them voted on on the floor. People may say: Why can't you? Well, because it requires 60 votes. We have to overcome a 60-vote hurdle in order to even proceed to the legislation. So we haven't been able to vote on a single appropriations bill before September 30, which is the fiscal year-end and which is coming up this week. It is no way to run a railroad, much less a government--by the way, the government that has the biggest budget of any government in the world, the government of the greatest nation in the world. We can't even bring these individual spending bills up here for a debate and a vote. It is just wrong. Again, when we don't do that, what we don't have is the oversight. I would think both sides would want to have oversight over these agencies and departments so we understand what is working and what is not working and so that those tax dollars are spent wisely. That is the kind of stewardship that we are responsible for. As taxpayers, as representatives of taxpayers, we should want to be sure those dollars are spent in a way that is most effective. Yet, without having these appropriations bills, it is just impossible to do. Instead, we are faced with this possibility of on September 30 not having any of what is called discretionary spending, which is not all of the spending of government, but it is the spending that Congress appropriates every year, and having the possibility of parts of government actually not being able to operate because September 30 is the fiscal year-end. It is just the wrong way to do business. So the amendment I am going to offer later this afternoon is an amendment that simply says: Let's adopt a new bill, new legislation that says: Let's end government shutdowns. How would we do it? We would say that as of September 30, if there is any bill that is not passed, any one of the 12--remember that this year none of the 12 were passed--none of them. But on any year, if any one of those were not passed, then we would simply continue the spending from the previous year, but there would be a reduction in that spending over time. After 120 days there would be a 1-percent reduction, giving 120 days to work with the Appropriations Committee to say: OK, we know you don't want to see the spending cut, and we know you have priorities you would like to fund, but it is going to be cut 1 percent after 120 days, then 1 percent after the next 90 days, 1 percent after the next 90 days, and 1 percent after the next 90 days. So we get to a point where we have to see a reduction in spending every year, which is not necessarily a bad thing because Congress spends more than it takes in every year. But if appropriators and others here in Congress don't want to see that, they would have to get their act together and actually pass appropriations bills. Once an appropriations bill is passed, the End Government Shutdowns Act would not apply. This seems to me to be a really logical bipartisan commonsense solution to the problem that we are facing here. Again, the problem is Congress is not doing its work. We are not getting these appropriations bills done. It is not for lack of work in the committees this year. Again, all 12 bills were reported out of committee. I believe the same is true in the House. Yet we cannot get here on the floor of the Senate the 60 votes needed to come up with the ability to proceed to these appropriations bills. It is called a filibuster. They are being filibustered. We are not even debating them. This is just wrong. I think, again, the way to get around that is to say: OK, if you want to try to block these bills, what is going to happen is we are going to have automatic spending from last year with no increases--in fact, decreases--and decreasing more over time, until Congress gets its act together and actually passes this legislation. This idea is so commonsense that when we had a vote on it a couple of years ago, when I was able to bring it [[Page S6965]] up for a vote--and we will see tonight whether I am permitted to do that--we actually had 46 Senators support it. Now, not everybody supported it on the Appropriations Committee. Some of them obviously had concerns about it. Not every Republican supported it. There were a few Republicans who didn't support it. By the way, one Republican who didn't support it last time is now a cosponsor of the legislation because she has looked at it, she has understood the system is not working, and she has been persuaded it is the right way to go. It was bipartisan last time. Senator Tester and I were the two cosponsors of it. So I hope I will have the opportunity to offer that amendment here this afternoon because I think it makes all the sense in the world. As we are debating a continuing resolution again, the so-called CR--which is the wrong way to govern--let's also pass as part of that a new discipline, a new idea, a new approach that says: Let's not do this again. Let's not ever have the threat of a government shutdown hanging over us. Instead, come September 30, if an appropriations bill isn't done, fine, continue the spending from last year, with a slow ratcheting down of that spending. I think that makes all the sense in the world. It takes away this political football that is being thrown back and forth. It takes away the specter for our economy, for our businesses, and for our families of not knowing whether they are going to have this government operation continue after September 30 in whatever area is affecting our economy or those businesses or those families. I think it makes a lot of sense, and I think it provides an incentive for Congress to get its work done. And Congress should be doing every year all 12 appropriations bills--doing the oversight that goes into that, deciding what gets more money, what gets less money, what gets thrown out altogether. It doesn't make any sense. In the huge bureaucracy of the vast Federal Government, not every program is perfect. Let's be honest; a lot of them need reform. If we don't have this process of the power of the purse--the leverage of the power of the purse to be able to say ``Prove this program is working,'' and when it doesn't, ``We are going to pull the funding away''--you lose the ability for Congress to be an effective partner with the executive branch and the judicial branch the way our Founders set it up. Again, Congress alone has the power of the purse. Every dime has to be appropriated by this Congress, and Congress is not doing its job. This amendment, if we put in place this new practice, would be a tremendous help to get Congress back on track. It wasn't too long ago that this happened. I have been here almost 5 years now or 4\1/2\ years. We haven't had a single year where all the appropriations bills were done. In fact, very few appropriations bills have been voted on at all. This year not a single appropriations bill--zero--has come to the floor of the Senate because they have been blocked. They have all come out of committee now, but not a single one is allowed to get voted on here in the Senate. I do hope that my own leadership on the Republican side will keep bringing these bills up. At least then we have an opportunity to talk about them--what is in the bills and why it is a good idea for us to have the oversight. Again, the reforms to these programs--the spending cuts, the spending increases for programs that are working well, the elimination altogether of programs that aren't working--we should at least have the opportunity to discuss them and talk about it. I was hopeful we would see a colleague from the other side of the aisle show up or a member of the Appropriations Committee. I was told I could give this little talk at 5, and I had the opportunity to offer this amendment. I will have to come back later and offer it again. I don't know if my colleague from Iowa is planning to speak---- Mr. GRASSLEY. No. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, earlier I had the opportunity to talk a little about the amendment I am about to offer. This is an amendment to the underlying bill, which is a continuing resolution. The amendment has to do with a piece of legislation called the End Government Shutdowns Act. Excuse me. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to speak for 5 minutes in order to finish the conversation that we started earlier this evening. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I talked about the fact that here we are, once again, without the appropriations bills done and forced to do a continuing resolution from now until December 11, and that is because later this week, on September 30, when the fiscal year ends and comes to a close, we will not have done the appropriations bills. It is not that we haven't done one or two or three; we haven't done any of them, and there are 12 of them. I think it is time for us to take a new approach; that is, to have an end government shutdowns discipline put before this Congress which says: Any time you get to this point with any of the appropriations bills--including now where we have all of them--that we instead have a continuation of last year's spending but that it ratchets down over time to provide an incentive for all of us in Congress--Democrats and Republicans alike, the Appropriations Committee, and all of us--to get our work done and to do our job under the Constitution. The power of the purse is exclusively delegated to the Congress. It will help us to get our job done if we had this by having the end government shutdowns discipline in place. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment and call up my amendment No. 2702, the end government shutdowns amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. COCHRAN. Reserving the right to object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi. Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if I understand the Senator's suggestion correctly, his amendment would create an automatic continuing resolution to fund the Federal Government in the event an annual appropriations bill is not enacted by the time the fiscal year expires. That may sound harmless enough, but what we are saying is that not only is the power of the Senate suspended and put on hold but the obligations of the committee system are put under a threat--that unless you complete action on legislation that is referred to the committee of jurisdiction by a certain time, you are out of business, and whoever wants to offer an amendment as a substitute gets to offer that and pass it on a majority vote. We are already required to have three-fifths of the Members vote to cut off debate in order to be sure that all Senators--not just a bare majority--get to decide the decisions of the Senate and get to actively participate in the process by offering amendments. My friend's amendment abolishes offering any other alternatives for a full debate--unlimited debate--which is why the Senate is here, to cool down the passions of the moment. A Senator might have a good idea and want to change a law, repeal a resolution, deny access to Federal funds for this, that or the other that goes to a State that is very important, and their interests are just as important. This is a terrible amendment, and it ought to be rejected. I hope the Senator will withhold offering the amendment. We can have hearings on this and see what other Senators may think about it, but at first blush, this seems like this is an amendment whose time has not come. We are not ready to dismantle the rules of the Senate piece by piece. Well, we have the right of unlimited debate, and Senators can talk as long as they wish to. We don't have to go through a rules committee to get permission or get permission from any other Senator. These are direct responsibilities of individual Senators selected by their States to stand up for their interests, not to go to Washington and cave in on something that might be a good-sounding amendment [[Page S6966]] or might have the passions of the moment behind it so that there appears to be a wave of support, but until you have a chance to seriously consider the individual issues involved, until three-fifths of the Senate decides to cut off debate--I strongly object to this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. COCHRAN. I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my friend and my colleague, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I look forward to talking to him more about this. As I said earlier, 46 Senators supported this in the past, including all but two or three Republicans, by the way, and one of them is now a cosponsor of the legislation. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call under rule XXII be waived with respect to today's cloture vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I wish to have 1 minute in order to debate the matter that is before us. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Illinois. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I stand with the Senator from Mississippi. We may be from opposite political parties, but I certainly agree with him that the suggestion by the Senator from Ohio does not serve the best interests of this country. Imagine if his proposal went through and we were faced with inadequate funding for medical care for our veterans. I am sorry to say the Senator from Ohio has suggested that we would have last year's level of funding with potentially a 4-percent cut. It would be the same for fighting fires and the National Institutes of Health. There would be a 4-percent cut in medical research. I think what we are doing, if we accept this approach, is giving up our responsibility that the taxpayers sent us to carry out; that is, to make careful choices when it comes to budgets. I just want to be on the record supporting my colleague from Mississippi. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I hadn't planned to have a debate on this, but I am happy to have one. Let me just be very clear. This is about putting the Appropriations Committee in business, not out of business. This is not about cutting spending; it is about forcing Congress to get its work done. Here we sit about to pass a continuing resolution because none of the 12 appropriations bills has been voted on because each of them has been blocked in the Senate. The committee has done its work. Yet we can't get them to the floor. Yet we have the other side saying: Gosh, this would somehow hurt the process. How can the process be hurt any worse? We want the process to work, and that is why 46 of us, on a bipartisan basis, have supported this idea. What it says is, if at the end of the day, on September 30, appropriations bills have not been passed, then we would simply continue the spending from last year, and, yes, over time we would ratchet it down, giving 120 days for the committee to get its act together that it did not in the previous year when it was supposed to, to get these bills done, to do the oversight, and to make the decisions about NIH, as the Senator has said, and to make the decisions about our veterans. If we truly want to help our veterans, a CR is not the way to do it. The way to do it is to let the VA bill come to the floor, have a debate, and take the committee's good ideas--and, by the way, it came out of committee with a large bipartisan vote. That is how we should be legislating. That is our job. The power of the purse resides exclusively with us. Yet once again this year we are not doing our job. It is not that we are just doing a couple of appropriations bills; we are not doing a single appropriations bill. I think it is time for us to change course and that is what this legislation is about. I am simply saying that in the process of passing the CR, which we now have to do, set up a discipline for the future that provides an incentive for us to get our work done so the good work being done by Senator Cochran and others--including Senator Mikulski--in the Appropriations Committee can come to the floor for a vote, and we can get back to governing. I yield back. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request to waive the mandatory quorum? Mr. DURBIN. No objection. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Cloture Motion Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. The bill clerk read as follows: Cloture Motion We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 719 with an amendment, No. 2689. Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, Orrin G. Hatch, Pat Roberts, Johnny Isakson, Michael B. Enzi, Cory Gardner, John Barrasso, Lindsey Graham, Lamar Alexander, Thad Cochran, Chuck Grassley, Kelly Ayotte, Susan M. Collins, Deb Fischer, Richard Burr. The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 719 with amendment No. 2689, offered by the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Blunt), the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Corker), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Graham), and the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio). The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 77, nays 19, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 271 Leg.] YEAS--77 Alexander Ayotte Baldwin Barrasso Bennet Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Burr Cantwell Capito Cardin Carper Casey Cassidy Cochran Collins Coons Cornyn Donnelly Durbin Enzi Ernst Feinstein Fischer Flake Franken Gardner Gillibrand Grassley Hatch Heinrich Heitkamp Hirono Hoeven Isakson Johnson Kaine King Kirk Klobuchar Leahy Manchin Markey McCain McCaskill McConnell Menendez Merkley Mikulski Murkowski Murphy Murray Nelson Perdue Peters Portman Reed Reid Roberts Rounds Sanders Schatz Schumer Shaheen Stabenow Sullivan Tester Thune Tillis Udall Warner Warren Whitehouse Wicker Wyden NAYS--19 Boozman Coats Cotton Crapo Cruz Daines Heller Inhofe Lankford Lee Moran Paul Risch Sasse Scott Sessions Shelby Toomey Vitter NOT VOTING--4 Blunt Corker Graham Rubio The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 77, the nays are 19. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to. Cloture having been invoked, the motion to refer falls. The Senator from Texas. Vote on Amendment No. 2690 Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I move to table the McConnell amendment No. 2690 for the purpose of offering my own amendment No. 2701, and I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There does not appear to be a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The motion was rejected. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas. [[Page S6967]] Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, there is a reason the American people are fed up with Washington. There is a reason the American people are frustrated. The frustration is not simply mild or passing or ephemeral; it is volcanic. Over and over again, the American people go to the ballot box. Over and over again, the American people rise and say: The direction we are going does not make sense; we want change. Over and over again, the American people win elections--in 2010, a tidal wave election; in 2014, a tidal wave election. Yet nothing changes in Washington. I would like to share with the Presiding Officer and the American people the real story of what is happening in Washington, why it is that our leaders cannot stop bankrupting this country, cannot stop the assault on our constitutional rights, cannot stop America's retreat from leadership in the world. It is a very simple dynamic when you have two sides allegedly in a political battle, one side that is relentlessly, unshakably committed to its principles and the other side that reflectively surrenders at the outset. The outcome is foreordained. I will give President Obama and the Senate Democrats credit. They believe in principles of Big Government. They believe in this relentless assault on our constitutional rights. They are willing to crawl over broken glass with a knife in between their teeth to fight for those principles. Unfortunately, leadership on my side of the aisle does not demonstrate the same commitment to principles. How is it, you might wonder, that a preemptive surrender is put in place? Well, it all begins with a relatively innocuous statement: There shall be no shutdowns. That is a statement leadership in both Houses-- Republican leadership in both Houses has said: We are not going to shut the government down. You can understand--to folks in the private sector, folks at home, that sounds pretty reasonable, except here is the reality in Washington. In today's Washington, there are three kinds of votes. No. 1, there are show votes--votes that are brought up largely to placate the voters, where the outcome is foreordained, where most Republicans will vote one way and most Democrats will vote the other. Republicans will lose, and the conservatives who elected Republican majorities in both Houses are supposed to be thrilled that they have been patted on the head and given their show vote that was destined to lose. We had a vote like that in recent weeks on Planned Parenthood. Leadership told us: You should be thrilled. We voted on it. What else do you want? We voted on it in a context where it would never happen. Indeed, it did not. The second kind of vote is a vote that simply grows government, dramatically expands spending, and expands corporate welfare. Those votes pass because you get a bipartisan coalition of Republican leadership and Democrats, both of whom are convinced that career politicians will get reelected if they keep growing and growing government and in particular handing out corporate welfare to giant corporations. Oh boy. If you have the lobbyists on K Street pushing for something, you can get 60, 70, 80 in this Chamber because Republican leadership loves it and Democrats are always willing to grow government. Then there is the third kind of vote--votes on must-pass legislation. In an era when one side--the Democratic Party--is adamantly committed to continuing down this path that is causing so many millions of Americans to hurt, must-pass votes are the only votes that have real consequence in this Chamber. They typically fall into one of three categories: either a continuing resolution, an omnibus appropriations bill, or a debt ceiling increase. All of those three are deemed must- pass votes. If you actually want to change law, those are the only hopes of doing so. But, as I mentioned before, you have one side who has preemptively surrendered. Republican leadership has said they will never ever shut down the government, and suddenly President Obama understands the easy key to winning every battle: He simply has to utter the word ``shutdown'' and Republican leadership runs to the hills. So President Obama demands of Congress: Fund every bit of ObamaCare--100 percent of it--and do nothing, zero, for the millions of Americans who are hurting, millions of Americans who have lost their jobs, who have lost their health care, who have lost their doctors, who have been forced into part-time work, the millions of young people who have seen their premiums skyrocket. President Obama: You can do nothing for the people who are hurting. Senate Democrats say: We don't care about the people who are hurting. We will do nothing for them. Here is the kicker. President Obama promises: If you try to do anything on ObamaCare, I, Barack Obama, will veto funding for the entire Federal Government and shut it down. Republican leadership compliantly says: OK. Fine. We will fund ObamaCare. President Obama then understands he has got a pretty good trump card here he can pull out at any time. So next he says: OK. Republicans, fund my unconstitutional Executive amnesty. It is contrary to law. It is flouting Federal immigration law. But you, Republicans, fund it anyway or else, I, Barack Obama, will veto funding for the entire Federal Government and shut it down. Republican leadership says at the outset: OK. We will fund amnesty. Now we turn to Planned Parenthood. Barack Obama--this will surprise no one--says: Fund 100 percent of Planned Parenthood with taxpayer money. Mind you, Planned Parenthood is a private organization. It is not even part of the government. But it happens to be politically favored by President Obama and the Democrats. Planned Parenthood is also the subject of multiple criminal investigations for being caught on tape apparently carrying out a pattern of ongoing felonies. In ordinary times, the proposition that we should not be sending your or my Federal taxpayer money to fund a private organization that is under multiple criminal investigations-- that ought to be a 100-to-0 vote. But, as I mentioned before, Barack Obama is absolutely committed to his partisan objectives. He is like the Terminator. He never stops. He never gives up. He moves forward and forward and forward. So what does he say? If you don't fund this one private organization that is not part of the government, that is under multiple criminal investigations, I, Barack Obama, will veto funding for the entire Federal Government and shut it down. What does Republican leadership say? Well, it will surprise no one. Republican leadership says: We surrender. We will fund Planned Parenthood. You know, President Obama has negotiated a catastrophic nuclear deal with Iran. Republican leadership goes on television all the time and rightly says: This is a catastrophic deal. The consequences are that it is the single greatest national security threat to America. Millions of Americans could die. I would suggest that if we actually believed the words that are coming out of our mouths, then we would be willing to use any and all constitutional authority given the Congress to stop a catastrophic deal that sends over $100 billion to Ayatollah Khamenei. Yet President Obama says he will veto the entire budget if we do, and, to the surprise of nobody, Republican leadership surrenders. You know, I will draw an analogy. It is as if at a football game, the beginning of the football game the two team captains go out to flip the coin. One team's coach walks out and says: We forfeit. They do it game after game after game right at the coin flip. Leadership says: We forfeit. We surrender. We, Republicans, will fund every single Big Government liberal priority of the Democrats. If an NFL team did that over 16 games, we know what their record would be; it would be 0 and 16. You know, I am pretty sure the fans who bought tickets and who went to the game would be pretty ticked off as they watched their coach forfeit over and over again. You want to understand the volcanic frustration with Washington? It is that Republican leadership in both Houses will not fight for a single priority we promised the voters we would fight for when we were campaigning less than a year ago. You know, this past week was a big news week in Washington. The Speaker [[Page S6968]] of the House, John Boehner, announced he was going to resign, and there was lots of speculation in the media as to why the Speaker of the House resigned. I am going to tell you why he resigned. It is actually a direct manifestation of this disconnect between the voters back home and Republican leadership. Speaker Boehner and Leader McConnell promised there will be no shutdown. Therefore, they will fund every single priority of Barack Obama. We are right now voting on what is called a clean CR. I would note it is clean only in the parlance of Washington, because what does it do? It funds 100 percent of ObamaCare, 100 percent of Executive amnesty. It funds all of Planned Parenthood, and it funds the Iranian nuclear deal. It is essentially a blank check to Barack Obama. That is not very clean to me. That actually sounds like a very dirty funding bill, funding priorities that are doing enormous damage. In the Senate the votes were always there for a dirty CR, a CR that funded all of Barack Obama's priorities. The Democrats will all vote for it--heck, of course they will. They have the other side funding their priorities. Of course, every Democrat will vote for that over and over and over and twice on Sunday. The simple reality on the Republican side is when leadership joins with the Democrats, about half of the Republican caucus is happy to move over to that side of the aisle. So the votes were always preordained. The motion I made just a moment ago was a motion to table the tree. You remember filling the tree. It is something we heard a lot about in the previous Congress. Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, did it all the time. Senators on this side of the aisle stood over and over and said: It is abuse of process. In fact, we even campaigned with our leadership saying: We are going to have an open amendment process. Yet what has happened here is that Majority Leader McConnell has taken a page out of Leader Reid's playbook and filled the tree. I moved to table the tree, and what you then saw was leadership denying a second. What does ``denying a second'' mean? Denying a recorded vote. Why is that important? When you are breaking the commitments you have made to the men and women who have elected you, the most painful thing in the world is accountability. When you are misleading the men and women who showed up to vote for you, you don't want sunshine making clear that you voted no. A recorded vote means each Senator's name is on it. Now, why did I move to table the tree? Simply to add the amendment that I had, which, No. 1, would have said that not one penny goes to Planned Parenthood, and No. 2, not one penny goes to implementing this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal unless and until they comply with Federal law--the administration complies with Federal law--and hands over the full deal, including the side agreements with Iran. What you saw was that Republican leadership desperately does not want a vote on that. Tomorrow I intend to make that motion again. And when I make that motion again, I would encourage those watching to see which Senators are here to give a second or not and to vote yea or nay. I would note that when you deny a second, which is truly an unprecedented procedural trick--it used to be that was a courtesy that was afforded to all Senators. Indeed, in the opposing party routinely over and over when a Democrat or Republican asked for a second, everyone raised their hand. But leadership has discovered: We can do this in the dark of the night. But I would encourage those watching to see, No. 1, when this motion is offered again, who shows up to offer a second and who either doesn't raise his hand or just doesn't come to the floor. One of the ways you avoid accountability is you are somehow somewhere else doing something very important instead of actually showing up for the battle that is waging right here and now. But I would also encourage people to watch very carefully what happens after that. After that you have a voice vote. A voice vote is still a vote. Let's be clear. Standing on the floor, there were two Senators--Senator Lee and I--who voted aye, who voted to table the tree and take up the amendment barring funding for Planned Parenthood and barring funding for this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. The remaining Senators on the Republican side--Leader McConnell, Whip Cornyn, Senator Alexander, and Senator Cotton--those four Senators loudly voted no. It is still a vote, even though it is not a recorded vote. It is a vote on the Senate floor. So why did Speaker Boehner resign? Well, I mentioned to you that the votes were always cooked here. The Democrats plus Republican leadership and the votes they bring with them ensure plenty of votes for a dirty CR, a CR that funds ObamaCare, that funds amnesty, that funds Planned Parenthood, that funds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. But the House was always the bulwark. The Presiding Officer will remember in 2013 when we had a fight over ObamaCare. The Presiding Officer was serving in the House at the time. In that fight we never had the votes in the Senate. Actually, the Senate was under control of the Democrats. They were going to do everything they could to defend ObamaCare regardless of the millions of people who were hurt. But the House was the bulwark in that fight, and in particular there was a core of 40 or 50 strong, principled conservatives who cared deeply about honoring the commitments they made to the men and women who elected them. That was always the strength we had in that fight. You know, it has been interesting reading some of the press coverage, speculating that there would be some magic parliamentary trick that would somehow stop this corrupt deal. Well, in the Senate there are no magic parliamentary tricks. When you have the Democrats plus Republican leadership and a chunk of the Republicans, those votes can roll over any parliamentary trick you might use. Even with the Blood Moon we just had, there are no mystical powers that allow you to roll over them. But in the House we still have those 30, 40, 50 strong conservatives. So how is it that Speaker Boehner and Leader McConnell could promise there will never, ever be a shutdown? Because, I believe, Speaker Boehner has decided to cut a deal with Leader Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democrats, that this dirty CR is going to be passed out of the Senate and is going to go to the House. The Speaker is going to take it up on the floor and pass it with all the Democrats--just as Leader McConnell did--and a handful of Republicans who will go with Republican leadership. A very significant percentage of Republicans will vote no. But here is the problem: Speaker Boehner has done that more than once. In this instance, there were too many Republicans who were tired of seeing their leadership lead the Democrats rather than lead the Republican Party. I believe if Speaker Boehner had done that--had passed a dirty CR funding Planned Parenthood, funding this Iranian nuclear deal--he would have lost his speakership. A Member of the House had introduced a motion to vacate the Chair because House Republicans were fed up with their leader not leading--at least not leading their party, leading the Democratic Party. So Speaker Boehner faced a conundrum. If he did what he and Leader McConnell promised, which is to fund all of Barack Obama's priorities, he would have lost his job. And so what did he do? He announced that he is resigning as Speaker and resigning as a Member of Congress. That is unsurprising, but it also telegraphs the deal that he has just cut. It is a deal to surrender and join with the Democrats. Notice he said he is going to stay a month. He is going to stay a month in order to join with the Democrats and fund Barack Obama's priorities. Now let's talk about some of the substantive issues that we ought to be talking about. Let's start with Planned Parenthood. In the past couple of months, a series of videos have come out about Planned Parenthood. To some of the people watching this, you may never have seen the videos. Why is that? Because the mainstream media has engaged in a virtual media blackout on them: ABC, NBC, CBS, the last thing they want to do is show these videos. If you watch FOX News, you can see the videos. But the mainstream media, in the great tradition of Pravda, wants [[Page S6969]] to make sure the citizenry doesn't see what is in these videos. I would encourage every American--Republican or Democrat--regardless of where you fall on the right to life, even--and, in fact, especially--if you consider yourself pro-choice--to just watch these videos. Go online and watch them and ask yourself: Are these my values? Is this what I believe? These videos show senior officials from Planned Parenthood laughing, sipping chardonnay and callously harvesting and selling the body parts of unborn children over and over and over. One senior official was caught on video laughing and saying she hopes she sells enough body parts of unborn children to buy herself a Lamborghini. Again, I would suggest to just ask yourself: Are these my values? In another video a lab tech describes a little baby boy--unborn, aborted, about 2 pounds, his heart still beating. She was instructed to insert scissors under his chin to cut open the face of this little boy and harvest his brain because the brain was valuable. Planned Parenthood could sell the brain. This is something out of ``Brave New World.'' These are human beings. That little boy had a heart that was still beating, had a brain that was being harvested. He had a soul given to him by God Almighty. He was made in the image of God. We are now a nation that harvests the body parts of little baby boys and girls. It is the very definition of inhumanity to treat children like agriculture, to be grown and killed for their body parts, to be sold for profit. There is a reason that the media and the Democrats don't want these videos shown, because anyone watching these videos will be horrified. But they are not just horrific; they are also prima facie evidence of criminal activity. There are multiple Federal statutes--criminal statutes--that Planned Parenthood appears to be violating, perhaps on a daily basis. The first and most direct is a prohibition on selling the body parts of unborn children for a profit. Federal criminal law makes that a felony with up to 10 years of jail time. Now these videos show them very clearly selling body parts. They also show them bartering a price. They will argue it wasn't for a profit. But you watch these videos. You watch the undercover buyer saying: How much will you give me for them? And you see the Planned Parenthood official saying: Well, how much can I get? I don't want to bargain against myself. On its face, that is evidence of bargaining for a profit. If you want the highest price you can get, it is not tied to your costs. It is tied to whatever dollars, whatever revenue you can bring in. Planned Parenthood is the largest abortion provider in the country. As another one of these videos reflects, it is a volume business--Planned Parenthood--taking the lives of unborn children and then selling them-- apparently for profit. It is also a Federal criminal offense to alter the means of an abortion for the purpose of harvesting the organs of the unborn child. That is a separate criminal offense. On video after video, you see Planned Parenthood officials saying: OK. What parts would you like? We can perform a different abortion depending on what parts you want us to harvest. On the videos they essentially admit to this crime. They are filmed in the act. There is the third criminal offense that provides that you cannot harvest the organs of an unborn child without informed consent from the mother. Yet again these videos seem to indicate that Planned Parenthood treats informed consent as a technicality that is sometimes complied with and sometimes ignored. Now, I will say as an aside that ordinarily, when a national organization is caught on film committing a pattern of felonies, the next steps are predictable: The Department of Justice opens an investigation; the FBI shows up and seizes their records. Everything on those videos suggests those felonies are still occurring today. What does it say about the Obama Justice Department that no one on the face of the planet believes there is any chance the Justice Department would even begin to investigate Planned Parenthood? What does it say about the most lawless partisan Department of Justice that there is this group that is a political ally of the President, so that is apparently all that matters. If it is an ally of the President, it doesn't matter that they are videotaped committing a felony. The Department of Justice will not even look at it. I am an alumnus of the U.S. Department of Justice. I was an Associate Deputy Attorney General. I spent much of my adult life working in law enforcement. The Department of Justice has a long, distinguished record of remaining outside of partisan politics, of staying above the partisan fray, of being blind to party or ideology and simply enforcing the law and the Constitution. I am sorry to say that under Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch, the Department of Justice has completely besmirched that tradition. No one remotely believes the Obama Justice Department will even begin to investigate this pattern of felonies. You don't see Democrats suggesting it. No one in the media suggests it. And by the way, if this were a Republican administration and the entity that admitted to a pattern of felonies was a private entity that supported Republicans, you would see on CBS, NBC, and ABC an indictment clock every night. You would see the anchors saying: When will this investigation be opened? When will they be indicted? Instead, the media pretends these videos don't exist. In the face of what appears to be a national criminal enterprise, we are faced here with a much simpler question: Will we continue to pay for it? Will we continue to pay for it with your and my tax dollars? Will we send $500 million a year to a private organization to use to fund this ongoing criminal organization? What is the position of the Democrats? Hear no evil, see no evil. They do not care. What Democrat do you see calling for the enforcement of criminal laws against Planned Parenthood? What Democrat do you hear saying, at a minimum, let's not send taxpayer money to fund this? Not one. Not a single Democrat stood up and said that. Let me ask you, Mr. President, what happens if Planned Parenthood gets indicted? Because even though the U.S. Department of Justice under President Obama has become little more than a partisan arm of the Democratic National Committee, there are State and local prosecutors who are investigating Planned Parenthood right now. If Planned Parenthood is indicted, will the Democrats maintain their wall of silence and say: We are going to continue to fund them under indictment. By all indications, that answer is yes. We haven't heard a single Democrat say: Well, if they are indicted, then we will stop. The response from our leadership is that we can't win this fight. That is their response. They say: Well, we can't win the Planned Parenthood fight. Why? Because we don't have 60 votes; because we don't have 67 votes. If that is the standard, then the Republican leadership standard is that we will do only what Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi approve of. That is what it means. You want to understand why the American people are frustrated? We were told: If only we had a Republican House of Representatives, then things would be different. In 2010, millions of us rose up in incredible numbers and won an historic tidal wave election. The Presiding Officer was a youth pastor, called to minister, yet he stood up and said: My country is in crisis. I am going to step forward and serve. The 2010 election was historic, yet very little changed. Then we were told: OK. We have a House of Representatives, but the problem is the Senate. As long as Harry Reid is majority leader, we can't do anything. Over and over again Washington gray beards would go on television, and in gravelly tones they would say: You cannot govern with one-half of one-third of government. The House of Representatives is not enough, but if we had the Senate, then things would be different. The problem is Harry Reid. The Presiding Officer will recall during the fight over ObamaCare a number of Members of this body--Republicans--said: No, no, no, no. We can't fight on ObamaCare. We have to wait until we have a Republican Senate to fight. So the American people obliged. In 2014, millions of us rose up for the second tidal wave election in a period of 4 years. We won nine Senate seats. [[Page S6970]] We retired Harry Reid as majority leader. We won the largest majority in the House of Representatives since the 1920s. It has been now over 9 months since we have had Republican majorities in both Houses, and I ask: What exactly have those Republican majorities accomplished? I have asked that question all over the country in townhalls. I have never been at a townhall where the response, spontaneous, was not absolutely nothing. That is true in every State I visit. And sadly, my response over and over again is: You know, it's worse than that. I wish the answer were absolutely nothing. It would have been better if the Republican majorities had done absolutely nothing because what, in fact, have they done? Well, the very first thing that happened, right after that election in November, is we came back to Washington, and Republican leadership joined up with Harry Reid and the Democrats and passed a trillion dollar CR omnibus bill that was filled with pork, corporate welfare, and grew government, grew the debt. Then Republican leadership took the lead in funding ObamaCare. Then Republican leadership took the lead in funding Executive amnesty. Then Republican leadership took the lead in funding Planned Parenthood. And then, astonishingly, Republican leadership took the lead in confirming Loretta Lynch as Attorney General. Now, I ask: Which one of those decisions is one iota different from what would have happened with Harry Reid and the Democrats in charge of this Chamber? Those decisions are identical. And I would note, by the way, with Loretta Lynch, the Republican majority could have defeated that nomination. The Senate majority leader could have done so. She looked at the Senate Judiciary Committee, and she looked at the Senate, and when asked how she would differ from Eric Holder's Justice Department--the most lawless and partisan Justice Department we would ever see--and she said: No way whatsoever. When asked to point to a single instance in which she would be willing to stand up to President Obama to stop his lawlessness, to stop his abuse of power, she could not identify any circumstance in which she would ever stand up to the President who appointed her. Attorneys general from both parties have done that, for centuries. Now, with Eric Holder, the Senate could be forgiven because his lawlessness manifested primarily after he was confirmed. With Loretta Lynch, she told us beforehand. She looked us in the eyes and said: Hey, I am going to do exactly what my predecessor has done. And Republican leadership confirmed her anyway. Is it any wonder the American people are frustrated out of their minds? We keep winning elections, and the people we put in office don't do what they said they would do. Now, some people across the country ask me: Is Republican leadership just not very capable? Are they not that competent or are they unwilling to fight? Mr. President, it is neither. They are actually quite competent, and they are willing to fight. The question becomes what they are fighting for. There is a disconnect right now. If you or I go to our home State and to any gathering of citizens and we put up a white board and we ask the citizens in the room to give the top priorities they think Republican majorities in Congress should be focusing on, and we wrote the 20 priorities that came from the citizens of Oklahoma or the citizens of Texas or, for that matter, the citizens of any of the 50 States, those top 20 priorities--at least 18 of them--would appear nowhere on the leadership's priority list. On the other hand, if you drive just down the street in Washington to K Street--K Street is the street in Washington where the lobbyists primarily reside, where their offices are--and you get a gathering of corporate lobbyists that represent giant corporations and ask them their top priorities, the list that comes out will not just bear passing similarity but will be identical to the priorities of the Republican leadership. That's the disconnect. Do you know why we are not here fighting on this? Because not giving taxpayer money to Planned Parenthood is not among the priorities of the lobbyists on K Street, so leadership is not interested in doing it. That is the disconnect. Leadership does know how to fight. Just a couple of months ago, in dealing with the Export-Import Bank, we saw leadership in both Chambers go to extraordinary lengths with Herculean procedural steps to reauthorize a classic example of corporate welfare--hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer-guaranteed loans to giant corporations. Now, for that, leadership is incentivized because those corporations hire lobbyists and those lobbyists distribute checks, typically by the wheelbarrow. There is no incentive greater in this body than getting reelected, and the view of leadership is that you get reelected by raking in the cash. How do you think we have gotten an $18 trillion national debt? Because the way you reach bipartisan compromise in this body today, in the broken world of Washington, is you grow and grow and grow government, and you sit around in a room and say: I will spend for your priority, your priority, your priority--another trillion dollars and we are done. The only people to lose are your children and mine. The only people to lose are the next generations who find themselves mired deeper and deeper and deeper in debt. I think of my little girls Caroline and Catherine. They are 7 and 4. If we don't stop what we are doing, your children and my children will face a debt so crushing they will not be able to spend in the future for the priorities of the future--for their needs, for their wants, for whatever crises come up that the next generation confronts. They will spend their whole lives simply working to pay off the debts racked up by their deadbeat parents and grandparents. No generation in history has ever done this to their children and grandchildren. Our parents didn't do it to us. Their parents didn't do it to them. The reason is the corruption of this town, and it boils down to a simple proposition: The Democrats are willing to do anything to push their priorities, and the Republicans, the leadership, are not listening to the men and women who elected us. But it is actually an even deeper problem than that. On the Democratic side, the major donors that fund the Democratic Party, they don't despise their base. The billionaires who write the giant checks that fund President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and the Democrats on that side of the aisle don't despise the radical gay rights movement or the radical environmentalist movement or all the people who knock on doors and get Democrats elected. The simple reality is a very large percentage of the Republican donors actively despise our base--actively despise the men and women who showed up and voted you and me into office. I can tell you, when you sit down and talk with a New York billionaire Republican donor--and I have talked with quite a few New York billionaire Republican donors, California Republican donors--their questions start out as follows. First of all, you have to come out for gay marriage, you need to be pro-choice, and you need to support amnesty. That is where the Republican donors are. You wonder why Republicans will not fight on any of these issues? Because the people writing the checks agree with the Democrats. Now mind you, the people who show up at the polls who elected you and me and who elected this Republican majority--far too many of the Republican donors look down on those voters as a bunch of ignorant hicks and rubes. It is why leadership likes show votes. It wasn't too long ago when the Washington cartel was able to mask it all with a show vote or two, and they told the rubes back home: See, we voted on it; we just don't have the votes. When I was first elected to this body, many times I heard more senior Senators saying some variation of the following: Now, Ted, that is what you tell folks back home. You don't actually do it. Here is what has changed. The voters have gotten more informed. They now understand the difference between show votes and a real vote. They understand the vote we had 1 week ago on Planned Parenthood was designed to lose, to placate those silly folks who think we shouldn't be sending taxpayer funds to a criminal organization that is selling the body parts of unborn children. But on the actual vote that could [[Page S6971]] change policy, leadership has no interest in fighting whatsoever. In the past couple of weeks, one of my colleagues sent me a letter that really embodied the leadership message. This letter said: ``Explain to me how you get 67 votes to defund Planned Parenthood. If you can't produce 67 votes, I won't support it.'' If that is our standard, then we should all be honest with the men and women who elected us: We do not have 67 Republican votes in this Chamber, and there is no realistic prospect of our getting 67 votes any time in the foreseeable future. If the standard is, unless we get 67 votes, Republican leadership will support no policy issue, then each of us when we run should tell the voters: If you vote for me, I will support whatever policy agenda Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi decide because that is my standard. If I don't have 67 votes--do you ever recall Harry Reid and the Democrats saying: How can we get Republican votes? No. Their side is absolutely committed to their principles. You don't see them holding back at all. If the standard is, how do we get 67 votes, name one thing that leadership will fight for. Well, the answer I mentioned, the three types of votes are they will fight for big government, they will fight to grow government, and they will fight to expand corporate welfare. Well, that can indeed get 67 votes. But I have never been to a townhall once where citizens said to me: The problem is we don't have enough corporate welfare. I need more subsidies for Big Business. If 100 percent of the agenda of Republican leadership is more subsidies for Big Business, what the heck are we doing in the Senate in the first place? That certainly wasn't why I ran, and I know it wasn't why you ran either. You don't have to win every fight, you don't have to fight every fight, but you do have to stand for something. Let's look beyond Planned Parenthood for a minute. Let's look to Iran. Of all the decisions the Obama administration has made, there may be none more damaging than this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. If this deal goes through, there will be three consequences: No. 1, the Obama administration will become, quite literally, the world's leading financier of radical Islamic terrorists. Now, when I said that a couple months ago, President Obama got very, very upset. He said it was ridiculous that I would say such a thing, but despite attacking me directly, President Obama didn't actually endeavor to refute the substance of what I said. So let's review the facts: Fact No. 1, Iran is today the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. That fact is undisputed even by this administration. Fact No. 2, if this deal goes through, over $100 billion will go directly to Iran to the Ayatollah Khamenei. Fact No. 3, if that happens, billions of those dollars will go to Hamas, to Hezbollah, to the Houthis, to radical Islamic terrorists across the globe who will use those billions to murder Americans, to murder Israelis, and to murder Europeans. It is worth remembering, 14 years ago this month, the horrific terrorist attack that was carried out on September 11. Osama bin Laden hated America, but he never had billions of dollars. He never had $100 billion. The Ayatollah Khamenei hates America every bit as much as Osama bin Laden did, and this administration is giving him control of over $100 billion. Imagine what bin Laden could have done. Look at the damage he did with 19 terrorists carrying box cutters. Now imagine that same zealotry with billions of dollars behind it. The consequences of this deal could easily be another terrorist attack that dwarfs September 11 in scale, that kills far more than the roughly 3,000 lives that were snuffed out. Who in their right mind would send over $100 billion to a theocratic zealot who chants ``Death to America''? A second consequence of his catastrophic deal is that we are abandoning four hostages--four American hostages--in Iranian jails: Pastor Saeed Abedini, an American citizen whose wife Naghmeh lives in Idaho. I have visited with Naghmeh many times. Pastor Saeed has two little kids who desperately want their daddy to come home. Pastor Saeed was sentenced to 8 years in prison for the crime of preaching the Gospel. Just last week was the 3-year anniversary of Pastor Saeed's imprisonment. Reports are that he is being horribly mistreated, that his health is failing, and yet President Obama cannot bring himself to utter the words ``Pastor Saeed Abedini''--$100 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, and Pastor Saeed Abedini remains in prison. Also in prison is Amir Hekmati, an American marine the President has abandoned. Also in prison is Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post reporter--I note to the reporters in the Gallery, a colleague of yours--abandoned by President Obama in an Iranian prison, thrown in jail for doing his job, reporting on the news--and Robert Levinson, whose whereabouts remain unknown. Why is the President refusing to even utter their names? The third consequence of this deal is this deal will only accelerate Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. The administration claims the deal will prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Why? Because they promised not to do it. We have learned from Iran, they break their promises over and over and over again. And what we do know is that they will have an extra $100 billion to develop nuclear weapons. Now, I will say the administration laughingly suggested: Well, they will use that on infrastructure, to rebuild their roads, to rebuild their energy industry. Right now they are sending vast sums to Hamas and Hezbollah, funding terrorism across the world, and they have those same infrastructure needs. With another $100 billion, you don't think they are going to funnel an awful lot of it to developing nuclear weapons? I would point out, it is not by accident that the Ayatollah Khamenei refers to Israel as the Little Satan and America as the Great Satan. This is the one threat on the face of the Earth that poses a real possibility of millions of Americans being murdered in the flash of an eye. Everything I am saying the Republican leadership has said over and over again. Yet Republican leadership refuses to enforce the terms of the Iran review legislation--Federal law that the administration is defying by not handing over the entire deal. I have laid out a clear path, a detailed path that leadership can follow to stop this deal, and leadership refuses to do so. Instead, we had a show vote that was designed to lose, and it did exactly what we expected. The Democrats, by and large, put party loyalty above the national security of this country, above standing with our friend and ally the nation of Israel, above protecting the lives of millions of Americans. If we truly believed what so many of us have said, that this poses the risk of murdering millions of Americans, is there any higher priority? The most powerful constitutional tool Congress has is the power of the purse. If we had the ability to stop this deal--and we don't--and millions of Americans die, how do we explain that to the men and women who elected us? I am not advocating that we fight willy-nilly. I am advocating that we fight on things that matter. Don't give $500 million to Planned Parenthood, a corrupt organization that is taking the lives of vast numbers of unborn children and selling their body parts, in a criminal conspiracy, directly contrary to Federal law. Don't give $100 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who seeks to murder millions. In both instances, those are defending life. Yet Republican leadership is not willing to lift a finger. If only all the people who might be murdered by a nuclear weapon could create a PAC in Washington and hire some lobbyists, maybe leadership would listen to them. But the truckdriver at home, the waitress at home, the schoolteacher at home, the pastor, the police officer, the working men and women--the Washington cartel does not listen to them. I will note where this deal is headed. In December, when this dirty continuing resolution expires, leadership is already foreshadowing that they plan to bust the budget caps. Why? We talked about it at the beginning. Barack Obama has discovered that when he says the word ``shutdown,'' the Republican leadership screams, surrenders, and runs to the hills. Obama, understanding that quite well, says: If you don't bust the budget caps, I will shut the government down. In this bizarre process, Republican leadership will blame whatever Obama [[Page S6972]] does on other Republicans. You noticed how much energy leader McConnell devotes to attacking conservatives? You notice how much energy Speaker Boehner devotes to attacking conservatives? Just yesterday the Speaker of the House went on national television, and on national television he directed an obscene epithet at me personally. He is welcome to insult whomever he likes. I don't intend to reciprocate. But when has leadership ever shown that level of venom, that level of animosity to President Obama and the Democrats who are bankrupting this country, who are destroying the Constitution, who are endangering the future of our children and grandchildren, who are retreating from leadership and the world, and who have created an environment that has led to the rise of radical Islamic terrorists? One of the dynamics we have seen in fight after fight is that Harry Reid and the Democrats sit back and laugh. Why? Because it is Republican leadership that leads the onslaught, attacking conservatives, saying: No, you can't, and we will not do anything to stop ObamaCare. No, you can't, and we will not do anything to stop amnesty. No, you can't, and we will not do anything to stop Planned Parenthood. No, you can't, and we will not do anything to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. If Republican leadership really believes we can accomplish nothing, then why does it matter if you have a Republican House or Senate? Every 2 years come October, November, we tell the voters it matters intensely. To paraphrase the immortal words of Hillary Clinton, what difference does it make if the standard for Republican leadership is, anything that gets 67 votes we will support. That means Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi remain the de facto leaders of the Senate and the House. I would note, by the way, if leadership goes through with their suggestion to bust the budget caps, they will have done something astonishing. Historically, the three legs of the conservative stool have been fiscal conservatives, social conservatives, and national security conservatives. Between Planned Parenthood, Iran, and the budget caps, leadership will have managed to abandon all three. No wonder the American people are frustrated. No wonder the American people do not understand why leadership isn't listening to them. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's postcloture time has expired. Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my time be extended. The Democrats are objecting to my speaking further, and both the Democrats and Republican leadership are objecting to the American people speaking further. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until the cloture vote on the motion to concur with an amendment in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 719 will be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees. The Senator from Illinois. Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, Wednesday night is the deadline. On Wednesday night, the authority of the government of the United States to do business ends. The funding for our government ends. It is a scary time. We don't want that to happen--most of us--because we know it will be catastrophic. There will be people who will suffer if we fail to do our job. Now, this isn't the first time we have been up against a deadline. We have faced them before, and many times we have to buy a little extra time to negotiate the budget. That is understandable. In this circumstance, though, we actually have announced candidates for the Presidency of the United States who are calling for a government shutdown. What happens when our government shuts down? Well, it is pretty obvious. Agencies stop doing business as usual. What we find, though, is that the impact goes far beyond just that simple statement. I went back to Illinois this last weekend, and I went for a visit to Scott Air Force Base. It is the largest single employer in the State of Illinois and downstate. In 2013--the last time we had a government shutdown--the junior Senator from Texas, Senator Ted Cruz, wanted to shut down our government to protest ObamaCare. So he successfully closed down the government and found other Republicans who would join him in that effort, and it went on for a long period of time. In 2013, at Scott Air Force Base, one of the most important defense facilities in our country, in Belleville, IL, we saw two-thirds of the civilian workforce--that is about 3,400 people--sent home immediately without pay. Those who were required to report for duty, including all of the base's 5,000 military personnel, would have been given IOUs rather than paychecks. Scott Air Force Base families were forced to limit their spending and stretch their savings while the Senator from Texas gave speeches on the floor about Dr. Seuss. I am not making this up. This had an impact on the entire region of Southwestern Illinois. Scott Air Force Base has a $1.6 billion economic impact on the local area, including supporting thousands of indirect jobs. Every part of this regional economy felt the impact of this decision to shut down the government 2 years ago--gas stations, restaurants, small businesses, contractors, everybody. Now, this brinksmanship goes far beyond flowery speeches on the floor and press attention. The last shutdown hurt the gross domestic product of the United States of America. Consumer confidence drops when the government shuts down. We saw $2 billion in lost productivity from furloughed employees. Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen said: We have a good recovery in place that's really making progress and to see Congress take actions that would endanger that progress, I think that would be more than unfortunate. So to me that's Congress' job. The CEO of JPMorgan Chase, a man named Jamie Dimon, speaking of the last Republican government shutdown, said, ``Washington has really slowed American down.'' I agree. And if that were the only thing that was happening, it would be bad enough. But there is more. Today I went to a neighborhood in Chicago, the All Saints Episcopal Church in Ravenswood. They are doing a restoration on this beautiful church built back in the 19th century. I met with the pastor there. We were at the food pantry of this church. This Episcopal Church tries to help neighborhood residents who are struggling to find enough to eat. We had a little press conference with the local Congressman, Mike Quigley and Jan Schakowsky, and people who represented the food pantries of Chicago in that area. They are worried about a shutdown and what a shutdown means to them. How would it affect the All Saints Episcopal Church food pantry and the men and women who go in there on a regular basis to pick up some canned goods to get by? Here is what it means. Many of these people are on food stamps. We call it the SNAP program now. The SNAP program, on average, gives a person food worth $7 a day, so the notion that people are going out for steak dinners on food stamps is not quite accurate. Sara--and I won't use her full name--who is 81 years old, came up to talk about what life is like for her. She was a hard-working person, stricken with cancer in 2002, which recurred in 2004, and she had to quit working. She has a walker now and she gets around, but all she has is her Social Security check and food stamps. That is how she survives from week to week and month to month. What happens when there is a government shutdown? They cut off food stamps. Did that happen last time? No. The last time the Senator from Texas shut down the government, it didn't happen because President Obama had a surplus in his recovery fund and he took the surplus and put it in the food stamps so there would be no interruption of service. You see, most of the recipients of food stamps are children. Single moms raising kids and not making enough money supplement their income with food stamps and buy food for their kids. Food stamps are also used by elderly people like Sara who are struggling on a fixed income. This time is different. If these Presidential wannabes who are determined to shut down the government this time are successful, we are going to have problems right away. It turns out the only surplus left in the food stamp or SNAP benefit fund is about $3 billion. That will keep the program going for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, they cut off the food stamps. What does that mean? Well, for a lot of people it means a lot of suffering--primarily for the poorest people among us. Did anyone notice last week what happened in Washington? The city was transformed by the visit of Pope Francis. Congress was in awe of this man who came and spoke to us in very human terms about what he thinks would be our obligation, not just as elected officials but as human beings. One of his highest priorities is that we have some caring and sensitivity for those who struggle--the poor, the people on food stamps. So for all the applause and all of the posing for pictures that went on last week with the Pope, here we are this week discussing a government shutdown. Here we are this week discussing whether we are going to cut off food stamps for poor people in America. It is a sad reality to think of what a government shutdown would do in human terms to those wonderful folks working at Scott Air Force Base in Belleville, IL, or to Sara who will go into the All Saints Episcopal Church food pantry and try to get by, as food stamps are cut off. Why? Why would we do that? How can we possibly be serving this Nation--this great Nation--by stalling our economy and hurting innocent people and punishing those who are serving our country in uniform and otherwise? Some think it is a grand strategy--a great political strategy. It may move [[Page S6964]] them up from the smaller debate to the big-time debate when it comes to running for President. To me it is an indication we have lost our way. In June, I joined with the other leaders on this side of the aisle in sending a letter to the Republican leader saying: Please, don't wait until the end of September to face this budget reality. Sit down now-- back in June--with the President, with the leaders on the Republican side and the Democratic side. Let us compromise in good faith. Let us meet our responsibilities. Well, that is what we face. As Senator Reid said a few minutes earlier, there is a suggestion that maybe as a parting gift to Speaker Boehner we will extend the budget temporarily until December 11, 2 weeks before Christmas, just days before the Hanukkah season--that we would extend the budget until then and then, once again, be up against the deadline and the prospect of shutting down our government. We can do better. We should do better. We need to make certain we keep faith with the people who send us here. We need to make certain we do our job--not just to send a continuing resolution to the President but to resolve this issue. We should not be threatening a government shutdown now or in December when we know how devastating that can be. I hope Congress gets busy taking care of the work we were sent here to do. I think it is time for those bipartisan budget negotiations. It is beyond time. Now is the time for Congress to act responsibly to develop a budget that allows America to thrive. Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I wish to talk about an amendment I plan to offer in a little while, once somebody comes from our side or the other side because they would like to be here to talk about it with me, as I understand it--maybe even to object to it, maybe to agree with it. But I wish to speak about the amendment, if I could, for a moment. Right now, we are debating the continuing resolution. This would be to continue a level of spending from now until December 11. There are a bunch of changes in that from last year's spending, but it is basically a continuation of the previous year until we can work out our differences. It is not the way to govern around here. What we should be doing instead is having individual spending bills come up. There are 12 different appropriations bills. The ideal way to handle this is the way it used to be done, which is that the Appropriations Committee and its subcommittees deal with these individual spending bills. For instance, one is for Commerce, the State Department, and the Justice Department. One is for the Department of Health and Human Services, and one is for the Department of Defense. When we do that, what happens is we have oversight hearings, and we have Congress playing its rightful role of saying: Are these agencies doing the right thing? Are these programs working or aren't they working? We might increase spending with a program that is actually working well, decrease spending from another program, and eliminate a third program that is not working well at all. That is what Congress is supposed to do. That is our job here. Under the Constitution, Congress was given the power of the purse, meaning that every dime has to be appropriated by the Congress. What has happened over the years--particularly in the last several years--is that Congress has not moved forward on these appropriations bills because they have been blocked. In this case, this year we have been trying to bring up appropriations bills and the other side, the Democrats, have been blocking even considering an appropriations bill. We have had this debate here on the floor. Many of us have heard it. But the bottom line is the committees have actually done their work and reported out 12 different appropriations bills. So 12 bills are ready to come to the floor. By the way, most of these bills have been reported out with huge bipartisan majorities. I saw one the other day. It was 24 to 3, for instance. I know the Presiding Officer has been involved in some of these issues over the years. It is typical, actually, that appropriators do their jobs. Senator Mikulski, Senator Cochran, and others work out the differences, but we simply can't get them voted on on the floor. People may say: Why can't you? Well, because it requires 60 votes. We have to overcome a 60-vote hurdle in order to even proceed to the legislation. So we haven't been able to vote on a single appropriations bill before September 30, which is the fiscal year-end and which is coming up this week. It is no way to run a railroad, much less a government--by the way, the government that has the biggest budget of any government in the world, the government of the greatest nation in the world. We can't even bring these individual spending bills up here for a debate and a vote. It is just wrong. Again, when we don't do that, what we don't have is the oversight. I would think both sides would want to have oversight over these agencies and departments so we understand what is working and what is not working and so that those tax dollars are spent wisely. That is the kind of stewardship that we are responsible for. As taxpayers, as representatives of taxpayers, we should want to be sure those dollars are spent in a way that is most effective. Yet, without having these appropriations bills, it is just impossible to do. Instead, we are faced with this possibility of on September 30 not having any of what is called discretionary spending, which is not all of the spending of government, but it is the spending that Congress appropriates every year, and having the possibility of parts of government actually not being able to operate because September 30 is the fiscal year-end. It is just the wrong way to do business. So the amendment I am going to offer later this afternoon is an amendment that simply says: Let's adopt a new bill, new legislation that says: Let's end government shutdowns. How would we do it? We would say that as of September 30, if there is any bill that is not passed, any one of the 12--remember that this year none of the 12 were passed--none of them. But on any year, if any one of those were not passed, then we would simply continue the spending from the previous year, but there would be a reduction in that spending over time. After 120 days there would be a 1-percent reduction, giving 120 days to work with the Appropriations Committee to say: OK, we know you don't want to see the spending cut, and we know you have priorities you would like to fund, but it is going to be cut 1 percent after 120 days, then 1 percent after the next 90 days, 1 percent after the next 90 days, and 1 percent after the next 90 days. So we get to a point where we have to see a reduction in spending every year, which is not necessarily a bad thing because Congress spends more than it takes in every year. But if appropriators and others here in Congress don't want to see that, they would have to get their act together and actually pass appropriations bills. Once an appropriations bill is passed, the End Government Shutdowns Act would not apply. This seems to me to be a really logical bipartisan commonsense solution to the problem that we are facing here. Again, the problem is Congress is not doing its work. We are not getting these appropriations bills done. It is not for lack of work in the committees this year. Again, all 12 bills were reported out of committee. I believe the same is true in the House. Yet we cannot get here on the floor of the Senate the 60 votes needed to come up with the ability to proceed to these appropriations bills. It is called a filibuster. They are being filibustered. We are not even debating them. This is just wrong. I think, again, the way to get around that is to say: OK, if you want to try to block these bills, what is going to happen is we are going to have automatic spending from last year with no increases--in fact, decreases--and decreasing more over time, until Congress gets its act together and actually passes this legislation. This idea is so commonsense that when we had a vote on it a couple of years ago, when I was able to bring it [[Page S6965]] up for a vote--and we will see tonight whether I am permitted to do that--we actually had 46 Senators support it. Now, not everybody supported it on the Appropriations Committee. Some of them obviously had concerns about it. Not every Republican supported it. There were a few Republicans who didn't support it. By the way, one Republican who didn't support it last time is now a cosponsor of the legislation because she has looked at it, she has understood the system is not working, and she has been persuaded it is the right way to go. It was bipartisan last time. Senator Tester and I were the two cosponsors of it. So I hope I will have the opportunity to offer that amendment here this afternoon because I think it makes all the sense in the world. As we are debating a continuing resolution again, the so-called CR--which is the wrong way to govern--let's also pass as part of that a new discipline, a new idea, a new approach that says: Let's not do this again. Let's not ever have the threat of a government shutdown hanging over us. Instead, come September 30, if an appropriations bill isn't done, fine, continue the spending from last year, with a slow ratcheting down of that spending. I think that makes all the sense in the world. It takes away this political football that is being thrown back and forth. It takes away the specter for our economy, for our businesses, and for our families of not knowing whether they are going to have this government operation continue after September 30 in whatever area is affecting our economy or those businesses or those families. I think it makes a lot of sense, and I think it provides an incentive for Congress to get its work done. And Congress should be doing every year all 12 appropriations bills--doing the oversight that goes into that, deciding what gets more money, what gets less money, what gets thrown out altogether. It doesn't make any sense. In the huge bureaucracy of the vast Federal Government, not every program is perfect. Let's be honest; a lot of them need reform. If we don't have this process of the power of the purse--the leverage of the power of the purse to be able to say ``Prove this program is working,'' and when it doesn't, ``We are going to pull the funding away''--you lose the ability for Congress to be an effective partner with the executive branch and the judicial branch the way our Founders set it up. Again, Congress alone has the power of the purse. Every dime has to be appropriated by this Congress, and Congress is not doing its job. This amendment, if we put in place this new practice, would be a tremendous help to get Congress back on track. It wasn't too long ago that this happened. I have been here almost 5 years now or 4\1/2\ years. We haven't had a single year where all the appropriations bills were done. In fact, very few appropriations bills have been voted on at all. This year not a single appropriations bill--zero--has come to the floor of the Senate because they have been blocked. They have all come out of committee now, but not a single one is allowed to get voted on here in the Senate. I do hope that my own leadership on the Republican side will keep bringing these bills up. At least then we have an opportunity to talk about them--what is in the bills and why it is a good idea for us to have the oversight. Again, the reforms to these programs--the spending cuts, the spending increases for programs that are working well, the elimination altogether of programs that aren't working--we should at least have the opportunity to discuss them and talk about it. I was hopeful we would see a colleague from the other side of the aisle show up or a member of the Appropriations Committee. I was told I could give this little talk at 5, and I had the opportunity to offer this amendment. I will have to come back later and offer it again. I don't know if my colleague from Iowa is planning to speak---- Mr. GRASSLEY. No. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, earlier I had the opportunity to talk a little about the amendment I am about to offer. This is an amendment to the underlying bill, which is a continuing resolution. The amendment has to do with a piece of legislation called the End Government Shutdowns Act. Excuse me. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to speak for 5 minutes in order to finish the conversation that we started earlier this evening. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I talked about the fact that here we are, once again, without the appropriations bills done and forced to do a continuing resolution from now until December 11, and that is because later this week, on September 30, when the fiscal year ends and comes to a close, we will not have done the appropriations bills. It is not that we haven't done one or two or three; we haven't done any of them, and there are 12 of them. I think it is time for us to take a new approach; that is, to have an end government shutdowns discipline put before this Congress which says: Any time you get to this point with any of the appropriations bills--including now where we have all of them--that we instead have a continuation of last year's spending but that it ratchets down over time to provide an incentive for all of us in Congress--Democrats and Republicans alike, the Appropriations Committee, and all of us--to get our work done and to do our job under the Constitution. The power of the purse is exclusively delegated to the Congress. It will help us to get our job done if we had this by having the end government shutdowns discipline in place. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment and call up my amendment No. 2702, the end government shutdowns amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. COCHRAN. Reserving the right to object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi. Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if I understand the Senator's suggestion correctly, his amendment would create an automatic continuing resolution to fund the Federal Government in the event an annual appropriations bill is not enacted by the time the fiscal year expires. That may sound harmless enough, but what we are saying is that not only is the power of the Senate suspended and put on hold but the obligations of the committee system are put under a threat--that unless you complete action on legislation that is referred to the committee of jurisdiction by a certain time, you are out of business, and whoever wants to offer an amendment as a substitute gets to offer that and pass it on a majority vote. We are already required to have three-fifths of the Members vote to cut off debate in order to be sure that all Senators--not just a bare majority--get to decide the decisions of the Senate and get to actively participate in the process by offering amendments. My friend's amendment abolishes offering any other alternatives for a full debate--unlimited debate--which is why the Senate is here, to cool down the passions of the moment. A Senator might have a good idea and want to change a law, repeal a resolution, deny access to Federal funds for this, that or the other that goes to a State that is very important, and their interests are just as important. This is a terrible amendment, and it ought to be rejected. I hope the Senator will withhold offering the amendment. We can have hearings on this and see what other Senators may think about it, but at first blush, this seems like this is an amendment whose time has not come. We are not ready to dismantle the rules of the Senate piece by piece. Well, we have the right of unlimited debate, and Senators can talk as long as they wish to. We don't have to go through a rules committee to get permission or get permission from any other Senator. These are direct responsibilities of individual Senators selected by their States to stand up for their interests, not to go to Washington and cave in on something that might be a good-sounding amendment [[Page S6966]] or might have the passions of the moment behind it so that there appears to be a wave of support, but until you have a chance to seriously consider the individual issues involved, until three-fifths of the Senate decides to cut off debate--I strongly object to this amendment. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. COCHRAN. I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my friend and my colleague, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I look forward to talking to him more about this. As I said earlier, 46 Senators supported this in the past, including all but two or three Republicans, by the way, and one of them is now a cosponsor of the legislation. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call under rule XXII be waived with respect to today's cloture vote. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I wish to have 1 minute in order to debate the matter that is before us. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Illinois. Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I stand with the Senator from Mississippi. We may be from opposite political parties, but I certainly agree with him that the suggestion by the Senator from Ohio does not serve the best interests of this country. Imagine if his proposal went through and we were faced with inadequate funding for medical care for our veterans. I am sorry to say the Senator from Ohio has suggested that we would have last year's level of funding with potentially a 4-percent cut. It would be the same for fighting fires and the National Institutes of Health. There would be a 4-percent cut in medical research. I think what we are doing, if we accept this approach, is giving up our responsibility that the taxpayers sent us to carry out; that is, to make careful choices when it comes to budgets. I just want to be on the record supporting my colleague from Mississippi. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I hadn't planned to have a debate on this, but I am happy to have one. Let me just be very clear. This is about putting the Appropriations Committee in business, not out of business. This is not about cutting spending; it is about forcing Congress to get its work done. Here we sit about to pass a continuing resolution because none of the 12 appropriations bills has been voted on because each of them has been blocked in the Senate. The committee has done its work. Yet we can't get them to the floor. Yet we have the other side saying: Gosh, this would somehow hurt the process. How can the process be hurt any worse? We want the process to work, and that is why 46 of us, on a bipartisan basis, have supported this idea. What it says is, if at the end of the day, on September 30, appropriations bills have not been passed, then we would simply continue the spending from last year, and, yes, over time we would ratchet it down, giving 120 days for the committee to get its act together that it did not in the previous year when it was supposed to, to get these bills done, to do the oversight, and to make the decisions about NIH, as the Senator has said, and to make the decisions about our veterans. If we truly want to help our veterans, a CR is not the way to do it. The way to do it is to let the VA bill come to the floor, have a debate, and take the committee's good ideas--and, by the way, it came out of committee with a large bipartisan vote. That is how we should be legislating. That is our job. The power of the purse resides exclusively with us. Yet once again this year we are not doing our job. It is not that we are just doing a couple of appropriations bills; we are not doing a single appropriations bill. I think it is time for us to change course and that is what this legislation is about. I am simply saying that in the process of passing the CR, which we now have to do, set up a discipline for the future that provides an incentive for us to get our work done so the good work being done by Senator Cochran and others--including Senator Mikulski--in the Appropriations Committee can come to the floor for a vote, and we can get back to governing. I yield back. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request to waive the mandatory quorum? Mr. DURBIN. No objection. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Cloture Motion Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. The bill clerk read as follows: Cloture Motion We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 719 with an amendment, No. 2689. Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, Orrin G. Hatch, Pat Roberts, Johnny Isakson, Michael B. Enzi, Cory Gardner, John Barrasso, Lindsey Graham, Lamar Alexander, Thad Cochran, Chuck Grassley, Kelly Ayotte, Susan M. Collins, Deb Fischer, Richard Burr. The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 719 with amendment No. 2689, offered by the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Blunt), the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Corker), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Graham), and the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio). The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 77, nays 19, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 271 Leg.] YEAS--77 Alexander Ayotte Baldwin Barrasso Bennet Blumenthal Booker Boxer Brown Burr Cantwell Capito Cardin Carper Casey Cassidy Cochran Collins Coons Cornyn Donnelly Durbin Enzi Ernst Feinstein Fischer Flake Franken Gardner Gillibrand Grassley Hatch Heinrich Heitkamp Hirono Hoeven Isakson Johnson Kaine King Kirk Klobuchar Leahy Manchin Markey McCain McCaskill McConnell Menendez Merkley Mikulski Murkowski Murphy Murray Nelson Perdue Peters Portman Reed Reid Roberts Rounds Sanders Schatz Schumer Shaheen Stabenow Sullivan Tester Thune Tillis Udall Warner Warren Whitehouse Wicker Wyden NAYS--19 Boozman Coats Cotton Crapo Cruz Daines Heller Inhofe Lankford Lee Moran Paul Risch Sasse Scott Sessions Shelby Toomey Vitter NOT VOTING--4 Blunt Corker Graham Rubio The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 77, the nays are 19. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to. Cloture having been invoked, the motion to refer falls. The Senator from Texas. Vote on Amendment No. 2690 Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I move to table the McConnell amendment No. 2690 for the purpose of offering my own amendment No. 2701, and I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There does not appear to be a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The motion was rejected. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas. [[Page S6967]] Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, there is a reason the American people are fed up with Washington. There is a reason the American people are frustrated. The frustration is not simply mild or passing or ephemeral; it is volcanic. Over and over again, the American people go to the ballot box. Over and over again, the American people rise and say: The direction we are going does not make sense; we want change. Over and over again, the American people win elections--in 2010, a tidal wave election; in 2014, a tidal wave election. Yet nothing changes in Washington. I would like to share with the Presiding Officer and the American people the real story of what is happening in Washington, why it is that our leaders cannot stop bankrupting this country, cannot stop the assault on our constitutional rights, cannot stop America's retreat from leadership in the world. It is a very simple dynamic when you have two sides allegedly in a political battle, one side that is relentlessly, unshakably committed to its principles and the other side that reflectively surrenders at the outset. The outcome is foreordained. I will give President Obama and the Senate Democrats credit. They believe in principles of Big Government. They believe in this relentless assault on our constitutional rights. They are willing to crawl over broken glass with a knife in between their teeth to fight for those principles. Unfortunately, leadership on my side of the aisle does not demonstrate the same commitment to principles. How is it, you might wonder, that a preemptive surrender is put in place? Well, it all begins with a relatively innocuous statement: There shall be no shutdowns. That is a statement leadership in both Houses-- Republican leadership in both Houses has said: We are not going to shut the government down. You can understand--to folks in the private sector, folks at home, that sounds pretty reasonable, except here is the reality in Washington. In today's Washington, there are three kinds of votes. No. 1, there are show votes--votes that are brought up largely to placate the voters, where the outcome is foreordained, where most Republicans will vote one way and most Democrats will vote the other. Republicans will lose, and the conservatives who elected Republican majorities in both Houses are supposed to be thrilled that they have been patted on the head and given their show vote that was destined to lose. We had a vote like that in recent weeks on Planned Parenthood. Leadership told us: You should be thrilled. We voted on it. What else do you want? We voted on it in a context where it would never happen. Indeed, it did not. The second kind of vote is a vote that simply grows government, dramatically expands spending, and expands corporate welfare. Those votes pass because you get a bipartisan coalition of Republican leadership and Democrats, both of whom are convinced that career politicians will get reelected if they keep growing and growing government and in particular handing out corporate welfare to giant corporations. Oh boy. If you have the lobbyists on K Street pushing for something, you can get 60, 70, 80 in this Chamber because Republican leadership loves it and Democrats are always willing to grow government. Then there is the third kind of vote--votes on must-pass legislation. In an era when one side--the Democratic Party--is adamantly committed to continuing down this path that is causing so many millions of Americans to hurt, must-pass votes are the only votes that have real consequence in this Chamber. They typically fall into one of three categories: either a continuing resolution, an omnibus appropriations bill, or a debt ceiling increase. All of those three are deemed must- pass votes. If you actually want to change law, those are the only hopes of doing so. But, as I mentioned before, you have one side who has preemptively surrendered. Republican leadership has said they will never ever shut down the government, and suddenly President Obama understands the easy key to winning every battle: He simply has to utter the word ``shutdown'' and Republican leadership runs to the hills. So President Obama demands of Congress: Fund every bit of ObamaCare--100 percent of it--and do nothing, zero, for the millions of Americans who are hurting, millions of Americans who have lost their jobs, who have lost their health care, who have lost their doctors, who have been forced into part-time work, the millions of young people who have seen their premiums skyrocket. President Obama: You can do nothing for the people who are hurting. Senate Democrats say: We don't care about the people who are hurting. We will do nothing for them. Here is the kicker. President Obama promises: If you try to do anything on ObamaCare, I, Barack Obama, will veto funding for the entire Federal Government and shut it down. Republican leadership compliantly says: OK. Fine. We will fund ObamaCare. President Obama then understands he has got a pretty good trump card here he can pull out at any time. So next he says: OK. Republicans, fund my unconstitutional Executive amnesty. It is contrary to law. It is flouting Federal immigration law. But you, Republicans, fund it anyway or else, I, Barack Obama, will veto funding for the entire Federal Government and shut it down. Republican leadership says at the outset: OK. We will fund amnesty. Now we turn to Planned Parenthood. Barack Obama--this will surprise no one--says: Fund 100 percent of Planned Parenthood with taxpayer money. Mind you, Planned Parenthood is a private organization. It is not even part of the government. But it happens to be politically favored by President Obama and the Democrats. Planned Parenthood is also the subject of multiple criminal investigations for being caught on tape apparently carrying out a pattern of ongoing felonies. In ordinary times, the proposition that we should not be sending your or my Federal taxpayer money to fund a private organization that is under multiple criminal investigations-- that ought to be a 100-to-0 vote. But, as I mentioned before, Barack Obama is absolutely committed to his partisan objectives. He is like the Terminator. He never stops. He never gives up. He moves forward and forward and forward. So what does he say? If you don't fund this one private organization that is not part of the government, that is under multiple criminal investigations, I, Barack Obama, will veto funding for the entire Federal Government and shut it down. What does Republican leadership say? Well, it will surprise no one. Republican leadership says: We surrender. We will fund Planned Parenthood. You know, President Obama has negotiated a catastrophic nuclear deal with Iran. Republican leadership goes on television all the time and rightly says: This is a catastrophic deal. The consequences are that it is the single greatest national security threat to America. Millions of Americans could die. I would suggest that if we actually believed the words that are coming out of our mouths, then we would be willing to use any and all constitutional authority given the Congress to stop a catastrophic deal that sends over $100 billion to Ayatollah Khamenei. Yet President Obama says he will veto the entire budget if we do, and, to the surprise of nobody, Republican leadership surrenders. You know, I will draw an analogy. It is as if at a football game, the beginning of the football game the two team captains go out to flip the coin. One team's coach walks out and says: We forfeit. They do it game after game after game right at the coin flip. Leadership says: We forfeit. We surrender. We, Republicans, will fund every single Big Government liberal priority of the Democrats. If an NFL team did that over 16 games, we know what their record would be; it would be 0 and 16. You know, I am pretty sure the fans who bought tickets and who went to the game would be pretty ticked off as they watched their coach forfeit over and over again. You want to understand the volcanic frustration with Washington? It is that Republican leadership in both Houses will not fight for a single priority we promised the voters we would fight for when we were campaigning less than a year ago. You know, this past week was a big news week in Washington. The Speaker [[Page S6968]] of the House, John Boehner, announced he was going to resign, and there was lots of speculation in the media as to why the Speaker of the House resigned. I am going to tell you why he resigned. It is actually a direct manifestation of this disconnect between the voters back home and Republican leadership. Speaker Boehner and Leader McConnell promised there will be no shutdown. Therefore, they will fund every single priority of Barack Obama. We are right now voting on what is called a clean CR. I would note it is clean only in the parlance of Washington, because what does it do? It funds 100 percent of ObamaCare, 100 percent of Executive amnesty. It funds all of Planned Parenthood, and it funds the Iranian nuclear deal. It is essentially a blank check to Barack Obama. That is not very clean to me. That actually sounds like a very dirty funding bill, funding priorities that are doing enormous damage. In the Senate the votes were always there for a dirty CR, a CR that funded all of Barack Obama's priorities. The Democrats will all vote for it--heck, of course they will. They have the other side funding their priorities. Of course, every Democrat will vote for that over and over and over and twice on Sunday. The simple reality on the Republican side is when leadership joins with the Democrats, about half of the Republican caucus is happy to move over to that side of the aisle. So the votes were always preordained. The motion I made just a moment ago was a motion to table the tree. You remember filling the tree. It is something we heard a lot about in the previous Congress. Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, did it all the time. Senators on this side of the aisle stood over and over and said: It is abuse of process. In fact, we even campaigned with our leadership saying: We are going to have an open amendment process. Yet what has happened here is that Majority Leader McConnell has taken a page out of Leader Reid's playbook and filled the tree. I moved to table the tree, and what you then saw was leadership denying a second. What does ``denying a second'' mean? Denying a recorded vote. Why is that important? When you are breaking the commitments you have made to the men and women who have elected you, the most painful thing in the world is accountability. When you are misleading the men and women who showed up to vote for you, you don't want sunshine making clear that you voted no. A recorded vote means each Senator's name is on it. Now, why did I move to table the tree? Simply to add the amendment that I had, which, No. 1, would have said that not one penny goes to Planned Parenthood, and No. 2, not one penny goes to implementing this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal unless and until they comply with Federal law--the administration complies with Federal law--and hands over the full deal, including the side agreements with Iran. What you saw was that Republican leadership desperately does not want a vote on that. Tomorrow I intend to make that motion again. And when I make that motion again, I would encourage those watching to see which Senators are here to give a second or not and to vote yea or nay. I would note that when you deny a second, which is truly an unprecedented procedural trick--it used to be that was a courtesy that was afforded to all Senators. Indeed, in the opposing party routinely over and over when a Democrat or Republican asked for a second, everyone raised their hand. But leadership has discovered: We can do this in the dark of the night. But I would encourage those watching to see, No. 1, when this motion is offered again, who shows up to offer a second and who either doesn't raise his hand or just doesn't come to the floor. One of the ways you avoid accountability is you are somehow somewhere else doing something very important instead of actually showing up for the battle that is waging right here and now. But I would also encourage people to watch very carefully what happens after that. After that you have a voice vote. A voice vote is still a vote. Let's be clear. Standing on the floor, there were two Senators--Senator Lee and I--who voted aye, who voted to table the tree and take up the amendment barring funding for Planned Parenthood and barring funding for this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. The remaining Senators on the Republican side--Leader McConnell, Whip Cornyn, Senator Alexander, and Senator Cotton--those four Senators loudly voted no. It is still a vote, even though it is not a recorded vote. It is a vote on the Senate floor. So why did Speaker Boehner resign? Well, I mentioned to you that the votes were always cooked here. The Democrats plus Republican leadership and the votes they bring with them ensure plenty of votes for a dirty CR, a CR that funds ObamaCare, that funds amnesty, that funds Planned Parenthood, that funds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. But the House was always the bulwark. The Presiding Officer will remember in 2013 when we had a fight over ObamaCare. The Presiding Officer was serving in the House at the time. In that fight we never had the votes in the Senate. Actually, the Senate was under control of the Democrats. They were going to do everything they could to defend ObamaCare regardless of the millions of people who were hurt. But the House was the bulwark in that fight, and in particular there was a core of 40 or 50 strong, principled conservatives who cared deeply about honoring the commitments they made to the men and women who elected them. That was always the strength we had in that fight. You know, it has been interesting reading some of the press coverage, speculating that there would be some magic parliamentary trick that would somehow stop this corrupt deal. Well, in the Senate there are no magic parliamentary tricks. When you have the Democrats plus Republican leadership and a chunk of the Republicans, those votes can roll over any parliamentary trick you might use. Even with the Blood Moon we just had, there are no mystical powers that allow you to roll over them. But in the House we still have those 30, 40, 50 strong conservatives. So how is it that Speaker Boehner and Leader McConnell could promise there will never, ever be a shutdown? Because, I believe, Speaker Boehner has decided to cut a deal with Leader Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democrats, that this dirty CR is going to be passed out of the Senate and is going to go to the House. The Speaker is going to take it up on the floor and pass it with all the Democrats--just as Leader McConnell did--and a handful of Republicans who will go with Republican leadership. A very significant percentage of Republicans will vote no. But here is the problem: Speaker Boehner has done that more than once. In this instance, there were too many Republicans who were tired of seeing their leadership lead the Democrats rather than lead the Republican Party. I believe if Speaker Boehner had done that--had passed a dirty CR funding Planned Parenthood, funding this Iranian nuclear deal--he would have lost his speakership. A Member of the House had introduced a motion to vacate the Chair because House Republicans were fed up with their leader not leading--at least not leading their party, leading the Democratic Party. So Speaker Boehner faced a conundrum. If he did what he and Leader McConnell promised, which is to fund all of Barack Obama's priorities, he would have lost his job. And so what did he do? He announced that he is resigning as Speaker and resigning as a Member of Congress. That is unsurprising, but it also telegraphs the deal that he has just cut. It is a deal to surrender and join with the Democrats. Notice he said he is going to stay a month. He is going to stay a month in order to join with the Democrats and fund Barack Obama's priorities. Now let's talk about some of the substantive issues that we ought to be talking about. Let's start with Planned Parenthood. In the past couple of months, a series of videos have come out about Planned Parenthood. To some of the people watching this, you may never have seen the videos. Why is that? Because the mainstream media has engaged in a virtual media blackout on them: ABC, NBC, CBS, the last thing they want to do is show these videos. If you watch FOX News, you can see the videos. But the mainstream media, in the great tradition of Pravda, wants [[Page S6969]] to make sure the citizenry doesn't see what is in these videos. I would encourage every American--Republican or Democrat--regardless of where you fall on the right to life, even--and, in fact, especially--if you consider yourself pro-choice--to just watch these videos. Go online and watch them and ask yourself: Are these my values? Is this what I believe? These videos show senior officials from Planned Parenthood laughing, sipping chardonnay and callously harvesting and selling the body parts of unborn children over and over and over. One senior official was caught on video laughing and saying she hopes she sells enough body parts of unborn children to buy herself a Lamborghini. Again, I would suggest to just ask yourself: Are these my values? In another video a lab tech describes a little baby boy--unborn, aborted, about 2 pounds, his heart still beating. She was instructed to insert scissors under his chin to cut open the face of this little boy and harvest his brain because the brain was valuable. Planned Parenthood could sell the brain. This is something out of ``Brave New World.'' These are human beings. That little boy had a heart that was still beating, had a brain that was being harvested. He had a soul given to him by God Almighty. He was made in the image of God. We are now a nation that harvests the body parts of little baby boys and girls. It is the very definition of inhumanity to treat children like agriculture, to be grown and killed for their body parts, to be sold for profit. There is a reason that the media and the Democrats don't want these videos shown, because anyone watching these videos will be horrified. But they are not just horrific; they are also prima facie evidence of criminal activity. There are multiple Federal statutes--criminal statutes--that Planned Parenthood appears to be violating, perhaps on a daily basis. The first and most direct is a prohibition on selling the body parts of unborn children for a profit. Federal criminal law makes that a felony with up to 10 years of jail time. Now these videos show them very clearly selling body parts. They also show them bartering a price. They will argue it wasn't for a profit. But you watch these videos. You watch the undercover buyer saying: How much will you give me for them? And you see the Planned Parenthood official saying: Well, how much can I get? I don't want to bargain against myself. On its face, that is evidence of bargaining for a profit. If you want the highest price you can get, it is not tied to your costs. It is tied to whatever dollars, whatever revenue you can bring in. Planned Parenthood is the largest abortion provider in the country. As another one of these videos reflects, it is a volume business--Planned Parenthood--taking the lives of unborn children and then selling them-- apparently for profit. It is also a Federal criminal offense to alter the means of an abortion for the purpose of harvesting the organs of the unborn child. That is a separate criminal offense. On video after video, you see Planned Parenthood officials saying: OK. What parts would you like? We can perform a different abortion depending on what parts you want us to harvest. On the videos they essentially admit to this crime. They are filmed in the act. There is the third criminal offense that provides that you cannot harvest the organs of an unborn child without informed consent from the mother. Yet again these videos seem to indicate that Planned Parenthood treats informed consent as a technicality that is sometimes complied with and sometimes ignored. Now, I will say as an aside that ordinarily, when a national organization is caught on film committing a pattern of felonies, the next steps are predictable: The Department of Justice opens an investigation; the FBI shows up and seizes their records. Everything on those videos suggests those felonies are still occurring today. What does it say about the Obama Justice Department that no one on the face of the planet believes there is any chance the Justice Department would even begin to investigate Planned Parenthood? What does it say about the most lawless partisan Department of Justice that there is this group that is a political ally of the President, so that is apparently all that matters. If it is an ally of the President, it doesn't matter that they are videotaped committing a felony. The Department of Justice will not even look at it. I am an alumnus of the U.S. Department of Justice. I was an Associate Deputy Attorney General. I spent much of my adult life working in law enforcement. The Department of Justice has a long, distinguished record of remaining outside of partisan politics, of staying above the partisan fray, of being blind to party or ideology and simply enforcing the law and the Constitution. I am sorry to say that under Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch, the Department of Justice has completely besmirched that tradition. No one remotely believes the Obama Justice Department will even begin to investigate this pattern of felonies. You don't see Democrats suggesting it. No one in the media suggests it. And by the way, if this were a Republican administration and the entity that admitted to a pattern of felonies was a private entity that supported Republicans, you would see on CBS, NBC, and ABC an indictment clock every night. You would see the anchors saying: When will this investigation be opened? When will they be indicted? Instead, the media pretends these videos don't exist. In the face of what appears to be a national criminal enterprise, we are faced here with a much simpler question: Will we continue to pay for it? Will we continue to pay for it with your and my tax dollars? Will we send $500 million a year to a private organization to use to fund this ongoing criminal organization? What is the position of the Democrats? Hear no evil, see no evil. They do not care. What Democrat do you see calling for the enforcement of criminal laws against Planned Parenthood? What Democrat do you hear saying, at a minimum, let's not send taxpayer money to fund this? Not one. Not a single Democrat stood up and said that. Let me ask you, Mr. President, what happens if Planned Parenthood gets indicted? Because even though the U.S. Department of Justice under President Obama has become little more than a partisan arm of the Democratic National Committee, there are State and local prosecutors who are investigating Planned Parenthood right now. If Planned Parenthood is indicted, will the Democrats maintain their wall of silence and say: We are going to continue to fund them under indictment. By all indications, that answer is yes. We haven't heard a single Democrat say: Well, if they are indicted, then we will stop. The response from our leadership is that we can't win this fight. That is their response. They say: Well, we can't win the Planned Parenthood fight. Why? Because we don't have 60 votes; because we don't have 67 votes. If that is the standard, then the Republican leadership standard is that we will do only what Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi approve of. That is what it means. You want to understand why the American people are frustrated? We were told: If only we had a Republican House of Representatives, then things would be different. In 2010, millions of us rose up in incredible numbers and won an historic tidal wave election. The Presiding Officer was a youth pastor, called to minister, yet he stood up and said: My country is in crisis. I am going to step forward and serve. The 2010 election was historic, yet very little changed. Then we were told: OK. We have a House of Representatives, but the problem is the Senate. As long as Harry Reid is majority leader, we can't do anything. Over and over again Washington gray beards would go on television, and in gravelly tones they would say: You cannot govern with one-half of one-third of government. The House of Representatives is not enough, but if we had the Senate, then things would be different. The problem is Harry Reid. The Presiding Officer will recall during the fight over ObamaCare a number of Members of this body--Republicans--said: No, no, no, no. We can't fight on ObamaCare. We have to wait until we have a Republican Senate to fight. So the American people obliged. In 2014, millions of us rose up for the second tidal wave election in a period of 4 years. We won nine Senate seats. [[Page S6970]] We retired Harry Reid as majority leader. We won the largest majority in the House of Representatives since the 1920s. It has been now over 9 months since we have had Republican majorities in both Houses, and I ask: What exactly have those Republican majorities accomplished? I have asked that question all over the country in townhalls. I have never been at a townhall where the response, spontaneous, was not absolutely nothing. That is true in every State I visit. And sadly, my response over and over again is: You know, it's worse than that. I wish the answer were absolutely nothing. It would have been better if the Republican majorities had done absolutely nothing because what, in fact, have they done? Well, the very first thing that happened, right after that election in November, is we came back to Washington, and Republican leadership joined up with Harry Reid and the Democrats and passed a trillion dollar CR omnibus bill that was filled with pork, corporate welfare, and grew government, grew the debt. Then Republican leadership took the lead in funding ObamaCare. Then Republican leadership took the lead in funding Executive amnesty. Then Republican leadership took the lead in funding Planned Parenthood. And then, astonishingly, Republican leadership took the lead in confirming Loretta Lynch as Attorney General. Now, I ask: Which one of those decisions is one iota different from what would have happened with Harry Reid and the Democrats in charge of this Chamber? Those decisions are identical. And I would note, by the way, with Loretta Lynch, the Republican majority could have defeated that nomination. The Senate majority leader could have done so. She looked at the Senate Judiciary Committee, and she looked at the Senate, and when asked how she would differ from Eric Holder's Justice Department--the most lawless and partisan Justice Department we would ever see--and she said: No way whatsoever. When asked to point to a single instance in which she would be willing to stand up to President Obama to stop his lawlessness, to stop his abuse of power, she could not identify any circumstance in which she would ever stand up to the President who appointed her. Attorneys general from both parties have done that, for centuries. Now, with Eric Holder, the Senate could be forgiven because his lawlessness manifested primarily after he was confirmed. With Loretta Lynch, she told us beforehand. She looked us in the eyes and said: Hey, I am going to do exactly what my predecessor has done. And Republican leadership confirmed her anyway. Is it any wonder the American people are frustrated out of their minds? We keep winning elections, and the people we put in office don't do what they said they would do. Now, some people across the country ask me: Is Republican leadership just not very capable? Are they not that competent or are they unwilling to fight? Mr. President, it is neither. They are actually quite competent, and they are willing to fight. The question becomes what they are fighting for. There is a disconnect right now. If you or I go to our home State and to any gathering of citizens and we put up a white board and we ask the citizens in the room to give the top priorities they think Republican majorities in Congress should be focusing on, and we wrote the 20 priorities that came from the citizens of Oklahoma or the citizens of Texas or, for that matter, the citizens of any of the 50 States, those top 20 priorities--at least 18 of them--would appear nowhere on the leadership's priority list. On the other hand, if you drive just down the street in Washington to K Street--K Street is the street in Washington where the lobbyists primarily reside, where their offices are--and you get a gathering of corporate lobbyists that represent giant corporations and ask them their top priorities, the list that comes out will not just bear passing similarity but will be identical to the priorities of the Republican leadership. That's the disconnect. Do you know why we are not here fighting on this? Because not giving taxpayer money to Planned Parenthood is not among the priorities of the lobbyists on K Street, so leadership is not interested in doing it. That is the disconnect. Leadership does know how to fight. Just a couple of months ago, in dealing with the Export-Import Bank, we saw leadership in both Chambers go to extraordinary lengths with Herculean procedural steps to reauthorize a classic example of corporate welfare--hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer-guaranteed loans to giant corporations. Now, for that, leadership is incentivized because those corporations hire lobbyists and those lobbyists distribute checks, typically by the wheelbarrow. There is no incentive greater in this body than getting reelected, and the view of leadership is that you get reelected by raking in the cash. How do you think we have gotten an $18 trillion national debt? Because the way you reach bipartisan compromise in this body today, in the broken world of Washington, is you grow and grow and grow government, and you sit around in a room and say: I will spend for your priority, your priority, your priority--another trillion dollars and we are done. The only people to lose are your children and mine. The only people to lose are the next generations who find themselves mired deeper and deeper and deeper in debt. I think of my little girls Caroline and Catherine. They are 7 and 4. If we don't stop what we are doing, your children and my children will face a debt so crushing they will not be able to spend in the future for the priorities of the future--for their needs, for their wants, for whatever crises come up that the next generation confronts. They will spend their whole lives simply working to pay off the debts racked up by their deadbeat parents and grandparents. No generation in history has ever done this to their children and grandchildren. Our parents didn't do it to us. Their parents didn't do it to them. The reason is the corruption of this town, and it boils down to a simple proposition: The Democrats are willing to do anything to push their priorities, and the Republicans, the leadership, are not listening to the men and women who elected us. But it is actually an even deeper problem than that. On the Democratic side, the major donors that fund the Democratic Party, they don't despise their base. The billionaires who write the giant checks that fund President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and the Democrats on that side of the aisle don't despise the radical gay rights movement or the radical environmentalist movement or all the people who knock on doors and get Democrats elected. The simple reality is a very large percentage of the Republican donors actively despise our base--actively despise the men and women who showed up and voted you and me into office. I can tell you, when you sit down and talk with a New York billionaire Republican donor--and I have talked with quite a few New York billionaire Republican donors, California Republican donors--their questions start out as follows. First of all, you have to come out for gay marriage, you need to be pro-choice, and you need to support amnesty. That is where the Republican donors are. You wonder why Republicans will not fight on any of these issues? Because the people writing the checks agree with the Democrats. Now mind you, the people who show up at the polls who elected you and me and who elected this Republican majority--far too many of the Republican donors look down on those voters as a bunch of ignorant hicks and rubes. It is why leadership likes show votes. It wasn't too long ago when the Washington cartel was able to mask it all with a show vote or two, and they told the rubes back home: See, we voted on it; we just don't have the votes. When I was first elected to this body, many times I heard more senior Senators saying some variation of the following: Now, Ted, that is what you tell folks back home. You don't actually do it. Here is what has changed. The voters have gotten more informed. They now understand the difference between show votes and a real vote. They understand the vote we had 1 week ago on Planned Parenthood was designed to lose, to placate those silly folks who think we shouldn't be sending taxpayer funds to a criminal organization that is selling the body parts of unborn children. But on the actual vote that could [[Page S6971]] change policy, leadership has no interest in fighting whatsoever. In the past couple of weeks, one of my colleagues sent me a letter that really embodied the leadership message. This letter said: ``Explain to me how you get 67 votes to defund Planned Parenthood. If you can't produce 67 votes, I won't support it.'' If that is our standard, then we should all be honest with the men and women who elected us: We do not have 67 Republican votes in this Chamber, and there is no realistic prospect of our getting 67 votes any time in the foreseeable future. If the standard is, unless we get 67 votes, Republican leadership will support no policy issue, then each of us when we run should tell the voters: If you vote for me, I will support whatever policy agenda Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi decide because that is my standard. If I don't have 67 votes--do you ever recall Harry Reid and the Democrats saying: How can we get Republican votes? No. Their side is absolutely committed to their principles. You don't see them holding back at all. If the standard is, how do we get 67 votes, name one thing that leadership will fight for. Well, the answer I mentioned, the three types of votes are they will fight for big government, they will fight to grow government, and they will fight to expand corporate welfare. Well, that can indeed get 67 votes. But I have never been to a townhall once where citizens said to me: The problem is we don't have enough corporate welfare. I need more subsidies for Big Business. If 100 percent of the agenda of Republican leadership is more subsidies for Big Business, what the heck are we doing in the Senate in the first place? That certainly wasn't why I ran, and I know it wasn't why you ran either. You don't have to win every fight, you don't have to fight every fight, but you do have to stand for something. Let's look beyond Planned Parenthood for a minute. Let's look to Iran. Of all the decisions the Obama administration has made, there may be none more damaging than this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal. If this deal goes through, there will be three consequences: No. 1, the Obama administration will become, quite literally, the world's leading financier of radical Islamic terrorists. Now, when I said that a couple months ago, President Obama got very, very upset. He said it was ridiculous that I would say such a thing, but despite attacking me directly, President Obama didn't actually endeavor to refute the substance of what I said. So let's review the facts: Fact No. 1, Iran is today the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. That fact is undisputed even by this administration. Fact No. 2, if this deal goes through, over $100 billion will go directly to Iran to the Ayatollah Khamenei. Fact No. 3, if that happens, billions of those dollars will go to Hamas, to Hezbollah, to the Houthis, to radical Islamic terrorists across the globe who will use those billions to murder Americans, to murder Israelis, and to murder Europeans. It is worth remembering, 14 years ago this month, the horrific terrorist attack that was carried out on September 11. Osama bin Laden hated America, but he never had billions of dollars. He never had $100 billion. The Ayatollah Khamenei hates America every bit as much as Osama bin Laden did, and this administration is giving him control of over $100 billion. Imagine what bin Laden could have done. Look at the damage he did with 19 terrorists carrying box cutters. Now imagine that same zealotry with billions of dollars behind it. The consequences of this deal could easily be another terrorist attack that dwarfs September 11 in scale, that kills far more than the roughly 3,000 lives that were snuffed out. Who in their right mind would send over $100 billion to a theocratic zealot who chants ``Death to America''? A second consequence of his catastrophic deal is that we are abandoning four hostages--four American hostages--in Iranian jails: Pastor Saeed Abedini, an American citizen whose wife Naghmeh lives in Idaho. I have visited with Naghmeh many times. Pastor Saeed has two little kids who desperately want their daddy to come home. Pastor Saeed was sentenced to 8 years in prison for the crime of preaching the Gospel. Just last week was the 3-year anniversary of Pastor Saeed's imprisonment. Reports are that he is being horribly mistreated, that his health is failing, and yet President Obama cannot bring himself to utter the words ``Pastor Saeed Abedini''--$100 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, and Pastor Saeed Abedini remains in prison. Also in prison is Amir Hekmati, an American marine the President has abandoned. Also in prison is Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post reporter--I note to the reporters in the Gallery, a colleague of yours--abandoned by President Obama in an Iranian prison, thrown in jail for doing his job, reporting on the news--and Robert Levinson, whose whereabouts remain unknown. Why is the President refusing to even utter their names? The third consequence of this deal is this deal will only accelerate Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. The administration claims the deal will prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Why? Because they promised not to do it. We have learned from Iran, they break their promises over and over and over again. And what we do know is that they will have an extra $100 billion to develop nuclear weapons. Now, I will say the administration laughingly suggested: Well, they will use that on infrastructure, to rebuild their roads, to rebuild their energy industry. Right now they are sending vast sums to Hamas and Hezbollah, funding terrorism across the world, and they have those same infrastructure needs. With another $100 billion, you don't think they are going to funnel an awful lot of it to developing nuclear weapons? I would point out, it is not by accident that the Ayatollah Khamenei refers to Israel as the Little Satan and America as the Great Satan. This is the one threat on the face of the Earth that poses a real possibility of millions of Americans being murdered in the flash of an eye. Everything I am saying the Republican leadership has said over and over again. Yet Republican leadership refuses to enforce the terms of the Iran review legislation--Federal law that the administration is defying by not handing over the entire deal. I have laid out a clear path, a detailed path that leadership can follow to stop this deal, and leadership refuses to do so. Instead, we had a show vote that was designed to lose, and it did exactly what we expected. The Democrats, by and large, put party loyalty above the national security of this country, above standing with our friend and ally the nation of Israel, above protecting the lives of millions of Americans. If we truly believed what so many of us have said, that this poses the risk of murdering millions of Americans, is there any higher priority? The most powerful constitutional tool Congress has is the power of the purse. If we had the ability to stop this deal--and we don't--and millions of Americans die, how do we explain that to the men and women who elected us? I am not advocating that we fight willy-nilly. I am advocating that we fight on things that matter. Don't give $500 million to Planned Parenthood, a corrupt organization that is taking the lives of vast numbers of unborn children and selling their body parts, in a criminal conspiracy, directly contrary to Federal law. Don't give $100 billion to the Ayatollah Khamenei, who seeks to murder millions. In both instances, those are defending life. Yet Republican leadership is not willing to lift a finger. If only all the people who might be murdered by a nuclear weapon could create a PAC in Washington and hire some lobbyists, maybe leadership would listen to them. But the truckdriver at home, the waitress at home, the schoolteacher at home, the pastor, the police officer, the working men and women--the Washington cartel does not listen to them. I will note where this deal is headed. In December, when this dirty continuing resolution expires, leadership is already foreshadowing that they plan to bust the budget caps. Why? We talked about it at the beginning. Barack Obama has discovered that when he says the word ``shutdown,'' the Republican leadership screams, surrenders, and runs to the hills. Obama, understanding that quite well, says: If you don't bust the budget caps, I will shut the government down. In this bizarre process, Republican leadership will blame whatever Obama [[Page S6972]] does on other Republicans. You noticed how much energy leader McConnell devotes to attacking conservatives? You notice how much energy Speaker Boehner devotes to attacking conservatives? Just yesterday the Speaker of the House went on national television, and on national television he directed an obscene epithet at me personally. He is welcome to insult whomever he likes. I don't intend to reciprocate. But when has leadership ever shown that level of venom, that level of animosity to President Obama and the Democrats who are bankrupting this country, who are destroying the Constitution, who are endangering the future of our children and grandchildren, who are retreating from leadership and the world, and who have created an environment that has led to the rise of radical Islamic terrorists? One of the dynamics we have seen in fight after fight is that Harry Reid and the Democrats sit back and laugh. Why? Because it is Republican leadership that leads the onslaught, attacking conservatives, saying: No, you can't, and we will not do anything to stop ObamaCare. No, you can't, and we will not do anything to stop amnesty. No, you can't, and we will not do anything to stop Planned Parenthood. No, you can't, and we will not do anything to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. If Republican leadership really believes we can accomplish nothing, then why does it matter if you have a Republican House or Senate? Every 2 years come October, November, we tell the voters it matters intensely. To paraphrase the immortal words of Hillary Clinton, what difference does it make if the standard for Republican leadership is, anything that gets 67 votes we will support. That means Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi remain the de facto leaders of the Senate and the House. I would note, by the way, if leadership goes through with their suggestion to bust the budget caps, they will have done something astonishing. Historically, the three legs of the conservative stool have been fiscal conservatives, social conservatives, and national security conservatives. Between Planned Parenthood, Iran, and the budget caps, leadership will have managed to abandon all three. No wonder the American people are frustrated. No wonder the American people do not understand why leadership isn't listening to them. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's postcloture time has expired. Mr. CRUZ.

the authority of the government of the united states to do business ends. the funding for our government ends. it is a scary time. we don't want that to happen--most of us--because we know it will be catastrophic. there will be people who will suffer if we fail to do our job. now, this isn't the first time we have been up against a deadline. we have faced them before, and many times we have to buy a little extra time to negotiate the budget. that is understandable. in this circumstance, though, we actually have announced candidates for the presidency of the united states who are calling for a government shutdown. what happens when our government shuts down? well, it is pretty obvious. agencies stop doing business as usual. what we find, though, is that the impact goes far beyond just that simple statement. i went back to illinois this last weekend, and i went for a visit to scott air force base. it is the largest single employer in the state of illinois and downstate. in 2013--the last time we had a government shutdown--the junior senator from texas, senator ted cruz, wanted to shut down our government to protest obamacare. so he successfully closed down the government and found other republicans who would join him in that effort, and it went on for a long period of time. in 2013, at scott air force base, one of the most important defense facilities in our country, in belleville, il, we saw two-thirds of the civilian workforce--that is about 3,400 people--sent home immediately without pay. those who were required to report for duty, including all of the base's 5,000 military personnel, would have been given ious rather than paychecks. scott air force base families were forced to limit their spending and stretch their savings while the senator from texas gave speeches on the floor about dr. seuss. i am not making this up. this had an impact on the entire region of southwestern illinois. scott air force base has a $1.6 billion economic impact on the local area, including supporting thousands of indirect jobs. every part of this regional economy felt the impact of this decision to shut down the government 2 years ago--gas stations, restaurants, small businesses, contractors, everybody. now, this brinksmanship goes far beyond flowery speeches on the floor and press attention. the last shutdown hurt the gross domestic product of the united states of america. consumer confidence drops when the government shuts down. we saw $2 billion in lost productivity from furloughed employees. federal reserve chairman janet yellen said: we have a good recovery in place that's really making progress and to see congress take actions that would endanger that progress, i think that would be more than unfortunate. so to me that's congress' job. the ceo of jpmorgan chase, a man named jamie dimon, speaking of the last republican government shutdown, said, ``washington has really slowed american down.'' i agree. and if that were the only thing that was happening, it would be bad enough. but there is more. today i went to a neighborhood in chicago, the all saints episcopal church in ravenswood. they are doing a restoration on this beautiful church built back in the 19th century. i met with the pastor there. we were at the food pantry of this church. this episcopal church tries to help neighborhood residents who are struggling to find enough to eat. we had a little press conference with the local congressman, mike quigley and jan schakowsky, and people who represented the food pantries of chicago in that area. they are worried about a shutdown and what a shutdown means to them. how would it affect the all saints episcopal church food pantry and the men and women who go in there on a regular basis to pick up some canned goods to get by? here is what it means. many of these people are on food stamps. we call it the snap program now. the snap program, on average, gives a person food worth $7 a day, so the notion that people are going out for steak dinners on food stamps is not quite accurate. sara--and i won't use her full name--who is 81 years old, came up to talk about what life is like for her. she was a hard-working person, stricken with cancer in 2002, which recurred in 2004, and she had to quit working. she has a walker now and she gets around, but all she has is her social security check and food stamps. that is how she survives from week to week and month to month. what happens when there is a government shutdown? they cut off food stamps. did that happen last time? no. the last time the senator from texas shut down the government, it didn't happen because president obama had a surplus in his recovery fund and he took the surplus and put it in the food stamps so there would be no interruption of service. you see, most of the recipients of food stamps are children. single moms raising kids and not making enough money supplement their income with food stamps and buy food for their kids. food stamps are also used by elderly people like sara who are struggling on a fixed income. this time is different. if these presidential wannabes who are determined to shut down the government this time are successful, we are going to have problems right away. it turns out the only surplus left in the food stamp or snap benefit fund is about $3 billion. that will keep the program going for 2 weeks. after 2 weeks, they cut off the food stamps. what does that mean? well, for a lot of people it means a lot of suffering--primarily for the poorest people among us. did anyone notice last week what happened in washington? the city was transformed by the visit of pope francis. congress was in awe of this man who came and spoke to us in very human terms about what he thinks would be our obligation, not just as elected officials but as human beings. one of his highest priorities is that we have some caring and sensitivity for those who struggle--the poor, the people on food stamps. so for all the applause and all of the posing for pictures that went on last week with the pope, here we are this week discussing a government shutdown. here we are this week discussing whether we are going to cut off food stamps for poor people in america. it is a sad reality to think of what a government shutdown would do in human terms to those wonderful folks working at scott air force base in belleville, il, or to sara who will go into the all saints episcopal church food pantry and try to get by, as food stamps are cut off. why? why would we do that? how can we possibly be serving this nation--this great nation--by stalling our economy and hurting innocent people and punishing those who are serving our country in uniform and otherwise? some think it is a grand strategy--a great political strategy. it may move [[page s6964]] them up from the smaller debate to the big-time debate when it comes to running for president. to me it is an indication we have lost our way. in june, i joined with the other leaders on this side of the aisle in sending a letter to the republican leader saying: please, don't wait until the end of september to face this budget reality. sit down now-- back in june--with the president, with the leaders on the republican side and the democratic side. let us compromise in good faith. let us meet our responsibilities. well, that is what we face. as senator reid said a few minutes earlier, there is a suggestion that maybe as a parting gift to speaker boehner we will extend the budget temporarily until december 11, 2 weeks before christmas, just days before the hanukkah season--that we would extend the budget until then and then, once again, be up against the deadline and the prospect of shutting down our government. we can do better. we should do better. we need to make certain we keep faith with the people who send us here. we need to make certain we do our job--not just to send a continuing resolution to the president but to resolve this issue. we should not be threatening a government shutdown now or in december when we know how devastating that can be. i hope congress gets busy taking care of the work we were sent here to do. i think it is time for those bipartisan budget negotiations. it is beyond time. now is the time for congress to act responsibly to develop a budget that allows america to thrive. madam president, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. portman. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer (mr. coats). without objection, it is so ordered. mr. portman. mr. president, i wish to talk about an amendment i plan to offer in a little while, once somebody comes from our side or the other side because they would like to be here to talk about it with me, as i understand it--maybe even to object to it, maybe to agree with it. but i wish to speak about the amendment, if i could, for a moment. right now, we are debating the continuing resolution. this would be to continue a level of spending from now until december 11. there are a bunch of changes in that from last year's spending, but it is basically a continuation of the previous year until we can work out our differences. it is not the way to govern around here. what we should be doing instead is having individual spending bills come up. there are 12 different appropriations bills. the ideal way to handle this is the way it used to be done, which is that the appropriations committee and its subcommittees deal with these individual spending bills. for instance, one is for commerce, the state department, and the justice department. one is for the department of health and human services, and one is for the department of defense. when we do that, what happens is we have oversight hearings, and we have congress playing its rightful role of saying: are these agencies doing the right thing? are these programs working or aren't they working? we might increase spending with a program that is actually working well, decrease spending from another program, and eliminate a third program that is not working well at all. that is what congress is supposed to do. that is our job here. under the constitution, congress was given the power of the purse, meaning that every dime has to be appropriated by the congress. what has happened over the years--particularly in the last several years--is that congress has not moved forward on these appropriations bills because they have been blocked. in this case, this year we have been trying to bring up appropriations bills and the other side, the democrats, have been blocking even considering an appropriations bill. we have had this debate here on the floor. many of us have heard it. but the bottom line is the committees have actually done their work and reported out 12 different appropriations bills. so 12 bills are ready to come to the floor. by the way, most of these bills have been reported out with huge bipartisan majorities. i saw one the other day. it was 24 to 3, for instance. i know the presiding officer has been involved in some of these issues over the years. it is typical, actually, that appropriators do their jobs. senator mikulski, senator cochran, and others work out the differences, but we simply can't get them voted on on the floor. people may say: why can't you? well, because it requires 60 votes. we have to overcome a 60-vote hurdle in order to even proceed to the legislation. so we haven't been able to vote on a single appropriations bill before september 30, which is the fiscal year-end and which is coming up this week. it is no way to run a railroad, much less a government--by the way, the government that has the biggest budget of any government in the world, the government of the greatest nation in the world. we can't even bring these individual spending bills up here for a debate and a vote. it is just wrong. again, when we don't do that, what we don't have is the oversight. i would think both sides would want to have oversight over these agencies and departments so we understand what is working and what is not working and so that those tax dollars are spent wisely. that is the kind of stewardship that we are responsible for. as taxpayers, as representatives of taxpayers, we should want to be sure those dollars are spent in a way that is most effective. yet, without having these appropriations bills, it is just impossible to do. instead, we are faced with this possibility of on september 30 not having any of what is called discretionary spending, which is not all of the spending of government, but it is the spending that congress appropriates every year, and having the possibility of parts of government actually not being able to operate because september 30 is the fiscal year-end. it is just the wrong way to do business. so the amendment i am going to offer later this afternoon is an amendment that simply says: let's adopt a new bill, new legislation that says: let's end government shutdowns. how would we do it? we would say that as of september 30, if there is any bill that is not passed, any one of the 12--remember that this year none of the 12 were passed--none of them. but on any year, if any one of those were not passed, then we would simply continue the spending from the previous year, but there would be a reduction in that spending over time. after 120 days there would be a 1-percent reduction, giving 120 days to work with the appropriations committee to say: ok, we know you don't want to see the spending cut, and we know you have priorities you would like to fund, but it is going to be cut 1 percent after 120 days, then 1 percent after the next 90 days, 1 percent after the next 90 days, and 1 percent after the next 90 days. so we get to a point where we have to see a reduction in spending every year, which is not necessarily a bad thing because congress spends more than it takes in every year. but if appropriators and others here in congress don't want to see that, they would have to get their act together and actually pass appropriations bills. once an appropriations bill is passed, the end government shutdowns act would not apply. this seems to me to be a really logical bipartisan commonsense solution to the problem that we are facing here. again, the problem is congress is not doing its work. we are not getting these appropriations bills done. it is not for lack of work in the committees this year. again, all 12 bills were reported out of committee. i believe the same is true in the house. yet we cannot get here on the floor of the senate the 60 votes needed to come up with the ability to proceed to these appropriations bills. it is called a filibuster. they are being filibustered. we are not even debating them. this is just wrong. i think, again, the way to get around that is to say: ok, if you want to try to block these bills, what is going to happen is we are going to have automatic spending from last year with no increases--in fact, decreases--and decreasing more over time, until congress gets its act together and actually passes this legislation. this idea is so commonsense that when we had a vote on it a couple of years ago, when i was able to bring it [[page s6965]] up for a vote--and we will see tonight whether i am permitted to do that--we actually had 46 senators support it. now, not everybody supported it on the appropriations committee. some of them obviously had concerns about it. not every republican supported it. there were a few republicans who didn't support it. by the way, one republican who didn't support it last time is now a cosponsor of the legislation because she has looked at it, she has understood the system is not working, and she has been persuaded it is the right way to go. it was bipartisan last time. senator tester and i were the two cosponsors of it. so i hope i will have the opportunity to offer that amendment here this afternoon because i think it makes all the sense in the world. as we are debating a continuing resolution again, the so-called cr--which is the wrong way to govern--let's also pass as part of that a new discipline, a new idea, a new approach that says: let's not do this again. let's not ever have the threat of a government shutdown hanging over us. instead, come september 30, if an appropriations bill isn't done, fine, continue the spending from last year, with a slow ratcheting down of that spending. i think that makes all the sense in the world. it takes away this political football that is being thrown back and forth. it takes away the specter for our economy, for our businesses, and for our families of not knowing whether they are going to have this government operation continue after september 30 in whatever area is affecting our economy or those businesses or those families. i think it makes a lot of sense, and i think it provides an incentive for congress to get its work done. and congress should be doing every year all 12 appropriations bills--doing the oversight that goes into that, deciding what gets more money, what gets less money, what gets thrown out altogether. it doesn't make any sense. in the huge bureaucracy of the vast federal government, not every program is perfect. let's be honest; a lot of them need reform. if we don't have this process of the power of the purse--the leverage of the power of the purse to be able to say ``prove this program is working,'' and when it doesn't, ``we are going to pull the funding away''--you lose the ability for congress to be an effective partner with the executive branch and the judicial branch the way our founders set it up. again, congress alone has the power of the purse. every dime has to be appropriated by this congress, and congress is not doing its job. this amendment, if we put in place this new practice, would be a tremendous help to get congress back on track. it wasn't too long ago that this happened. i have been here almost 5 years now or 4\1/2\ years. we haven't had a single year where all the appropriations bills were done. in fact, very few appropriations bills have been voted on at all. this year not a single appropriations bill--zero--has come to the floor of the senate because they have been blocked. they have all come out of committee now, but not a single one is allowed to get voted on here in the senate. i do hope that my own leadership on the republican side will keep bringing these bills up. at least then we have an opportunity to talk about them--what is in the bills and why it is a good idea for us to have the oversight. again, the reforms to these programs--the spending cuts, the spending increases for programs that are working well, the elimination altogether of programs that aren't working--we should at least have the opportunity to discuss them and talk about it. i was hopeful we would see a colleague from the other side of the aisle show up or a member of the appropriations committee. i was told i could give this little talk at 5, and i had the opportunity to offer this amendment. i will have to come back later and offer it again. i don't know if my colleague from iowa is planning to speak---- mr. grassley. no. mr. portman. mr. president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. portman. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. the senator from ohio. mr. portman. mr. president, earlier i had the opportunity to talk a little about the amendment i am about to offer. this is an amendment to the underlying bill, which is a continuing resolution. the amendment has to do with a piece of legislation called the end government shutdowns act. excuse me. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to be able to speak for 5 minutes in order to finish the conversation that we started earlier this evening. the presiding officer. is there objection? without objection, it is so ordered. mr. portman. mr. president, i talked about the fact that here we are, once again, without the appropriations bills done and forced to do a continuing resolution from now until december 11, and that is because later this week, on september 30, when the fiscal year ends and comes to a close, we will not have done the appropriations bills. it is not that we haven't done one or two or three; we haven't done any of them, and there are 12 of them. i think it is time for us to take a new approach; that is, to have an end government shutdowns discipline put before this congress which says: any time you get to this point with any of the appropriations bills--including now where we have all of them--that we instead have a continuation of last year's spending but that it ratchets down over time to provide an incentive for all of us in congress--democrats and republicans alike, the appropriations committee, and all of us--to get our work done and to do our job under the constitution. the power of the purse is exclusively delegated to the congress. it will help us to get our job done if we had this by having the end government shutdowns discipline in place. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment and call up my amendment no. 2702, the end government shutdowns amendment. the presiding officer. is there objection? mr. cochran. reserving the right to object. the presiding officer. the senator from mississippi. mr. cochran. mr. president, if i understand the senator's suggestion correctly, his amendment would create an automatic continuing resolution to fund the federal government in the event an annual appropriations bill is not enacted by the time the fiscal year expires. that may sound harmless enough, but what we are saying is that not only is the power of the senate suspended and put on hold but the obligations of the committee system are put under a threat--that unless you complete action on legislation that is referred to the committee of jurisdiction by a certain time, you are out of business, and whoever wants to offer an amendment as a substitute gets to offer that and pass it on a majority vote. we are already required to have three-fifths of the members vote to cut off debate in order to be sure that all senators--not just a bare majority--get to decide the decisions of the senate and get to actively participate in the process by offering amendments. my friend's amendment abolishes offering any other alternatives for a full debate--unlimited debate--which is why the senate is here, to cool down the passions of the moment. a senator might have a good idea and want to change a law, repeal a resolution, deny access to federal funds for this, that or the other that goes to a state that is very important, and their interests are just as important. this is a terrible amendment, and it ought to be rejected. i hope the senator will withhold offering the amendment. we can have hearings on this and see what other senators may think about it, but at first blush, this seems like this is an amendment whose time has not come. we are not ready to dismantle the rules of the senate piece by piece. well, we have the right of unlimited debate, and senators can talk as long as they wish to. we don't have to go through a rules committee to get permission or get permission from any other senator. these are direct responsibilities of individual senators selected by their states to stand up for their interests, not to go to washington and cave in on something that might be a good-sounding amendment [[page s6966]] or might have the passions of the moment behind it so that there appears to be a wave of support, but until you have a chance to seriously consider the individual issues involved, until three-fifths of the senate decides to cut off debate--i strongly object to this amendment. the presiding officer. is there objection? mr. cochran. i object. the presiding officer. objection is heard. the senator from ohio. mr. portman. mr. president, i appreciate the comments of my friend and my colleague, the chairman of the appropriations committee. i look forward to talking to him more about this. as i said earlier, 46 senators supported this in the past, including all but two or three republicans, by the way, and one of them is now a cosponsor of the legislation. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call under rule xxii be waived with respect to today's cloture vote. the presiding officer. is there objection? mr. durbin. mr. president, reserving the right to object. i wish to have 1 minute in order to debate the matter that is before us. the presiding officer. is there objection? the senator from illinois. mr. durbin. mr. president, i stand with the senator from mississippi. we may be from opposite political parties, but i certainly agree with him that the suggestion by the senator from ohio does not serve the best interests of this country. imagine if his proposal went through and we were faced with inadequate funding for medical care for our veterans. i am sorry to say the senator from ohio has suggested that we would have last year's level of funding with potentially a 4-percent cut. it would be the same for fighting fires and the national institutes of health. there would be a 4-percent cut in medical research. i think what we are doing, if we accept this approach, is giving up our responsibility that the taxpayers sent us to carry out; that is, to make careful choices when it comes to budgets. i just want to be on the record supporting my colleague from mississippi. the presiding officer. the senator from ohio. mr. portman. mr. president, i hadn't planned to have a debate on this, but i am happy to have one. let me just be very clear. this is about putting the appropriations committee in business, not out of business. this is not about cutting spending; it is about forcing congress to get its work done. here we sit about to pass a continuing resolution because none of the 12 appropriations bills has been voted on because each of them has been blocked in the senate. the committee has done its work. yet we can't get them to the floor. yet we have the other side saying: gosh, this would somehow hurt the process. how can the process be hurt any worse? we want the process to work, and that is why 46 of us, on a bipartisan basis, have supported this idea. what it says is, if at the end of the day, on september 30, appropriations bills have not been passed, then we would simply continue the spending from last year, and, yes, over time we would ratchet it down, giving 120 days for the committee to get its act together that it did not in the previous year when it was supposed to, to get these bills done, to do the oversight, and to make the decisions about nih, as the senator has said, and to make the decisions about our veterans. if we truly want to help our veterans, a cr is not the way to do it. the way to do it is to let the va bill come to the floor, have a debate, and take the committee's good ideas--and, by the way, it came out of committee with a large bipartisan vote. that is how we should be legislating. that is our job. the power of the purse resides exclusively with us. yet once again this year we are not doing our job. it is not that we are just doing a couple of appropriations bills; we are not doing a single appropriations bill. i think it is time for us to change course and that is what this legislation is about. i am simply saying that in the process of passing the cr, which we now have to do, set up a discipline for the future that provides an incentive for us to get our work done so the good work being done by senator cochran and others--including senator mikulski--in the appropriations committee can come to the floor for a vote, and we can get back to governing. i yield back. the presiding officer. is there objection to the request to waive the mandatory quorum? mr. durbin. no objection. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. cloture motion pursuant to rule xxii, the chair lays before the senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. the bill clerk read as follows: cloture motion we, the undersigned senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule xxii of the standing rules of the senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to concur in the house amendment to the senate amendment to h.r. 719 with an amendment, no. 2689. mitch mcconnell, john cornyn, orrin g. hatch, pat roberts, johnny isakson, michael b. enzi, cory gardner, john barrasso, lindsey graham, lamar alexander, thad cochran, chuck grassley, kelly ayotte, susan m. collins, deb fischer, richard burr. the presiding officer. by unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. the question is, is it the sense of the senate that debate on the motion to concur in the house amendment to the senate amendment to h.r. 719 with amendment no. 2689, offered by the senator from kentucky, mr. mcconnell, shall be brought to a close? the yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk called the roll. mr. cornyn. the following senators are necessarily absent: the senator from missouri (mr. blunt), the senator from tennessee (mr. corker), the senator from south carolina (mr. graham), and the senator from florida (mr. rubio). the presiding officer (mr. lankford). are there any other senators in the chamber desiring to vote? the yeas and nays resulted--yeas 77, nays

cloture having been invoked, the motion to refer falls. the senator from texas. vote on amendment no. 2690 mr. cruz. mr. president, i move to table the mcconnell amendment no. 2690 for the purpose of offering my own amendment no. 2701, and i ask for the yeas and nays. the presiding officer. is there a sufficient second? there does not appear to be a sufficient second. the question is on agreeing to the motion. the motion was rejected. the presiding officer. the senator from texas. [[page s6967]] mr. cruz. mr. president, there is a reason the american people are fed up with washington. there is a reason the american people are frustrated. the frustration is not simply mild or passing or ephemeral; it is volcanic. over and over again, the american people go to the ballot box. over and over again, the american people rise and say: the direction we are going does not make sense; we want change. over and over again, the american people win elections--in 2010, a tidal wave election; in 2014, a tidal wave election. yet nothing changes in washington. i would like to share with the presiding officer and the american people the real story of what is happening in washington, why it is that our leaders cannot stop bankrupting this country, cannot stop the assault on our constitutional rights, cannot stop america's retreat from leadership in the world. it is a very simple dynamic when you have two sides allegedly in a political battle, one side that is relentlessly, unshakably committed to its principles and the other side that reflectively surrenders at the outset. the outcome is foreordained. i will give president obama and the senate democrats credit. they believe in principles of big government. they believe in this relentless assault on our constitutional rights. they are willing to crawl over broken glass with a knife in between their teeth to fight for those principles. unfortunately, leadership on my side of the aisle does not demonstrate the same commitment to principles. how is it, you might wonder, that a preemptive surrender is put in place? well, it all begins with a relatively innocuous statement: there shall be no shutdowns. that is a statement leadership in both houses-- republican leadership in both houses has said: we are not going to shut the government down. you can understand--to folks in the private sector, folks at home, that sounds pretty reasonable, except here is the reality in washington. in today's washington, there are three kinds of votes. no. 1, there are show votes--votes that are brought up largely to placate the voters, where the outcome is foreordained, where most republicans will vote one way and most democrats will vote the other. republicans will lose, and the conservatives who elected republican majorities in both houses are supposed to be thrilled that they have been patted on the head and given their show vote that was destined to lose. we had a vote like that in recent weeks on planned parenthood. leadership told us: you should be thrilled. we voted on it. what else do you want? we voted on it in a context where it would never happen. indeed, it did not. the second kind of vote is a vote that simply grows government, dramatically expands spending, and expands corporate welfare. those votes pass because you get a bipartisan coalition of republican leadership and democrats, both of whom are convinced that career politicians will get reelected if they keep growing and growing government and in particular handing out corporate welfare to giant corporations. oh boy. if you have the lobbyists on k street pushing for something, you can get 60, 70, 80 in this chamber because republican leadership loves it and democrats are always willing to grow government. then there is the third kind of vote--votes on must-pass legislation. in an era when one side--the democratic party--is adamantly committed to continuing down this path that is causing so many millions of americans to hurt, must-pass votes are the only votes that have real consequence in this chamber. they typically fall into one of three categories: either a continuing resolution, an omnibus appropriations bill, or a debt ceiling increase. all of those three are deemed must- pass votes. if you actually want to change law, those are the only hopes of doing so. but, as i mentioned before, you have one side who has preemptively surrendered. republican leadership has said they will never ever shut down the government, and suddenly president obama understands the easy key to winning every battle: he simply has to utter the word ``shutdown'' and republican leadership runs to the hills. so president obama demands of congress: fund every bit of obamacare--100 percent of it--and do nothing, zero, for the millions of americans who are hurting, millions of americans who have lost their jobs, who have lost their health care, who have lost their doctors, who have been forced into part-time work, the millions of young people who have seen their premiums skyrocket. president obama: you can do nothing for the people who are hurting. senate democrats say: we don't care about the people who are hurting. we will do nothing for them. here is the kicker. president obama promises: if you try to do anything on obamacare, i, barack obama, will veto funding for the entire federal government and shut it down. republican leadership compliantly says: ok. fine. we will fund obamacare. president obama then understands he has got a pretty good trump card here he can pull out at any time. so next he says: ok. republicans, fund my unconstitutional executive amnesty. it is contrary to law. it is flouting federal immigration law. but you, republicans, fund it anyway or else, i, barack obama, will veto funding for the entire federal government and shut it down. republican leadership says at the outset: ok. we will fund amnesty. now we turn to planned parenthood. barack obama--this will surprise no one--says: fund 100 percent of planned parenthood with taxpayer money. mind you, planned parenthood is a private organization. it is not even part of the government. but it happens to be politically favored by president obama and the democrats. planned parenthood is also the subject of multiple criminal investigations for being caught on tape apparently carrying out a pattern of ongoing felonies. in ordinary times, the proposition that we should not be sending your or my federal taxpayer money to fund a private organization that is under multiple criminal investigations-- that ought to be a 100-to-0 vote. but, as i mentioned before, barack obama is absolutely committed to his partisan objectives. he is like the terminator. he never stops. he never gives up. he moves forward and forward and forward. so what does he say? if you don't fund this one private organization that is not part of the government, that is under multiple criminal investigations, i, barack obama, will veto funding for the entire federal government and shut it down. what does republican leadership say? well, it will surprise no one. republican leadership says: we surrender. we will fund planned parenthood. you know, president obama has negotiated a catastrophic nuclear deal with iran. republican leadership goes on television all the time and rightly says: this is a catastrophic deal. the consequences are that it is the single greatest national security threat to america. millions of americans could die. i would suggest that if we actually believed the words that are coming out of our mouths, then we would be willing to use any and all constitutional authority given the congress to stop a catastrophic deal that sends over $100 billion to ayatollah khamenei. yet president obama says he will veto the entire budget if we do, and, to the surprise of nobody, republican leadership surrenders. you know, i will draw an analogy. it is as if at a football game, the beginning of the football game the two team captains go out to flip the coin. one team's coach walks out and says: we forfeit. they do it game after game after game right at the coin flip. leadership says: we forfeit. we surrender. we, republicans, will fund every single big government liberal priority of the democrats. if an nfl team did that over 16 games, we know what their record would be; it would be 0 and 16. you know, i am pretty sure the fans who bought tickets and who went to the game would be pretty ticked off as they watched their coach forfeit over and over again. you want to understand the volcanic frustration with washington? it is that republican leadership in both houses will not fight for a single priority we promised the voters we would fight for when we were campaigning less than a year ago. you know, this past week was a big news week in washington. the speaker [[page s6968]] of the house, john boehner, announced he was going to resign, and there was lots of speculation in the media as to why the speaker of the house resigned. i am going to tell you why he resigned. it is actually a direct manifestation of this disconnect between the voters back home and republican leadership. speaker boehner and leader mcconnell promised there will be no shutdown. therefore, they will fund every single priority of barack obama. we are right now voting on what is called a clean cr. i would note it is clean only in the parlance of washington, because what does it do? it funds 100 percent of obamacare, 100 percent of executive amnesty. it funds all of planned parenthood, and it funds the iranian nuclear deal. it is essentially a blank check to barack obama. that is not very clean to me. that actually sounds like a very dirty funding bill, funding priorities that are doing enormous damage. in the senate the votes were always there for a dirty cr, a cr that funded all of barack obama's priorities. the democrats will all vote for it--heck, of course they will. they have the other side funding their priorities. of course, every democrat will vote for that over and over and over and twice on sunday. the simple reality on the republican side is when leadership joins with the democrats, about half of the republican caucus is happy to move over to that side of the aisle. so the votes were always preordained. the motion i made just a moment ago was a motion to table the tree. you remember filling the tree. it is something we heard a lot about in the previous congress. harry reid, the democratic leader, did it all the time. senators on this side of the aisle stood over and over and said: it is abuse of process. in fact, we even campaigned with our leadership saying: we are going to have an open amendment process. yet what has happened here is that majority leader mcconnell has taken a page out of leader reid's playbook and filled the tree. i moved to table the tree, and what you then saw was leadership denying a second. what does ``denying a second'' mean? denying a recorded vote. why is that important? when you are breaking the commitments you have made to the men and women who have elected you, the most painful thing in the world is accountability. when you are misleading the men and women who showed up to vote for you, you don't want sunshine making clear that you voted no. a recorded vote means each senator's name is on it. now, why did i move to table the tree? simply to add the amendment that i had, which, no. 1, would have said that not one penny goes to planned parenthood, and no. 2, not one penny goes to implementing this catastrophic iranian nuclear deal unless and until they comply with federal law--the administration complies with federal law--and hands over the full deal, including the side agreements with iran. what you saw was that republican leadership desperately does not want a vote on that. tomorrow i intend to make that motion again. and when i make that motion again, i would encourage those watching to see which senators are here to give a second or not and to vote yea or nay. i would note that when you deny a second, which is truly an unprecedented procedural trick--it used to be that was a courtesy that was afforded to all senators. indeed, in the opposing party routinely over and over when a democrat or republican asked for a second, everyone raised their hand. but leadership has discovered: we can do this in the dark of the night. but i would encourage those watching to see, no. 1, when this motion is offered again, who shows up to offer a second and who either doesn't raise his hand or just doesn't come to the floor. one of the ways you avoid accountability is you are somehow somewhere else doing something very important instead of actually showing up for the battle that is waging right here and now. but i would also encourage people to watch very carefully what happens after that. after that you have a voice vote. a voice vote is still a vote. let's be clear. standing on the floor, there were two senators--senator lee and i--who voted aye, who voted to table the tree and take up the amendment barring funding for planned parenthood and barring funding for this catastrophic iranian nuclear deal. the remaining senators on the republican side--leader mcconnell, whip cornyn, senator alexander, and senator cotton--those four senators loudly voted no. it is still a vote, even though it is not a recorded vote. it is a vote on the senate floor. so why did speaker boehner resign? well, i mentioned to you that the votes were always cooked here. the democrats plus republican leadership and the votes they bring with them ensure plenty of votes for a dirty cr, a cr that funds obamacare, that funds amnesty, that funds planned parenthood, that funds this catastrophic iranian nuclear deal. but the house was always the bulwark. the presiding officer will remember in 2013 when we had a fight over obamacare. the presiding officer was serving in the house at the time. in that fight we never had the votes in the senate. actually, the senate was under control of the democrats. they were going to do everything they could to defend obamacare regardless of the millions of people who were hurt. but the house was the bulwark in that fight, and in particular there was a core of 40 or 50 strong, principled conservatives who cared deeply about honoring the commitments they made to the men and women who elected them. that was always the strength we had in that fight. you know, it has been interesting reading some of the press coverage, speculating that there would be some magic parliamentary trick that would somehow stop this corrupt deal. well, in the senate there are no magic parliamentary tricks. when you have the democrats plus republican leadership and a chunk of the republicans, those votes can roll over any parliamentary trick you might use. even with the blood moon we just had, there are no mystical powers that allow you to roll over them. but in the house we still have those 30, 40, 50 strong conservatives. so how is it that speaker boehner and leader mcconnell could promise there will never, ever be a shutdown? because, i believe, speaker boehner has decided to cut a deal with leader nancy pelosi, the leader of the democrats, that this dirty cr is going to be passed out of the senate and is going to go to the house. the speaker is going to take it up on the floor and pass it with all the democrats--just as leader mcconnell did--and a handful of republicans who will go with republican leadership. a very significant percentage of republicans will vote no. but here is the problem: speaker boehner has done that more than once. in this instance, there were too many republicans who were tired of seeing their leadership lead the democrats rather than lead the republican party. i believe if speaker boehner had done that--had passed a dirty cr funding planned parenthood, funding this iranian nuclear deal--he would have lost his speakership. a member of the house had introduced a motion to vacate the chair because house republicans were fed up with their leader not leading--at least not leading their party, leading the democratic party. so speaker boehner faced a conundrum. if he did what he and leader mcconnell promised, which is to fund all of barack obama's priorities, he would have lost his job. and so what did he do? he announced that he is resigning as speaker and resigning as a member of congress. that is unsurprising, but it also telegraphs the deal that he has just cut. it is a deal to surrender and join with the democrats. notice he said he is going to stay a month. he is going to stay a month in order to join with the democrats and fund barack obama's priorities. now let's talk about some of the substantive issues that we ought to be talking about. let's start with planned parenthood. in the past couple of months, a series of videos have come out about planned parenthood. to some of the people watching this, you may never have seen the videos. why is that? because the mainstream media has engaged in a virtual media blackout on them: abc, nbc, cbs, the last thing they want to do is show these videos. if you watch fox news, you can see the videos. but the mainstream media, in the great tradition of pravda, wants [[page s6969]] to make sure the citizenry doesn't see what is in these videos. i would encourage every american--republican or democrat--regardless of where you fall on the right to life, even--and, in fact, especially--if you consider yourself pro-choice--to just watch these videos. go online and watch them and ask yourself: are these my values? is this what i believe? these videos show senior officials from planned parenthood laughing, sipping chardonnay and callously harvesting and selling the body parts of unborn children over and over and over. one senior official was caught on video laughing and saying she hopes she sells enough body parts of unborn children to buy herself a lamborghini. again, i would suggest to just ask yourself: are these my values? in another video a lab tech describes a little baby boy--unborn, aborted, about 2 pounds, his heart still beating. she was instructed to insert scissors under his chin to cut open the face of this little boy and harvest his brain because the brain was valuable. planned parenthood could sell the brain. this is something out of ``brave new world.'' these are human beings. that little boy had a heart that was still beating, had a brain that was being harvested. he had a soul given to him by god almighty. he was made in the image of god. we are now a nation that harvests the body parts of little baby boys and girls. it is the very definition of inhumanity to treat children like agriculture, to be grown and killed for their body parts, to be sold for profit. there is a reason that the media and the democrats don't want these videos shown, because anyone watching these videos will be horrified. but they are not just horrific; they are also prima facie evidence of criminal activity. there are multiple federal statutes--criminal statutes--that planned parenthood appears to be violating, perhaps on a daily basis. the first and most direct is a prohibition on selling the body parts of unborn children for a profit. federal criminal law makes that a felony with up to 10 years of jail time. now these videos show them very clearly selling body parts. they also show them bartering a price. they will argue it wasn't for a profit. but you watch these videos. you watch the undercover buyer saying: how much will you give me for them? and you see the planned parenthood official saying: well, how much can i get? i don't want to bargain against myself. on its face, that is evidence of bargaining for a profit. if you want the highest price you can get, it is not tied to your costs. it is tied to whatever dollars, whatever revenue you can bring in. planned parenthood is the largest abortion provider in the country. as another one of these videos reflects, it is a volume business--planned parenthood--taking the lives of unborn children and then selling them-- apparently for profit. it is also a federal criminal offense to alter the means of an abortion for the purpose of harvesting the organs of the unborn child. that is a separate criminal offense. on video after video, you see planned parenthood officials saying: ok. what parts would you like? we can perform a different abortion depending on what parts you want us to harvest. on the videos they essentially admit to this crime. they are filmed in the act. there is the third criminal offense that provides that you cannot harvest the organs of an unborn child without informed consent from the mother. yet again these videos seem to indicate that planned parenthood treats informed consent as a technicality that is sometimes complied with and sometimes ignored. now, i will say as an aside that ordinarily, when a national organization is caught on film committing a pattern of felonies, the next steps are predictable: the department of justice opens an investigation; the fbi shows up and seizes their records. everything on those videos suggests those felonies are still occurring today. what does it say about the obama justice department that no one on the face of the planet believes there is any chance the justice department would even begin to investigate planned parenthood? what does it say about the most lawless partisan department of justice that there is this group that is a political ally of the president, so that is apparently all that matters. if it is an ally of the president, it doesn't matter that they are videotaped committing a felony. the department of justice will not even look at it. i am an alumnus of the u.s. department of justice. i was an associate deputy attorney general. i spent much of my adult life working in law enforcement. the department of justice has a long, distinguished record of remaining outside of partisan politics, of staying above the partisan fray, of being blind to party or ideology and simply enforcing the law and the constitution. i am sorry to say that under eric holder and loretta lynch, the department of justice has completely besmirched that tradition. no one remotely believes the obama justice department will even begin to investigate this pattern of felonies. you don't see democrats suggesting it. no one in the media suggests it. and by the way, if this were a republican administration and the entity that admitted to a pattern of felonies was a private entity that supported republicans, you would see on cbs, nbc, and abc an indictment clock every night. you would see the anchors saying: when will this investigation be opened? when will they be indicted? instead, the media pretends these videos don't exist. in the face of what appears to be a national criminal enterprise, we are faced here with a much simpler question: will we continue to pay for it? will we continue to pay for it with your and my tax dollars? will we send $500 million a year to a private organization to use to fund this ongoing criminal organization? what is the position of the democrats? hear no evil, see no evil. they do not care. what democrat do you see calling for the enforcement of criminal laws against planned parenthood? what democrat do you hear saying, at a minimum, let's not send taxpayer money to fund this? not one. not a single democrat stood up and said that. let me ask you, mr. president, what happens if planned parenthood gets indicted? because even though the u.s. department of justice under president obama has become little more than a partisan arm of the democratic national committee, there are state and local prosecutors who are investigating planned parenthood right now. if planned parenthood is indicted, will the democrats maintain their wall of silence and say: we are going to continue to fund them under indictment. by all indications, that answer is yes. we haven't heard a single democrat say: well, if they are indicted, then we will stop. the response from our leadership is that we can't win this fight. that is their response. they say: well, we can't win the planned parenthood fight. why? because we don't have 60 votes; because we don't have 67 votes. if that is the standard, then the republican leadership standard is that we will do only what harry reid and nancy pelosi approve of. that is what it means. you want to understand why the american people are frustrated? we were told: if only we had a republican house of representatives, then things would be different. in 2010, millions of us rose up in incredible numbers and won an historic tidal wave election. the presiding officer was a youth pastor, called to minister, yet he stood up and said: my country is in crisis. i am going to step forward and serve. the 2010 election was historic, yet very little changed. then we were told: ok. we have a house of representatives, but the problem is the senate. as long as harry reid is majority leader, we can't do anything. over and over again washington gray beards would go on television, and in gravelly tones they would say: you cannot govern with one-half of one-third of government. the house of representatives is not enough, but if we had the senate, then things would be different. the problem is harry reid. the presiding officer will recall during the fight over obamacare a number of members of this body--republicans--said: no, no, no, no. we can't fight on obamacare. we have to wait until we have a republican senate to fight. so the american people obliged. in 2014, millions of us rose up for the second tidal wave election in a period of 4 years. we won nine senate seats. [[page s6970]] we retired harry reid as majority leader. we won the largest majority in the house of representatives since the 1920s. it has been now over 9 months since we have had republican majorities in both houses, and i ask: what exactly have those republican majorities accomplished? i have asked that question all over the country in townhalls. i have never been at a townhall where the response, spontaneous, was not absolutely nothing. that is true in every state i visit. and sadly, my response over and over again is: you know, it's worse than that. i wish the answer were absolutely nothing. it would have been better if the republican majorities had done absolutely nothing because what, in fact, have they done? well, the very first thing that happened, right after that election in november, is we came back to washington, and republican leadership joined up with harry reid and the democrats and passed a trillion dollar cr omnibus bill that was filled with pork, corporate welfare, and grew government, grew the debt. then republican leadership took the lead in funding obamacare. then republican leadership took the lead in funding executive amnesty. then republican leadership took the lead in funding planned parenthood. and then, astonishingly, republican leadership took the lead in confirming loretta lynch as attorney general. now, i ask: which one of those decisions is one iota different from what would have happened with harry reid and the democrats in charge of this chamber? those decisions are identical. and i would note, by the way, with loretta lynch, the republican majority could have defeated that nomination. the senate majority leader could have done so. she looked at the senate judiciary committee, and she looked at the senate, and when asked how she would differ from eric holder's justice department--the most lawless and partisan justice department we would ever see--and she said: no way whatsoever. when asked to point to a single instance in which she would be willing to stand up to president obama to stop his lawlessness, to stop his abuse of power, she could not identify any circumstance in which she would ever stand up to the president who appointed her. attorneys general from both parties have done that, for centuries. now, with eric holder, the senate could be forgiven because his lawlessness manifested primarily after he was confirmed. with loretta lynch, she told us beforehand. she looked us in the eyes and said: hey, i am going to do exactly what my predecessor has done. and republican leadership confirmed her anyway. is it any wonder the american people are frustrated out of their minds? we keep winning elections, and the people we put in office don't do what they said they would do. now, some people across the country ask me: is republican leadership just not very capable? are they not that competent or are they unwilling to fight? mr. president, it is neither. they are actually quite competent, and they are willing to fight. the question becomes what they are fighting for. there is a disconnect right now. if you or i go to our home state and to any gathering of citizens and we put up a white board and we ask the citizens in the room to give the top priorities they think republican majorities in congress should be focusing on, and we wrote the 20 priorities that came from the citizens of oklahoma or the citizens of texas or, for that matter, the citizens of any of the 50 states, those top 20 priorities--at least 18 of them--would appear nowhere on the leadership's priority list. on the other hand, if you drive just down the street in washington to k street--k street is the street in washington where the lobbyists primarily reside, where their offices are--and you get a gathering of corporate lobbyists that represent giant corporations and ask them their top priorities, the list that comes out will not just bear passing similarity but will be identical to the priorities of the republican leadership. that's the disconnect. do you know why we are not here fighting on this? because not giving taxpayer money to planned parenthood is not among the priorities of the lobbyists on k street, so leadership is not interested in doing it. that is the disconnect. leadership does know how to fight. just a couple of months ago, in dealing with the export-import bank, we saw leadership in both chambers go to extraordinary lengths with herculean procedural steps to reauthorize a classic example of corporate welfare--hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer-guaranteed loans to giant corporations. now, for that, leadership is incentivized because those corporations hire lobbyists and those lobbyists distribute checks, typically by the wheelbarrow. there is no incentive greater in this body than getting reelected, and the view of leadership is that you get reelected by raking in the cash. how do you think we have gotten an $18 trillion national debt? because the way you reach bipartisan compromise in this body today, in the broken world of washington, is you grow and grow and grow government, and you sit around in a room and say: i will spend for your priority, your priority, your priority--another trillion dollars and we are done. the only people to lose are your children and mine. the only people to lose are the next generations who find themselves mired deeper and deeper and deeper in debt. i think of my little girls caroline and catherine. they are 7 and 4. if we don't stop what we are doing, your children and my children will face a debt so crushing they will not be able to spend in the future for the priorities of the future--for their needs, for their wants, for whatever crises come up that the next generation confronts. they will spend their whole lives simply working to pay off the debts racked up by their deadbeat parents and grandparents. no generation in history has ever done this to their children and grandchildren. our parents didn't do it to us. their parents didn't do it to them. the reason is the corruption of this town, and it boils down to a simple proposition: the democrats are willing to do anything to push their priorities, and the republicans, the leadership, are not listening to the men and women who elected us. but it is actually an even deeper problem than that. on the democratic side, the major donors that fund the democratic party, they don't despise their base. the billionaires who write the giant checks that fund president obama, hillary clinton, and the democrats on that side of the aisle don't despise the radical gay rights movement or the radical environmentalist movement or all the people who knock on doors and get democrats elected. the simple reality is a very large percentage of the republican donors actively despise our base--actively despise the men and women who showed up and voted you and me into office. i can tell you, when you sit down and talk with a new york billionaire republican donor--and i have talked with quite a few new york billionaire republican donors, california republican donors--their questions start out as follows. first of all, you have to come out for gay marriage, you need to be pro-choice, and you need to support amnesty. that is where the republican donors are. you wonder why republicans will not fight on any of these issues? because the people writing the checks agree with the democrats. now mind you, the people who show up at the polls who elected you and me and who elected this republican majority--far too many of the republican donors look down on those voters as a bunch of ignorant hicks and rubes. it is why leadership likes show votes. it wasn't too long ago when the washington cartel was able to mask it all with a show vote or two, and they told the rubes back home: see, we voted on it; we just don't have the votes. when i was first elected to this body, many times i heard more senior senators saying some variation of the following: now, ted, that is what you tell folks back home. you don't actually do it. here is what has changed. the voters have gotten more informed. they now understand the difference between show votes and a real vote. they understand the vote we had 1 week ago on planned parenthood was designed to lose, to placate those silly folks who think we shouldn't be sending taxpayer funds to a criminal organization that is selling the body parts of unborn children. but on the actual vote that could [[page s6971]] change policy, leadership has no interest in fighting whatsoever. in the past couple of weeks, one of my colleagues sent me a letter that really embodied the leadership message. this letter said: ``explain to me how you get 67 votes to defund planned parenthood. if you can't produce 67 votes, i won't support it.'' if that is our standard, then we should all be honest with the men and women who elected us: we do not have 67 republican votes in this chamber, and there is no realistic prospect of our getting 67 votes any time in the foreseeable future. if the standard is, unless we get 67 votes, republican leadership will support no policy issue, then each of us when we run should tell the voters: if you vote for me, i will support whatever policy agenda harry reid and nancy pelosi decide because that is my standard. if i don't have 67 votes--do you ever recall harry reid and the democrats saying: how can we get republican votes? no. their side is absolutely committed to their principles. you don't see them holding back at all. if the standard is, how do we get 67 votes, name one thing that leadership will fight for. well, the answer i mentioned, the three types of votes are they will fight for big government, they will fight to grow government, and they will fight to expand corporate welfare. well, that can indeed get 67 votes. but i have never been to a townhall once where citizens said to me: the problem is we don't have enough corporate welfare. i need more subsidies for big business. if 100 percent of the agenda of republican leadership is more subsidies for big business, what the heck are we doing in the senate in the first place? that certainly wasn't why i ran, and i know it wasn't why you ran either. you don't have to win every fight, you don't have to fight every fight, but you do have to stand for something. let's look beyond planned parenthood for a minute. let's look to iran. of all the decisions the obama administration has made, there may be none more damaging than this catastrophic iranian nuclear deal. if this deal goes through, there will be three consequences: no. 1, the obama administration will become, quite literally, the world's leading financier of radical islamic terrorists. now, when i said that a couple months ago, president obama got very, very upset. he said it was ridiculous that i would say such a thing, but despite attacking me directly, president obama didn't actually endeavor to refute the substance of what i said. so let's review the facts: fact no. 1, iran is today the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. that fact is undisputed even by this administration. fact no. 2, if this deal goes through, over $100 billion will go directly to iran to the ayatollah khamenei. fact no. 3, if that happens, billions of those dollars will go to hamas, to hezbollah, to the houthis, to radical islamic terrorists across the globe who will use those billions to murder americans, to murder israelis, and to murder europeans. it is worth remembering, 14 years ago this month, the horrific terrorist attack that was carried out on september 11. osama bin laden hated america, but he never had billions of dollars. he never had $100 billion. the ayatollah khamenei hates america every bit as much as osama bin laden did, and this administration is giving him control of over $100 billion. imagine what bin laden could have done. look at the damage he did with 19 terrorists carrying box cutters. now imagine that same zealotry with billions of dollars behind it. the consequences of this deal could easily be another terrorist attack that dwarfs september 11 in scale, that kills far more than the roughly 3,000 lives that were snuffed out. who in their right mind would send over $100 billion to a theocratic zealot who chants ``death to america''? a second consequence of his catastrophic deal is that we are abandoning four hostages--four american hostages--in iranian jails: pastor saeed abedini, an american citizen whose wife naghmeh lives in idaho. i have visited with naghmeh many times. pastor saeed has two little kids who desperately want their daddy to come home. pastor saeed was sentenced to 8 years in prison for the crime of preaching the gospel. just last week was the 3-year anniversary of pastor saeed's imprisonment. reports are that he is being horribly mistreated, that his health is failing, and yet president obama cannot bring himself to utter the words ``pastor saeed abedini''--$100 billion to the ayatollah khamenei, and pastor saeed abedini remains in prison. also in prison is amir hekmati, an american marine the president has abandoned. also in prison is jason rezaian, a washington post reporter--i note to the reporters in the gallery, a colleague of yours--abandoned by president obama in an iranian prison, thrown in jail for doing his job, reporting on the news--and robert levinson, whose whereabouts remain unknown. why is the president refusing to even utter their names? the third consequence of this deal is this deal will only accelerate iran acquiring nuclear weapons. the administration claims the deal will prevent iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. why? because they promised not to do it. we have learned from iran, they break their promises over and over and over again. and what we do know is that they will have an extra $100 billion to develop nuclear weapons. now, i will say the administration laughingly suggested: well, they will use that on infrastructure, to rebuild their roads, to rebuild their energy industry. right now they are sending vast sums to hamas and hezbollah, funding terrorism across the world, and they have those same infrastructure needs. with another $100 billion, you don't think they are going to funnel an awful lot of it to developing nuclear weapons? i would point out, it is not by accident that the ayatollah khamenei refers to israel as the little satan and america as the great satan. this is the one threat on the face of the earth that poses a real possibility of millions of americans being murdered in the flash of an eye. everything i am saying the republican leadership has said over and over again. yet republican leadership refuses to enforce the terms of the iran review legislation--federal law that the administration is defying by not handing over the entire deal. i have laid out a clear path, a detailed path that leadership can follow to stop this deal, and leadership refuses to do so. instead, we had a show vote that was designed to lose, and it did exactly what we expected. the democrats, by and large, put party loyalty above the national security of this country, above standing with our friend and ally the nation of israel, above protecting the lives of millions of americans. if we truly believed what so many of us have said, that this poses the risk of murdering millions of americans, is there any higher priority? the most powerful constitutional tool congress has is the power of the purse. if we had the ability to stop this deal--and we don't--and millions of americans die, how do we explain that to the men and women who elected us? i am not advocating that we fight willy-nilly. i am advocating that we fight on things that matter. don't give $500 million to planned parenthood, a corrupt organization that is taking the lives of vast numbers of unborn children and selling their body parts, in a criminal conspiracy, directly contrary to federal law. don't give $100 billion to the ayatollah khamenei, who seeks to murder millions. in both instances, those are defending life. yet republican leadership is not willing to lift a finger. if only all the people who might be murdered by a nuclear weapon could create a pac in washington and hire some lobbyists, maybe leadership would listen to them. but the truckdriver at home, the waitress at home, the schoolteacher at home, the pastor, the police officer, the working men and women--the washington cartel does not listen to them. i will note where this deal is headed. in december, when this dirty continuing resolution expires, leadership is already foreshadowing that they plan to bust the budget caps. why? we talked about it at the beginning. barack obama has discovered that when he says the word ``shutdown,'' the republican leadership screams, surrenders, and runs to the hills. obama, understanding that quite well, says: if you don't bust the budget caps, i will shut the government down. in this bizarre process, republican leadership will blame whatever obama [[page s6972]] does on other republicans. you noticed how much energy leader mcconnell devotes to attacking conservatives? you notice how much energy speaker boehner devotes to attacking conservatives? just yesterday the speaker of the house went on national television, and on national television he directed an obscene epithet at me personally. he is welcome to insult whomever he likes. i don't intend to reciprocate. but when has leadership ever shown that level of venom, that level of animosity to president obama and the democrats who are bankrupting this country, who are destroying the constitution, who are endangering the future of our children and grandchildren, who are retreating from leadership and the world, and who have created an environment that has led to the rise of radical islamic terrorists? one of the dynamics we have seen in fight after fight is that harry reid and the democrats sit back and laugh. why? because it is republican leadership that leads the onslaught, attacking conservatives, saying: no, you can't, and we will not do anything to stop obamacare. no, you can't, and we will not do anything to stop amnesty. no, you can't, and we will not do anything to stop planned parenthood. no, you can't, and we will not do anything to stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. if republican leadership really believes we can accomplish nothing, then why does it matter if you have a republican house or senate? every 2 years come october, november, we tell the voters it matters intensely. to paraphrase the immortal words of hillary clinton, what difference does it make if the standard for republican leadership is, anything that gets 67 votes we will support. that means harry reid and nancy pelosi remain the de facto leaders of the senate and the house. i would note, by the way, if leadership goes through with their suggestion to bust the budget caps, they will have done something astonishing. historically, the three legs of the conservative stool have been fiscal conservatives, social conservatives, and national security conservatives. between planned parenthood, iran, and the budget caps, leadership will have managed to abandon all three. no wonder the american people are frustrated. no wonder the american people do not understand why leadership isn't listening to them. the presiding officer. the senator's postcloture time has expired. mr. cruz. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that my time be extended. the democrats are objecting to my speaking further, and both the democrats and republican leadership are objecting to the american people speaking further. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from montana. ____________________",77680

Mr. President, I rise to recognize the 50th anniversary of the Southern Nevada Group of the Sierra Club. The Southern Nevada Group of the Sierra Club was established in 1965 and encompasses Clark, Lincoln, Nye, Esmerelda, and White Pine Counties. During that time, its membership has helped shape Nevada's future by honoring the pristine beauty of Nevada. Today, Nevadans and visitors from around the country travel to southern Nevada to see the life, history, and culture of the Silver State. The Southern Nevada Group of the Sierra Club has worked tirelessly to protect places, such as the Great Basin National Park, the Spring Mountain National Recreation Area, the Sloan Canyon and Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Areas, and the recently designated Tule Springs Fossil Beds and Basin and Range National Monuments. These special places have inspired tens of millions of people and will continue to inspire our children and grandchildren. The Sierra Club has also been key to the protection of millions of acres of pristine landscapes as wilderness in southern and eastern Nevada. Today, the Sierra Club's dedication to Nevada continues in its efforts to protect treasured sites that highlight Nevada's unique geological and cultural history, including Gold Butte. These wonderful parts of Nevada are owned by everyone, and their protection has helped solidify Nevada's status as a world class destination. The progress the Southern Nevada Group has made to protect these wonderful parts of Nevada continues through its work to fully realize Nevada's clean energy potential. These efforts notably began with opposition to the construction of new coal plants in White Pine County. More recently, the Southern Nevada Group teamed with the Moapa Band of Paiutes and others to support meaningful legislation that resulted in the closure of the Reid-Gardner coal plant and its replacement with clean energy. I have been gratified to work with the Southern Nevada Group on so many of these efforts and was honored earlier this year to receive the Sierra Club's Edgar Wayburn Award. I commend the Southern Nevada Group of the Sierra Club on their 50 years of success and wish the organization continued success in the years to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S6973] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SOUTHERN NEVADA GROUP OF THE SIERRA CLUB Mr. REID.

Mr. President, as the son of a former general manager of a brewery and a loyal customer I wish to acknowledge the founding of a true American success story, Miller Brewing, and to congratulate it on the occasion of its historic 160th anniversary celebration. In 1855, just a few years after Wisconsin joined the Union, 30-year old Frederick J. Miller brought his brewing passion from his native Germany to the United States, taking over what was then the Plank Road Brewery in Milwaukee. Now, 160 years later, Milwaukee is known worldwide as Brew City, and the company he founded is celebrating the accomplishments of this young, brash entrepreneurial brewmaster who turned a pocketful of yeast into a global beer brewing icon. From its founding, through its expansions and partnerships, Miller Brewing has become a quintessential success story, having forever woven itself into the fabric of American society and culture. As Miller Brewing celebrates its 160th anniversary, guests from around the world have come to Milwaukee to hear and read stories of a young Frederick Miller. Each week the company is highlighting a different era from Miller's storied past, and visitors to the historic Miller Valley plant can even taste a sample of 1855 celebration Lager during brewery tours. Earlier this month, I toured Miller's Milwaukee brewery and enjoyed some of the same sights and smells I experienced as a young boy hanging around [[Page S6974]] the small brewery managed by my father. After decades of continued success, Miller joined with Colorado-based Coors in 2008, thus combining more than 300 years of brewing heritage. Operating out of eight breweries in eight States, the most talented and professional brewmasters in the world now provide beer drinkers in America with a portfolio of beers that are second to none. But, Miller Brewing and MillerCoors are more than the product they make; they are greater than the sum of their parts. They are economic engines in Wisconsin, Colorado, and throughout the country, providing family- supporting jobs to more than 8,000 employees nationwide. Because of their presence, over $5 billion is injected in the economy each year, money that is spent on goods and services, and which helps support the businesses of thousands of suppliers. Miller pays more than $1 billion annually in State, local and Federal taxes. As they celebrate the past 160 years, current employees are taking note of the efforts made by the earliest employees of Miller Brewing, who knew the importance of civic leadership and sustainable business practices. We see those traditions continue today, as Miller Brewing and MillerCoors remain a deeply rooted presence in the communities in which they brew and sell their beer. Support of local charities and responsible consumption programs, and efforts to reduce water and energy usage and waste are only a few examples of how the company proves itself to be a valuable corporate citizen. Frederick J. Miller arrived in Milwaukee with a passion and ambition. He committed himself to brew ``confoundedly good beers'' with ``uncompromising quality.'' After founding Miller Brewing Company in 1855, he worked hard to achieve that goal. For the past 160 years, millions of Americans have reaped the benefits of his efforts, one bottle, one can, or one glass at a time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S6973-S6974] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS ______ RECOGNIZING THE 160TH BIRTHDAY OF MILLER BREWING Mr. JOHNSON.

DAGGETT Mr. KING. Mr. President, today we solemnly remember Senator Beverly Daggett. A dedicated public servant, Beverly died on September 6, 2015, 3 days before her 70th birthday, after a valiant, lifelong battle with kidney disease. Bev will be remembered for her dedication to her family, community, and State. The State of Maine has lost a woman of true integrity, and she will be greatly missed. Bev was an exceptionally intelligent and hard-working woman who found countless successes in life. She began her tenure in the Maine House of Representatives in 1987 as a member of the 113th legislature. She served in the Maine House of Representatives from 1987 through 1996 and in the Maine Senate from 1997 through 2004. In the Senate, Bev rose to leadership as the Senate Democratic leader in 2000. She worked closely with members on both sides of the aisle to achieve the historic power- sharing deal that stemmed from the Senate's first ever partisan tie. In 2002, in recognition of her strong leadership, her colleagues elected Beverly Daggett to serve as the first woman President of the Maine Senate. Bev's dedication to community was obvious as she served in countless ways other than her political activities. Senator Daggett was also Kennebec County Commissioner for several terms. She served for 25 years on the Board of Crisis and Counseling, culminating in her role as board chair. She also sat on the school board and was a member of the Green Street United Methodist Church, where she was a substitute organist. Above all else, Beverly was a devoted wife, mother, and friend. I had the honor of working with Beverly during my time as the Governor of Maine and witnessed firsthand her strong leadership and commitment to the betterment of Maine. I am deeply saddened by her passing and would like to join her friends and family in reflecting on her many life accomplishments and honor her memory. Beverly will be remembered for her deep and abiding faith, her leadership, encouragement of those around her, ceaseless advocacy for those without a voice, sense of humor, and wisdom. Her firm devotion to the betterment of Maine will never be forgotten. I, along with all the people of Maine, am thankful for her immeasurable contributions to our State and the Nation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S6974] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING BEVERLY C.

A bill to ensure that Social Security contributions made by workers are available to pay all benefits which they have earned; to the Committee on Finance. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes today to discuss the enormous importance of America's most critical safety net program--Social Security. In particular, I want to talk about the Social Security Disability Insurance program and introduce a proposal to secure the financing of Social Security. Of all the strands woven together in America's safety net, disability insurance is one of the most successful at keeping vulnerable people in Oregon and across the country out of poverty. It is a vital lifeline for people who suffer from catastrophic illnesses or disabilities, including a million veterans. The time has come for Congress to take an expected but important step to preserve Social Security's strength into the future. The trust fund for the disability insurance portion of Social Security is set to be depleted in 2016. This doesn't mean the program will stop paying benefits but does mean that it will only have dedicated tax revenue to pay about 80 percent of benefits. This isn't a late-breaking crisis; this is something that Congress has anticipated for more than two decades. And it is a simple issue to resolve. For a defined-benefit system like Social Security, it is not unusual to adjust the dials of funding between the retirement program and the disability program as needed. That way, the entire program remains as strong as possible. Benefits go out in full and on time. Nobody in Oregon or elsewhere is stuck in limbo, worrying about suddenly being unable to make rent or pay the bills. Congress has adjusted resources within Social Security 11 times and has shifted funding both to and from the disability insurance program. The last time it did, in 1994, it set the disability insurance program on strong footing for about 20 years. That is the practical way to strengthen disability insurance for the future. I am introducing legislation today along with 27 colleagues that would do just that, and Ways and Means Ranking Member Levin is introducing a similar measure in the House of Representatives. This is a straightforward, commonsense proposal supported by a number of prominent advocates for Americans with disabilities, including the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities Social Security Task Force, Social Security Works, and the Strengthen Social Security Coalition. Despite that, there are some members of Congress who are ringing false alarm bells and insisting on changes to the program that may be harmful to workers and beneficiaries. They make the misguided case that disability insurance is plagued by fraud or that it is a big giveaway. That is not the case--as I will explain in a moment. The reason I am introducing this legislation now is the House of Representatives has adopted a rule that prevents a clean reallocation of funding between the retirement and disability programs. I want to make sure that harmful changes to these programs are not included in end-of-year or other must-pass legislation. In my view, there are opportunities to further strengthen Social Security, [[Page S6977]] and I believe the Congress should be open to policies that would not harm workers and beneficiaries. However, it is important that Congress not take any action that would reduce protections for those who desire to attempt work, add more complexity in benefits or administration, or rig up another trust fund depletion scenario. There have been some ideas thrown around that don't pass those tests. As Congress debates the future of disability insurance, it is important to get the facts straight. First, the Social Security Administration makes stopping program fraud and abuse a top priority. Disability insurance payments are more than 99 percent accurate, due in no small part to the agency's robust efforts to combat waste, fraud, and abuse. For example, the agency uses a highly effective method of preventing improper payments called ``continuing disability reviews,'' which returns $9 in savings for every dollar invested. The agency has demonstrated that it can do this important work when we here in Congress provide it with sufficient resources. In addition, let me be clear: nobody is getting rich off of disability insurance. The benefits average just over $1,100 a month, which is slightly over the individual poverty level. If SSDI went away, half of the families receiving benefits would fall into poverty. And it is important to recognize that the qualifications for disability insurance are strict, which means only those who are so impaired they can't perform substantial work receive benefits. The program is not a giveaway. Workers earn coverage by paying into the program. Less than 40 percent of applications for disability insurance are approved, even after appeals. The people who qualify suffer from severe medical conditions that have derailed their lives and left them extremely vulnerable. In my view, it is deeply unfair to delay the simple changes that will keep the disability insurance program running for years to come. One year ago, the Finance Committee heard testimony from a woman named Stephanie Dempsey who suffered from debilitating chronic illnesses and received disability insurance benefits. Stephanie's long list of health problems began in her late twenties, when she was diagnosed with a hereditary heart disease. She had quadruple bypass surgery at age 30. Over the following years, she had 27 stents placed in her arteries over the course of several more operations. That enormous burden was compounded by Lupus, arthritis, and a seizure disorder. A mountain of prescription bottles was stacked on the witness table the day Stephanie came before the Finance Committee. As Stephanie told us, she wanted to work, but her illnesses made it impossible. Rather than sliding backward into poverty or having to rely entirely on others to stay afloat, disability insurance benefits helped cover the bills. I am sorry to say that Stephanie passed away in December. But there are vulnerable people across the country who rely on disability insurance in the same way Stephanie did. On the Social Security Administration's website is a page where many of these individuals have shared their stories. Let me tell you about three other individuals who rely on disability insurance: Charlotte, Christine, and Carrie. Charlotte was working three jobs and pursuing her degree in social work when she suffered two strokes in 2007. After the strokes, Charlotte now has trouble getting around and climbing steps. She gets help from her niece with day-to-day chores. She says disability insurance keeps her from becoming homeless and helps her pay her bills, afford her medications, and keep food on the table. Christine has a disorder of the nervous system that has left her in a wheelchair. Her disability insurance benefits give her independence. She said that without Social Security, she would be stuck in a nursing home, but instead, she is able to be a productive citizen. Carrie is a mother who suffers from multiple sclerosis, MS. She worked in the insurance industry and shrugged off the early symptoms of her MS. But the fatigue and forgetfulness grew, and she became unable to work. Carrie's Social Security benefits help her family pay for food, clothes, and school supplies. Mr. President, these individuals and millions more across the country have earned their benefits, and they are relying on Congress to keep both parts of Social Security running at full strength. I urge my colleagues to work on a bipartisan basis to ensure that benefits continue in full and as promised, to guarantee that millions of vulnerable Americans remain protected. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S6976-S6977] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Brown, Mr. Casey, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Blumenthal, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Franken, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Heinrich, Ms. Hirono, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Markey, Mr. Merkley, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Murphy, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Peters, Mr. Reed, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schatz, Ms. Warren, and Mr. Whitehouse): S. 2090. A bill to ensure that Social Security contributions made by workers are available to pay all benefits which they have earned; to the Committee on Finance. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes today to discuss the enormous importance of America's most critical safety net program--Social Security. In particular, I want to talk about the Social Security Disability Insurance program and introduce a proposal to secure the financing of Social Security. Of all the strands woven together in America's safety net, disability insurance is one of the most successful at keeping vulnerable people in Oregon and across the country out of poverty. It is a vital lifeline for people who suffer from catastrophic illnesses or disabilities, including a million veterans. The time has come for Congress to take an expected but important step to preserve Social Security's strength into the future. The trust fund for the disability insurance portion of Social Security is set to be depleted in 2016. This doesn't mean the program will stop paying benefits but does mean that it will only have dedicated tax revenue to pay about 80 percent of benefits. This isn't a late-breaking crisis; this is something that Congress has anticipated for more than two decades. And it is a simple issue to resolve. For a defined-benefit system like Social Security, it is not unusual to adjust the dials of funding between the retirement program and the disability program as needed. That way, the entire program remains as strong as possible. Benefits go out in full and on time. Nobody in Oregon or elsewhere is stuck in limbo, worrying about suddenly being unable to make rent or pay the bills. Congress has adjusted resources within Social Security 11 times and has shifted funding both to and from the disability insurance program. The last time it did, in 1994, it set the disability insurance program on strong footing for about 20 years. That is the practical way to strengthen disability insurance for the future. I am introducing legislation today along with 27 colleagues that would do just that, and Ways and Means Ranking Member Levin is introducing a similar measure in the House of Representatives. This is a straightforward, commonsense proposal supported by a number of prominent advocates for Americans with disabilities, including the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities Social Security Task Force, Social Security Works, and the Strengthen Social Security Coalition. Despite that, there are some members of Congress who are ringing false alarm bells and insisting on changes to the program that may be harmful to workers and beneficiaries.

CREC-2015-09-28-pt1-PgS6976-2,CREC-2015-09-28,114,Introductory Statement on S. 2090,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S6976-S6977] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Brown, Mr. Casey, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Blumenthal, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Franken, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Heinrich, Ms. Hirono, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Markey, Mr. Merkley, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Murphy, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Peters, Mr. Reed, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schatz, Ms. Warren, and Mr. Whitehouse): S. 2090. A bill to ensure that Social Security contributions made by workers are available to pay all benefits which they have earned; to the Committee on Finance. Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes today to discuss the enormous importance of America's most critical safety net program--Social Security. In particular, I want to talk about the Social Security Disability Insurance program and introduce a proposal to secure the financing of Social Security. Of all the strands woven together in America's safety net, disability insurance is one of the most successful at keeping vulnerable people in Oregon and across the country out of poverty. It is a vital lifeline for people who suffer from catastrophic illnesses or disabilities, including a million veterans. The time has come for Congress to take an expected but important step to preserve Social Security's strength into the future. The trust fund for the disability insurance portion of Social Security is set to be depleted in 2016. This doesn't mean the program will stop paying benefits but does mean that it will only have dedicated tax revenue to pay about 80 percent of benefits. This isn't a late-breaking crisis; this is something that Congress has anticipated for more than two decades. And it is a simple issue to resolve. For a defined-benefit system like Social Security, it is not unusual to adjust the dials of funding between the retirement program and the disability program as needed. That way, the entire program remains as strong as possible. Benefits go out in full and on time. Nobody in Oregon or elsewhere is stuck in limbo, worrying about suddenly being unable to make rent or pay the bills. Congress has adjusted resources within Social Security 11 times and has shifted funding both to and from the disability insurance program. The last time it did, in 1994, it set the disability insurance program on strong footing for about 20 years. That is the practical way to strengthen disability insurance for the future. I am introducing legislation today along with 27 colleagues that would do just that, and Ways and Means Ranking Member Levin is introducing a similar measure in the House of Representatives. This is a straightforward, commonsense proposal supported by a number of prominent advocates for Americans with disabilities, including the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities Social Security Task Force, Social Security Works, and the Strengthen Social Security Coalition. Despite that, there are some members of Congress who are ringing false alarm bells and insisting on changes to the program that may be harmful to workers and beneficiaries. They make the misguided case that disability insurance is plagued by fraud or that it is a big giveaway. That is not the case--as I will explain in a moment. The reason I am introducing this legislation now is the House of Representatives has adopted a rule that prevents a clean reallocation of funding between the retirement and disability programs. I want to make sure that harmful changes to these programs are not included in end-of-year or other must-pass legislation. In my view, there are opportunities to further strengthen Social Security, [[Page S6977]] and I believe the Congress should be open to policies that would not harm workers and beneficiaries. However, it is important that Congress not take any action that would reduce protections for those who desire to attempt work, add more complexity in benefits or administration, or rig up another trust fund depletion scenario. There have been some ideas thrown around that don't pass those tests. As Congress debates the future of disability insurance, it is important to get the facts straight. First, the Social Security Administration makes stopping program fraud and abuse a top priority. Disability insurance payments are more than 99 percent accurate, due in no small part to the agency's robust efforts to combat waste, fraud, and abuse. For example, the agency uses a highly effective method of preventing improper payments called ``continuing disability reviews,'' which returns $9 in savings for every dollar invested. The agency has demonstrated that it can do this important work when we here in Congress provide it with sufficient resources. In addition, let me be clear: nobody is getting rich off of disability insurance. The benefits average just over $1,100 a month, which is slightly over the individual poverty level. If SSDI went away, half of the families receiving benefits would fall into poverty. And it is important to recognize that the qualifications for disability insurance are strict, which means only those who are so impaired they can't perform substantial work receive benefits. The program is not a giveaway. Workers earn coverage by paying into the program. Less than 40 percent of applications for disability insurance are approved, even after appeals. The people who qualify suffer from severe medical conditions that have derailed their lives and left them extremely vulnerable. In my view, it is deeply unfair to delay the simple changes that will keep the disability insurance program running for years to come. One year ago, the Finance Committee heard testimony from a woman named Stephanie Dempsey who suffered from debilitating chronic illnesses and received disability insurance benefits. Stephanie's long list of health problems began in her late twenties, when she was diagnosed with a hereditary heart disease. She had quadruple bypass surgery at age 30. Over the following years, she had 27 stents placed in her arteries over the course of several more operations. That enormous burden was compounded by Lupus, arthritis, and a seizure disorder. A mountain of prescription bottles was stacked on the witness table the day Stephanie came before the Finance Committee. As Stephanie told us, she wanted to work, but her illnesses made it impossible. Rather than sliding backward into poverty or having to rely entirely on others to stay afloat, disability insurance benefits helped cover the bills. I am sorry to say that Stephanie passed away in December. But there are vulnerable people across the country who rely on disability insurance in the same way Stephanie did. On the Social Security Administration's website is a page where many of these individuals have shared their stories. Let me tell you about three other individuals who rely on disability insurance: Charlotte, Christine, and Carrie. Charlotte was working three jobs and pursuing her degree in social work when she suffered two strokes in 2007. After the strokes, Charlotte now has trouble getting around and climbing steps. She gets help from her niece with day-to-day chores. She says disability insurance keeps her from becoming homeless and helps her pay her bills, afford her medications, and keep food on the table. Christine has a disorder of the nervous system that has left her in a wheelchair. Her disability insurance benefits give her independence. She said that without Social Security, she would be stuck in a nursing home, but instead, she is able to be a productive citizen. Carrie is a mother who suffers from multiple sclerosis, MS. She worked in the insurance industry and shrugged off the early symptoms of her MS. But the fatigue and forgetfulness grew, and she became unable to work. Carrie's Social Security benefits help her family pay for food, clothes, and school supplies. Mr. President, these individuals and millions more across the country have earned their benefits, and they are relying on Congress to keep both parts of Social Security running at full strength. I urge my colleagues to work on a bipartisan basis to ensure that benefits continue in full and as promised, to guarantee that millions of vulnerable Americans remain protected. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S6976-S6977] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Brown, Mr. Casey, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Blumenthal, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Franken, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Heinrich, Ms. Hirono, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Markey, Mr. Merkley, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Murphy, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Peters, Mr. Reed, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schatz, Ms. Warren, and Mr. Whitehouse): S. 2090.

She gets help from her niece with day-to-day chores. She says disability insurance keeps her from becoming homeless and helps her pay her bills, afford her medications, and keep food on the table. Christine has a disorder of the nervous system that has left her in a wheelchair. Her disability insurance benefits give her independence. She said that without Social Security, she would be stuck in a nursing home, but instead, she is able to be a productive citizen. Carrie is a mother who suffers from multiple sclerosis, MS. She worked in the insurance industry and shrugged off the early symptoms of her MS. But the fatigue and forgetfulness grew, and she became unable to work. Carrie's Social Security benefits help her family pay for food, clothes, and school supplies. Mr. President, these individuals and millions more across the country have earned their benefits, and they are relying on Congress to keep both parts of Social Security running at full strength. I urge my colleagues to work on a bipartisan basis to ensure that benefits continue in full and as promised, to guarantee that millions of vulnerable Americans remain protected.

through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] by mr. wyden (for himself, mr. schumer, ms. stabenow, mr. menendez, mr. cardin, mr. brown, mr. casey, ms. baldwin, mr. blumenthal, mrs. boxer,

schatz, ms. warren, and mr. whitehouse): s. 2090. a bill to ensure that social security contributions made by workers are available to pay all benefits which they have earned; to the committee on finance. mr. wyden. mr. president, i want to take a few minutes today to discuss the enormous importance of america's most critical safety net program--social security. in particular, i want to talk about the social security disability insurance program and introduce a proposal to secure the financing of social security. of all the strands woven together in america's safety net, disability insurance is one of the most successful at keeping vulnerable people in oregon and across the country out of poverty. it is a vital lifeline for people who suffer from catastrophic illnesses or disabilities, including a million veterans. the time has come for congress to take an expected but important step to preserve social security's strength into the future. the trust fund for the disability insurance portion of social security is set to be depleted in 2016. this doesn't mean the program will stop paying benefits but does mean that it will only have dedicated tax revenue to pay about 80 percent of benefits. this isn't a late-breaking crisis; this is something that congress has anticipated for more than two decades. and it is a simple issue to resolve. for a defined-benefit system like social security, it is not unusual to adjust the dials of funding between the retirement program and the disability program as needed. that way, the entire program remains as strong as possible. benefits go out in full and on time. nobody in oregon or elsewhere is stuck in limbo, worrying about suddenly being unable to make rent or pay the bills. congress has adjusted resources within social security 11 times and has shifted funding both to and from the disability insurance program. the last time it did, in 1994, it set the disability insurance program on strong footing for about 20 years. that is the practical way to strengthen disability insurance for the future. i am introducing legislation today along with 27 colleagues that would do just that, and ways and means ranking member levin is introducing a similar measure in the house of representatives. this is a straightforward, commonsense proposal supported by a number of prominent advocates for americans with disabilities, including the national committee to preserve social security and medicare, the consortium for citizens with disabilities social security task force, social security works, and the strengthen social security coalition. despite that, there are some members of congress who are ringing false alarm bells and insisting on changes to the program that may be harmful to workers and beneficiaries. they make the misguided case that disability insurance is plagued by fraud or that it is a big giveaway. that is not the case--as i will explain in a moment. the reason i am introducing this legislation now is the house of representatives has adopted a rule that prevents a clean reallocation of funding between the retirement and disability programs. i want to make sure that harmful changes to these programs are not included in end-of-year or other must-pass legislation. in my view, there are opportunities to further strengthen social security, [[page s6977]] and i believe the congress should be open to policies that would not harm workers and beneficiaries. however, it is important that congress not take any action that would reduce protections for those who desire to attempt work, add more complexity in benefits or administration, or rig up another trust fund depletion scenario. there have been some ideas thrown around that don't pass those tests. as congress debates the future of disability insurance, it is important to get the facts straight. first, the social security administration makes stopping program fraud and abuse a top priority. disability insurance payments are more than 99 percent accurate, due in no small part to the agency's robust efforts to combat waste, fraud, and abuse. for example, the agency uses a highly effective method of preventing improper payments called ``continuing disability reviews,'' which returns $9 in savings for every dollar invested. the agency has demonstrated that it can do this important work when we here in congress provide it with sufficient resources. in addition, let me be clear: nobody is getting rich off of disability insurance. the benefits average just over $1,100 a month, which is slightly over the individual poverty level. if ssdi went away, half of the families receiving benefits would fall into poverty. and it is important to recognize that the qualifications for disability insurance are strict, which means only those who are so impaired they can't perform substantial work receive benefits. the program is not a giveaway. workers earn coverage by paying into the program. less than 40 percent of applications for disability insurance are approved, even after appeals. the people who qualify suffer from severe medical conditions that have derailed their lives and left them extremely vulnerable. in my view, it is deeply unfair to delay the simple changes that will keep the disability insurance program running for years to come. one year ago, the finance committee heard testimony from a woman named stephanie dempsey who suffered from debilitating chronic illnesses and received disability insurance benefits. stephanie's long list of health problems began in her late twenties, when she was diagnosed with a hereditary heart disease. she had quadruple bypass surgery at age 30. over the following years, she had 27 stents placed in her arteries over the course of several more operations. that enormous burden was compounded by lupus, arthritis, and a seizure disorder. a mountain of prescription bottles was stacked on the witness table the day stephanie came before the finance committee. as stephanie told us, she wanted to work, but her illnesses made it impossible. rather than sliding backward into poverty or having to rely entirely on others to stay afloat, disability insurance benefits helped cover the bills. i am sorry to say that stephanie passed away in december. but there are vulnerable people across the country who rely on disability insurance in the same way stephanie did. on the social security administration's website is a page where many of these individuals have shared their stories. let me tell you about three other individuals who rely on disability insurance: charlotte, christine, and carrie. charlotte was working three jobs and pursuing her degree in social work when she suffered two strokes in 2007. after the strokes, charlotte now has trouble getting around and climbing steps. she gets help from her niece with day-to-day chores. she says disability insurance keeps her from becoming homeless and helps her pay her bills, afford her medications, and keep food on the table. christine has a disorder of the nervous system that has left her in a wheelchair. her disability insurance benefits give her independence. she said that without social security, she would be stuck in a nursing home, but instead, she is able to be a productive citizen. carrie is a mother who suffers from multiple sclerosis, ms. she worked in the insurance industry and shrugged off the early symptoms of her ms. but the fatigue and forgetfulness grew, and she became unable to work. carrie's social security benefits help

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service and commitment of Patty Rose of the Pierce County Central Labor Council, who is receiving the distinguished Star of Destiny Award at the 9th Annual Destiny Dinner hosted by the Tacoma Historical Society. Patty has provided unmatched leadership and commitment to the organized labor community and the greater citizenry of Tacoma-Pierce County in her 13 years guiding the Pierce County Labor Council with a firm commitment to improving the lives of working families in our region. She has provided sound advice and mentorship to fellow labor leaders, local elected officials, and rank-and-file union members throughout Pierce County. In addition to her day job, Patty serves her community on the Board for the United Way of Pierce County, which provides opportunity and resources to families in need. Even in the face of personal struggles, Patty has continued to serve in this capacity for the betterment of those less fortunate. Her contributions to our region's history included spearheading the recent 125th anniversary celebration of the Pierce County Labor Council, which highlighted the many ways that this organization has helped to shape our community. Patty uses her leadership position to remind the public why basic protections and workers' rights exist today--due to the advocacy and sacrifice of labor leaders before her. Mr. Speaker, her influence on our region's proud organized labor history is exemplified by her receipt of the Tacoma Historical Society's Star of Destiny Award. This very special designation is reserved for those who show an ``unwavering commitment to the dignity and welfare of the working men and women of Tacoma and Pierce County.'' Patty Rose is certainly deserving of this award and will be in good company. She joins my predecessor Rep. Norm Dicks in receiving this important recognition on behalf of the citizens of Tacoma. I join their voices in thanks for her continued leadership and perseverance in helping to better the lives of working families in our community. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to call Patty Rose my friend and I am privileged to stand on the floor of the United States Congress today in recognition of her many accomplishments and leadership that will continue into the future. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1367] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE DEDICATED COMMUNITY SERVICE OF PATTY ROSE TO TACOMA, WA, AND THE GREATER PUGET SOUND REGION ______ HON.

ADAM B. SCHIFF of california in the house of representatives Monday, September 28, 2015 Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the National Society Daughters of the American Revolution upon its one hundred and twenty fifth anniversary. The National Society Daughters of the American Revolution (NSDAR), a non-profit, non-political women's volunteer service organization dedicated to patriotism, education and historic preservation, was founded in 1890 by Mary Smith Lockwood, Ellen Walworth, Mary Desha and Eugenia Washington. At their first meeting held on October 11, 1890, several women attended, as well as four members of the Sons of the American Revolution who served as an advisory board to the organization for its first few years. In 1896 the NSDAR, also known as the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) was incorporated by an Act of Congress. A lineage society, NSDAR members have the common bond of having ancestors who were patriots of the American Revolution. Members have included many noteworthy women, including women's rights pioneer Susan B. Anthony, American Red Cross founder Clara Barton, First Lady Rosalynn Carter, retired NASA astronaut Margaret Rhea Seddon and former U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno. With 177,000 members and 3,000 chapters in the United States and internationally, members have volunteered millions of service hours for various projects and programs. Projects include supporting active duty military personnel and assisting veterans, supporting schools for underserved children, awarding scholarships and providing financial aid to students, and restoring American Revolution War sites and memorials. Most of NSDAR's volunteer work is accomplished by the grassroots efforts of chapters on the local level, which focus on the mission areas of DAR: historic preservation, patriotism and education. There are several chapters in my 28th Congressional District. The Don Jose Verdugo Chapter, located in La Canada Flintridge, has been serving the community for sixty-two years, focusing their efforts on veterans and education. Additionally, the Martin Severance Chapter in Pasadena, founded in 1914 and the Hollywood Chapter founded in 1910; both have a strong focus on helping veterans. For 125 years, the NSDAR has exemplified their motto: ``God, Home, Country.'' I am honored to recognize this excellent organization, and ask all Members to join me in commending the National Society Daughters of the American Revolution upon their anniversary. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1367] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO THE NATIONAL SOCIETY DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION ______ HON.

WILLIAM R. KEATING of massachusetts in the house of representatives Monday, September 28, 2015 Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Fisheries Survival Fund for receiving the Friend of the Fishing Industry Award at the annual Blessing of the Fleet, held in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Established in New Bedford in 1969, the Blessing of the Fleet is a time-honored tradition that has been celebrated by fishing communities since the Archaic period. Legend speaks of Greek fishermen asking clergy to bless their boats and crews, providing well wishes for safe sailing and heavy nets while out to sea. Fittingly, the top fishing port of New Bedford has continued this practice for nearly fifty years. This year's recipient of the Offshore Mariners' Wives Association's Friend of the Fishing Industry award is the Fisheries Survival Fund (FSF). Established to ensure the long-term sustainability of the sea scallop fishery, FSF plays an incredibly important role in preserving and advocating for an industry that provides more than 50 million pounds of sea scallops each year and helping the port retain its status as the most profitable port on the East Coast and within the continental United States. The Fisheries Survival Fund is intrinsically imbedded in the South Coast's fishing community. From working with academic institutions and independent experts to conduct research on sustainability, partnering with the federal government to ensure responsible management of the fishery, and by pioneering a management system and improving practices, FSF has helped to preserve and grow the scallop industry. Mr. Speaker, it brings me great pride to recognize the Fisheries Survival Fund's receipt of the Friend of the Fishing Industry award and the role FSF has played in the greater New Bedford fishing community.

JUDY GENSHAFT'S LEADERSHIP OF THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1368] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING DR. JUDY GENSHAFT'S LEADERSHIP OF THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA ______ HON. DAVID W. JOLLY of florida in the house of representatives Monday, September 28, 2015 Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I submit an article that appeared in the Tampa Tribune recognizing Dr. Judy Genshaft for her leadership as President of the University of South Florida. For the past 15 years, Dr. Genshaft has worked tirelessly to improve USF's academic successes, as well as expand USF's role in our local economy. It is my honor to recognize her achievements at the helm of USF, and we are fortunate to have her as a part of our Tampa Bay community. Editorial: Genshaft's Education and Economic Successes [From the Tampa Tribune, Sept. 12, 2015] Judy Genshaft has enjoyed the longest tenure of any University of South Florida president, and by most measures the university has flourished under her direction. But often overlooked is how her 15-year leadership also has boosted the local economy. Improving USF's academic standing, to be sure, has been the priority, and results have been impressive. The graduation rate, a persistent trouble area, has jumped from 48 percent in 2008 to 67 percent, thanks to university initiatives. The average SAT test scores of incoming freshmen have increased by 159 points, reflecting USF's growing status. The Tampa campus, once a barren collection of far-flung buildings, has been transformed into a beautifully landscaped and bustling community. Also impressive is how Genshaft has tapped USF's potential as an economic engine. She strengthened its ties to the business community and made it a catalyst for innovation and investment. Former USF President Betty Castor, who served from 1994 to 1999, also deserves credit for highlighting the university's economic importance. Genshaft expanded that effort. Genshaft, who has served as chair of the Greater Tampa Chamber of Commerce and the Tampa Bay Partnership, actively sought to recruit companies to the area, particularly those that needed the resource of a research university. Indeed, the university has excelled at winning research grants. As the Tribune's Anastasia Dawson reports, when Genshaft came to USF it brought in about $171.3 million in research funds. Last year that number was $440.5 million-- 43rd in the nation among public and private universities. These dollars have an impact far beyond campus. According to the National Institutes of Health, every $1 in research funding brings in $2.21 in local economic growth. So USF's research funds alone are calculated to be responsible for $974 million in new economic activity and account for 5,900 jobs with an average salary of $75,000. The emphasis on innovation has helped USF become the No. 1 university in the state for patents, and 10th in the nation and 13th worldwide. With USF badly in need of renovating its 40-year-old medical school facilities, Genshaft seized the opportunity to partner with Lightning owner Jeff Vinik in the redevelopment of downtown's Channelside District. Now, with the backing of the Legislature and Gov. Rick Scott, the USF Morsani College of Medicine and the new USF Health Heart Institute will be the centerpiece of Vinik's downtown project, which will include residences, offices, hotels and retail shops. The school is expected to create 1,500 jobs and undoubtedly will attract other health-care enterprises. Genshaft also is pushing to redevelop the challenged neighborhoods near USF into an innovation district that will attract and nurture new enterprises. Former Hillsborough County Commissioner Mark Sharpe is heading the Tampa Innovation Alliance. Thanks to such diverse efforts, USF is widely recognized as a university on the move and is attracting widespread attention and support. It's nearing its goal of raising $1 billion in donations. Genshaft has had the occasional tussle with the Legislature, mostly stemming from lawmakers wanting more for USF branch campuses in their communities. The USF system includes St. Petersburg and Sarasota-Manatee campuses. The Legislature, in an act of fiscal lunacy, transformed USF's Polk County branch into a separate university, Florida Polytechnic, in 2012. Such dustups underscore the pitfalls of a branch campus system that invites meddling by lawmakers focused on bringing goodies to their districts. Granted, USF's football and basketball programs have languished in recent years. But those rough spots pale in comparison to USF's progress during Genshaft's 15 years. Her contract runs out next year, but she says she would like to remain. That decision will be up to the USF Board of Trustees. But there is a good reason Genshaft has managed to stay at USF's helm for 15 years. She is getting the job done. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1368] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING DR.

The Tampa campus, once a barren collection of far-flung buildings, has been transformed into a beautifully landscaped and bustling community. Also impressive is how Genshaft has tapped USF's potential as an economic engine. She strengthened its ties to the business community and made it a catalyst for innovation and investment. Former USF President Betty Castor, who served from 1994 to 1999, also deserves credit for highlighting the university's economic importance. Genshaft expanded that effort. Genshaft, who has served as chair of the Greater Tampa Chamber of Commerce and the Tampa Bay Partnership, actively sought to recruit companies to the area, particularly those that needed the resource of a research university. Indeed, the university has excelled at winning research grants. As the Tribune's Anastasia Dawson reports, when Genshaft came to USF it brought in about $171.3 million in research funds. Last year that number was $440.5 million-- 43rd in the nation among public and private universities. These dollars have an impact far beyond campus. According to the National Institutes of Health, every $1 in research funding brings in $2.21 in local economic growth. So USF's research funds alone are calculated to be responsible for $974 million in new economic activity and account for 5,900 jobs with an average salary of $75,000. The emphasis on innovation has helped USF become the No. 1 university in the state for patents, and 10th in the nation and 13th worldwide. With USF badly in need of renovating its 40-year-old medical school facilities, Genshaft seized the opportunity to partner with Lightning owner Jeff Vinik in the redevelopment of downtown's Channelside District. Now, with the backing of the Legislature and Gov. Rick Scott, the USF Morsani College of Medicine and the new USF Health Heart Institute will be the centerpiece of Vinik's downtown project, which will include residences, offices, hotels and retail shops. The school is expected to create 1,500 jobs and undoubtedly will attract other health-care enterprises. Genshaft also is pushing to redevelop the challenged neighborhoods near USF into an innovation district that will attract and nurture new enterprises. Former Hillsborough County Commissioner Mark Sharpe is heading the Tampa Innovation Alliance. Thanks to such diverse efforts, USF is widely recognized as a university on the move and is attracting widespread attention and support. It's nearing its goal of raising $1 billion in donations. Genshaft has had the occasional tussle with the Legislature, mostly stemming from lawmakers wanting more for USF branch campuses in their communities. The USF system includes St. Petersburg and Sarasota-Manatee campuses. The Legislature, in an act of fiscal lunacy, transformed USF's Polk County branch into a separate university, Florida Polytechnic, in 2012. Such dustups underscore the pitfalls of a branch campus system that invites meddling by lawmakers focused on bringing goodies to their districts. Granted, USF's football and basketball programs have languished in recent years. But those rough spots pale in comparison to USF's progress during Genshaft's 15 years. Her contract runs out next year, but she says she would like to remain. That decision will be up to the USF Board of Trustees. But there is a good reason Genshaft has managed to stay at USF's helm for 15 years. She is getting the job done. ____________________",package_114_54.csv,4969,4969,5041,"[congressional record volume 161, number 140 (monday, september 28, 2015)] [extensions of remarks] [page e1368]

JIM McDERMOTT of washington in the house of representatives Monday, September 28, 2015 Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the 50th anniversary of Northwest Center. The Northwest Center is a leader in advancing equal opportunities for children and adults with developmental disabilities. Their unique social enterprise model provides services such as inclusive early childhood education, after school programs, job training and placement. Founded in 1965, Northwest Center was initiated by parents who refused to accept that institutionalizing their children with special needs was the only option for their education and enrichment. Washington State is a place of pioneers and it was in that spirit that these parents effected positive change for children everywhere. Fifty years later in 2015, Northwest Center continues to revolutionize the ways we think about people with abilities different than our own. Where Northwest Center's founding parents were once viewed as audacious for their advocacy, today there is a generation of people living rich, productive lives because they were given the opportunity to thrive as a part of a community that nurtured them as part of its whole, instead of isolating them as separate and distinct. Northwest Center's 50th Anniversary celebrates the promise the organization made a [[Page E1369]] half century ago, ``to promote the growth, development, and economic independence of persons with developmental disabilities through programs of education, rehabilitation, and work opportunity.'' Its revolutionary approach recognizes that inclusion, not segregation, is a fundamental tenet of a strong community--at school, at work and in the world around us. In Northwest Center classrooms, children with and without disabilities share high expectations. Innovative companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Starbucks have embraced the advantages of workforce inclusion. Against this backdrop of revolutionary achievement, I salute Northwest Center and its founders for their leadership--not only in their programs, but in launching a groundbreaking attitudinal shift that impacts people across the state of Washington and across this country. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1368-E1369] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO THE NORTHWEST CENTER'S 50 YEARS OF SERVICE AND ADVOCACY FOR PEOPLE OF ALL ABILITIES ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Willie Mae Seaton, longtime owner of Willie Mae's Scotch House in New Orleans. Ms. Seaton passed away on September 18, 2015, at the age of 99. Ms. Seaton was born in Crystal Springs, Mississippi, and moved to New Orleans during World War II with her husband who worked at the Higgins Shipyard. For several years she drove a taxi, worked at a dry cleaner, and was a licensed beautician. Ms. Seaton's true ambition, however, was to own a bar. In 1957, Ms. Seaton turned her corner beauty shop into Willie Mae's Scotch House where it quickly became a neighborhood favorite. While cooking out of the bar's kitchen, patrons encouraged her to open a restaurant. Famous for its fried chicken, Ms. Seaton ran her business for decades. Ms. Seaton represented everything that is great about New Orleans. She had a wonderful spirit and always greeted everyone who came to visit her restaurant with warmth and love. To this day, Willie Mae's is among the best fried chicken you will ever find. In fact, when President Obama visited New Orleans for the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, we ate at Willie Mae's. Ms. Seaton was named an America's Classic by the James Beard Foundation in May 2005. Later that year, the floods that followed post- Katrina levee failure destroyed Willie Mae's Scotch House and Ms. Seaton's home next door. A testament to her impact on the New Orleans community, waves of volunteers helped to rebuild her neighborhood restaurant. New Orleans will not be the same without her, but her legacy will forever be a part of the city. Her story of turning her small beauty shop into a world-renowned establishment exemplifies the spirit of New Orleans. Stories like hers will show generations of Americans that if we work hard, our dreams can become a reality. Mr. Speaker, I celebrate the life and legacy of Ms. Seaton, a beloved mother, grandmother, and example to African-American entrepreneurs everywhere. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1369] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF MS.

Lieutenant Colonel Kem has served our country for 26 years with the United States Air Force and New York Air National Guard. Lieutenant Colonel Kem has been decorated with numerous medals, awards, and service distinctions and will retire from military service on October 1st.

Lieutenant Colonel Kem served active duty from May 1989 through September 2000. Lieutenant Colonel Kem had a very successful active duty career; after commissioning he attended pilot training at Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas and remained there after graduating as a First Assignment Instructor Pilot (FAIP) in the T-38. During his time at Laughlin Air Force Base, he flew as a check pilot, was an assistant Flight Commander, and the Runway Supervisory Unit Training and Standardization Officer-In-Charge. Lieutenant Colonel Kem then flew the C-141 at Travis Air Force Base, California, working as a training officer and flying missions to all points of the world.

[[Page E1370]] Shortly after joining the RC-26 program, its mission expanded to include missions outside the United States to locations such as Colombia, South America, various locations within Iraq and Afghanistan, and more recently to Lima, Peru. Lieutenant Colonel Kem courageously deployed ten times with the RC-26 in support of Operations Iraqi Freedom, New Dawn, and Enduring Freedom. Five of those deployments were to Iraq and two to Afghanistan. Lieutenant Colonel Kem has dedicated 26 years of service to the United States of America. Lieutenant Colonel Kem earned his pilot wings at Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas, and throughout his career he has earned the rating of Command Pilot, while logging 7,600 military flight hours, 1,115 combat hours, and 277 combat sorties. Lieutenant Colonel Kem worked his way through the ranks to earn the title of Lieutenant Colonel in September 2007. His effective dates of promotion are: Second Lieutenant--May 1989; First Lieutenant--May 1991; Captain--May 1993; Major--September 2000; Lieutenant Colonel--September 2007.

EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of texas in the house of representatives Monday, September 28, 2015 Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great pleasure to pay tribute to the life and legacy of a proud Dallasite and a true American. Ebby Halliday, known in North Texas as the ``Queen of Real Estate,'' passed in Dallas on Wednesday, September 9, 2015. The 70-year-old company that she founded, Ebby Halliday Real Estate, has nearly 1800 real estate agents and in 2014 amassed sales of $6.6 billion. The impact of her company was only outweighed by the impact of her character. The life and work of Ebby Halliday is a part of the social and economic fabric of Dallas. Mrs. Halliday approached philanthropy with the same way she approached real estate. Always graceful, she explained her work ethic by saying: ``I work like a dog and act like a lady.'' Her intensity and charm only intensified with age. Praise for Mrs. Halliday rings far and wide in Dallas, from the state capitol to her many employees. Twenty-three years ago, she placed 49 percent of the company that she had build into a stock portfolio for her employees. She believed that they should be rewarded for their work. She changed the scope and nature of the real estate industry in Texas, by including, recruiting, and mentoring talented women to lead the industry. Some of the largest real estate firms in North Texas today are owned by women who received their training under the prudent tutelage of Ebby Halliday. At a celebration for her 100th birthday four years ago, this graceful lady donned a ukulele and sang ``Happy Days Are Here Again.'' She was as joyous as the youngest person in the room. Because of Ebby Halliday, Dallas grew not only in size, but in the capacity to love. I want to take this time to remember her, on behalf of her family, the city of Dallas. Mr. Speaker, Ebby Halliday is an unforgettable public servant and leader. A woman fueled by passion and concern for others, she was a trailblazer for women throughout the state of Texas. She left a powerful legacy that will live for generations. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1370] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNITION OF EBBY HALLIDAY ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate John Calipari, Head Basketball Coach of the University of Kentucky Wildcats, on his induction into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Over his career as a basketball coach, Calipari has received many well deserved awards and the Hall of Fame recognizes the years of successful accomplishments. In twenty two years as a head coach in college basketball, Coach Cal has an overall record of 593-174 (.773). He has led three schools to the Final Four; UMass, Memphis, and Kentucky. At the University of Kentucky, his teams have reached the Final Four in four out of the last five years. As all Kentuckians know, the 2012 Kentucky team won the national championship. He has twenty official twenty win seasons and eight official thirty win seasons as a college head coach. In addition to his amazing won-loss record and his successful teams, Coach Cal can be very proud of the positive affect he has had on the lives of many young men. Numerous former players are now successful stars in the next step of their careers, the NBA. Coach Cal continues to follow their careers after they go to the NBA and takes time to show continued interest in their lives. Coach Calipari can also be proud of the positive contributions he has made to the communities where he has coached through philanthropic efforts. Not only does he give generously to the community in many ways, he teaches his players to do the same. Young men on his teams are known for spending time with those who are less fortunate, especially children. He teaches players to be positive role models and good citizens. For all the accomplishments of his college basketball coaching career, Coach John Calipari has been honored with membership in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. As a proud alumnus of the University of Kentucky and lifelong Wildcat fan, I am happy to be able to congratulate him before the House of Representatives. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1370] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING COACH JOHN CALIPARI, NAISMITH MEMORIAL BASKETBALL HALL OF FAME MEMBER ______ HON.

CREC-2015-09-28-pt1-PgE1371-5,CREC-2015-09-28,114,INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AVOIDANCE ACT OF 2015,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1371] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AVOIDANCE ACT OF 2015 ______ HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON of the district of columbia in the house of representatives Monday, September 28, 2015 Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, although it appears the federal government will narrowly avert a shutdown on October 1, the second shutdown since 2013, I rise today to offer the District of Columbia Government Shutdown Avoidance Act of 2015 to permanently authorize the District to spend its local funds during a federal shutdown and therefore to remain open during a shutdown. Congress has recently exempted D.C. from shutdowns on an annual basis, and this bill simply makes those exemptions permanent. The District has an $8 billion local budget, which is comprised entirely of local revenue sources, such as taxes and fees. The District should be free, as every state and city is, to spend its own local funds during a federal shutdown. The shutdowns involve congressional disputes about federal funding, but the federal government does not provide a dollar of D.C.'s local budget. The D.C. government should never have to wonder whether it will be part of a federal shutdown, have to prepare in case of a shutdown, or even have to ask Congress to be exempted annually. No Member of the House or Senate has spoken up in favor of shutting down the D.C. government, and I do not believe any Member wants to shut down the D.C. government and bring a large, complicated city to its knees over purely federal matters in which the city is not involved. There is unprecedented bipartisan and bicameral support, as well as support from the Obama administration, for preventing D.C. shutdowns. In fiscal years 2014 and 2015, for the first time ever, Congress exempted D.C. from shutdowns for an entire fiscal year (fiscal years 2015 and 2016, respectively). The pending House and Senate fiscal year 2016 D.C. Appropriations bills each exempt D.C. from shutdowns for fiscal year 2017. Among the most important reasons for a permanent shutdown exemption would be the significant financial and operational benefits for the District. If the District shuts down, it could default under certain financing agreements and leases. The financial importance of eliminating shutdown threats to the District were definitively shown recently. The three leading bond rating agencies have cited the annual shutdown exemption as a positive credit factor in upgrading or maintaining their ratings on the District's bonds. The city's partners, Wall Street and vendors alike can charge a risk premium for the uncertainty created by shutdown threats. A permanent shutdown exemption would undoubtedly improve D.C.'s creditworthiness even more. The 650,000 D.C. residents do not suffer alone when vital city services cease during a shutdown. Federal officials, federal buildings, foreign embassies and dignitaries, businesses and tourists rely daily on the city's services as well. Successive continuing resolutions (CRs) do not help much. Not only do successive CRs make it difficult for the city to plan its activities for the year, they increase the city's costs of doing business. Shutdown threats force the District to invest time and money preparing contingency shutdown plans. Although federal shutdowns have shut down the District in the past, the District did not shut down during the 2013 federal shutdown, only because D.C. was able to use previously appropriated contingency funds to remain open. However, the District had to severely ration its payments, risking its credit standing, and if the federal shutdown had continued for much longer, the District would have exhausted those funds and shut down, too. It is clear that Congress does not intend such risks and consequences to the District. Congress loses nothing by allowing the District, which submits a balanced budget, almost always with surpluses, each year, to remain open. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1371] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AVOIDANCE ACT OF 2015 ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Ukrainian- American and Northern Ohioan Adrian Karmazyn on the announcement of his retirement as Voice of America's (VOA) Ukrainian Service Chief. Mr. Karmazyn is a native of Parma, Ohio and is respected around the world as a veteran journalist covering Ukraine and Ukrainian-American communities in the United States. During his career, Mr. Karmazyn has contributed immensely to keeping the flame of freedom alive in Ukraine, even during some of her darkest hours. He is a freedom fighter. His mindful voice has been an essential component on the arduous path to a more open, democratic society following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the harrowing but steady progress of Ukraine to become part of the European community of nations. Mr. Karmazyn attended Ohio State University, receiving a B.A. in History. He then joined Voice of America in 1988 as an international radio broadcaster in VOA's Ukrainian Service, serving as a writer, producer, reporter, translator, announcer, and eventually as a correspondent in Kyiv. While there, he recruited a team of radio and video journalists in Kyiv and in other regional cities, helping to establish VOA's reporting presence throughout Ukraine. He continued to distinguish himself and in 1999 was named Program Manager of VOA's Ukrainian Service. Mr. Karmazyn directed the reorganization of the weekly Ukrainian Service TV magazine program Vikno v America, or Window on America. Over the next several years, the Ukrainian Service significantly expanded its network of reporters in Ukraine. In 2004, Mr. Karmazyn was assigned leadership over VOA's Ukrainian television programming. Later that year, during Ukraine's Orange Revolution, Karmazyn oversaw the launch of the daily Chas-Time television program. He was appointed Chief of VOA's Ukrainian Service in 2006 and served as one of the most reliable and valuable sources of information during the Euromaidan protests and Revolution of Dignity in 2013. This was vital as freedom of the press was under threat in the region. I have known and worked with Adrian Karmazyn for many years. Please allow me to extend my heartfelt appreciation for his years of exemplary and passionate service and his commitment to telling the stories of Ukraine, from Kyiv to Cleveland. His labor has brought the American people and the people of Ukraine closer for decades, with his regular presence and positive influence at VOA for the cause of liberty. His has been a voice of freedom and he will be missed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1372] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING ADRIAN KARMAZYN, VOICE OF AMERICA UKRAINIAN SERVICE CHIEF, ON THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS RETIREMENT ______ HON.

MARCY KAPTUR of ohio in the house of representatives Monday, September 28, 2015 Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Ukrainian- American and Northern Ohioan Adrian Karmazyn on the announcement of his retirement as Voice of America's (VOA) Ukrainian Service Chief. Mr. Karmazyn is a native of Parma, Ohio and is respected around the world as a veteran journalist covering Ukraine and Ukrainian-American communities in the United States. During his career, Mr. Karmazyn has contributed immensely to keeping the flame of freedom alive in Ukraine, even during some of her darkest hours. He is a freedom fighter. His mindful voice has been an essential component on the arduous path to a more open, democratic society following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the harrowing but steady progress of Ukraine to become part of the European community of nations. Mr. Karmazyn attended Ohio State University, receiving a B.A. in History. He then joined Voice of America in 1988 as an international radio broadcaster in VOA's Ukrainian Service, serving as a writer, producer, reporter, translator, announcer, and eventually as a correspondent in Kyiv. While there, he recruited a team of radio and video journalists in Kyiv and in other regional cities, helping to establish VOA's reporting presence throughout Ukraine. He continued to distinguish himself and in 1999 was named Program Manager of VOA's Ukrainian Service. Mr. Karmazyn directed the reorganization of the weekly Ukrainian Service TV magazine program Vikno v America, or Window on America. Over the next several years, the Ukrainian Service significantly expanded its network of reporters in Ukraine. In 2004, Mr. Karmazyn was assigned leadership over VOA's Ukrainian television programming. Later that year, during Ukraine's Orange Revolution, Karmazyn oversaw the launch of the daily Chas-Time television program. He was appointed Chief of VOA's Ukrainian Service in 2006 and served as one of the most reliable and valuable sources of information during the Euromaidan protests and Revolution of Dignity in 2013. This was vital as freedom of the press was under threat in the region. I have known and worked with Adrian Karmazyn for many years. Please allow me to extend my heartfelt appreciation for his years of exemplary and passionate service and his commitment to telling the stories of Ukraine, from Kyiv to Cleveland. His labor has brought the American people and the people of Ukraine closer for decades, with his regular presence and positive influence at VOA for the cause of liberty.

ELIZABETH H. ESTY of connecticut in the house of representatives Monday, September 28, 2015 Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 375th anniversary of Farmington, Connecticut. During the month of August and September, seven historical organizations planned History Day to display, honor, and celebrate influential Farmington community leaders. This historic milestone recognizes Farmington's deeply rooted history and significance as one of the first settlements in New England. Over the past 375 years, Farmington residents have enjoyed the fruits of the land, scenic views along the Farmington River, and trails through the Farmington Valley greenway. Though closely neighboring the major metropolitan hub of Hartford, the town of Farmington has maintained its unique character through careful land use and historic preservation. On September 13, 2015, the town celebrated History Day, educating community members about the first Tunxis Indians who welcomed new settlers into the area. In 1640, the early settlers purchased the land that would become Farmington. During the mid-1700s, Farmington's rich farmland and access to water made it an attractive destination for homesteaders. As trade opportunities evolved, a booming economy brought with it an era of technological innovation. Manufacturers located their factories in the Unionville section of Farmington to take advantage of its easy access to the Farmington Canal, which was later replaced by a railroad. Through its many periods of growth, Farmington continues to embody the values instilled by its early inhabitants to promote its natural resources. From its wooden lands, to the majestic river and valley, Farmington offers its residents a getaway from the Hartford metropolitan area, while remaining in a central location in the state. I am honored to represent Farmington in Congress.

K. MICHAEL CONAWAY of texas in the house of representatives Monday, September 28, 2015 Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join with America's rice farmers in celebrating the month of September as National Rice Month. It has been 25 years since September was first declared National Rice Month. On this silver anniversary, I want to pay a special tribute to the hard working men and women who produce rice on their family farms. I would also like to recognize all of those who mill and market rice, all of the suppliers and buyers, and, of course, all of the consumers who make rice an essential part of their diet. Rice farming in America actually predates our nation's independence, beginning some 300 years ago. Today, America's rice industry creates 125,000 good-paying jobs and contributes an estimated $34 billion to our nation's economy, including an estimated direct impact of $169.8 million in my home state of Texas. Nine million tons of rice are grown each year by family farmers on some 2.7 million acres of land, predominately in the states of Arkansas, California, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Texas. While these six states produce the lion's share of rice in America, there is also rice production in other states, like Illinois and Tennessee, and the entire rice industry reaches every state in the nation, especially those states with cereal makers, breweries, and other food-makers that use rice as a key ingredient. On top of this, about half of America's rice crop is bound for export markets, helping to feed people around the globe while positively contributing to our nation's balance of trade. Although the figures I just listed are as impressive as they are important, the benefits of rice are not limited to jobs and the economy. Health-wise, rice is a source of more than 15 vitamins and minerals and 100% gluten-free, with only 100 calories per serving. Brown rice is 100% whole grain and may reduce the risk of heart disease and certain cancers. What is more, studies suggest that those who eat rice have healthier diets than those who do not. On the conservation front, America's rice farmers have a longstanding commitment to protect and preserve natural resources. Today, U.S. rice farmers produce more rice using less land, energy, and water than they did just 20 years ago. Our rice farms provide critical habitat for hundreds of species, particularly migratory birds. America's rice farmers continue to serve as leaders in the farming community by producing a healthy, conservation-friendly food that, as a byproduct, generates jobs and economic opportunity. It is fitting that we honor the hard working American farmers, millers, merchants, suppliers and buyers, and the consumers who make rice not only such a wholesome and popular food but an important part of our economy. I ask that my colleagues join with me in celebrating September as National Rice Month. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1373] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING 25 YEARS OF NATIONAL RICE MONTH ______ HON.

CREC-2015-09-28-pt1-PgE1373-4,CREC-2015-09-28,114,IN MEMORY OF RICHARD RAINWATER,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1373-E1374] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN MEMORY OF RICHARD RAINWATER ______ HON. JOE WILSON of south carolina in the house of representatives Monday, September 28, 2015 Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, Richard Rainwater sadly passed away on Sunday, September 27, 2015, at his home in Fort Worth, Texas. The following obituary by Miguel Bustillo, Gregory Zuckerman and Rob Copeland was published in The Wall Street Journal on September 27, 2015. The citizens of South Carolina especially appreciate the Rainwater and Moore families for their phenomenal generosity promoting business education at the University of South Carolina. Long before Wall Street was littered with swaggering hedge- fund billionaires, Richard Rainwater earned a Texas-size reputation as an investor with an eye on the big score. He helped install Michael Eisner as Walt Disney Co. chief executive, steered George W. Bush to buy a stake in Major League Baseball's Texas Rangers and helped multiply the Bass family fortune one-hundred-fold before building a billion- dollar one of his own. ``My brother said, `Don't be mediocre at anything; be remarkable at something,' '' Mr. Rainwater recalled in 2010 in a speech at Stanford University. Mr. Rainwater died on Sunday morning at his home in Fort Worth, Texas, according to the Rainwater Charitable Foundation and his family. He had been suffering from complications of a rare brain disease. He was 71 years old. Born to a middle-class family, Mr. Rainwater parlayed a gift for mathematics and a gregarious personality into a more than $2 billion fortune as a financial adviser and wheeler- dealer whose underlings went on to become chief executives, governors and hedge-fund tycoons. ``He was a laid back guy who liked to invest but he was not a fan of fancy dinners or some of the other things that went with it,'' his son, Todd, said on Sunday. ``What he was best at is being a talent scout. He would find a troubled business, find the best person to run it, the Michael Jordan of that industry, and inevitably that person would turn the business around''. A native of Fort Worth, Mr. Rainwater attended the Stanford Graduate School of Business on scholarship, where he met Sid Bass, who hired him to serve as chief investment adviser for the Bass brothers, who were also from Fort Worth. He began working in 1970 for the Bass family, which had inherited an oil fortune from Texas wildcatter Sid Williams Richardson, and helped them to dramatically increase their wealth over the next decade and a half through a dizzying succession of deals. Perhaps the most famous deal was the Bass family's rescue of then-struggling Disney in [[Page E1374]] 1984 with a nearly $500 million investment to ward off a potential hostile takeover bid by financier Saul Steinberg. Mr. Rainwater helped handpick a new management team for Disney led by Mr. Eisner that brought the studio back to prominence--and made the Bass brothers billions. ``Richard was one of best deal guys who ever lived,'' said David Bonderman, who met Mr. Rainwater while working for Robert Bass and later founded private-equity giant TPG. ``He was always confident and idiosyncratic, and generally was right.'' Mr. Rainwater struck out on his own in the late 1980s, continuing his penchant for spotting distressed assets and market quirks that made for bold investment opportunities through his private-equity firm, Rainwater Inc. His winning moves included buying more than 15 million square feet of downtown Houston real estate during a slump in the mid-1990s; many of the properties later sold for two or three times his purchase price. In addition to mastering the art of the deal, Mr. Rainwater became known for his extraordinary ability to spot and cultivate young talent during the 1980s and early 1990s. His Fort Worth offices became a salon of sorts for ambitious young financiers. Among those he encouraged was Edward S. Lampert, who began his ESL Investments Inc. hedge fund in the office. Down the hall at the time was Rick Scott, who became the CEO of the Columbia/HCA hospital chain and is now governor of Florida. ``He believed in [young people] and made them believe in themselves,'' said Mr. Lampert, who later made a fortune for investors buying the debt of Kmart and steering the troubled retailer out of bankruptcy. Mr. Rainwater's unorthodox personal style--he would often stand on his desk to hammer home a point--made an impression on his proteges, as did his lack of pretense. Mr. Bonderman recalled how Mr. Rainwater once traveled to a city to cut a deal without packing a suitcase; the billionaire brought a change of clothes in a paper bag. ``He couldn't be bothered, he was a total character,'' Mr. Bonderman said. ``It was all about making lot of money and having fun doing it.'' Mr. Rainwater, who had three children with his first wife, Karen, married Darla Moore, a prominent bankruptcy banker, in 1991. Ms. Moore became CEO of Rainwater Inc. in 1994 and brought a harder edge to some of the firm's dealings that generated controversy, notably when it forced oilman T. Boone Pickens to leave the company he founded, Mesa Petroleum, in 1996. Mr. Rainwater had slowed his investment activity, playing golf and traveling with his wife, when he began experiencing falls and mood changes. He slowly withdrew from public life as the symptoms of progressive supranuclear palsy, a rare brain disease with no known cure, became more pronounced and he lost his ability to speak clearly. Doctors warned his friends and family that he would almost certainly die from the disease. Undeterred, Mr. Rainwater's family tackled the problem through an investment, creating the Tau Consortium, a group of international scientists, which is trying to understand and ultimately treat degenerative brain diseases such as the one that struck Mr. Rainwater. The Tau Consortium has spent a total of more than $50 million trying to find a solution to the disease, a cure that may also assist people with a more common illness: Alzheimer's disease, Todd Rainwater said Sunday. ``Just like my father invested in business, we went about assembling the top team possible to work on this,'' he said. ``I do have faith that ultimately, we will be able to make a difference.'' ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1373-E1374] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN MEMORY OF RICHARD RAINWATER ______ HON.

EARL BLUMENAUER of oregon in the house of representatives Monday, September 28, 2015 Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, on Friday, September 25, 2015, I voted against H.R. 348, the RAPID Act, which, if enacted, would severely weaken the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Under current law, NEPA requires federal agencies to go through a public assessment of the environmental impacts of certain proposed federal actions and mandates the consideration of alternatives to those actions. This process often identifies alternatives that are less costly and have fewer impacts on the environment. While I support efforts to refine our regulatory process in a manner that rewards outcomes instead of dictating onerous processes, H.R. 348 adds confusion and would lead to worse outcomes for our environment, communities and future generations. This bill would allow potential developers to prepare environmental review documents for their proposed projects, creating clear conflicts of interest. The bill prohibits agencies from using the social cost of carbon in the environmental review or decision-making process and it limits the ability of an aggrieved party to seek judicial review of a permit or license. The bill imposes arbitrary and rigid deadlines for review and approval, and it provides for default approvals of permits or licenses if deadlines are not met; a measure that wholly undermines the environmental review process. The stated goal of this bill is to help projects--including infrastructure projects--to move forward more quickly. The NEPA process, however, is not the reason for project delays; other factors such as project complexity and under-resourced agencies are to blame. At the Army Corps of Engineers, there is a $60 billion backlog of authorized water resources projects that were successfully approved under NEPA, but have not been built due to lack of funding. Our roads and bridges are in disrepair, not due to NEPA, but because the Congress has failed to act to raise the gas tax, leaving the federal government short of resources. The Highway Trust Fund is projected to need $90 billion in additional revenue over the next six years just to stay solvent. Additionally, the NEPA process, which ensures the public has a voice in the planning of major projects that impact their communities, leads to better decision-making and better projects. In the end, NEPA saves time, money and reduces negative impacts. NEPA's positive impact is unquestionable--it is one of the nation's bedrock environmental laws, ensuring careful decision making and public participation. I am disappointed to see H.R. 348 pass the House, which will only limit the public's participation, increase confusion and undermine responsible agency reviews. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1374] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] H.R. 348--RAPID ACT ______ HON.

While I support efforts to refine our regulatory process in a manner that rewards outcomes instead of dictating onerous processes, H.R. 348 adds confusion and would lead to worse outcomes for our environment, communities and future generations. This bill would allow potential developers to prepare environmental review documents for their proposed projects, creating clear conflicts of interest. The bill prohibits agencies from using the social cost of carbon in the environmental review or decision-making process and it limits the ability of an aggrieved party to seek judicial review of a permit or license. The bill imposes arbitrary and rigid deadlines for review and approval, and it provides for default approvals of permits or licenses if deadlines are not met; a measure that wholly undermines the environmental review process. The stated goal of this bill is to help projects--including infrastructure projects--to move forward more quickly. The NEPA process, however, is not the reason for project delays; other factors such as project complexity and under-resourced agencies are to blame. At the Army Corps of Engineers, there is a $60 billion backlog of authorized water resources projects that were successfully approved under NEPA, but have not been built due to lack of funding. Our roads and bridges are in disrepair, not due to NEPA, but because the Congress has failed to act to raise the gas tax, leaving the federal government short of resources. The Highway Trust Fund is projected to need $90 billion in additional revenue over the next six years just to stay solvent. Additionally, the NEPA process, which ensures the public has a voice in the planning of major projects that impact their communities, leads to better decision-making and better projects. In the end, NEPA saves time, money and reduces negative impacts. NEPA's positive impact is unquestionable--it is one of the nation's bedrock environmental laws, ensuring careful decision making and public participation. I am disappointed to see H.R. 348 pass the House, which will only limit the public's participation, increase confusion and undermine responsible agency reviews. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1374] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] H.R. 348--RAPID ACT ______ HON.

Mr. Denard Davis passed away September 8th, 2015. He is survived by his wife Yvonne, two daughters, Donna and Dorma, 3 grandchildren and 1 great grandchild. Denard Davis was born in New Orleans, Louisiana on May 15, 1934. Denard left New Orleans to attend Texas College in Tyler, Texas. Denard then served in the United States Marine Corps. After his discharge from the Corps in 1959 he went to San Francisco to work as a substitute teacher. On May 16, 1960 he married his childhood sweetheart Yvonne. On August 13th 1960 the newlyweds arrived in Merced where Denard began working for the Merced City School District. After teaching for fifteen years Denard became the first African American Assistant Superintendent of Merced County schools, providing administrative leadership for over 30 years. Denard Davis had extensive experience in the planning and development of educational programs from their inception to their implementation. He was an instrumental part in the development of the Head Start buildings in Planada and South Dos Palos. Denard also played an essential role in the development of preschool programs and buildings in the migrant worker camps in Merced, Stanislaus and San Joaquin Counties. His efforts later extended to Madera and Contra Costa counties [[Page E1375]] in 1969 and his administrative duties included hiring all staff in the five county migrant education program After retiring from the Merced County Office of Education he created his own consulting business and served on many projects, programs and initiatives that focused on the betterment of Merced County children's education. Denard worked on anything that would improve the opportunities, training, job creation and life-long experiences that would translate into the development of Merced County. These movements include among many others: serving on the board of the local NAACP chapter, workforce development and the renaming of J Street in Merced to Martin Luther King Jr. Way. He was instrumental in establishing the annual ``Concerned Men Cook'' event where all of the proceeds go to scholarships for local children. Denard managed local campaigns, and was always engaged on municipal and county committees. He was a thoughtful and active leader who often called upon the community to weigh in on local issues at public hearings.

BROWN ______ HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. of georgia in the house of representatives Monday, September 28, 2015 Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the outstanding service of Mr. Tary L. Brown, who will be retiring after thirty years of serving as CEO of Albany Area Primary Health Care (AAPHC) in Southwest Georgia. A retirement celebration was held in Tary's honor on Saturday, September 26, 2015 at 6:00 p.m. at the Doublegate Country Club in Albany, Georgia. Tary began his professional career after the death of his grandmother. Upset with how the local health care system treated her, he chose to devote his life ``to making a difference and promoting healthcare as a Right.'' Tary subsequently received a Bachelor of Science degree from Illinois State University and a Master's degree in Health Administration from the University of Illinois. Upon graduation, he began working with community health centers (CHCs) in Oquawka, Illinois as both health department administrator and CHC director. Tary was then offered an opportunity to work in Georgia for two years initially. But Tary, as countless others before and after him, fell in love with the beautiful landscape and rich culture of our great state. For the next three decades, he worked tirelessly in Georgia to ensure that all citizens--no matter their race, income, or background--had access to quality health care. Under Tary's leadership, AAPHC performed over one million patient visits. The center trained medical students and residents and piloted primary care case management of HIV/AIDS, the largest rural program in the nation. Moreover, AAPHC was instrumental in responding to the medical needs of citizens during natural disasters. Tary oversaw AAPHC's growth from three sites and 34 employees to eight sites and 160 employees. I know that he will leave the AAPHC in good hands with incoming CEO, Shelley Spires. Tary has been recognized and commended for his leadership and service numerous times throughout his career. Some of his accolades include the 2010 Betsey K. Cook Advocacy MVP Award and the 2015 Spirit of Excellence Award, both from the National Association of Community Health Centers, and two Administrator of the Year Awards from the Georgia Association for Primary Health Care, Inc. His practice has been recognized as the Rural Practice of the Year in 2009 and was listed in the Top 25 Physician Group Practices by Atlanta Business Chronicle in 1997. Tary Brown has been a stalwart advocate for CHCs on the local, state, and national levels and has been a frequent visitor to my Congressional office both in Albany and Washington D.C. He also has been active in the community and previously served as President of Georgia Association for Primary Health Care, Inc. Tary has achieved much in his life, but none of this would have been possible without the love and support of his wife, Lyndea, their three children, and three grandchildren. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring and recognizing Mr. Tary Brown for his outstanding leadership and his contributions to improving the quality of health care in Southwest Georgia. I wish Tary all the best for his retirement and I look forward to his continued friendship and wise counsel in the future. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1375] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF TARY L.

The DGDC was established in 1979 as a non-profit organization dedicated to improving Downtown Goldsboro by creating and facilitating downtown development, promotion, and preservation activities. DGDC's employees and members of its board strive to work with local community members, downtown merchants, and other groups to enhance the appearance, desirability, and vitality of Downtown Goldsboro. DGDC's work that started some 36 years ago continues today under the capable leadership of its Executive Director, Ms. Julie M. Metz. I have had the pleasure of representing the City of Goldsboro since coming to Congress 11 years ago and have witnessed firsthand the renaissance of Downtown Goldsboro. The significant infrastructure improvements and beautification efforts have helped to draw new residents and businesses to the City and helped to create jobs and expand the tax base. I was proud to accompany U.S. Secretaries of Transportation Ray LaHood and Anthony Foxx to Goldsboro. They were equally impressed by the focused efforts of DGDC and the City in pursuing the Goldsboro Master Plan. Implementing that long term plan takes strategic partnerships between federal and local government and individuals and businesses. And it is DGDC's Annual Dinner and Awards Ceremony that recognizes and honors the dedicated work of those that have labored so hard to improve the City of Goldsboro and its vibrant downtown. Awardees are honored in a variety of categories, including awards for Best Curb Appeal, Best Promotional or Marketing Effort, Best New Business, Indicator of the Year, the ``Thank You'' Award, Historic Preservation, Volunteer of the Year, Design Improvement, Advocate of the Year, Board Member of the Year, Outstanding Investor, Most Valuable Supporter, and Outstanding Business of the Year. This year's award recipients are most deserving of DGDC's recognition. They have gone to great lengths on behalf of those who live, work, and visit Downtown Goldsboro. I ask my colleagues join me in congratulating this year's award recipients and in extending best wishes as they continue to build upon the City's great successes. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1375] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING DOWNTOWN GOLDSBORO DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION ______ HON.

LOUIS STOKES ______ HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR. of michigan in the house of representatives Monday, September 28, 2015 Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, tonight, it is an honor to stand before you all and celebrate the life of my good friend, Congressman Lou Stokes. Lou was a highly honored member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. He was a decorated veteran who served in the U.S. Army during World War II. He was one of the original founders of the Congressional Black Caucus, and later its chair from 1972-1974. We will miss him here in Congress and across the country--he gave us all so much. Lou lived his life with an unrelenting optimism--he knew his country could be a better place, and he never ceased to join in that struggle. He shared that quality that so many great men and women possess: a fierce, unrelenting, desire to bring about change. In 1967, Lou followed that conviction to the U.S. Supreme Court, where he argued for the petitioner in Terry v. Ohio, which established the standards under which a police officer may stop a citizen. Less than a year later, he became the first African-American in Ohio elected to the United States House of Representatives. On Jan. 3, 1969 he took his seat in the House, just a year and three days after his brother--Carl Stokes--was elected Mayor of Cleveland and the first African-American mayor of a major city. He was a distinguished member of this body, serving on the Appropriations Committee for many years. He also served as Chairman of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, investigating the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Dr. Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., and as Chairman of the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, now the House Ethics Committee. If there was one thing you knew about Lou, it was that you could find him fighting for what is right no matter how difficult the challenge or ominous the odds. It was--quite simply--an honor to call him my friend and my colleague. To have fought with him for 30 years has given my own time in this body a special meaning. I have passed along my condolences to his family--his wife Jay, his daughters Shelly, Angela, and Lori, and his son Chuck Stokes, an Editorial Director with Detroit's WXYZ News. I thank them for sharing Lou with those who loved him and a country that needed him. Congressman Louis Stokes left behind a record of accomplishment that will continue to benefit the people of Cleveland, the American public, and this body for many years. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1376] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF REP.

LOUIS STOKES ______ HON. JOHN CONYERS, JR. of michigan in the house of representatives Monday, September 28, 2015 Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, tonight, it is an honor to stand before you all and celebrate the life of my good friend, Congressman Lou Stokes. Lou was a highly honored member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. He was a decorated veteran who served in the U.S. Army during World War II. He was one of the original founders of the Congressional Black Caucus, and later its chair from 1972-1974. We will miss him here in Congress and across the country--he gave us all so much. Lou lived his life with an unrelenting optimism--he knew his country could be a better place, and he never ceased to join in that struggle. He shared that quality that so many great men and women possess: a fierce, unrelenting, desire to bring about change. In 1967, Lou followed that conviction to the U.S. Supreme Court, where he argued for the petitioner in Terry v. Ohio, which established the standards under which a police officer may stop a citizen. Less than a year later, he became the first African-American in Ohio elected to the United States House of Representatives. On Jan. 3, 1969 he took his seat in the House, just a year and three days after his brother--Carl Stokes--was elected Mayor of Cleveland and the first African-American mayor of a major city. He was a distinguished member of this body, serving on the Appropriations Committee for many years. He also served as Chairman of the House Select Committee on Assassinations, investigating the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Dr. Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., and as Chairman of the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, now the House Ethics Committee. If there was one thing you knew about Lou, it was that you could find him fighting for what is right no matter how difficult the challenge or ominous the odds. It was--quite simply--an honor to call him my friend and my colleague. To have fought with him for 30 years has given my own time in this body a special meaning.

JOYCE BEATTY of ohio in the house of representatives Monday, September 28, 2015 Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, last week His Holiness Pope Francis addressed a Joint Session of Congress--an address that I, like many, found to be both profound and provocative. Pope Francis' first visit to our country coincided with a time when our nation as he stated, is ``marking the anniversaries of several great Americans'', including Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who fifty years ago led the Selma-to-Montgomery marches in order to achieve full civil and political rights for African-Americans. These marches culminated in the enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which offered African-Americans a piece of Dr. King's dream of equality, fairness, and justice. Yet, our nation continues to struggle with ensuring racial equality and voter enfranchisement; we have, as Pope Francis stated at the White House last week, ``defaulted on a promissory note'', but now is the time to honor it.'' Let us continue to strive to follow the advice of Pope Francis and as envisioned by Dr. King--``to foster a culture which enables people to dream of full rights for all our brothers and sisters, instead of creating one which limits opportunity and growth.'' We could take a big step in that direction by passing the bipartisan Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2015, H.R. 885. I urge all of my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation and urge the Republican Leadership to bring it to the floor for a vote without delay. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 140 (Monday, September 28, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1376] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] POPE FRANCIS' VISIT AND CALL TO DEFEND AND PRESERVE THE DIGNITY OF ALL ______ HON.
