Madam President, we live in an incredibly dangerous world. The number of threats facing our Nation is simply staggering. That is one reason both parties actually came together to pass the national defense authorization bill through both Chambers by very large bipartisan margins. In the Senate, it was 71 to 25; in the House, 269 to 151. A bipartisan committee then worked to merge both Chambers' bills into one. Republicans on the committee supported that unified Defense bill. Democrats on the committee also supported that unified Defense bill. The House already passed the unified legislation, and we will vote on it here tomorrow. Americans have every reason to expect that Democrats will vote again to support--not block--America's national defense authorization bill. And yet, at a time when the United States faces numerous conventional, cyber, and terror threats, the Obama administration is goading Democrats into opposing the very legislation that sets out defense policy and authorizes funds for our military. Democrats just voted to pass America's national defense bill this summer. Now they might filibuster it? This is part of a pattern that should be worrying to all of us. Just consider what we have seen already. The Senate passed a bipartisan veterans funding bill out of the Committee on Appropriations. Democrats voted for and praised the bill at that time; then they filibustered it. The Senate passed a bipartisan defense funding bill out of the Committee on Appropriations. Democrats voted for and praised the bill at that time; then they filibustered it twice. This really hasn't stopped, Madam President. These are serious times.

CREC-2015-10-05-pt1-PgS7109-7,CREC-2015-10-05,114,REMEMBERING JANICE SHELTON,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 145 (Monday, October 5, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7109-S7110] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING JANICE SHELTON Mr. REID. Madam President, at about a quarter to eleven this morning, one of my friends passed away. Her name was Janice Shelton. She was a fixture in the Senate. She worked in the Senate for more than three decades, but the reason I feel so bad this afternoon is that Janice worked for me. Janice Shelton worked for me for 25 years. She was such a good person. She ran my office, and that is an understatement. Janice was born in Virginia, in Warrenton. She graduated from Mt. Vernon High School in Alexandria and attended Northern Virginia Community College. She was married to Robert Shelton for 61 years. They have two daughters, Robin LeCroy and Laurie Nelson. They have eight grandchildren in total, two of whom I know well. Shelton Nelson worked for me. Well, I shouldn't say he worked for me. I got to know him very well. I read the papers every Sunday to find out how his football team had done. He was a huge offensive lineman. He weighed more than 300 pounds, all solid muscle. His brother Chris, who is 6 foot 4, was a stunningly good baseball pitcher, also at the college level. Rebecca and Holly worked in the Senate as Senate pages. And they have four great-grandchildren. Janice started her career working with the Department of the Army. She worked in the Carter White House in the Office of Domestic Policy. She worked in the Reagan White House. She then moved to the Senate in 1981, working as an executive assistant. She worked for Paula Hawkins of Florida for 6 years and worked for Senator Mikulski for 1 year and then worked for me for 25 years. She left maybe less than 3 years ago and moved to North Carolina to be near her two daughters, one of whom now lives in Atlanta. Janice spent her professional career creating order where chaos could easily have been. In my office everyone knew [[Page S7110]] Janice Shelton. She ran that place so well and was so polite, yet so firm, in what she would allow to happen and not happen. There was no bad language. She had a little cup, and if people used bad language, they had to put money in it. She was so gracious and so kind, and she had unbelievable energy. It didn't matter what the job was, big or small, Janice could handle that job. She was a stenographer, but she was a person who could handle the most difficult administrative situation, and she was a woman of tremendous faith. Janice had a love affair with her husband Bobby for a long time. I remember Bobby, with that southern accent of his. When Bobby was still in business around here, he would bother his morning breakfast crowd by wearing T-shirts of mine. He ran with a kind of conservative crowd, and my T-shirt didn't fit in very well all the time. But she and Bobby were so loyal to me. Janice was good to my family. She knew every one of my children and knew my grandchildren. She suffered with the bad times that we had. I remember I was heavily involved in the final stages of the Obama health care bill when she walked into my office and said: I have to talk to you. She told me my wife had been in a very bad automobile accident. She, of course, was available anytime she was needed to help Landra or me with things--those personal things you can't have just anyone help you with; it had to be somebody like Janice. Janice's desk was right outside my office door. She was a fixture there. She was there all the time that I was. Whatever my hours were in the Senate, those were her hours. And I mean that without anything other than the truth. If I was there until 10 o'clock, she was there until 10 o'clock. Often, after I would go home at night, I would call back and say: Janice, why are you still there? And she would say: Well, I still have a few things to do. I have missed Janice now for almost 3 years. I talked to her as often as I could. I am going to truly miss her now. She will leave a tremendous void in my heart. I am going to call my kids later today--I haven't done it yet because I haven't had time for anything--and tell them about Janice's passing. I wish words could convey to everyone within the sound of my voice what a wonderful human being Janice Shelton was. I will miss her. The impact she has made in my life and my wife's life will be there forever. Two of my staff came into my office separately and broke down in tears about Janice no longer being with us. She created such loyalty, such admiration for her hard work and professionalism. I love Janice Shelton and always will. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 145 (Monday, October 5, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7109-S7110] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING JANICE SHELTON Mr. REID.

CREC-2015-10-05-pt1-PgS7110,CREC-2015-10-05,114,MASS SHOOTING AT UMPQUA COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND GUN VIOLENCE IN AMERICA,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 145 (Monday, October 5, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7110-S7111] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MASS SHOOTING AT UMPQUA COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND GUN VIOLENCE IN AMERICA Mr. REID. Madam President, just a few days ago--last Thursday--our great Nation witnessed another tragedy. While preparing these remarks, we were trying to come up with what we should say, and ``tragedy'' doesn't quite convey how horrible that mass killing was in Oregon. Once again, a young man was able to obtain an arsenal of guns and end the lives of innocent people. Nine men and women woke up Thursday morning, all to attend a community college, but they were assaulted and killed in a demented, sadistic killing ritual. Lucero Alcaraz, age 19; Treven Taylor Anspach, age 20; Rebecka Ann Carnes, age 18; Quinn Glen Cooper, age 18; Kim Saltmarsh Dietz, 59 years old; Lucas Eibel, 18 years old; Jason Dale Johnson, 34; Lawrence Levine, 67; Sarena Dawn Moore, 44--all victims of a deranged gunman's murderous attack. Madam President, our hearts are broken for the families and loved ones of the victims and for this whole community of Roseburg, but a broken heart isn't enough, is it. This senseless act of gun violence is not an isolated tragedy. Communities all around our Nation are shattered daily by these cruel and undeserved acts of gun violence. The reality of gun violence in the United States is not only shocking; it is pathetic. Every day, gun violence claims the lives of 30 Americans. Tomorrow at this time, 4:15--24 hours from now--about 30 more Americans will be killed by guns. And 11,000 Americans are murdered with guns each year. This year alone, we have had 200 mass shootings--200. Anywhere else in the world these alarming facts would prompt action. Sadly, here in the United States we have become so desensitized to the lives taken every day by guns that our response is to do nothing--to do nothing. Each time gun violence claims a life in America, the Nation follows the same routine. Here is what it is. The same thing happens. We have shock and sorrow. Then we start asking questions. Who did that? Who was the killer? We usually have to wait a few hours to find out who it was. Why did they do this? Why did they carry out this horrible act? Then we wonder aloud, when the time allows it: What could we as a nation have done to prevent this terrible thing from happening? But we don't do anything. We don't act. It is within our power to reduce gun violence in this Nation and prevent mass shootings--not all of them but some of them, a few of them. We know these tragic events almost always occur in instances where somebody is unstable or they are terribly violent, and they are able to get a gun easily and use it to carry out these terrible attacks. We know this, yet we fail to pass improved Federal laws placing distance between mentally ill, violent people and guns. Instead of taking action, lawmakers all around this country pander to the extreme rightwing gun lobby and leave Americans vulnerable to these attacks. This year alone there have been more than 200 mass shootings-- this year. The United States is the global leader in mass shootings-- this great Nation. Can't we raise standards in this country for gun purchases? The answer of course is yes. We can do it while not infringing on the rights to restrict access to firearms but to keep Americans safe. Let's not mince words about who would stop us from passing background checks: Republicans who wage a rightwing ideological crusade fashioned by the National Rifle Association and Gun Owners of America. These two organizations are in a scramble of who can raise the most money. That is what it is all about. If one of them does something, the other will do better than that. Each request comes with ``Can you send some money?'' This rightwing ideological crusade, fashioned by the NRA and Gun Owners of America, is to prevent background checks to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists, criminals, and the mentally ill. The National Rifle Association is a far cry from the sportsmen's organization it once was. The NRA once called mandatory background checks ``reasonable.'' That is what they said. Now it uses its energies and its members' dues to fight against even the most sensible reforms. In opposition to this deadly agenda, Democrats have long sought to strengthen background checks. But instead of joining Democrats in finding ways to protect American lives, Republicans have pledged their loyalty to what was once a moderate sportsmen's organization. Times have changed. Now the NRA and its leadership are committed to a radical agenda that allows criminals and mentally ill Americans to access guns and commit these terrible acts. Is this what the American people elected us to do? I think not. Is this the protection they want or deserve? I think not. Americans are smarter than that. They deserve better than that. The majority of people who belong to the NRA believe there should be background checks to stop people who are mentally unstable and are criminals from buying guns, and 90 percent of gun owners believe there should be background checks, including 86 percent of Republicans. But even in the face of overwhelming public support, Republicans still refuse to join Democrats in taking steps to implement background checks that could save the lives of countless Americans. We have witnessed the consequence of inaction too often. Why do I say that? This is over a period of many, many years--now decades: Fort Hood, 13 Americans killed; Tucson, 6 Americans killed; Carson City, 4 Americans killed; Newtown, 27 Americans killed, including 22 babies, little tiny children; Aurora, 12 Americans killed; the Navy Yard, here in DC, 12 Americans killed; Charleston, 9 Americans killed while worshipping; Moneta, VA, 2 journalists shot to death on live television; and now there is the massacre at Umpqua Community College, 9 dead. [[Page S7111]] These tragic events have shattered the lives of too many families. The shooter was armed with 6 firearms and loads of ammunition, and when they came to his home they found at least 14 guns--and another gun. I thought it was only 14, but, no, they found another one. So add them up--15 plus 6, or 21 guns--21 guns. We do not yet know why this young man murdered these innocent people in cold blood. But what does it say about our country that it is willing to stand by, idle, while these tragedies happen, happen, happen? Smarter gun laws in this country are long overdue. The lives of these men, women, babies, and children are at stake. How many more innocent lives must be taken before we are willing to act? How many more communities and families' lives will be shattered? How many more sacred places of worship will be violently attacked? How many more colleges or schools will be terrorized and forever traumatized by gun violence? How many more Americans will we mourn? How many more solemn statements, speeches of condemnation, and frank discussions must take place? What will it take before we stand up as a nation and say: Enough, not another innocent American will fall victim to this ideological crusade of having more guns and more guns and more guns. If we don't take action, we are equally responsible for innocent deaths as are the sick individuals who plot and carry out these horrific massacres. I have started reaching out to Senators and talking about what can be done to advance the cause of background checks while Republicans are in charge for the next year or so. But one thing is clear. To pass background checks, we need Republicans to stop acting as puppets for the NRA. Madam President, would the Presiding Officer announce what the schedule is for the rest of the day. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 145 (Monday, October 5, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7110-S7111] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MASS SHOOTING AT UMPQUA COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND GUN VIOLENCE IN AMERICA Mr. REID.

Instead of taking action, lawmakers all around this country pander to the extreme rightwing gun lobby and leave Americans vulnerable to these attacks. This year alone there have been more than 200 mass shootings-- this year. The United States is the global leader in mass shootings-- this great Nation. Can't we raise standards in this country for gun purchases? The answer of course is yes. We can do it while not infringing on the rights to restrict access to firearms but to keep Americans safe. Let's not mince words about who would stop us from passing background checks: Republicans who wage a rightwing ideological crusade fashioned by the National Rifle Association and Gun Owners of America. These two organizations are in a scramble of who can raise the most money. That is what it is all about. If one of them does something, the other will do better than that. Each request comes with ``Can you send some money?'' This rightwing ideological crusade, fashioned by the NRA and Gun Owners of America, is to prevent background checks to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists, criminals, and the mentally ill. The National Rifle Association is a far cry from the sportsmen's organization it once was. The NRA once called mandatory background checks ``reasonable.'' That is what they said. Now it uses its energies and its members' dues to fight against even the most sensible reforms. In opposition to this deadly agenda, Democrats have long sought to strengthen background checks. But instead of joining Democrats in finding ways to protect American lives, Republicans have pledged their loyalty to what was once a moderate sportsmen's organization. Times have changed. Now the NRA and its leadership are committed to a radical agenda that allows criminals and mentally ill Americans to access guns and commit these terrible acts. Is this what the American people elected us to do? I think not. Is this the protection they want or deserve? I think not. Americans are smarter than that. They deserve better than that. The majority of people who belong to the NRA believe there should be background checks to stop people who are mentally unstable and are criminals from buying guns, and 90 percent of gun owners believe there should be background checks, including 86 percent of Republicans. But even in the face of overwhelming public support, Republicans still refuse to join Democrats in taking steps to implement background checks that could save the lives of countless Americans. We have witnessed the consequence of inaction too often. Why do I say that? This is over a period of many, many years--now decades: Fort Hood, 13 Americans killed; Tucson, 6 Americans killed; Carson City, 4 Americans killed; Newtown, 27 Americans killed, including 22 babies, little tiny children; Aurora, 12 Americans killed; the Navy Yard, here in DC, 12 Americans killed; Charleston, 9 Americans killed while worshipping; Moneta, VA, 2 journalists shot to death on live television; and now there is the massacre at Umpqua Community College, 9 dead. [[Page S7111]] These tragic events have shattered the lives of too many families. The shooter was armed with 6 firearms and loads of ammunition, and when they came to his home they found at least 14 guns--and another gun. I thought it was only 14, but, no, they found another one. So add them up--15 plus 6, or 21 guns--21 guns. We do not yet know why this young man murdered these innocent people in cold blood. But what does it say about our country that it is willing to stand by, idle, while these tragedies happen, happen, happen? Smarter gun laws in this country are long overdue. The lives of these men, women, babies, and children are at stake. How many more innocent lives must be taken before we are willing to act? How many more communities and families' lives will be shattered? How many more sacred places of worship will be violently attacked? How many more colleges or schools will be terrorized and forever traumatized by gun violence? How many more Americans will we mourn? How many more solemn statements, speeches of condemnation, and frank discussions must take place? What will it take before we stand up as a nation and say: Enough, not another innocent American will fall victim to this ideological crusade of having more guns and more guns and more guns. If we don't take action, we are equally responsible for innocent deaths as are the sick individuals who plot and carry out these horrific massacres. I have started reaching out to Senators and talking about what can be done to advance the cause of background checks while Republicans are in charge for the next year or so. But one thing is clear. To pass background checks, we need Republicans to stop acting as puppets for the NRA.

Madam President, just a few days ago--last Thursday--our great Nation witnessed another tragedy. While preparing these remarks, we were trying to come up with what we should say, and ``tragedy'' doesn't quite convey how horrible that mass killing was in Oregon. Once again, a young man was able to obtain an arsenal of guns and end the lives of innocent people. Nine men and women woke up Thursday morning, all to attend a community college, but they were assaulted and killed in a demented, sadistic killing ritual. Lucero Alcaraz, age 19; Treven Taylor Anspach, age 20; Rebecka Ann Carnes, age 18; Quinn Glen Cooper, age 18; Kim Saltmarsh Dietz, 59 years old; Lucas Eibel, 18 years old; Jason Dale Johnson, 34; Lawrence Levine, 67; Sarena Dawn Moore, 44--all victims of a deranged gunman's murderous attack. Madam President, our hearts are broken for the families and loved ones of the victims and for this whole community of Roseburg, but a broken heart isn't enough, is it. This senseless act of gun violence is not an isolated tragedy. Communities all around our Nation are shattered daily by these cruel and undeserved acts of gun violence. The reality of gun violence in the United States is not only shocking; it is pathetic. Every day, gun violence claims the lives of 30 Americans. Tomorrow at this time, 4:15--24 hours from now--about 30 more Americans will be killed by guns. And 11,000 Americans are murdered with guns each year. This year alone, we have had 200 mass shootings--200. Anywhere else in the world these alarming facts would prompt action. Sadly, here in the United States we have become so desensitized to the lives taken every day by guns that our response is to do nothing--to do nothing. Each time gun violence claims a life in America, the Nation follows the same routine. Here is what it is. The same thing happens. We have shock and sorrow. Then we start asking questions. Who did that? Who was the killer? We usually have to wait a few hours to find out who it was. Why did they do this? Why did they carry out this horrible act? Then we wonder aloud, when the time allows it: What could we as a nation have done to prevent this terrible thing from happening? But we don't do anything. We don't act. It is within our power to reduce gun violence in this Nation and prevent mass shootings--not all of them but some of them, a few of them. We know these tragic events almost always occur in instances where somebody is unstable or they are terribly violent, and they are able to get a gun easily and use it to carry out these terrible attacks. We know this, yet we fail to pass improved Federal laws placing distance between mentally ill, violent people and guns.

CREC-2015-10-05-pt1-PgS7111-3,CREC-2015-10-05,114,NOMINATION OBJECTION,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 145 (Monday, October 5, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7111-S7113] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NOMINATION OBJECTION Mr. COTTON. Madam President, our Founders designed a constitutional government powerful enough to defend against all threats, foreign and domestic, yet safe enough itself not to threaten our liberty. The separation of powers is a primary feature of our Constitution. Our Founders knew that encroachment by the executive onto the legislature, or vice versa, isn't only a political dispute but ultimately a threat to the freedom of all Americans. Thus they provided both branches with checks and balances to prevent such encroachment. Late last week, we learned shocking news. Armed agents of the executive violated the law to intimidate a Congressman from doing his job. This is exactly the kind of encroachment against which our Founders warned. The executive hasn't yet acted with anything like the gravity this matter deserves. Until it does, I intend to use the powers of my office to demand action and to protect our constitutional order. Let me say more about the shocking news. In an inspector general report issued last week, we learned that dozens of Secret Service employees illegally accessed the personnel file of Representative Jason Chaffetz. More than a decade ago, Congressman Chaffetz applied to the Secret Service; he was not hired. Now he is the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. In late March of this year, the committee held an important oversight hearing into a serious misconduct by Secret Service agents. Mere minutes into the hearing, an agent at the Secret Service's Washington office illegally searched the Service's database, which contains all manner of criminal, security, investigative, personnel, and other data. The agent discovered Congressman Chaffetz's old job application. This search was a blatant violation of the Privacy Act, about which the computer-based system explicitly warns on a prompt screen. The agent admitted conducting the search simply out of curiosity, presumably because Congressman Chaffetz was conducting an oversight hearing. Far from an isolated incident, word quickly spread throughout the Secret Service, and 45 employees accessed Congressman Chaffetz's records over the next week on 60 different occasions. These employees were located around the world, from London to Sacramento, in multiple headquarter offices, even on Bill Clinton's protective detail. The inspector general could identify only four instances of potentially legitimate access. Moreover, the inspector general concludes that the information was shared with hundreds of people--each a violation of the Privacy Act. Some employees realized their mistake and self-reported to their supervisor, according to the inspector general. While these employees indeed made a serious mistake, at least they owned up to it. Others remained defiant, saying they didn't read the warning banner or even claiming a right to satisfy personal curiosity because the personnel files are ``our database.'' Let me state for the record my admiration for the vast majority of Secret Service agents, officers, and other professionals. We saw their professionalism on display again last month during Pope Francis's visit and at the U.N. General Assembly. They are dedicated professionals who risk their lives to defend our Constitution and laws. Indeed, Secret Service whistleblowers aware of this situation helped to initiate the inspector general investigation. Like the soldiers with whom I served in the Army, the upstanding men and women of the Secret Service want to get rid of their bad apples more than anyone. Unfortunately, the senior leaders at the Secret Service once again failed their people. The inspector general identified 18 supervisors who knew or should have known of the illegal searches and disclosures. With but one exception, the inspector general found no evidence that these senior managers reported the matter up the chain of command or took steps to stop or remedy it. These leadership failures went all the way to the top. One example is Deputy Director Craig Magaw. When briefed by a subordinate, Mr. Magaw reportedly ``made a shooing hand motion and stated `Yeah, yeah we know.' '' Despite the gravity of the allegations, Mr. Magaw apparently took no steps to learn more or stop the illegal activity, and he claims not to recall this exchange. Another example is Chief of Staff Michael Biermann, whom the inspector general characterizes as the de facto gatekeeper for Director Joe Clancy and Deputy Director Magaw. Mr. Biermann admits to hearing rampant rumors about the Chaffetz matter within 24 hours of the hearing. Yet he also apparently didn't inquire any further to learn the truth or take action to stop illegal activity. The most egregious example of leadership failure in the inspector general report is Assistant Director Ed Lowery, the head of training for the Secret Service. Mr. Lowery wrote in this email about Congressman Chaffetz, ``Some information that he might find embarrassing needs to get out. Just to be fair.'' Lo and behold, 2 days later, a news Web site ran an article-- unsourced--about Congressman Chaffetz's decade-old job application to the Secret Service. I wonder who the source could have been. For that matter, I wonder if this kind of attitude from the head of training explains some of the Secret Service's recent struggles. There is even more egregious behavior not in the inspector general report. Thanks to a Friday afternoon news dump, we now know that Director Joe Clancy himself both knew of the Chaffetz matter at the time and misrepresented the facts to the inspector [[Page S7112]] general. In the report, Director Clancy states he didn't learn about the matter until a week after the congressional hearing, on the eve of a Washington Post story about the matter. As we have seen, this would have made him a notable exception among the Secret Service's top leaders. But Director Clancy, confronted with this report, is now singing a different tune. He now admits that he heard of a ``speculative rumor'' the day after the hearing and a week before the Washington Post story. Yet Director Clancy says he considered the rumor ``not credible'' and ``not indicative'' of wrongful conduct. That admission alone is a damning and ironic confession of a gross leadership failure. Let's put this in context. Director Clancy was specifically hired just months earlier to clean up the Secret Service's leadership culture after a string of embarrassing incidents. At the very congressional hearing that started all of this, Director Clancy testified that he was ``infuriated'' that he hadn't been made aware of the latest security lapse. He further testified that he was ``working furiously to try to break down these barriers where people feel they can't talk up the chain.'' Despite all that, despite all the problems he was specifically hired to fix, despite hearing rumors that obviously should have triggered immediate investigation, he did nothing for a full week to look into the matter and put a stop to it, which he only did once the story hit the Washington Post. How could this happen? How could someone hired to change the culture of his agency be so indifferent to potential illegal activity and to such a constitutional affront to the legislature that he did nothing-- absolutely nothing--until the press broke the story? To make matters worse, Director Clancy misrepresented all of it to the inspector general until the report was released last Wednesday. If anything remotely like this happened in the Army, commanders would have been relieved of command months ago. The Army holds its leaders responsible for everything their unit does and fails to do, and we should expect no less from the Secret Service leadership. Jason Chaffetz and I served together in the House. He is a tough, smart guy, more than capable of standing up for himself, although I should say this is not a partisan matter. I would feel the same way and give the same speech if Secret Service employees violated the law to intimidate Representative Elijah Cummings, chairman Chaffetz's Democratic counterpart. Of course, for that matter, how do we know they didn't? But since I am neither in the House any longer nor on the committees that oversee the Secret Service or Homeland Security, why am I so outraged by the Secret Service or Homeland Security? Why am I so outraged by the Secret Service's misconduct in this matter? First, if Secret Service personnel will violate the law to intimidate and retaliate against the chairman of their oversight committee, what might they do to a normal Arkansan, to the little guy who doesn't have Chairman Chaffetz's megaphone and position of influence? What might renegade bureaucrats in other agencies do? Second, these abuses are far more than yet another example of government misconduct; they strike at the heart of our constitutional order. Although troubled by Secret Service lapses like the Colombian prostitute scandal, I haven't spoken out on these matters, believing my peers on the oversight committee could handle them, as they did. This case, though, goes far beyond simple misbehavior, even beyond violations of law. To reiterate, armed agents of a paramilitary law enforcement agency violated the law to intimidate the Congressman charged with oversight of that agency. The gravity of this scandal hasn't thus far been met with appropriate action from the highest levels of the executive branch. Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson stated last week that he is ``confident U.S. Secret Service Director Joe Clancy will take appropriate action to hold accountable those who violated any laws or policies of this Department.'' This response is woefully inadequate on multiple counts. First, when an abuse of power strikes at the heart of our constitutional order, it warrants at a minimum the attention of a Senate-confirmed department Secretary. Second, Secretary Johnson implies there may be some doubt about whether laws were broken. In fact, the inspector general identified no fewer than 56 instances of blatant illegal activity. Third, Director Clancy cannot be trusted to handle this matter given what we know now, although, to give Secretary Johnson the benefit of the doubt on this count, he issued this statement before Director Clancy's Friday afternoon admission of misrepresenting the facts to the inspector general. Responsibility for a constitutional confrontation such as this calls for a Presidential response. Yet President Obama has been silent. His spokesman last week acted as if an apology was enough and implied that it was really just a matter of procedures not being followed--as if there are appropriate procedures for the executive to violate the law to intimidate a Member of the legislature. He even suggested that the response thus far ``is a strong indication that there is effective leadership in place at the Secret Service.'' Effective at what, one must ask? This indifferent response is far short of what this situation demands. First, Secretary Johnson must take appropriate disciplinary action against all Secret Service personnel involved, including Director Joe Clancy, Deputy Director Craig Magaw, Chief of Staff Michael Biermann, and Assistant Director Ed Lowery. I invite Secretary Johnson to brief not only me but the entire Congress. Once he makes his decision about appropriate action--for instance, firings, revocation of security clearances, removal from supervisory positions or suspension-- he can explain his own reasoning. Congress can then decide whether this discipline is adequate. Most immediately, if it turns out that Director Clancy knowingly misled the inspector general, he should resign or be fired. He was hired to clean up wrongdoing at the Secret Service, not perpetrate it and cover it up. Second, and independent of workplace discipline, the Attorney General must start a criminal investigation of the Secret Service personnel who unlawfully accessed Congressman Chaffetz's personnel file and who disseminated its contents. Criminal violations of the Privacy Act and other statutes must be punished. The inspector general lacks criminal authority, and it is unclear from his report if he was able to take certain key steps, such as obtaining personal emails and phone records. Further, Secret Service officials sat in many of the interviews the inspector general conducted, raising genuine questions about improper influence in the process. What is needed is a vigorous and disinterested criminal investigation by a single Federal prosecutor at the Justice Department. Senators often make requests for action from the executive branch, which are almost as often ignored. Let me say for the record that these aren't requests; these are demands. They are quite modest demands, given these most serious constitutional stakes. Take and explain appropriate disciplinary action and start a criminal investigation. Until then, I will be compelled to act by exercising our constitutional authority over executive branch nominations. Every officer of the United States, from the President to the newest clerk, must understand that Congress will fend off this kind of executive encroachment and there will be severe consequences for attempting to intimidate the people's elected representatives or obstructing us from doing our jobs. I am not yet at the point of calling for a total blockade on all executive branch nominations, although I may reach that point. Right before this speech, though, I did register an objection to three prominent political nominations and there will be more to follow if the executive branch doesn't act swiftly. None of these are nominees to the Department of Homeland Security, partly because the Department has no pending nominees but mostly because this is a constitutional question, not a parochial matter about a single department. I take this step reluctantly and with no particular quarrel with these three nominations or future ones to which I might be compelled to object. I do not [[Page S7113]] wish to prolong this dispute, only to defend our constitutional order. When President Obama and Secretary Johnson take appropriate action, I will likewise take action and release these and future objections. I hope our two branches can resolve this confrontation quickly and in keeping with our constitutional traditions. The American people deserve no less. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 145 (Monday, October 5, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7111-S7113] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NOMINATION OBJECTION Mr. COTTON.

The agent discovered Congressman Chaffetz's old job application. This search was a blatant violation of the Privacy Act, about which the computer-based system explicitly warns on a prompt screen. The agent admitted conducting the search simply out of curiosity, presumably because Congressman Chaffetz was conducting an oversight hearing. Far from an isolated incident, word quickly spread throughout the Secret Service, and 45 employees accessed Congressman Chaffetz's records over the next week on 60 different occasions. These employees were located around the world, from London to Sacramento, in multiple headquarter offices, even on Bill Clinton's protective detail. The inspector general could identify only four instances of potentially legitimate access. Moreover, the inspector general concludes that the information was shared with hundreds of people--each a violation of the Privacy Act. Some employees realized their mistake and self-reported to their supervisor, according to the inspector general. While these employees indeed made a serious mistake, at least they owned up to it. Others remained defiant, saying they didn't read the warning banner or even claiming a right to satisfy personal curiosity because the personnel files are ``our database.'' Let me state for the record my admiration for the vast majority of Secret Service agents, officers, and other professionals. We saw their professionalism on display again last month during Pope Francis's visit and at the U.N. General Assembly. They are dedicated professionals who risk their lives to defend our Constitution and laws. Indeed, Secret Service whistleblowers aware of this situation helped to initiate the inspector general investigation. Like the soldiers with whom I served in the Army, the upstanding men and women of the Secret Service want to get rid of their bad apples more than anyone. Unfortunately, the senior leaders at the Secret Service once again failed their people. The inspector general identified 18 supervisors who knew or should have known of the illegal searches and disclosures. With but one exception, the inspector general found no evidence that these senior managers reported the matter up the chain of command or took steps to stop or remedy it. These leadership failures went all the way to the top. One example is Deputy Director Craig Magaw. When briefed by a subordinate, Mr. Magaw reportedly ``made a shooing hand motion and stated `Yeah, yeah we know.' '' Despite the gravity of the allegations, Mr. Magaw apparently took no steps to learn more or stop the illegal activity, and he claims not to recall this exchange. Another example is Chief of Staff Michael Biermann, whom the inspector general characterizes as the de facto gatekeeper for Director Joe Clancy and Deputy Director Magaw. Mr. Biermann admits to hearing rampant rumors about the Chaffetz matter within 24 hours of the hearing. Yet he also apparently didn't inquire any further to learn the truth or take action to stop illegal activity. The most egregious example of leadership failure in the inspector general report is Assistant Director Ed Lowery, the head of training for the Secret Service. Mr. Lowery wrote in this email about Congressman Chaffetz, ``Some information that he might find embarrassing needs to get out. Just to be fair.'' Lo and behold, 2 days later, a news Web site ran an article-- unsourced--about Congressman Chaffetz's decade-old job application to the Secret Service. I wonder who the source could have been. For that matter, I wonder if this kind of attitude from the head of training explains some of the Secret Service's recent struggles. There is even more egregious behavior not in the inspector general report. Thanks to a Friday afternoon news dump, we now know that Director Joe Clancy himself both knew of the Chaffetz matter at the time and misrepresented the facts to the inspector [[Page S7112]] general. In the report, Director Clancy states he didn't learn about the matter until a week after the congressional hearing, on the eve of a Washington Post story about the matter. As we have seen, this would have made him a notable exception among the Secret Service's top leaders. But Director Clancy, confronted with this report, is now singing a different tune. He now admits that he heard of a ``speculative rumor'' the day after the hearing and a week before the Washington Post story. Yet Director Clancy says he considered the rumor ``not credible'' and ``not indicative'' of wrongful conduct. That admission alone is a damning and ironic confession of a gross leadership failure. Let's put this in context. Director Clancy was specifically hired just months earlier to clean up the Secret Service's leadership culture after a string of embarrassing incidents. At the very congressional hearing that started all of this, Director Clancy testified that he was ``infuriated'' that he hadn't been made aware of the latest security lapse. He further testified that he was ``working furiously to try to break down these barriers where people feel they can't talk up the chain.'' Despite all that, despite all the problems he was specifically hired to fix, despite hearing rumors that obviously should have triggered immediate investigation, he did nothing for a full week to look into the matter and put a stop to it, which he only did once the story hit the Washington Post. How could this happen? How could someone hired to change the culture of his agency be so indifferent to potential illegal activity and to such a constitutional affront to the legislature that he did nothing-- absolutely nothing--until the press broke the story? To make matters worse, Director Clancy misrepresented all of it to the inspector general until the report was released last Wednesday. If anything remotely like this happened in the Army, commanders would have been relieved of command months ago. The Army holds its leaders responsible for everything their unit does and fails to do, and we should expect no less from the Secret Service leadership. Jason Chaffetz and I served together in the House. He is a tough, smart guy, more than capable of standing up for himself, although I should say this is not a partisan matter. I would feel the same way and give the same speech if Secret Service employees violated the law to intimidate Representative Elijah Cummings, chairman Chaffetz's Democratic counterpart. Of course, for that matter, how do we know they didn't? But since I am neither in the House any longer nor on the committees that oversee the Secret Service or Homeland Security, why am I so outraged by the Secret Service or Homeland Security? Why am I so outraged by the Secret Service's misconduct in this matter? First, if Secret Service personnel will violate the law to intimidate and retaliate against the chairman of their oversight committee, what might they do to a normal Arkansan, to the little guy who doesn't have Chairman Chaffetz's megaphone and position of influence? What might renegade bureaucrats in other agencies do? Second, these abuses are far more than yet another example of government misconduct; they strike at the heart of our constitutional order. Although troubled by Secret Service lapses like the Colombian prostitute scandal, I haven't spoken out on these matters, believing my peers on the oversight committee could handle them, as they did. This case, though, goes far beyond simple misbehavior, even beyond violations of law. To reiterate, armed agents of a paramilitary law enforcement agency violated the law to intimidate the Congressman charged with oversight of that agency. The gravity of this scandal hasn't thus far been met with appropriate action from the highest levels of the executive branch. Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson stated last week that he is ``confident U.S. Secret Service Director Joe Clancy will take appropriate action to hold accountable those who violated any laws or policies of this Department.'' This response is woefully inadequate on multiple counts. First, when an abuse of power strikes at the heart of our constitutional order, it warrants at a minimum the attention of a Senate-confirmed department Secretary. Second, Secretary Johnson implies there may be some doubt about whether laws were broken. In fact, the inspector general identified no fewer than 56 instances of blatant illegal activity. Third, Director Clancy cannot be trusted to handle this matter given what we know now, although, to give Secretary Johnson the benefit of the doubt on this count, he issued this statement before Director Clancy's Friday afternoon admission of misrepresenting the facts to the inspector general. Responsibility for a constitutional confrontation such as this calls for a Presidential response. Yet President Obama has been silent. His spokesman last week acted as if an apology was enough and implied that it was really just a matter of procedures not being followed--as if there are appropriate procedures for the executive to violate the law to intimidate a Member of the legislature. He even suggested that the response thus far ``is a strong indication that there is effective leadership in place at the Secret Service.'' Effective at what, one must ask? This indifferent response is far short of what this situation demands. First, Secretary Johnson must take appropriate disciplinary action against all Secret Service personnel involved, including Director Joe Clancy, Deputy Director Craig Magaw, Chief of Staff Michael Biermann, and Assistant Director Ed Lowery. I invite Secretary Johnson to brief not only me but the entire Congress. Once he makes his decision about appropriate action--for instance, firings, revocation of security clearances, removal from supervisory positions or suspension-- he can explain his own reasoning. Congress can then decide whether this discipline is adequate. Most immediately, if it turns out that Director Clancy knowingly misled the inspector general, he should resign or be fired. He was hired to clean up wrongdoing at the Secret Service, not perpetrate it and cover it up. Second, and independent of workplace discipline, the Attorney General must start a criminal investigation of the Secret Service personnel who unlawfully accessed Congressman Chaffetz's personnel file and who disseminated its contents. Criminal violations of the Privacy Act and other statutes must be punished. The inspector general lacks criminal authority, and it is unclear from his report if he was able to take certain key steps, such as obtaining personal emails and phone records. Further, Secret Service officials sat in many of the interviews the inspector general conducted, raising genuine questions about improper influence in the process. What is needed is a vigorous and disinterested criminal investigation by a single Federal prosecutor at the Justice Department. Senators often make requests for action from the executive branch, which are almost as often ignored. Let me say for the record that these aren't requests; these are demands. They are quite modest demands, given these most serious constitutional stakes. Take and explain appropriate disciplinary action and start a criminal investigation. Until then, I will be compelled to act by exercising our constitutional authority over executive branch nominations. Every officer of the United States, from the President to the newest clerk, must understand that Congress will fend off this kind of executive encroachment and there will be severe consequences for attempting to intimidate the people's elected representatives or obstructing us from doing our jobs. I am not yet at the point of calling for a total blockade on all executive branch nominations, although I may reach that point. Right before this speech, though, I did register an objection to three prominent political nominations and there will be more to follow if the executive branch doesn't act swiftly. None of these are nominees to the Department of Homeland Security, partly because the Department has no pending nominees but mostly because this is a constitutional question, not a parochial matter about a single department. I take this step reluctantly and with no particular quarrel with these three nominations or future ones to which I might be compelled to object. I do not [[Page S7113]] wish to prolong this dispute, only to defend our constitutional order. When President Obama and Secretary Johnson take appropriate action, I will likewise take action and release these and future objections. I hope our two branches can resolve this confrontation quickly and in keeping with our constitutional traditions. The American people deserve no less. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, our Founders designed a constitutional government powerful enough to defend against all threats, foreign and domestic, yet safe enough itself not to threaten our liberty. The separation of powers is a primary feature of our Constitution. Our Founders knew that encroachment by the executive onto the legislature, or vice versa, isn't only a political dispute but ultimately a threat to the freedom of all Americans. Thus they provided both branches with checks and balances to prevent such encroachment. Late last week, we learned shocking news. Armed agents of the executive violated the law to intimidate a Congressman from doing his job. This is exactly the kind of encroachment against which our Founders warned. The executive hasn't yet acted with anything like the gravity this matter deserves. Until it does, I intend to use the powers of my office to demand action and to protect our constitutional order. Let me say more about the shocking news. In an inspector general report issued last week, we learned that dozens of Secret Service employees illegally accessed the personnel file of Representative Jason Chaffetz. More than a decade ago, Congressman Chaffetz applied to the Secret Service; he was not hired. Now he is the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. In late March of this year, the committee held an important oversight hearing into a serious misconduct by Secret Service agents. Mere minutes into the hearing, an agent at the Secret Service's Washington office illegally searched the Service's database, which contains all manner of criminal, security, investigative, personnel, and other data.

this indifferent response is far short of what this situation demands. first, secretary johnson must take appropriate disciplinary action against all secret service personnel involved, including director joe clancy, deputy director craig magaw, chief of staff michael biermann, and assistant director ed lowery. i invite secretary johnson to brief not only me but the entire congress. once he makes his decision about appropriate action--for instance, firings, revocation of security clearances, removal from supervisory positions or suspension-- he can explain his own reasoning. congress can then decide whether this discipline is adequate. most immediately, if it turns out that director clancy knowingly misled the inspector general, he should resign or be fired. he was hired to clean up wrongdoing at the secret service, not perpetrate it and cover it up. second, and independent of workplace discipline, the attorney general must start a criminal investigation of the secret service personnel who unlawfully accessed congressman chaffetz's personnel file and who disseminated its contents. criminal violations of the privacy act and other statutes must be punished. the inspector general lacks criminal authority, and it is unclear from his report if he was able to take certain key steps, such as obtaining personal emails and phone records. further, secret service officials sat in many of the interviews the inspector general conducted, raising genuine questions about improper influence in the process. what is needed is a vigorous and disinterested criminal investigation by a single federal prosecutor at the justice department. senators often make requests for action from the executive branch, which are almost as often ignored. let me say for the record that these aren't requests; these are demands. they are quite modest demands, given these most serious constitutional stakes. take and explain appropriate disciplinary action and start a criminal investigation. until then, i will be compelled to act by exercising our constitutional authority over executive branch nominations. every officer of the united states, from the president to the newest clerk, must understand that congress will fend off this kind of executive encroachment and there will be severe consequences for attempting to intimidate the people's elected representatives or obstructing us from doing our jobs. i am not yet at the point of calling for a total blockade on all executive branch nominations, although i may reach that point. right before this speech, though, i did register an objection to three prominent political nominations and there will be more to follow if the executive branch doesn't act swiftly. none of these are nominees to the department of homeland security, partly because the department has no pending nominees but mostly because this is a constitutional question, not a parochial matter about a single department. i take this step reluctantly and with no particular quarrel with these three nominations or future ones to which i might be compelled to object. i do not [[page s7113]] wish to prolong this dispute, only to defend our constitutional order. when president obama and secretary johnson take appropriate action, i will likewise take action and release these and future objections. i hope our two branches can resolve this confrontation quickly and in keeping with our constitutional traditions. the american people deserve no less. the presiding officer. the senator from connecticut. ____________________",14684

I just wanted to send my condolences to those who were impacted by the tragic mass shooting in Oregon. As many have said, as we pray for those who are fighting to survive and for the families who are grieving, we have to do more than pray. We have to stop this. I know we can't stop every single tragedy from happening, but I have to say, if you look at my home State, we have passed some very commonsense laws. We don't have a gun show loophole. That is important. If it is important to get a background check from a federally licensed dealer, it is important to get a background check at a gun show. It is important to get a Federal background check online. We have to make it harder for people who want to get guns for nefarious reasons--not to protect their families but sometimes to harm their families, harm their communities. I want to say that after Senator Feinstein and I went through one of these horrible experiences with some of our communities, we introduced a bill which would give parents and families of mentally disturbed young people a chance to go to court and intervene so that individual would not have this weaponry, because we knew in the last incident in California where a gunman came down and shot up people sitting in a cafe, that the mother was desperate to try and warn law enforcement that this was going to happen and to intervene, but there was no pathway for her to go. This bill that we call the Gun Violence Intervention Act is very simple. It says if a family member knows and believes someone in their family is mentally unstable, is buying a gun, and may well use it, give that family member a pathway forward to intervene in the situation. I don't know who could be against this because a judge will be objective. If somebody is doing it or if a mom is doing it just out of whole cloth and there is no reason, the judge will not allow it. I am proud to say that California has passed a nearly identical bill and it will go into effect in 2016. Then, in California, if you see someone in your family who you know is acting strange, who you know is making threats, who you know is buying weapons, you have the ability to intervene and take your story to a judge and prevent these kinds of tragedies. That is just one example of some of the commonsense measures we should be taking up. My heart goes out to the families, but I have to say I agree with the critics who say don't just come to the Senate floor and say your heart goes out to the families. That is not enough. So I am calling on this Senate to do something. Wednesday we are going to have a press conference that Senator Blumenthal has organized to talk about a very important but small loophole-closing he is recommending. At this time I yield the floor, and the remaining time I would give to Senator Nelson. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida. Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I am certainly going to help Senator Boxer. On the question about guns, I am an old country boy.

CREC-2015-10-05-pt1-PgS7113,CREC-2015-10-05,114,STRENGTHENING MISSING PERSONS DATABASES,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 145 (Monday, October 5, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7113-S7114] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STRENGTHENING MISSING PERSONS DATABASES Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I am here on the floor this afternoon to talk about a young man named Billy Smolinski and a law that Senator Hoeven and I are introducing on behalf of him, his family, and, quite literally, the millions of other families throughout the United States who have had to deal with the trauma, angst, and grief of a loved one gone missing. I will begin by telling everyone a little bit about Billy Smolinski. Billy's parents don't think that he is alive any longer, but they aren't sure because on August 24, 2004, at the age of 31 Billy went missing. Billy was a vibrant young man who lived in Waterbury, CT, along with his treasured dog. When he didn't respond to calls and communications from his family over the course of a number of days, his parents--and I will speak about his mother in particular, Jan Smolinski, who has been the driving force behind Billy's Law--contacted the Waterbury Police Department. The Waterbury Police Department is a great police department, and I have a lot of friends there, but even they will admit they really screwed up this case from the beginning. They told his parents that he probably didn't go missing, that he was just running away from his personal problems. One officer stated that Billy was probably ``drinking a beer somewhere in Europe.'' The Smolinskis pressed their case over and over, day after day, and after 2 weeks of asking for help from the police department, the Smolinskis were finally able get an investigation started, but it went slowly. DNA samples were submitted and lost. It took 4 years before the police department ever actually searched his car to see if there was any information about what happened to Billy. Billy's case made a lot of news in Connecticut and Waterbury, and over the course of the last few years, it has taken twists and turns, but he has never been found. His parents suspect he has been killed, but law enforcement hasn't made progress on that potential case either. Over the course of the last 11 years, Billy's parents encountered obstacle after obstacle when they tried to be helpful and participate in the investigation and search for Billy Smolinski. They came to me at that time, as their Member of Congress representing Waterbury, CT, to discuss ways in which we here in Washington could take down some of the barriers they faced. What they reluctantly found, as they became a part of this big national network of families who have had loved ones go missing, was that their story was not unique. Their story of finding obstacles at the local police department and nationally was not unique and unfortunately all too common, as they tried to figure out what happened to Billy. What they were connected into was a national network of tens of thousands of individuals who were searching for a missing loved one--a missing father, mother, brother or sister. Nationwide there are as many as 90,000 active missing persons cases at any given time, and there are some really simple things we can do to help families who are trying to find their missing loved one. Much of the attention, rightly, goes to missing children. Missing children have an entire set of laws built up around them, and for good reason, our priority lies in finding them. Law enforcement, within a matter of hours, has to post information about missing children onto national databases. There are specific campaigns waged on billboards and media outlets to immediately find missing children. But our focus on finding missing children shouldn't absolve us from the responsibility to help families such as the Smolinskis to find missing adults as well. Senator Hoeven and I have gotten together on a fairly simple piece of legislation, and I wish to talk about it today. A companion piece of legislation is being introduced in the House by my colleague in Connecticut, Representative Elizabeth Esty, and Congressman Ted Poe of Texas. I will explain what this piece of legislation does. At its foundation, it strengthens the database system that families access to try to find their missing loved one. Currently, there are two databases. One is a law enforcement database, which is called NCIC, and the other one is a public-facing database called NamUs. These two databases very often aren't talking to each other, and therein lies the primary problem this bill tries to solve. Law enforcement uploads all sorts of information onto NCIC, but the net data often doesn't get transferred over to the database that the families can access, which is called the NamUs database. Why is that important? It is important because families are the supersleuths in cases of missing persons. Families are the ones who know all of the detailed and intricate information about the circumstances of a disappearance and the identification of their loved one. I don't mean to get too gruesome, but think about this statistic. There are 40,000 sets of unidentified remains in the country today. Think about that. There are 40,000 sets of unidentified remains in the country, but because not all of that information--the detailed descriptions of those remains--is uploaded onto a database that the public can see, Billy's body may be out there somewhere, but his parents can't find him because they don't have access to the information. Unfortunately, that is the reality and the problem that we are trying to solve. If you get more information that law enforcement has onto a public database, the supersleuths--the parents, brothers, and sisters--will have more access to it. What about information that law enforcement has about an individual who has gone missing--a report of someone who has gone missing in California and whose information is not uploaded onto a database that a family who is looking for that information in New York may want? This legislation authorizes NamUs permanently in law and then requires that the two databases be connected. Law enforcement, rightly, has a concern that any information that is sensitive to an open case should remain private, and this legislation allows for the FBI to determine what information has to remain private as part of NCIC and what information goes onto the public database. But connecting those databases will give more information to families such as the Smolinskis to try and crack these 90,000 cases that are out there today. The legislation also opens up a relatively modest but important training program for police, coroners, and medical examiners to make sure they are using these databases and putting this information online. The databases don't work if the information is not getting uploaded. If the data from the coroner's office isn't up on the database, there is no way a family from across the country can access it to try to find the final resting place of their loved ones. So this legislation authorizes a small new program that would provide training to those medical examiners, coroners, and police departments to try to make sure that information is getting up on the law enforcement database, the NCIC. Remember, they put up all the information about missing kids right away, but as we heard in the case of Billy Smolinski, they often don't put that information up about missing adults. Some of these police departments are tiny. They don't have the resources to train their personnel on how to do that, and this program would allow them to get that. In the end, we can crack a lot of these cases--thousands of these cases--if we are able to simply give tools to these families so they could participate in the search and tools to law enforcement so they can talk with each other. The Smolinskis have not given up. Jan has come down to Congress to testify on behalf of Billy's Law. She has changed the practices of the Waterbury Police Department and has even gotten laws passed in Hartford to make sure [[Page S7114]] that other police departments don't make the same mistakes. She wants to make sure those mistakes aren't repeated across the country. She thinks about what would have happened if that information about Billy had been uploaded onto NCIC immediately, the day she reported it. Maybe Billy was taken to some other State. Maybe the lack of that information being transmitted that day meant that a break in the case didn't happen in those early days. She always thinks about what would have happened if she had access to more information--if the database that she looks at virtually every day, the NamUs database, had more information about missing persons and unidentified remains. She thinks about her ability to solve this case and how it could have helped the police solve this case if those databases were better or more up to date. We hope we are eventually going to solve the case of Billy Smolinski's disappearance in Connecticut, but we also hope that we can pass legislation here in both Houses--bipartisan, noncontroversial, measured, commonsense--that will assure that there are less Jan Smolinskis in the world going forward. We passed this in the House, when I was there, with a broad, big bipartisan vote. This is the first time we introduced it on a bipartisan basis here in the Senate, and I am hopeful--speaking on behalf of not just the Smolinski family, but the 90,000 other families who are grieving for a missing person--we can get this done and get it done shortly so we can get families and law enforcement the tools they need to crack more of these cases. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 145 (Monday, October 5, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7113-S7114] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STRENGTHENING MISSING PERSONS DATABASES Mr. MURPHY.

If the data from the coroner's office isn't up on the database, there is no way a family from across the country can access it to try to find the final resting place of their loved ones. So this legislation authorizes a small new program that would provide training to those medical examiners, coroners, and police departments to try to make sure that information is getting up on the law enforcement database, the NCIC. Remember, they put up all the information about missing kids right away, but as we heard in the case of Billy Smolinski, they often don't put that information up about missing adults. Some of these police departments are tiny. They don't have the resources to train their personnel on how to do that, and this program would allow them to get that. In the end, we can crack a lot of these cases--thousands of these cases--if we are able to simply give tools to these families so they could participate in the search and tools to law enforcement so they can talk with each other. The Smolinskis have not given up. Jan has come down to Congress to testify on behalf of Billy's Law. She has changed the practices of the Waterbury Police Department and has even gotten laws passed in Hartford to make sure [[Page S7114]] that other police departments don't make the same mistakes. She wants to make sure those mistakes aren't repeated across the country. She thinks about what would have happened if that information about Billy had been uploaded onto NCIC immediately, the day she reported it. Maybe Billy was taken to some other State. Maybe the lack of that information being transmitted that day meant that a break in the case didn't happen in those early days. She always thinks about what would have happened if she had access to more information--if the database that she looks at virtually every day, the NamUs database, had more information about missing persons and unidentified remains. She thinks about her ability to solve this case and how it could have helped the police solve this case if those databases were better or more up to date. We hope we are eventually going to solve the case of Billy Smolinski's disappearance in Connecticut, but we also hope that we can pass legislation here in both Houses--bipartisan, noncontroversial, measured, commonsense--that will assure that there are less Jan Smolinskis in the world going forward. We passed this in the House, when I was there, with a broad, big bipartisan vote. This is the first time we introduced it on a bipartisan basis here in the Senate, and I am hopeful--speaking on behalf of not just the Smolinski family, but the 90,000 other families who are grieving for a missing person--we can get this done and get it done shortly so we can get families and law enforcement the tools they need to crack more of these cases. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. LEAHY.

Madam President, I am here on the floor this afternoon to talk about a young man named Billy Smolinski and a law that Senator Hoeven and I are introducing on behalf of him, his family, and, quite literally, the millions of other families throughout the United States who have had to deal with the trauma, angst, and grief of a loved one gone missing. I will begin by telling everyone a little bit about Billy Smolinski. Billy's parents don't think that he is alive any longer, but they aren't sure because on August 24, 2004, at the age of 31 Billy went missing. Billy was a vibrant young man who lived in Waterbury, CT, along with his treasured dog. When he didn't respond to calls and communications from his family over the course of a number of days, his parents--and I will speak about his mother in particular, Jan Smolinski, who has been the driving force behind Billy's Law--contacted the Waterbury Police Department. The Waterbury Police Department is a great police department, and I have a lot of friends there, but even they will admit they really screwed up this case from the beginning. They told his parents that he probably didn't go missing, that he was just running away from his personal problems. One officer stated that Billy was probably ``drinking a beer somewhere in Europe.'' The Smolinskis pressed their case over and over, day after day, and after 2 weeks of asking for help from the police department, the Smolinskis were finally able get an investigation started, but it went slowly. DNA samples were submitted and lost. It took 4 years before the police department ever actually searched his car to see if there was any information about what happened to Billy. Billy's case made a lot of news in Connecticut and Waterbury, and over the course of the last few years, it has taken twists and turns, but he has never been found. His parents suspect he has been killed, but law enforcement hasn't made progress on that potential case either. Over the course of the last 11 years, Billy's parents encountered obstacle after obstacle when they tried to be helpful and participate in the investigation and search for Billy Smolinski. They came to me at that time, as their Member of Congress representing Waterbury, CT, to discuss ways in which we here in Washington could take down some of the barriers they faced. What they reluctantly found, as they became a part of this big national network of families who have had loved ones go missing, was that their story was not unique. Their story of finding obstacles at the local police department and nationally was not unique and unfortunately all too common, as they tried to figure out what happened to Billy. What they were connected into was a national network of tens of thousands of individuals who were searching for a missing loved one--a missing father, mother, brother or sister. Nationwide there are as many as 90,000 active missing persons cases at any given time, and there are some really simple things we can do to help families who are trying to find their missing loved one. Much of the attention, rightly, goes to missing children. Missing children have an entire set of laws built up around them, and for good reason, our priority lies in finding them. Law enforcement, within a matter of hours, has to post information about missing children onto national databases. There are specific campaigns waged on billboards and media outlets to immediately find missing children. But our focus on finding missing children shouldn't absolve us from the responsibility to help families such as the Smolinskis to find missing adults as well. Senator Hoeven and I have gotten together on a fairly simple piece of legislation, and I wish to talk about it today. A companion piece of legislation is being introduced in the House by my colleague in Connecticut, Representative Elizabeth Esty, and Congressman Ted Poe of Texas. I will explain what this piece of legislation does. At its foundation, it strengthens the database system that families access to try to find their missing loved one. Currently, there are two databases. One is a law enforcement database, which is called NCIC, and the other one is a public-facing database called NamUs. These two databases very often aren't talking to each other, and therein lies the primary problem this bill tries to solve. Law enforcement uploads all sorts of information onto NCIC, but the net data often doesn't get transferred over to the database that the families can access, which is called the NamUs database. Why is that important? It is important because families are the supersleuths in cases of missing persons. Families are the ones who know all of the detailed and intricate information about the circumstances of a disappearance and the identification of their loved one. I don't mean to get too gruesome, but think about this statistic. There are 40,000 sets of unidentified remains in the country today. Think about that. There are 40,000 sets of unidentified remains in the country, but because not all of that information--the detailed descriptions of those remains--is uploaded onto a database that the public can see, Billy's body may be out there somewhere, but his parents can't find him because they don't have access to the information. Unfortunately, that is the reality and the problem that we are trying to solve. If you get more information that law enforcement has onto a public database, the supersleuths--the parents, brothers, and sisters--will have more access to it. What about information that law enforcement has about an individual who has gone missing--a report of someone who has gone missing in California and whose information is not uploaded onto a database that a family who is looking for that information in New York may want? This legislation authorizes NamUs permanently in law and then requires that the two databases be connected. Law enforcement, rightly, has a concern that any information that is sensitive to an open case should remain private, and this legislation allows for the FBI to determine what information has to remain private as part of NCIC and what information goes onto the public database. But connecting those databases will give more information to families such as the Smolinskis to try and crack these 90,000 cases that are out there today. The legislation also opens up a relatively modest but important training program for police, coroners, and medical examiners to make sure they are using these databases and putting this information online. The databases don't work if the information is not getting uploaded. If the data from the coroner's office isn't up on the database, there is no way a family from across the country can access it to try to find the final resting place of their loved ones. So this legislation authorizes a small new program that would provide training to those medical examiners, coroners, and police departments to try to make sure that information is getting up on the law enforcement database, the NCIC. Remember, they put up all the information about missing kids right away, but as we heard in the case of Billy Smolinski, they often don't put that information up about missing adults. Some of these police departments are tiny. They don't have the resources to train their personnel on how to do that, and this program would allow them to get that. In the end, we can crack a lot of these cases--thousands of these cases--if we are able to simply give tools to these families so they could participate in the search and tools to law enforcement so they can talk with each other. The Smolinskis have not given up. Jan has come down to Congress to testify on behalf of Billy's Law. She has changed the practices of the Waterbury Police Department and has even gotten laws passed in Hartford to make sure [[Page S7114]] that other police departments don't make the same mistakes. She wants to make sure those mistakes aren't repeated across the country. She thinks about what would have happened if that information about Billy had been uploaded onto NCIC immediately, the day she reported it. Maybe Billy was taken to some other State. Maybe the lack of that information being transmitted that day meant that a break in the case didn't happen in those early days.

She thinks about her ability to solve this case and how it could have helped the police solve this case if those databases were better or more up to date. We hope we are eventually going to solve the case of Billy Smolinski's disappearance in Connecticut, but we also hope that we can pass legislation here in both Houses--bipartisan, noncontroversial, measured, commonsense--that will assure that there are less Jan Smolinskis in the world going forward.

CREC-2015-10-05-pt1-PgS7117-3,CREC-2015-10-05,114,DISASTER IN SOUTH CAROLINA,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 145 (Monday, October 5, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7117-S7118] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DISASTER IN SOUTH CAROLINA Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I just returned from South Carolina. I am sure many Members of the body have been watching this drama unfold on television. I have never seen anything like it. I was in the Charleston area over the weekend. There was 18 inches in about 24 hours, and Columbia, SC, is really under siege. It is a thousand-year historic rain. I am not a meteorologist, but it seems as if everything bad that could happen did happen to send the water and the rain to South Carolina. All 46 counties have received Federal emergency declaration. There has been a verbal request for a major disaster declaration for 11 counties; 1,300 National Guard deployed and 7,000 more on standby; the entire State trooper force is on the road; 1,250 South Carolina DOT maintenance employees working; 550 road closures; 150 bridge closures; 26,000 and climbing without power; 40,000 and climbing without water; there have been 9 deaths. The economic damage--we don't know yet. There will be an insurance component, and there will be a disaster relief component. As we get through this and look at the damages--that comes later--we are not going to ask the Federal Government to do anything beyond the responsibility of the government. We will not turn this into a pile-on party. The bottom line is I really appreciate my colleagues coming up and offering their assistance and their prayers to the people of South Carolina. Our Governor and the entire infrastructure of the emergency management system in South Carolina have done a very good job. More is coming. The rain is about to depart the area, but we will have runoff from upstate of South Carolina that will flow down to the coast and run right through the communities that have been hit the hardest. So there is a second wave of water coming. My sister lives in the Columbia area, and I can say there are very few families in South Carolina not affected by this. Manning, SC, is virtually underwater. ``We are thinking about the people of South Carolina'' is what I have heard from all of my colleagues. Senator Schumer called. The Vice President called. I appreciate all of your concern and prayers. We will hopefully get this behind us soon in terms of the rainfall and start building up some levees and dams that are just about to break. I worry about the bridges and the damage to our bridges. I don't think we really appreciate how extensive it is. This is sort of the worst of nature coming our way, but I think we met it with the best of human nature. From what I can tell, people have been working together trying to slug through this. And I will just echo what the Governor said: Stay in your homes. Get off the roads. It is so dangerous down there. Anybody who has to be rescued because they are out looking around and taking photos is draining resources from the people who are under siege. So on behalf of Tim Scott and myself, we are going to do whatever we can, with our House delegation, to make sure our State is taken care of in an appropriate fashion. Hopefully by the end of this week we will begin to survey the damage, but unfortunately there is more coming as the runoff from upstate makes its way to the coast. This was literally a perfect storm of things coming together to take water from the hurricane and create a river of rain. I have never seen anything like it, and I have lived in the State all my life. To the people without power, whose houses are underwater, whose cars have been devastated, those who have lost loved ones, we are definitely thinking about you. We are pulling together in our State. Mr. President, 2015 has been a miserable year for the State of South Carolina. Some of the worst things have happened, and we are still hanging in there. Everybody is clinging to each other in a very heartwarming way. And I am sure there will be exceptions to that rule-- curfews are in place--but the vast majority of South Carolinians are rising to the occasion. I was talking to the Governor last night. We can't wait to get this year behind us. And I cannot tell you, from the Charleston shooting to this, how tough it has been for our State. But when it is all said and done, we are going to be together and come out stronger. To the families who are thinking the world has come to an end, God willing, it will get better. The water will pass, we will start surveying the damage, and we will help those who need help. [[Page S7118]] We are not going to ask for a penny more than we need. This is not about fixing problems unrelated to this event; this is about appropriately dealing with this event and nothing more. I thank the President and the Members of this body who have offered their prayers and wishes for the people of South Carolina. To the people of my State, to the first responders, to all who have been involved trying to take care of your fellow citizens, God bless you. To our Governor and her team, I know you are working so hard. I would end this with a request for prayers. Any money that people can send will be much appreciated because there are people who have lost everything they have worked for all their lives. It is days like this that make you appreciate one another. There is a role for the government to play here, but at the end of the day, it is going to be people helping people, with the government providing some resources, but we will have to help each other. There is no substitute for neighbor taking care of neighbor here. I appreciate the floor time. I will keep the body informed as this disaster unfolds. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator hold his suggestion? Mr. GRAHAM. Yes. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 145 (Monday, October 5, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7117-S7118] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DISASTER IN SOUTH CAROLINA Mr. GRAHAM.

It was 4 years ago that a drug company in St. Louis raised the price dramatically on a drug that was administered to pregnant women, a shot they took once a week for 20 weeks that significantly reduced the incidents of low birth weight babies. Now we see a headline on the front page of the New York Times today which reads ``A Drug Company's Price Tactics Pinch Insurers and Consumers.'' Two weeks ago another New York Times headline read ``Drug Goes From $13.50 a Tablet to $750, Overnight.'' In April the Wall Street Journal ran an article titled ``Pharmaceutical Companies Buy Rivals' Drugs, Then Jack Up the Prices.'' The reporters who did the investigating in these articles all found the same thing: Pharmaceutical companies buy up the rights of older existing drugs where all the costs from research have been recouped and raise prices dramatically overnight. In its most recent article, the Times investigated Valeant Pharmaceuticals, a company that recently raised the cost of the lifesaving drug Cuprimine more than fivefold. The Times interviewed Mr. Bruce Mannes, a 68-year-old retired carpenter in Michigan who has relied on Cuprimine for 55 years to treat his Wilson's disease. In May Mr. Mannes was paying $366 a month for Cuprimine. Today he is forced to pay $1,800 a month just to stay alive. It is the same drug and the same dosage. It was $366 a month not too long ago. Today it is $1,800 a month just to stay alive. It is not just Mr. Mannes who is left on the hook to pay for his medicine, which has more than quadrupled in cost. The taxpayer-funded Medicare Program will now be spending $35,000 a month to cover its portion of his pills because current law prohibits Medicare--because of the power of the drug companies in this institution--from negotiating more favorable drug prices. Cuprimine is not a cure for Wilson's disease. Mr. Mannes must take this drug for the rest of his life. It doesn't cure him, but it keeps him alive. Valeant did nothing to improve this drug. They don't claim that. It has been around for decades. They have done nothing to invest in a cure. Instead, the company bought the rights to an existing medicine and raised its price. Remember, I said that in May Mr. Mannes was paying $366 a month. Today he is paying $1,800 a month. This story, unfortunately, is outrageous, and it is not an isolated story. The Times reports that this year alone Valeant has raised the price of its drugs by an average of 66 percent. When Valeant acquired Salix Pharmaceuticals earlier this year, it raised the price of its diabetic drug Glumetza by 800 percent. These are drugs that have been out there. They don't need to recoup their costs of research and development. These are drugs that have been used for many years at a significantly lower price. They buy these companies--these drugs and jack up the price. After Valeant acquired the drug Isuprel, which treats slow or irregular heart rate, it raised the price by more than $30,000. Valeant's investors and its billionaire CEO are, of course, getting rich but always on the backs of America's seniors and American taxpayers, who pay the price. Seniors on Medicare face skyrocketing bills for lifesaving drugs they cannot afford. Insurance companies sometimes stop covering drugs altogether. Janis, from Lower Salem in Washington County, OH, wrote to me about the drug Glumetza. She wrote: My husband has gotten the drug Glumetza for $10 each refill of 180 pills. When he re-ordered this prescription this morning the pharmacy called him to say that Glumetza now costs $3,000 for a 15-day supply. His insurance has a limit of $3,000. The pharmaceutical companies are beginning to look like the drug cartels of Mexico. The insurance companies are being forced to cut benefits or increase their cost to consumers who have worked hard all their lives and earned their health care benefits. He and I cannot continue to afford to pay these out of pocket expenses on a fixed income. We know that Janis in Washington County, OH, isn't alone. We also know that all Americans face higher health care premiums when insurance companies and hospitals are forced to absorb the cost of this price- gouging. Jeffrey Rosner of the Cleveland Clinic told the Times that the nine drugs with the worst price increases cost that hospital alone an additional $11 million a year and that Valeant's products made up 80 percent of that. Yet their billionaire CEO is doing very well. Valeant is not the only company that profits from its business of buying up old drugs and jacking up the price. We remember the coverage last month about Turing Pharmaceuticals, which raised the price of a drug called Daraprim, which is used to treat a life-threatening parasitic infection, from $13.50 to $750 a tablet overnight. The company Rodelis Therapeutics recently raised the price of a drug to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis from $500 to over $10,000 for the same number of pills. These are not scenarios of pharmaceutical companies charging higher prices to finance the development cost of new drugs. Take Valeant for example. Valeant spends 3 percent of its sales on research and development. Traditional drug companies tell us they spend 15 to 20 percent. Traditional drug companies will tell you they spend 15 to 20 percent of their revenues on research and development. That is why they need to charge high prices at the beginning, at least during their patent protection period--to recoup, they will say, the $500 million, $600 million, whatever it costs, in research and development. Valeant is buying drugs where that research and development have already been recouped. They spend only 3 percent of their sales on research and development. So where does Valeant's money go? One might hope it would support American pharmaceutical manufacturing jobs or pay back into our tax system to support lifesaving biopharmaceutical research at the National Institutes of health. But, no, what actually is happening is infuriating. Valeant, which shifted its profits overseas in 2010 to avoid its U.S. tax obligation, buys up the rights to existing pharmaceutical companies, lays off workers, hikes prices by eight- nine- tenfold, and then expects patients, hospitals, and taxpayers to pick up the tab. It is not right. As I said at the outset, we have seen this before. Valeant, Turing, and Rodelis are not the first companies to try this shady--and ``shady'' is too kind a word--business model. They won't be the last. In 2011, KV Pharmaceutical created an overnight monopoly on the lifesaving drug 17P, a preterm labor-prevention drug--a progesterone-- for pregnant women. KV Pharmaceutical didn't invent the drug. It spent no money on R&D. It spent no money on clinical trials, which are also expensive but not for them. The drug had been around for decades. It was normally compounded at pharmacies and at hospitals to treat pregnant [[Page S7119]] women. What did it do? It applied to the FDA for 7 years of exclusive coverage under the Orphan Drug Act and changed the name from 17P to Makena. That is it. They proposed raising the price by almost 15 percent overnight. It was a $10 drug initially--$10, taken 20 times, so it cost about $200 for the regimen, and they raised the price to $30,000. Imagine that. We have thousands of pregnant women who have had a history of preterm births, and their doctors say to these women: You should take this compound, this progesterone, P17. The cost is only $200. You will get a shot every week for 20 weeks in a row. Then all of a sudden the price of $200 is raised to $30,000. What happens? Some places, Medicaid won't pay. Other places, private insurance won't pay. In many cases, women simply wouldn't take this progesterone, and the problems of low birth weight babies increases. The potentially devastating impact on our country is already too high for the preterm birth rate. Fewer women are able to afford the drug. When that happened 4 years ago, I wrote to the company's CEO asking them to consider the price increase. The senior Senator from Minnesota, Ms. Klobuchar, and I sent a letter to the FTC urging an investigation. Together, we kept the pressure on the company. Frankly, we embarrassed them, as they deserved. So far the drug has stayed more affordable. We need to do the same thing today. Valeant and companies like it must not be allowed to get away with fleecing consumers and taxpayers. I am calling on my colleagues on the HELP Committee to hold hearings on this price-gouging. We must work together--Congress, the media, the public--to expose this kind of behavior, maybe a little shame. I don't normally like to do that, but when a CEO makes this kind of money by fleecing so many people--especially when it comes to low birth weight babies but also where people need these moderately priced drugs to stay alive--I think it is time to out them and put pressure on these companies. One thing we can also do, if my colleagues would wean themselves off of drug company contributions, is give Medicare the authority to negotiate drug prices. Many of these drugs with massive price increases are taken by large numbers of seniors who are on Medicare. We know the Veterans Administration uses the buying power of millions of American veterans to negotiate directly with drug companies to bring down significantly the cost of these drugs. For too long the pharmaceutical companies have profited off of their ability to charge more vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries higher prices for their drugs. Current law expressly bans Medicare from negotiating with pharmaceutical companies--again showing the power of drug companies lobbying my colleagues in this body--even though the government can negotiate bigger discounts with private insurance companies. This summer I helped introduce the Medicare Prescription Drug Savings and Choice Act, which would allow seniors to enroll in a Medicare Part D plan administered directly by Medicare instead of a private insurance company. This legislation requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate directly with drug companies to get the best prices for our seniors. Seniors should be able to get drug coverage directly through Medicare and not be forced to buy from a middleman. The purpose of lifesaving drugs is that--to save lives, not to line the pockets of Big Pharma executives and investors. We owe it to the people we serve--the people who elect us--to put a stop to the price- gouging that is bankrupting patients and overcharging Medicare, straining hospitals, and fleecing taxpayers. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 145 (Monday, October 5, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7118-S7119] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES AND DRUG PRICING Mr. BROWN.

jack up the prices.'' the reporters who did the investigating in these articles all found the same thing: pharmaceutical companies buy up the rights of older existing drugs where all the costs from research have been recouped and raise prices dramatically overnight. in its most recent article, the times investigated valeant pharmaceuticals, a company that recently raised the cost of the lifesaving drug cuprimine more than fivefold. the times interviewed mr. bruce mannes, a 68-year-old retired carpenter in michigan who has relied on cuprimine for 55 years to treat his wilson's disease. in may mr. mannes was paying $366 a month for cuprimine. today he is forced to pay $1,800 a month just to stay alive. it is the same drug and the same dosage. it was $366 a month not too long ago. today it is $1,800 a month just to stay alive. it is not just mr. mannes who is left on the hook to pay for his medicine, which has more than quadrupled in cost. the taxpayer-funded medicare program will now be spending $35,000 a month to cover its portion of his pills because current law prohibits medicare--because of the power of the drug companies in this institution--from negotiating more favorable drug prices. cuprimine is not a cure for wilson's disease. mr. mannes must take this drug for the rest of his life. it doesn't cure him, but it keeps him alive. valeant did nothing to improve this drug. they don't claim that. it has been around for decades. they have done nothing to invest in a cure. instead, the company bought the rights to an existing medicine and raised its price. remember, i said that in may mr. mannes was paying $366 a month. today he is paying $1,800 a month. this story, unfortunately, is outrageous, and it is not an isolated story. the times reports that this year alone valeant has raised the price of its drugs by an average of 66 percent. when valeant acquired salix pharmaceuticals earlier this year, it raised the price of its diabetic drug glumetza by 800 percent. these are drugs that have been out there. they don't need to recoup their costs of research and development. these are drugs that have been used for many years at a significantly lower price. they buy these companies--these drugs and jack up the price. after valeant acquired the drug isuprel, which treats slow or irregular heart rate, it raised the price by more than $30,000. valeant's investors and its billionaire ceo are, of course, getting rich but always on the backs of america's seniors and american taxpayers, who pay the price. seniors on medicare face skyrocketing bills for lifesaving drugs they cannot afford. insurance companies sometimes stop covering drugs altogether. janis, from lower salem in washington county, oh, wrote to me about the drug glumetza. she wrote: my husband has gotten the drug glumetza for $10 each refill of 180 pills. when he re-ordered this prescription this morning the pharmacy called him to say that glumetza now costs $3,000 for a 15-day supply. his insurance has a limit of $3,000. the pharmaceutical companies are beginning to look like the drug cartels of mexico. the insurance companies are being forced to cut benefits or increase their cost to consumers who have worked hard all their lives and earned their health care benefits. he and i cannot continue to afford to pay these out of pocket expenses on a fixed income. we know that janis in washington county, oh, isn't alone. we also know that all americans face higher health care premiums when insurance companies and hospitals are forced to absorb the cost of this price- gouging. jeffrey rosner of the cleveland clinic told the times that the nine drugs with the worst price increases cost that hospital alone an additional $11 million a year and that valeant's products made up 80 percent of that. yet their billionaire ceo is doing very well. valeant is not the only company that profits from its business of buying up old drugs and jacking up the price. we remember the coverage last month about turing pharmaceuticals, which raised the price of a drug called daraprim, which is used to treat a life-threatening parasitic infection, from $13.50 to $750 a tablet overnight. the company rodelis therapeutics recently raised the price of a drug to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis from $500 to over $10,000 for the same number of pills. these are not scenarios of pharmaceutical companies charging higher prices to finance the development cost of new drugs. take valeant for example. valeant spends 3 percent of its sales on research and development. traditional drug companies tell us they spend 15 to 20 percent. traditional drug companies will tell you they spend 15 to 20 percent of their revenues on research and development. that is why they need to charge high prices at the beginning, at least during their patent protection period--to recoup, they will say, the $500 million, $600 million, whatever it costs, in research and development. valeant is buying drugs where that research and development have already been recouped. they spend only 3 percent of their sales on research and development. so where does valeant's money go? one might hope it would support american pharmaceutical manufacturing jobs or pay back into our tax system to support lifesaving biopharmaceutical research at the national institutes of health. but, no, what actually is happening is infuriating. valeant, which shifted its profits overseas in 2010 to avoid its u.s. tax obligation, buys up the rights to existing pharmaceutical companies, lays off workers, hikes prices by eight- nine- tenfold, and then expects patients, hospitals, and taxpayers to pick up the tab. it is not right. as i said at the outset, we have seen this before. valeant, turing, and rodelis are not the first companies to try this shady--and ``shady'' is too kind a word--business model. they won't be the last. in 2011, kv pharmaceutical created an overnight monopoly on the lifesaving drug 17p, a preterm labor-prevention drug--a progesterone-- for pregnant women. kv pharmaceutical didn't invent the drug. it spent no money on r&d. it spent no money on clinical trials, which are also expensive but not for them. the drug had been around for decades. it was normally compounded at pharmacies and at hospitals to treat pregnant [[page s7119]] women. what did it do? it applied to the fda for 7 years of exclusive coverage under the orphan drug act and changed the name from 17p to makena. that is it. they proposed raising the price by almost 15 percent overnight. it was a $10 drug initially--$10, taken 20 times, so it cost about $200 for the regimen, and they raised the price to $30,000. imagine that. we have thousands of pregnant women who have had a history of preterm births, and their doctors say to these women: you should take this compound, this progesterone, p17. the cost is only $200. you will get a shot every week for 20 weeks in a row. then all of a sudden the price of $200 is raised to $30,000. what happens? some places, medicaid won't pay. other places, private insurance won't pay. in many cases, women simply wouldn't take this progesterone, and the problems of low birth weight babies increases. the potentially devastating impact on our country is already too high for the preterm birth rate. fewer women are able to afford the drug. when that happened 4 years ago, i wrote to the company's ceo asking them to consider the price increase. the senior senator from minnesota, ms. klobuchar, and i sent a letter to the ftc urging an investigation. together, we kept the pressure on the company. frankly, we embarrassed them, as they deserved. so far the drug has stayed more affordable. we need to do the same thing today. valeant and companies like it must not be allowed to get away with fleecing consumers and taxpayers. i am calling on my colleagues on the help committee to hold hearings on this price-gouging. we must work together--congress, the media, the public--to expose this kind of behavior, maybe a little shame. i don't normally like to do that, but when a ceo makes this kind of money by fleecing so many people--especially when it comes to low birth weight babies but also where people need these moderately priced drugs to stay alive--i think it is time to out them and put pressure on these companies. one thing we can also do, if my colleagues would wean themselves off of drug company contributions, is give medicare the authority to negotiate drug prices. many of these drugs with massive price increases are taken by large numbers of seniors who are on medicare. we know the veterans administration uses the buying power of millions of american veterans to negotiate directly with drug companies to bring down significantly the cost of these drugs. for too long the pharmaceutical companies have profited off of their ability to charge more vulnerable medicare beneficiaries higher prices for their drugs. current law expressly bans medicare from negotiating with pharmaceutical companies--again showing the power of drug companies lobbying my colleagues in this body--even though the government can negotiate bigger discounts with private insurance companies. this summer i helped introduce the medicare prescription drug savings and choice act, which would allow seniors to enroll in a medicare part d plan administered directly by medicare instead of a private insurance company. this legislation requires the secretary of health and human services to negotiate directly with drug companies to get the best prices for our seniors. seniors should be able to get drug coverage directly through medicare and not be forced to buy from a middleman. the purpose of lifesaving drugs is that--to save lives, not to line the pockets of big pharma executives and investors. we owe it to the people we serve--the people who elect us--to put a stop to the price- gouging that is bankrupting patients and overcharging medicare, straining hospitals, and fleecing taxpayers. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. mcconnell. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",11217
CREC-2015-10-05-pt1-PgS7120,CREC-2015-10-05,114,SRI LANKA,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 145 (Monday, October 5, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7120-S7121] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SRI LANKA Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to address the situation in Sri Lanka, a country that has endured a brutal civil war and is working to address the difficult issues of accountability and reconciliation. Following the historic elections in January and August, Sri Lanka has a remarkable opportunity to economically integrate with the West and build security ties. This relationship has great potential that we all hope can be realized. But before we move forward on greater economic and security cooperation, Sri Lanka must finally resolve longstanding issues of accountability that have plagued the country since the end of the war and engage in a credible and legitimate effort to reconcile amongst all communities in the country: Sinhalese and Tamil, Muslim, Christian, Hindu, and Buddhist. Efforts by the last government to deal with war crimes allegations were a sham, according to the U.N., according to the U.S. Government, according to the victims and according to the current government in Colombo. Justice has been mostly nonexistent for scores across the country. Many Tamils do not trust the central government to administer a genuine and credible domestic mechanism to provide real accountability for crimes committed during the war. Many Sinhala mothers want to know what happened to their sons who served in the military. Many combatants and civilians remain unaccounted for, necessitating a comprehensive effort to identify all missing persons. On October 1, the U.N. Human Rights Council passed Resolution 25/1, which is focused on accountability and reconciliation in Sri Lanka. This resolution is not perfect, but if fully implemented, it provides the most promising path forward since the end of the war. The resolution leaves open the possibility for international judges and prosecutors in Sri Lanka's judicial mechanism to promote accountability. The current government has made clear that the international role will be limited to providing technical assistance and advice. As the U.S. works with Sri Lanka to implement the resolution, I urge our diplomats to push for the most robust international role in the accountability process. I also urge the Sri Lankan Government to continue to act in good faith to ensure that any accountability mechanism is seen as fair and just by all its citizens. The U.S. led an effort to pass a 2014 U.N. Human Rights Council resolution which mandated a report on war crimes allegations in Sri Lanka. Earlier this month, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights released its report which documented ``a horrific level of violations and abuses'' committed between 2002 and 2011. Among the violations committed by Sri Lankan government forces, the separatist Tamil Tigers, LTTE, and pro-government paramilitaries included in the 261-page report include enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, torture, denial of humanitarian assistance, sexual violence, indiscriminate shelling, and the recruitment of child soldiers. The report also recommended a series of measures that Sri Lanka should take to address these issues. For example the report recommends that the Government of Sri Lanka integrate international judges and prosecutors with an independent Sri Lankan investigative and prosecuting body to try those accused of war crimes, implement security sector reform, return land occupied by the military, strengthen witness protection programs, and establish a national reparations policy in consultation with victims and families. Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera spoke a few weeks ago at the 30th session of the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva. His own very welcome recognition of the depth of the institutional challenges and of past failures is more than enough reason to insist on outside involvement, particularly in investigations and witness protection. Foreign Minister Samaraweera appears genuinely committed to reconciliation. He recently announced the government's support for a commission for truth, justice, reconciliation and nonrecurrence to help victims understand what happened and help them attain justice. He emphasized the government's commitment to an office on missing persons based on the principle of the families' right to know what happened to their loved ones. He announced the establishment of an office for reparations for victims. Most notably he acknowledged that any judicial mechanism for accountability will need to be designed through a wide process of consultations involving all stakeholders to include support from the international community. Sri Lanka and its supporters in the international community expect action, not more promises, on each of these fronts. The political will expressed by the government for a democratic future based on human rights and rule of law is something that should be acknowledged and welcomed by the U.S., international community, and all Sri Lankans. We have an obligation to support and foster this vision. As a friend, we also have an obligation to identify shortcomings as they arise throughout the process. Moving forward, the U.S. can take several concrete measures to support Sri Lanka's accountability process through the challenging days ahead. First, the U.S. should work to ensure that the commitments in the current UNHRC resolution are fully implemented. Following the passage of the resolution, the U.S. should push for the most robust international role in the accountability process, to include international judges and prosecutors. Second, the United States can support efforts to ensure witness protection inside of Sri Lanka. This could include the establishment of special security force for witness protection, developed in close coordination with leaders in the Tamil community. Third, the U.S. military should urge its counterparts in the Sri Lankan Armed Forces to play a constructive [[Page S7121]] role in the accountability process. I understand that there are many in the Sri Lankan military who seek to clear the military's name so that the institution can move forward. They should deliver on that commitment. Fourth, the U.S. should continue and expand programs that strengthen civil society voices in Sri Lanka. The country now has a parliament which is more disposed towards incorporating civil society into the policymaking process. These advocates will be critical moving forward on this as well as broader reconciliation efforts. Finally, the U.S. should make clear that any accountability process must include addressing violations committed by all sides in the conflict: LTTE, the Sri Lankan military, and pro-government paramilitary groups. The goal of accountability is not revenge. The goal is to conduct a process where all sides are provided a measure of justice that leads to durable reconciliation and a marked departure from armed conflict. The previous government's policies were a dangerous cocktail that were slowly sliding Sri Lanka back into ethnic and religious strife. Today, Sri Lanka's leaders have an important opportunity to move beyond this divisive past. They say they want it and they have a plan on paper. Now is the time to act. And I am prepared to support the efforts of President Sirisena, Prime Minister Wickramasinghe, Opposition Leader Sampanthan, and all Sri Lankans towards that end. The High Commissioner for Human Rights Prince Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said the credibility of the U.N. Human Rights Council is on the line in Sri Lanka. I agree and would say that the same goes for the United States. Our country has an important responsibility to finish the work of diplomats in recent years and promote the strongest accountability mechanism in Sri Lanka. Our credibility on human rights issues around the world is at stake and will be watched closely by human rights defenders and violators alike. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 145 (Monday, October 5, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7120-S7121] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SRI LANKA Mr. CARDIN.

accused of war crimes, implement security sector reform, return land occupied by the military, strengthen witness protection programs, and establish a national reparations policy in consultation with victims and families. foreign minister mangala samaraweera spoke a few weeks ago at the 30th session of the u.n. human rights council in geneva. his own very welcome recognition of the depth of the institutional challenges and of past failures is more than enough reason to insist on outside involvement, particularly in investigations and witness protection. foreign minister samaraweera appears genuinely committed to reconciliation. he recently announced the government's support for a commission for truth, justice, reconciliation and nonrecurrence to help victims understand what happened and help them attain justice. he emphasized the government's commitment to an office on missing persons based on the principle of the families' right to know what happened to their loved ones. he announced the establishment of an office for reparations for victims. most notably he acknowledged that any judicial mechanism for accountability will need to be designed through a wide process of consultations involving all stakeholders to include support from the international community. sri lanka and its supporters in the international community expect action, not more promises, on each of these fronts. the political will expressed by the government for a democratic future based on human rights and rule of law is something that should be acknowledged and welcomed by the u.s., international community, and all sri lankans. we have an obligation to support and foster this vision. as a friend, we also have an obligation to identify shortcomings as they arise throughout the process. moving forward, the u.s. can take several concrete measures to support sri lanka's accountability process through the challenging days ahead. first, the u.s. should work to ensure that the commitments in the current unhrc resolution are fully implemented. following the passage of the resolution, the u.s. should push for the most robust international role in the accountability process, to include international judges and prosecutors. second, the united states can support efforts to ensure witness protection inside of sri lanka. this could include the establishment of special security force for witness protection, developed in close coordination with leaders in the tamil community. third, the u.s. military should urge its counterparts in the sri lankan armed forces to play a constructive [[page s7121]] role in the accountability process. i understand that there are many in the sri lankan military who seek to clear the military's name so that the institution can move forward. they should deliver on that commitment. fourth, the u.s. should continue and expand programs that strengthen civil society voices in sri lanka. the country now has a parliament which is more disposed towards incorporating civil society into the policymaking process. these advocates will be critical moving forward on this as well as broader reconciliation efforts. finally, the u.s. should make clear that any accountability process must include addressing violations committed by all sides in the conflict: ltte, the sri lankan military, and pro-government paramilitary groups. the goal of accountability is not revenge. the goal is to conduct a process where all sides are provided a measure of justice that leads to durable reconciliation and a marked departure from armed conflict. the previous government's policies were a dangerous cocktail that were slowly sliding sri lanka back into ethnic and religious strife. today, sri lanka's leaders have an important opportunity to move beyond this divisive past. they say they want it and they have a plan on paper. now is the time to act. and i am prepared to support the efforts of president sirisena, prime minister wickramasinghe, opposition leader sampanthan, and all sri lankans towards that end. the high commissioner for human rights prince zeid ra'ad al hussein said the credibility of the u.n. human rights council is on the line in sri lanka. i agree and would say that the same goes for the united states. our country has an important responsibility to finish the work of diplomats in recent years and promote the strongest accountability mechanism in sri lanka. our credibility on human rights issues around the world is at stake and will be watched closely by human rights defenders and violators alike.

CREC-2015-10-05-pt1-PgS7119,CREC-2015-10-05,114,WOMEN'S SMALL BUSINESS OWNERSHIP ACT OF 2015,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 145 (Monday, October 5, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7119-S7120] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WOMEN'S SMALL BUSINESS OWNERSHIP ACT OF 2015 Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I have introduced, along with Senator Vitter and Senator Shaheen, a bill that we believe will help break the glass ceiling women entrepreneurs face in this country. This month is National Women's Small Business Month. Throughout the month, the important contributions women entrepreneurs make to keep the economy growing will be highlighted. According the U.S. Small Business Administration, SBA, women-owned businesses are growing three times faster than their counterparts. Today, there are more than 10 million women-owned businesses across our country. They provide more than 23 million jobs and are expected to provide another five million additional jobs by 2018. In addition, one-third of all women-owned businesses are now owned by minorities. It is clear that we need to be investing more in our women-owned small businesses. That is why the legislation I am introducing today would help ensure that the next generation of women small business owners can get the training and counseling they need to turn their ideas into realities. This legislation would reauthorize the SBA's Women's Business Centers, WBCs, program for the first time since 1999. I am very pleased we were able to raise the authorized funding level for this critical counseling program to $21.7 million annually. Although the number of women entrepreneurs has continued to grow, funding for WBCs has remained flat for many years. Last year, when I was chair of the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, we took a hard look at actions necessary to propel women's entrepreneurship forward and introduced legislation that addressed three components necessary to unlock their success-- increasing access to federal contracts, increasing access to capital, and improving the training and counseling programs that support them. It became very clear that women all over the country agree that the Congress must take these additional steps. As Chair, I also issued a report, ``21st Century Barriers to Women's Entrepreneurship,'' which demonstrated the need for the policy changes we seek in this legislation. I am pleased to say that on October 14, one of those goals will be achieved. The Small Business Administration has finalized sole-source authority for the women's procurement program--bringing the program and the women it serves in line with other Federal contracting programs. This will result in increased access to Federal contracts for women. The bill I introduced addresses another finding in the report which called for expanding training and counseling for women entrepreneurs. It does this by reauthorizing the SBA's Women's Business Center, WBC, program, which provides critical counseling, training, and other assistance to women, particularly in socially and economically disadvantaged communities. I cannot think of a better investment than one that helps women who want to create jobs and contribute to the economy. Women's Business Centers also provide important business counseling and training to underserved minority entrepreneurs. The need is greater than we knew last year. Since the Survey of Business Owners, published by the Census Bureau, was released this summer, a greater number of women have started businesses. The latest preliminary data showed that there are nearly 10 million women-owned firms in the United States. This is a 27 percent increase from the survey's last iteration in 2007 and a 50 percent increase in only a decade. Women-owned businesses generate more than $1.6 trillion in revenue. The report we issued last year showed that women entrepreneurs benefit from the customized business training and counseling Women's Business Centers provide to help level the playing field in starting and growing a small business. The majority of women-owned businesses are still under $24,999 in revenues. Women entrepreneurs receive only 4 percent of all commercial loan dollars, 17 percent of SBA loans, and 4.2 percent of venture capital--so there is plenty of work to be done. It is astonishing to me that more than 100 Women's Business Centers [[Page S7120]] around the country are expected to serve this growing group of entrepreneurs. Women-owned small businesses generate needed income. According to a study released by the Association for Enterprise Opportunity, AEO, ``microbusinesses can be vital for income and wealth creation in underserved communities. In 2010, for instance, female- headed family households in which at least one person owned a microbusiness generated $8,000 to $13,000 more in annual household income than similar households without a business owner.'' For low- income households, this additional income is a path toward prosperity. The report goes on to say, ``the median net worth of business owners is almost two and a half times greater than that of non-business owners.'' Liz Jamieson, Director of the Washington Center for Women in Business, a WBC in Lacey, WA, explains why we need to increase support for Women's Business Centers. ``Since our inception in 2013, the Washington Center for Women in Business has coached and supported over 400 women entrepreneurs, to help them start, grow or scale up their companies. We've also provided training and business skills development to over 1000 entrepreneurs in the same time frame. Our center would not exist without the partnership of the SBA. Even so, our center serves 34 of the 39 counties in Washington State, and two staff people can only do so much, although they do an extraordinary job and we get rave reviews. This legislation will empower us to empower far more entrepreneurs from all over our state, and to help them grow their businesses and create more jobs.'' The legislation enjoys broad support by a number of key national organizations that support women business owners. The Association of Women's Business Centers, AWBC, Women Impacting Public Policy, WIPP, and the Association for Enterprise Opportunity, AEO, believe the changes we are proposing in this legislation are necessary to make this program open to more women. In closing, I would like to thank my colleagues who have cosponsored this legislation. I also want to commend Chairman Vitter and Ranking Member Shaheen of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee for their hard work and dedication to assisting women entrepreneurs succeed. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 145 (Monday, October 5, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7119-S7120] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WOMEN'S SMALL BUSINESS OWNERSHIP ACT OF 2015 Ms. CANTWELL.

Mr. President, I wish to honor the men and women of Little Rock Air Force Base and the surrounding communities for their steadfast support, spirit of service, and faithful dedication to the defense of our Nation. In 1951, community leaders in Jacksonville, AR, and the surrounding region began petitioning Congress for the creation of a local air base. The needed support was unattainable in the post-World War II environment, so supporters took it upon themselves to raise the money and purchase the land required for the base. In only 32 days, these air base advocates raised more than $800,000, and with the combination of purchased and donated land, 6,359 acres were gifted to the U.S. Government for the establishment of Little Rock Air Force Base. On October 9, 1955, the base officially opened. Since that day, it has served as a strategic operating location for numerous mission sets. From reconnaissance and bomber alert missions to the ever-present readiness of Titan II missile crews, Little Rock Air Force Base stood ready. With their cargo aircraft and selfless airmen, the base has responded to numerous natural disasters and humanitarian missions. Most recently, with the C-130 Hercules, Little Rock airmen have had a continuous global presence. From training members of three U.S. services and 20 foreign nations to supporting operations on five of the seven continents, they embody their motto as ``The Home of Combat Airlift.'' Over the past 60 years, the men and women of Little Rock Air Force Base have employed weapons systems covering every key tenant of air power. Currently, the base seamlessly blends Active Duty, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve command personnel into a singular fighting machine, taking airmen from initial qualification through graduate- level training. From its inception, Little Rock Air Force Base has been uniquely suited to fulfill any mission it is presented. The support of the community provides an unmatched strength that cannot be countered by any weapon system. The people of central Arkansas have opened their hearts and homes for six decades to welcome the men and women of the United States military. I am proud to represent the men and women of Little Rock Air Force Base and the communities who support them. I am grateful for their service and dedication and look forward to a future of continued success and cooperation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 145 (Monday, October 5, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S7121] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS ______ RECOGNIZING LITTLE ROCK AIR FORCE BASE ON ITS 60TH ANNIVERSARY Mr. BOOZMAN.

Mr. President, I wish to honor the men and women of Little Rock Air Force Base and the surrounding communities for their steadfast support, spirit of service, and faithful dedication to the defense of our Nation. In 1951, community leaders in Jacksonville, AR, and the surrounding region began petitioning Congress for the creation of a local air base. The needed support was unattainable in the post-World War II environment, so supporters took it upon themselves to raise the money and purchase the land required for the base. In only 32 days, these air base advocates raised more than $800,000, and with the combination of purchased and donated land, 6,359 acres were gifted to the U.S. Government for the establishment of Little Rock Air Force Base. On October 9, 1955, the base officially opened. Since that day, it has served as a strategic operating location for numerous mission sets. From reconnaissance and bomber alert missions to the ever-present readiness of Titan II missile crews, Little Rock Air Force Base stood ready. With their cargo aircraft and selfless airmen, the base has responded to numerous natural disasters and humanitarian missions. Most recently, with the C-130 Hercules, Little Rock airmen have had a continuous global presence. From training members of three U.S. services and 20 foreign nations to supporting operations on five of the seven continents, they embody their motto as ``The Home of Combat Airlift.'' Over the past 60 years, the men and women of Little Rock Air Force Base have employed weapons systems covering every key tenant of air power. Currently, the base seamlessly blends Active Duty, Air National Guard, and Air Force Reserve command personnel into a singular fighting machine, taking airmen from initial qualification through graduate- level training. From its inception, Little Rock Air Force Base has been uniquely suited to fulfill any mission it is presented. The support of the community provides an unmatched strength that cannot be countered by any weapon system. The people of central Arkansas have opened their hearts and homes for six decades to welcome the men and women of the United States military. I am proud to represent the men and women of Little Rock Air Force Base and the communities who support them. I am grateful for their service and dedication and look forward to a future of continued success and cooperation. ____________________",package_114_56.csv,2706,2706,2775,"[congressional record volume 161, number 145 (monday, october 5, 2015)] [senate] [page s7121] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] additional statements ______ recognizing little rock air force base on its 60th anniversary mr. boozman. mr. president, i wish to honor the men and women of little rock air force base and the surrounding communities for their steadfast support, spirit of service, and faithful dedication to the defense of our nation. in 1951, community leaders in jacksonville, ar, and the surrounding region began petitioning congress for the creation of a local air base. the needed support was unattainable in the post-world war ii environment, so supporters took it upon themselves to raise the money and purchase the land required for the base. in only 32 days, these air base advocates raised more than $800,000, and with the combination of purchased and donated land, 6,359 acres were gifted to the u.s. government for the establishment of little rock air force base. on october 9, 1955, the base officially opened. since that day, it has served as a strategic operating location for numerous mission sets. from reconnaissance and bomber alert missions to the ever-present readiness of titan ii missile crews, little rock air force base stood ready. with their cargo aircraft and selfless airmen, the base has responded to numerous natural disasters and humanitarian missions. most recently, with the c-130 hercules, little rock airmen have had a continuous global presence. from training members of three u.s. services and 20 foreign nations to supporting operations on five of the seven continents, they embody their motto as ``the home of combat airlift.'' over the past 60 years, the men and women of little rock air force base have employed weapons systems covering every key tenant of air power. currently, the base seamlessly blends active duty, air national guard, and air force reserve command personnel into a singular fighting machine, taking airmen from initial qualification through graduate- level training. from its inception, little rock air force base has been uniquely suited to fulfill any mission it is presented. the support of the community provides an unmatched strength that cannot be countered by any weapon system. the people of central arkansas have opened their hearts and homes for six decades to welcome the men and women of the united states military. i am proud to represent the men and women of little rock air force base and the communities who support them. i am grateful for their service and dedication and look forward to a future of continued success and cooperation. ____________________",2706

SIMS Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to pay special tribute to COL Martin L. Sims on the occasion of his retirement from a long and distinguished career in the U.S. Army. Colonel Sims began his military career through the Army Reserve Officer Training Corps at Vanderbilt University where he was a Distinguished Military Graduate in 1987, was branched as an armor officer, and was granted an educational delay to attend law school at the University of Tennessee where he served as the managing editor of the Tennessee Law Review and graduated with honors in 1990. After being assessed into the Army Judge Advocate General's Corps, he entered into active duty as a first lieutenant, less than 2 months after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. For the next 25 years, Colonel Sims served faithfully as a judge advocate during which time he was stationed overseas four times and deployed on numerous occasions to Afghanistan, Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Hungary, Kosovo, Kuwait, and Iraq in support of various contingency operations. A dedicated and talented soldier-lawyer, Colonel Sims held numerous positions of significant responsibility, culminating in his selection as the special assistant for strategy, plans, and capabilities within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs. Some of the many other key positions Colonel Sims held prior to his final assignment include service as the staff judge advocate for the 25th Infantry Division in Iraq; the staff judge advocate for Combined Joint Interagency Task Force 435 in Afghanistan; legal advisor to the inspector general of the Army, and deputy chief of the international and operational law branch at the office of the Judge Advocate General of the Army. A recognized master military justice practitioner, COL Sims also served the Army and the Department of Defense as a distinguished jurist, sitting as a senior judge on the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals and as an associate judge on the United States Court of Military Commission Review. I ask that you join me, our colleagues, and Colonel Sims' many friends in saluting this distinguished officer's many contributions and sacrifices in the defense of our great Nation. It is fitting that the Senate today publicly recognizes his service and wishes him; his wife, Stacy; and their daughters, Heather and Rachel, health, happiness, and success in the years to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 145 (Monday, October 5, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S7121] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO COLONEL MARTIN L.

When the building opened in 1915, it was home to the Scandinavian American Bank. It changed the face of downtown Grand Forks and helped spur westward growth toward the University of North Dakota. The bank, later known as First National Bank, and its building remained an anchor of the downtown area. It was officially listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 and is unofficially loved as the only building in the city with an escalator.

SAMPSEL Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I wish to honor William H. Sampsel, a veteran of World War II. On behalf of all Montanans and all Americans, I stand to say thank you to William for his service to our Nation. It is my honor to share the story of William's life and service--a story that most certainly won't be forgotten and a story he perhaps wouldn't have told himself. William, an extremely humble man, never asked to be placed on a pedestal; in fact it was his quiet service that is the landmark of his story. William was born in the midst of the Great Depression in January of 1925. His parents William H. and Marguerite Brennan Sampsel lived in Shenandoah, PA, at the time. His father, William H., was a meter reader with the Pennsylvania Power and Light Company and would later become a district manager. His mother, Marguerite, cared for five children. From a young age, William developed a strong work ethic that would serve him well throughout his life. He started his first job at the age of 14, clearing forest land by hand, earning a modest wage of $1 a day. By the time he was off to college, he quadrupled his wage to $4 a day. William's high school football coach, Al ``Ali Baba'' Barbartsky, a teammate of Vince Lombardi, helped make it possible for William to attend the University of Illinois on a football scholarship. Although William was a 180-pound guard for U of I's football team, his true love was baseball. In 1943, William enlisted in the Army and was assigned to Fort Benning, GA, for basic training. The following year, he was sent to an infantry division at Camp McCain, MS. Shortly following, he was transferred to the 319th Combat Engineer Battalion, where he deployed to France in August of 1944 as an Army engineer. While in France on orders to contain a pocket of German soldiers in Lorient and St. Nazaire, he was wounded in battle. Toward the end of the war, he was promoted to second lieutenant and received a Purple Heart medal. Now, William never told his family about receiving a Purple Heart for his service. They found out after noticing his name on the Montana Purple Heart Memorial wall in Billings. But when asked about his prestigious award, he humbly described the incident as ``just a little shrapnel''. But this only speaks true to the man he was. After his service in the Army was up, William attended Penn State University and graduated in 1949 with a degree in geology. He then was hired at Amerada Petroleum Co.--now known as Hess--in Tyler, TX. There he met his wife Christine Wallis, and they were married in May of 1952. William and Christine moved to Regina, SK, Calgary, AB; and ultimately settled in Billings, MT, in 1961. William and Christine had two children--daughter, Priscilla, who now lives in Laurel, and son, Michael William Sampsel, who lives in Tucson, Arizona. Outside of his accomplishments as a geologist, William loved to fish and is remembered for his love of the outdoors. William died on July 19, 2012. William always gave all he had to give, whether it was his knowledge, military service, or help to others in need. His life story is reflective of the dedicated, hard-working, and generous man folks knew. It is my honor to recognize William H. Sampsel's bravery and service to the United States by presenting his family with his Purple Heart, in addition to a Good Conduct Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with four bronze service stars, World War II Victory Medal, Army of Occupation Medal with Germany Clasp, Honorable Service Lapel Button WW II, and a sharpshooter badge and rifle bar. Our Nation is grateful for William's service. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 145 (Monday, October 5, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S7122] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING WILLIAM H.

William, an extremely humble man, never asked to be placed on a pedestal; in fact it was his quiet service that is the landmark of his story. William was born in the midst of the Great Depression in January of 1925. His parents William H. and Marguerite Brennan Sampsel lived in Shenandoah, PA, at the time. His father, William H., was a meter reader with the Pennsylvania Power and Light Company and would later become a district manager. His mother, Marguerite, cared for five children. From a young age, William developed a strong work ethic that would serve him well throughout his life. He started his first job at the age of 14, clearing forest land by hand, earning a modest wage of $1 a day. By the time he was off to college, he quadrupled his wage to $4 a day. William's high school football coach, Al ``Ali Baba'' Barbartsky, a teammate of Vince Lombardi, helped make it possible for William to attend the University of Illinois on a football scholarship. Although William was a 180-pound guard for U of I's football team, his true love was baseball. In 1943, William enlisted in the Army and was assigned to Fort Benning, GA, for basic training. The following year, he was sent to an infantry division at Camp McCain, MS. Shortly following, he was transferred to the 319th Combat Engineer Battalion, where he deployed to France in August of 1944 as an Army engineer. While in France on orders to contain a pocket of German soldiers in Lorient and St. Nazaire, he was wounded in battle. Toward the end of the war, he was promoted to second lieutenant and received a Purple Heart medal. Now, William never told his family about receiving a Purple Heart for his service. They found out after noticing his name on the Montana Purple Heart Memorial wall in Billings. But when asked about his prestigious award, he humbly described the incident as ``just a little shrapnel''. But this only speaks true to the man he was. After his service in the Army was up, William attended Penn State University and graduated in 1949 with a degree in geology. He then was hired at Amerada Petroleum Co.--now known as Hess--in Tyler, TX. There he met his wife Christine Wallis, and they were married in May of 1952. William and Christine moved to Regina, SK, Calgary, AB; and ultimately settled in Billings, MT, in 1961. William and Christine had two children--daughter, Priscilla, who now lives in Laurel, and son, Michael William Sampsel, who lives in Tucson, Arizona. Outside of his accomplishments as a geologist, William loved to fish and is remembered for his love of the outdoors. William died on July 19, 2012. William always gave all he had to give, whether it was his knowledge, military service, or help to others in need. His life story is reflective of the dedicated, hard-working, and generous man folks knew. It is my honor to recognize William H. Sampsel's bravery and service to the United States by presenting his family with his Purple Heart, in addition to a Good Conduct Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with four bronze service stars, World War II Victory Medal, Army of Occupation Medal with Germany Clasp, Honorable Service Lapel Button WW II, and a sharpshooter badge and rifle bar. Our Nation is grateful for William's service. ____________________",package_114_56.csv,3871,3871,3940,"[congressional record volume 161, number 145 (monday, october 5, 2015)] [senate] [page s7122] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] remembering william h. sampsel mr. tester. mr. president, i wish to honor william h. sampsel, a veteran of world war ii. on behalf of all montanans and all americans, i stand to say thank you to william for his service to our nation. it is my honor to share the story of william's life and service--a story that most certainly won't be forgotten and a story he perhaps wouldn't have told himself. william, an extremely humble man, never asked to be placed on a pedestal; in fact it was his quiet service that is the landmark of his story. william was born in the midst of the great depression in january of 1925. his parents william h. and marguerite brennan sampsel lived in shenandoah, pa, at the time. his father, william h., was a meter reader with the pennsylvania power and light company and would later become a district manager. his mother, marguerite, cared for five children. from a young age, william developed a strong work ethic that would serve him well throughout his life. he started his first job at the age of 14, clearing forest land by hand, earning a modest wage of $1 a day. by the time he was off to college, he quadrupled his wage to $4 a day. william's high school football coach, al ``ali baba'' barbartsky, a teammate of vince lombardi, helped make it possible for william to attend the university of illinois on a football scholarship. although william was a 180-pound guard for u of i's football team, his true love was baseball. in 1943, william enlisted in the army and was assigned to fort benning, ga, for basic training. the following year, he was sent to an infantry division at camp mccain, ms. shortly following, he was transferred to the 319th combat engineer battalion, where he deployed to france in august of 1944 as an army engineer. while in france on orders to contain a pocket of german soldiers in lorient and st. nazaire, he was wounded in battle. toward the end of the war, he was promoted to second lieutenant and received a purple heart medal. now, william never told his family about receiving a purple heart for his service. they found out after noticing his name on the montana purple heart memorial wall in billings. but when asked about his prestigious award, he humbly described the incident as ``just a little shrapnel''. but this only speaks true to the man he was. after his service in the army was up, william attended penn state university and graduated in 1949 with a degree in geology. he then was hired at amerada petroleum co.--now known as hess--in tyler, tx. there he met his wife christine wallis, and they were married in may of 1952. william and christine moved to regina, sk, calgary, ab; and ultimately settled in billings, mt, in 1961. william and christine had two children--daughter, priscilla, who now lives in laurel, and son, michael william sampsel, who lives in tucson, arizona. outside of his accomplishments as a geologist, william loved to fish and is remembered for his love of the outdoors. william died on july 19, 2012. william always gave all he had to give, whether it was his knowledge, military service, or help to others in need. his life story is reflective of the dedicated, hard-working, and generous man folks knew. it is my honor to recognize william h. sampsel's bravery and service to the united states by presenting his family with his purple heart, in addition to a good conduct medal, european-african-middle eastern campaign medal with four bronze service stars, world war ii victory medal, army of occupation medal with germany clasp, honorable service lapel button ww ii, and a sharpshooter badge and rifle bar. our nation is grateful for william's service. ____________________",3871

I urge all Members to join me in congratulating the people of Taiwan on this momentous occasion. Our great friend in Asia, Taiwan, will be celebrating its 104th anniversary on October 10. Also known as Double Ten Day since it falls on the 10th day of the 10th month, this is Taiwan's National Day and is revered and celebrated in the same fashion as we do the Fourth of July here in America. Mr. Speaker, Taiwan today is a multi-party democracy with a strong economy that is working to ease tensions with Mainland China, while preserving both its political existence and its vibrant national life. This Double Ten Day marks the 102nd anniversary of China's Wuchang Uprising, a significant development in the Xinhai Revolution. Mr. Speaker, Taiwan and my home city of Houston have shared a special bond since 1961 with the establishment of the sister-city relationship between Houston and Taipei. For more than 50 years, economic, cultural, and educational exchanges between these sister cities, and between the United States and Taiwan have flourished, aided significantly by the ease of travel resulting from commencement in June 2015 of direct flights between Houston and Taipei on EVA Airway, a Taiwanese airline company. Mr. Speaker, Taiwan has been a great friend and partner of the United States, and I have no doubt that this important relationship will continue to be a source of strength to our peoples as this new century continues to unfold.

SANCHEZ ______ HON. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of new mexico in the house of representatives Monday, October 5, 2015 Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Charles F. Sanchez, a devoted husband, father and distinguished World War II Veteran. Charles was born on November 11, 1918 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He is a graduate of Albuquerque High School and briefly attended the University of New Mexico. He married the love of his life, Mary F. Lucero, becoming proud parents of six children: Bernie S. Sanchez, Charles E. Sanchez, Sylvia L. Sanchez Wortzman, Paul A. Sanchez, Elaine M. Sanchez Fordice and David G. Sanchez. Corporal Charles F. Sanchez served in the United States Army's 200th Coast Artillery Anti-Aircraft Regiment. In August 1941, he left Albuquerque to serve his country at Clark Air Base, located in the Philippines. Shortly after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Clark Air Base was attacked. Charles' Regiment, led by General Edward P. King, fought bravely against the Japanese assaults in the Bataan Peninsula. However, after several months of fighting and with low supplies, General King surrendered and Charles became one of the tens of thousands of prisoners who endured the infamous Bataan Death March to Camp O'Donnell. Prisoners endured physical abuse, received little food or water, and many were executed along the way. Thousands of Filipino and American prisoners died before they reached Camp O'Donnell in what would become known as one of the most heinous Japanese war crimes. Charles and his first cousin, Herman Tafoya--whom Charles assisted along the way, survived against all odds and completed the 60 mile ordeal. As a prisoner of war, the Japanese forced Charles and his work group to transport ammunition inland into churches where the Japanese thought that it would be safe from U.S. attacks. After that, he was sent to Cabanatuan Prisoner of War Camp where he was required to move and bury bodies. In September 1945, Charles and a friend, Manuel Archuleta from Blanco, New Mexico, were placed on a freight ship to Japan. Conditions were so poor that there was no room to sit or lie down and Charles and Manuel tied themselves together with their belts to keep from falling. After the Japanese surrendered on August 15, 1945--approximately 4 years since he was first deployed to the Philippines--Charles was freed and taken back to the United States. Later that year, Charles finally returned to his home state of New Mexico where he was reunited with his loving family. Charles F. Sanchez will always be known by his friends and family for the sacrifices he bravely made for his country. It is my sincere honor to preserve his story in the Congressional Record, so everyone may remember and take pride in the life of one of New Mexico's greatest sons. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 145 (Monday, October 5, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1421] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING CHARLES F.

She had been diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer more than six years before her death but kept her illness almost entirely to herself. She reportedly only informed her sister, Joan, two weeks before she died. Jackie wrote five books since the initial diagnosis.

She refused to let her cancer define her. October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month--a time to recognize breast cancer as the most common cancer among women and to honor those fighters, survivors and families it impacts. Best-selling author Jackie Collins was among those fighters. While Collins' name might be one we recognize, her story of struggle and perseverance is universal. Women from across our nation and around the globe battle breast cancer every day. In fact, The American Cancer Society's estimates nearly 300,000 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed in the United States this year; resulting in over 40,000 deaths. That equates to one woman out of every eight women receiving this dreadful diagnosis. And for them the battle will not end when October ends. As the son and brother of breast cancer survivors, I understand the importance of breast cancer awareness beyond the pink ribbons.

LOIS FRANKEL of florida in the house of representatives Monday, October 5, 2015 Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the one year anniversary of the dedication of the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial, a permanent reminder of the enduring sacrifices of our nation's veterans. The memorial was dedicated on October 5, 2014 to honor the more than 3.6 million men and women currently living with service-related disabilities. As a result of their service, many veterans are left permanently injured, ill or disabled. These men and women must face the challenges of living with visible and invisible burdens every day. Nearly 20 years ago, my friend and constituent Ms. Lois Pope, asked Art Wilson, National Adjutant of the Disabled American Veterans, if there is a place in Washington, D.C. where we honor disabled veterans. When Art responded that there was no such thing, Ms. Pope replied, ``We need to change that.'' Years later, thanks to the tireless work of Ms. Pope and the rest of the advocates at the Disabled Veterans' Life Memorial Foundation, this monument now ensures that we will never forget the sacrifices made by members of the United States Armed Forces. I would also like to recognize broad support across Congress for honoring disabled veterans on October 5th of each year. The anniversary of the memorial's dedication provides an opportunity to express appreciation for the men and women who suffer from service-connected disabilities and to recognize their enduring struggles. Today, October 5, 2015, a screening of the documentary film ``Debt of Honor'' in Washington, D.C. will depict the realities of living with wartime sacrifices. This film will debut on national television on November 10th on PBS. As the mother of a veteran myself, I want to thank all of the veterans living with disabilities for their sacrifices and assure them that they will not be forgotten. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 145 (Monday, October 5, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1422] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICAN VETERANS DISABLED FOR LIFE MEMORIAL ______ HON.
