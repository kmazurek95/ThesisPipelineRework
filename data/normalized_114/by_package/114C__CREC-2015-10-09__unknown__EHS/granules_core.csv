But I would like to take just this 1 minute to mark the retirement of my former boss, a guy named Bill Leaver, who is now CEO of a health system called UnityPoint. It is one of the largest nonprofit nondenominational health systems in America. I met him first more than 10, 15 years ago when I wrote a profile about him as a newspaper reporter. I knew from the very start that this is a guy who understood the needs of the community, the needs of those who needed to acquire health care and have access to quality health care. He was my mentor, my friend, and my boss. I wish Bill Leaver all the best in his future. He and his wife, Jeannie, are more than deserving of having this next chapter of their life be one of their most successful. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [House] [Page H6940] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING BILL LEAVER (Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)

Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss an example of the real-life consequences of underinvesting in scientific research and development. Last week, with the development of Hurricane Joaquin, we were reminded that U.S. weather forecasting is not what it should be. Our system, GFS, predicted that Joaquin would hit the Mid-Atlantic States, while the European model correctly predicted that it would remain at sea, and nobody predicted the severity of the flooding that would hit South Carolina. This wasn't the first time that our predictions have missed the mark. Three years ago we failed to predict the path of Hurricane Sandy, while the European model correctly identified that it would be a direct and devastating hit on New Jersey. After Sandy, we invested somewhat more money into the computing ability of the National Weather Service, but, as Joaquin has shown, it was too little, too late. The economic costs of unnecessary evacuations are as real as missing evacuations. Scientific research requires a steady investment of time and talent to be successful. If we continue to underinvest in essential infrastructure like weather forecasting, we do it at our own peril. I urge my colleagues to heed this warning and to start taking seriously the long-term investments that our R&D infrastructure requires. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [House] [Page H6940] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WEATHER FORECASTING (Mr. FOSTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 702. This measure will amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 to repeal the President's authority to restrict the export of coal, petroleum products, natural gas, or other petrochemical feedstocks. The bill specifically prohibits any Federal official from imposing or enforcing any restriction on the export of crude oil. Why is this important? Because at a time when America's energy innovation is at an all-time high, we can be a helpful strategic partner to our partners overseas that need energy and don't have to turn to unreliable partners like Russia, like the Middle East, and others to have their energy needs met. America can be helpful in that regard and, therefore, have stronger allies that don't have to be beholden to those other sources. It will bring jobs back home to the United States in our ever-developing energy sources. Mr. Speaker, I urge the House today to support H.R. 702, to strengthen U.S. options, U.S. jobs, and strengthen our allies in our ability to be able to serve them with our energy development that we have had in this country and, therefore, have a stronger bond with them. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [House] [Page H6940] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ENERGY FLEXIBILITY FOR OUR STRATEGIC PARTNERS (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize high school principal of the year for 2015, Grant Hanevold of Sunrise Mountain High School in Las Vegas. I have always believed that providing the Nation's youth with a quality education is one of the best investments that we can make to ensure that this century is yet another American century. Principal Hanevold represents the spirit of service that is often missed at too many of our Nation's schools. He understands that educators must invest time and effort in their communities which they serve. By incorporating teachers, parents, and community members into the decisionmaking process, Principal Hanevold was able to get everyone to buy in on his vision and take pride in what they were accomplishing together. This established a culture of success at Sunrise Mountain that ultimately led to a remarkable 13 percent increase in graduation rates.

CREC-2015-10-09-pt1-PgH6941-4,CREC-2015-10-09,114,ADAPTATION TO CHANGING CRUDE OIL MARKETS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6941-H6965] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ADAPTATION TO CHANGING CRUDE OIL MARKETS general leave Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material in the Record on the bill, H.R. 702. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 466 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 702. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hultgren) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. {time} 1003 In the Committee of the Whole Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 702) to adapt to changing crude oil market conditions, with Mr. Hultgren in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Harper), a member of the committee. Mr. HARPER. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 702, but, more importantly, I rise today in support of American jobs. The U.S. daily production of oil has increased dramatically in the past 14 years. That number is projected to continue to increase due to advances in technology, but companies need a new market. At this point, the ban is not protecting the economy. Instead, the economy is being restricted, and Americans are being denied jobs. My district and State rely on good-paying oil industry jobs. At a time when our economy can't afford to see unemployment numbers rise, oil companies are being forced to cut back their workforce. Lifting the ban on crude oil exports will mean new jobs for Mississippians that will allow them to support their families. I urge my colleagues to support and vote for H.R. 702 and for American jobs. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 702, a poorly crafted bill that needlessly and recklessly sweeps away 40 years of critical energy protections for national security, our economy, consumers, and the environment. H.R. 702 is a blunt object that doesn't just undermine current protective authorities related to crude oil; it also prohibits any Federal official from taking any action at any time if that action either restricts or enforces a restriction on the export of oil. The term ``restriction'' is undefined and potentially dangerous in scope. The bill would also override any other law that would impose any restriction by any Federal official on exports. That means that the bill does nothing to preserve any environment or safety statutes or regulations, and it doesn't even preserve the Defense Production Act, one of the most important tools any President has to ensure our national energy security in the face of a threat. Let's be clear, Mr. Chairman. The President has already stated that he will veto this bill. Further, any legislation of this nature is completely unnecessary since the President already has the authority to ease or even remove restrictions on crude oil exports, and the Obama administration has taken major steps to exercise that authority by approving crude oil swaps with Mexico and applications for the export of condensate. The bottom line, Mr. Chairman, is that it is imperative for Congress to consider a host of factors before we lift the current restrictions and, certainly, if we are to completely dismantle our Nation's ability to restrict oil exports, as proposed by H.R. 702. First, Mr. Chairman, there are consumer impacts, especially related to the price of crude oil and gasoline. A recent study found that changes to U.S. oil export policy will have little to no impact on the future price of oil. What we do know is that changes in our crude oil policy will lead to a significant payday for oil producers, with increases in annual profits approaching $30 billion by 2025. Next, there are the impacts on our refinery capacity and associated jobs, well-paying middle class jobs that have grown over the past few years due to increased production. Unrestricted exports of crude oil put those jobs at jeopardy and could mean exporting those jobs and losing out on critical investments in future refining capacity. And finally, Mr. Chairman, there are, of course, the environmental and climate impacts of lifting the export ban. Energy policy is fundamentally linked to environmental policy. Each is a facet of the other. Increasing crude oil exports means increasing domestic production and its impacts on climate change, public health, worker safety, property owners, and protection of our drinking water supplies. As I have said before, this legislation eagerly embraces short-term profits and benefits without understanding or even considering the cost of such a major action. We simply can't afford to make that mistake. We should ensure we fully understand and consider the enduring consequences of our actions and choose the cleanest and most sustainable path forward. I don't believe, Mr. Chairman, that the potential impacts of H.R. 702 on national security, on the economy, on consumers, and on the environment can be considered acceptable. So, Mr. Chairman, increased crude exports certainly help oil companies. It is a bonanza for the oil companies, but without any guaranteed benefits for consumers. I urge my colleagues to join me and the President in saying ``no'' to this legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Parliamentary Inquiries Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I have a parliamentary inquiry. The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. BARTON. My understanding, in general debate, the majority, or proponents, have 30 minutes, and then the opponents have 30 minutes; is that correct? [[Page H6942]] The CHAIR. On this bill, yes, the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce each control 30 minutes. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar), the original Democrat sponsor, have 6 minutes of the proponent's time to control as he sees fit. The CHAIR. The Chair cannot entertain a unanimous consent request to change the scheme for control of general debate. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I have an additional parliamentary inquiry. The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. BARTON. Could the Chair educate the illiterate Member from Texas on how I could give Mr. Cuellar time that he may control on his side? If I can't yield it unanimously, how can I do that? The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas may yield from his own time to engage in debate, and may yield to Members on the other side of the aisle. Mr. BARTON. Continuing the parliamentary inquiry, if I do that, can he reserve part of that time, or does he have to use it all in one slot? The CHAIR. The other gentleman from Texas would not control the time. Mr. BARTON. He could not reserve any of it? The CHAIR. Correct. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson). Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for the time to speak on this bill, which I wholeheartedly support, because ending this oil export ban will not only boost our economy, it will also improve our foreign policy. I also rise with hesitation to a proposed amendment that would remove a provision of this bill boosting payments to the 60 ships of our maritime security fleet. These ships are essential in transporting cargo to the men and women of our Armed Forces who are serving overseas in harm's way. As evidence of this, 90 percent of all cargo moved to Iraq and Afghanistan has been transported on these privately owned ships. As of right now, Mr. Chairman, the stipend provided by the government is too low to make this program viable to those who have stepped up to defend our Nation against foreign threats. Without this increase, it is likely that participants will drop out of the program. This, obviously, is a national security threat. It is estimated that for the government to replicate this program, it would cost more than $50 billion in taxpayer money. This programs saves money while enhancing our security, and I encourage my colleagues to avoid supporting this amendment, but voting ``yes'' to lift this outdated oil export ban. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F. Doyle). Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this bill. I have been here in Congress for 21 years, and during that time, we always hear talk about we want to be energy-independent in the United States. My colleagues on both sides of the aisle always talk about the dream of energy independence, where we don't have to depend on any other country for our oil. It would change policy in the Middle East, and it would dramatically improve our national security. Well, the bad news is, Mr. Chairman, we are not energy-independent. We use 17 million barrels of oil a day, but we only produce 9 million, which means we are still importing nearly half of all the oil we use. Now, here is the good news, Mr. Chairman. Horizontal drilling and all this oil we are finding in the shale formations gives us a chance to be truly energy-independent. We could produce an additional 9 million barrels a day, and we wouldn't have to depend on any other country in the world for our oil. All we have to do is produce what we have in our own country and make sure that we have refinery capacity to take care of this light sweet crude, and we are energy-independent. So the question is, Mr. Chairman, why aren't we investing in our own domestic refinery capacity to keep high-paying jobs here in the United States in the refinery industry, in the maritime trades, and in manufacturing, like steelmaking? Why aren't we doing that for America while enhancing America's security? We had the former commander of the USS Cole, Kirk Lippold, testify before our committee. He highlighted ``the significant national security risks associated with greater oil imports.'' He said that ``too many times in recent history, the U.S. has made oil deals with hostile or unfriendly governments that actually threaten our foreign policy and our national security objectives. ``Lifting the export ban will undermine U.S. power projection capabilities by undermining the competitiveness of our U.S. refineries.'' Do we really want to undermine the U.S. military? And then we hear the story that, somehow, lifting this ban is going to help our European allies because it will reduce their dependence on Russian oil. Well, that is a myth, too. As Commander Lippold testified before our committee, ``the primary recipient of this U.S. exported oil is going to be Asia, specifically, China.'' {time} 1015 So we want to export U.S. oil to China and still have to import oil from countries that aren't necessarily friendly to us. Why would we do that? Mr. Chairman, H.R. 702 is deeply flawed because it doesn't allow for any future oversight of oil exports under any circumstances. Even if there is an oil spike or a shortage, there is no ``safety valve'' to ensure that we have enough of this critical resource for our Armed Forces, our industries, and our constituents. In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, this bill undermines our national security, and we are still importing an incredible amount of oil. This just defies common sense, and we should reject it. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Mimi Walters), a cosponsor of the bill. Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 702, legislation that would lift the 40-year-old ban on U.S. oil exports. In 1975, President Gerald Ford signed the ban into law in response to gasoline shortages and the Arab oil embargo. While the ban served a purpose nearly 40 years ago, much has changed since that time. Today we need an energy policy that aligns with our current economic and political climate. The United States is the largest petroleum and natural gas producer in the world. Our self-imposed export ban doesn't make sense and does nothing but hinder economic growth. If the ban is lifted this year, over 57,000 new supply chain jobs would be created in my home State of California by 2018, and nationwide nearly 450,000 new jobs would be created. Having the option to put U.S. crude oil on the world market would benefit Americans. Lifting the ban would create jobs, strengthen the U.S. economy, and help reduce our trade deficit. It would also provide the international marketplace with more options, in turn, limiting the ability of energy commodities to be used as political weapons. It is important to note that this bill doesn't require the U.S. to export crude oil. It simply provides the option needed for barrels to be used in the areas where they are needed most. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time so the Republicans can have another speaker. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hinojosa) at the request of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar), who is my original Democrat sponsor. Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support and as a cosponsor of H.R. 702, which lifts the ban on crude oil exports. Modern advances in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have allowed the United States access to large deposits of crude oil and natural gas. Last year our country produced over 350 million barrels of crude oil, and that number is steadily increasing. The crude oil in our deposits is lighter and sweeter than the traditional heavy crude oil our refineries process. The export ban hinders our access to international markets that need the [[Page H6943]] sweeter type of crude and that have the refinement infrastructure for it. I am convinced that lifting the outdated crude oil export ban will create jobs and economic opportunities for our communities as we strive for greater energy independence. In the great State of Texas, lifting the export ban is estimated to increase the annual GDP by over $7.1 billion and create over 40,000 new supply chain jobs. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BARTON. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds on behalf of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar). Mr. HINOJOSA. According to the Government Accountability Office, removing export restrictions will create employment opportunities, expand trade, and lower gasoline prices. The economic and political landscape has evolved since the ban's inception in the 1970s. I am confident that now is the time to repeal the ban on the export of crude oil to increase our economic and energy competitiveness. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 702. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green). Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 702. In the past 10 years, the United States has undergone an energy revolution. Our production of oil and gas has far exceeded all analysis or prediction. The success in the field has materialized into jobs in our district in the Houston area, both in the chemical and the refining industries. The price of oil dropped from $100 a barrel to $45 a barrel. Gasoline prices have fallen from $4 per gallon to less than $2 in Houston. I have represented our refinery complexes for many years. All of these benefited our economy and the consumer. Unfortunately, the success has brought hardship upon the upstream producers. The energy sector, which led our country out of the recession, has now laid off approximately 150,000 folks. Bloomberg estimated that 40 percent of those layoffs were in Texas. I know the oil patch is facing a tough and difficult time, and I want to help. That is why it is very difficult for me to oppose this bill today. I support crude oil exports while protecting our domestic manufacturing jobs, including refining. We have the resource. We should use as much as possible here at home and sell what is left. I am a legislator who would like to solve this problem, and I like working across the party lines to get results. In fact, I worked with my good friend from Texas, Joe Barton, on many issues during our years in Congress. In fact, Joe and I sat together for years at the Texas A&M football games until we realized A&M would lose when we sat next to each other. So last Saturday, when they beat Mississippi State, we sat a ways apart so we didn't jinx them. For months, I talked with Representative Barton about the crude export issue. The crude oil export ban has been in place since 1975. In the seventies, the United States was in a tough spot, and we put the ban in place to protect our national interests. That is more than 40 years of legislative history. Before we throw all of that away, we should make sure we have a policy that will make sense for the next 40 years. I am hoping we can craft a bill that would create a process at the Bureau of Industry and Security within the Department of Commerce that would establish an authorization and reporting requirements for crude oil. Crude oil is a valuable national resource, and the government should have some oversight as to where and when we send it overseas. We export liquefied natural gas through a process developed at the Department of Energy. I have not been a fan of that process, but we have worked to improve it. We should have some basic requirements at the Department of Commerce to oversee crude. Unlike LNG, crude is a raw commodity. Unlike refined products, raw crude oil doesn't have value added. Our refiners add value to that, and we export that refined product. So those are jobs created in our community. Building LNG terminals and exporting refined product creates good- paying jobs and lots of capital expenditure. If exporting crude is the right policy, then let's do it correctly. Let's maximize the benefits for the United States. Let's make sure U.S. crude doesn't end up in the hands of North Korea or any of our other foes. We need to know where this resource is going, how much of it is being sent, and how often it is being sent there. We need to ensure that, if at any time, a potential bad actor enters the marketplace; the Department of Commerce has the ability to enforce the law. The Department of Commerce is not an obstacle to exports. In fact, I have struggled to find a more industry-friendly government agency. The Department of Commerce has approved every application to export oil in the last five years. That's 138 permits. What's more impressive is Commerce approves 99 percent of all export applications, regardless of product. Now, I agree that the Department could approve permits more efficiently but that's something we can legislate. That's a ``fix'' I can support and believe would help our upstream producers. Unfortunately, we were unable to find that compromise. I did not want to oppose this bill but without changes it is not in the best interest of our country. The time to address exports is now but we cannot just open the tap and hope for the best. I do not want the United States to become a resource nation and I certainly do not want to go back to the days of the 1970s. I look forward to working on this issue again and hope that a reasonable, commonsense approach can be reached. I want folks in all sectors to get back to work. For these reasons, I am forced to oppose H.R. 702 and I urge all my colleagues to do the same. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds to respond to what the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green) just said. The whole concept of this bill is to let willing buyers interact with willing sellers in a free market, transparent fashion. If you subject the bill to some sort of a discretionary permitting requirement, as one of Mr. Gene Green's amendments would have done, you gut the bill. You destroy the entire purpose of the bill. So as much as I respect my good friend from Houston, Texas, I respectfully have to object to that amendment. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Lance), a member of the committee. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Chairman, I commend Chairman Emeritus Barton's tremendous leadership on this issue. I rise today in strong support of the bill, bipartisan in nature, which will create thousands of American jobs, generate billions of dollars in revenues to States and locals, and use our Nation's natural resources as a counterbalance to the rogue actors currently dominating world oil markets. American energy brings security and independence to the world and jobs and economic development to the United States. It makes no sense that Iranian oil will soon be permitted to flow, but American-made energy is left untapped. It is time to end the outdated restrictions on the export of U.S. oil and, instead, work to create and protect tens of thousands of U.S. jobs, enhance our national security, and help keep prices at the pump affordable for all consumers across the country. American energy brings growth, prosperity, security, and independence to the United States and our allies. Our Nation should counter Iran and create thousands of U.S. jobs in the process. Please vote for H.R. 702. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, may I ask how much time there is on both sides. The CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey has 20\1/2\ minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 24 minutes remaining. Mr. PALLONE. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the great State of New Mexico (Mr. Pearce), one of our original cosponsors and a strong proponent of this bill. [[Page H6944]] Mr. PEARCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I appreciate his work on this important proposition. Mr. Chairman, for almost my entire life, the Nation has worked under prevailing science that said we have reached peak energy, we are out, that we have to plan for the future because we have no more oil. Two years ago a discovery was found in New Mexico that will provide more oil from that one find than has been produced in our State from its entire history through the entire geographic part of New Mexico. The science was a lie. We are finding oil. What is happening right now is that the refineries use a heavy sour crude. The new finds in shale are producing light sweet, which is more valuable. It is easier to refine. Yet, that light sweet oil is sitting in the pipelines in New Mexico, trying to get to Houston. It is selling at $17 below the market cost because there is no destination. The Baltics have said they would use our oil, they would put our workers back to work. But this law prevents it. The law in place, H.R. 702, simply says: Open that door and put Americans back to work, Americans driving trucks, Americans at the convenient stores. Americans everywhere get the jobs. The idea that this somehow undercuts jobs is absolutely a frivolous idea to present on this House floor. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush), the ranking member of the subcommittee. Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, over the past couple of months, I have worked tirelessly to find a reasonable compromise with the sponsor of H.R. 702, my friend and colleague from Texas (Mr. Barton), that would allow me and others with similarly situated constituencies to support this bill. Although I share the concerns of many of my Democratic colleagues on how this bill might impact the environment and climate change, I have always stated that I believe in the all-of-the-above energy approach that balances environmental concerns and economic opportunities. Mr. Chairman, yesterday in the Rules Committee I advocated for an open rule process that would have allowed Democrats to offer amendments that would reflect priorities and concerns of the minority party. In fact, Mr. Chairman, I myself submitted an amendment that would have expanded access for minority- and women-owned firms to more fully participate in the energy supply chain, which we know will be greatly enhanced if the export ban is lifted. Mr. Chairman, although my friends in the environmental community wouldn't agree, in my district, we say: Oil is not just a commodity. Oil is indeed an economic opportunity. {time} 1030 Mr. Chairman, my most pressing concern is making sure up front and from the beginning that minority firms would be part of the pipeline economy and would directly benefit from vendor and contracting opportunities that lifting this ban would create. Instead, Mr. Chairman, despite positive rhetoric from members of the majority party, a closed rule was adopted. While my comprehensive amendment was not allowed, Members are asked to vote now on Trojan horse amendments that would do nothing to actually benefit minorities and women as my far-reaching amendment was designed to do. Rather than shielding the majority party from charges of creating a multibillion-dollar boondoggle for the energy industry, today there is not much in this bill as currently drafted that I can point to as really benefiting all segments of the American population. As I have said time and time and time again, cut us in or cut it out. Cut us in or cut it out. Cut women in or cut it out. Cut the minorities in or cut it out. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, we will put the gentleman from Illinois down as undecided on the bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Flores), who is the chairman of the Republican Study Committee and a member of the committee. He is from the home of the Fightin' Texas Aggies. Mr. FLORES. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 702. H.R. 702 results in five key benefits: Number one, it benefits the American consumer with resulting overall lower energy prices. This particularly benefits lower-income and lower- middle-income Americans, providing greater financial security for these hardworking families. Number two, it benefits the American producer and allows them to further reinvest in our domestic energy infrastructure, furthering our energy security and American jobs. Number three, it benefits our geopolitical standing and strengthens ties with our global friends and allies, and it hurts those countries like Russia, Iran, and Venezuela who are opposed to American interests around the world. Number four, it benefits the downstream refining community, as lower prices will stimulate volume demand for refined products. This volume gives them more financial capital to hire skilled American workers and to reinvest in their operation. Number five, it strengthens our national defense by enhancing the Maritime Security Program, which supports a robust Merchant Marine for use by our military during times of international crisis. These are five critical reasons why everybody wins after we lift the ban. The President has threatened to veto this commonsense bill, and hardworking American families all over this country should ask: Mr. President, why are you putting the interests of Iranian terrorists ahead of the interests of hardworking American families? Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge my colleagues to reject the Amash amendment and to support H.R. 702. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Eshoo). Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chairman, I thank our ranking member. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this legislation for several reasons. First, except in very narrow circumstances, the bill does not allow any limits--not any limits--on exports of domestic oil regardless of potential threats to our national security, and that is our top responsibility as Members--our national security. For decades there has been a bipartisan commitment in Congress and several administrations to energy independence and reducing our reliance on foreign oil. Given the continued dependence of our economy and our military on oil, energy independence remains critical to our national defense. But with little consideration of any national security implications, this bill allows unlimited exports of a critical strategic resource. Mr. Chairman, the United States still imports 26 percent of the oil we consume and remains the world's top importer. Every barrel exported under this bill would have to be replaced by a barrel imported from elsewhere, leaving us more reliant on foreign countries. The bill allows the President to limit exports only if he declares an emergency under the National Emergencies Act or the International Emergency Economic Powers Act or if he is directed by the International Energy Agency to respond to an international supply crisis. Outside of these narrow circumstances, the bill permits no restrictions on exports of crude oil. This means strategic considerations such as decreasing our reliance on imports from unfriendly regimes can play no part in deciding whether to allow exports. I don't think that is a good deal at all. The bill also will have drastic impacts on the U.S. shipbuilding industry, tanker fleet, and refineries, all of which are critical to our national defense. Congress has recognized for nearly 100 years that it benefits our national security to maintain a robust domestic shipbuilding industry and commercial shipping fleet. For example, crude exports from Alaska which were legalized in 1995 must be carried on U.S.-flagged vessels crewed by Americans. This bill contains no requirement that exports be carried on U.S.-flagged tankers. Under current law, the President can allow exports of crude oil if he finds they are in the national interest. This bill would allow unlimited exports regardless of whether they are in the national security interests of the United [[Page H6945]] States or not. I think that this is a slippery slope. Commander Kirk Lippold, the retired Navy Captain of the USS Cole, testified before Congress earlier this year. The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman. Ms. ESHOO. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Chairman, the retired Navy Captain of the USS Cole said the following: ``The national security implications of changing the existing policy regulating the export of crude oil are rife with unknown and probably unintended consequences that must be fully considered and addressed.'' I agree with Commander Lippold. This bill largely ignores those important national security concerns, and it is why I urge my colleagues to oppose it. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), from the energy capital of the world, Houston, Texas. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, the administration has worked very hard to make sure the export ban on crude oil from Iran is lifted. But the administration has threatened to veto this bill that would lift the crude oil sanction ban on American oil. That doesn't make any sense to me--help the Iranians sell their excess crude oil abroad, but prevent America from selling our excess crude oil abroad. That is nutty. Why does the President prefer the Iranians over Americans? It doesn't make any sense. The President should at least give us the same deal that he gave the Iranians: lift sanctions on them, lift the sanctions on American oil. We have a surplus. We need to sell it. ``Use all we can and sell the rest.'' That is the motto. And that is just the way it is. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I believe we are lopsided on the time a little again, so I would like to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Could we ask what the time differential is, Mr. Chairman? The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 20\1/2\ minutes remaining. The gentleman from New Jersey has 14 minutes remaining. Mr. BARTON. At this time, Mr. Chairman, I am very honored to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton). Chairman Upton is the distinguished chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee from the great State of Michigan and my good friend. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I really thank Chairman Emeritus Barton for doing a really significant, good job on getting this bill bipartisan support and working so hard over the last 18 months or so, and both in the last Congress and this Congress, to get this bill ready for the floor today. Mr. Chairman, much has changed since the ban on crude oil was put in place in 1975. At that time, Congress and President Ford were responding to the Arab oil embargo crisis in an effort to protect this country from the unwanted impacts of the unstable global crude oil market. But we got good news today. Times have changed, and one of the biggest threats to the American energy boom today is not an international actor but, rather, our own ban on oil exports. Lifting the crude oil export ban is a win for our economy, yes, it is. Study after study has shown that lifting the ban would actually lower prices at the pump, create thousands of jobs, generate hundreds of millions of dollars in economic benefits, and strengthen our geopolitical influence across the globe. It will actually also reduce the deficit by more than $1 billion with additional oil royalties. These are real benefits that will be felt not only in southwest Michigan, my district, but across the country; yet, somehow, this administration does not support this thoughtful solution. Let's look at the benefits. According to the nonpartisan GAO, lifting the ban could lower prices by 1.5 to 13 cents a gallon, real savings that add up for every family's budget. Some estimates suggest that it could support the creation of an average of 394,000 jobs. Additionally, the bill before us would boost royalty payments, as I indicated, from Federal oil and gas leases. Collectively, all of these gains provide the making of a success story that would greatly benefit our economy at a time of great uncertainty. This administration often likes to say that they are for an all-of- the-above energy policy, but the rhetoric, indeed, falls well short of reality. It doesn't make much sense that the White House is gung ho to lift the export ban in Iran, but when it comes to this country, the answer is ``no.'' The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, this bipartisan bill would strengthen our hand in foreign diplomacy at a time when America has lost its standing on the global stage. By exporting our excess crude oil, we can help our allies seeking a safe and secure supply of energy. Instead of being beholden to OPEC and Russia for their energy needs, they can instead rely on their friends, the United States of America. Creating jobs, keeping energy affordable, boosting energy production, and improving our energy security--that is what this bill does. I would urge my colleagues to support the Barton bill in a vote later on this morning. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps). Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 702. Not only does this bill incentivize more oil development while ignoring its impact on our climate, it also essentially guarantees billions more in profits for oil companies while doing virtually nothing to help consumers. There are many more important issues that we should be spending our time on to actually help American families, like raising the minimum wage and making college more affordable, but instead we are passing a bill to help oil companies make more money. Additionally, section 3 of the bill prohibits any Federal official from taking any action that could potentially restrict the export of oil. This broad language could seriously undermine critical health and safety responsibilities of the Federal Government. For example, under current law, the Secretary of Transportation has the authority to shut down a crude oil pipeline if it poses a threat to life, property, or the environment. But what if an oil pipeline leading to an export terminal were in imminent danger of rupturing? Would the Secretary still have the authority to shut down that line, or would that action be considered a restriction on exporting crude oil under this bill? Mr. Chairman, these are not hypothetical questions. This authority was recently used in my district to shut down line 901 of the Plains All American Pipeline when it ruptured last May. Since line 901 is the only way for the nearby offshore oil platforms to transport their oil to refineries, these platforms have had to shut down production entirely. Nearly 5 months after the spill, line 901 remains shut down, and there is no indication that it will be restarted in the near future. It is not hard to imagine a similar event happening again, and the Secretary's authority to protect public health, property, and the environment during such an event must not be undermined. {time} 1045 Yet, if this bill were law, the Secretary's authority could be preempted entirely by section 3 of this bill. In other words, the bill could create a scenario in which the perceived right of oil companies to export their oil supersedes our very real responsibility to protect public health and safety. The American people deserve better. This is a fatally flawed bill and sets the wrong priorities. I urge its defeat. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), from District One of the great Pelican State, the distinguished Republican whip. Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my friend from Texas for yielding, but also for his leadership in bringing this bill to the floor and building a strong bipartisan coalition to finally lift the ban on oil exports. Mr. Chairman, this is a relic of the 1970s that doesn't fit with today's [[Page H6946]] world economy, but it also doesn't fit with the revolution that has happened in American energy because of American technology. We have an abundance of natural resources now and an abundance of oil. We literally could be the Saudi Arabia of energy. Yet, there is a law that is on the books that bans the ability of the United States to export its own oil. There is no other nation in the world that has that limitation on their ability to sell that natural resource. Mr. Chairman, at a time when the President is actually supporting this horrible deal with Iran that, among other things, allows Iran to export their oil to the world markets, the President at the same time is saying he opposes this bill that allows America to export its oil. What is at stake, Mr. Chairman? What is at stake under this bill, if this bill passes, is it will create over 800,000 American jobs, good American jobs, here at home. If this bill passes, Mr. Chairman, we can actually create over $800 million to reduce the deficit, deficit reduction, just by passing this bill. What is also at stake, Mr. Chairman, if we pass this bill? We can help our allies around the world who don't want to have to get their oil from countries like Russia, where Vladimir Putin is using energy as a weapon against our friends. They can now get that energy from us. Creating American jobs along the way, everything about this says yes. It is time to lift this relic of the 1970s. Let's finally allow American oil to be exported on world markets when we have such an abundance and we have the ability to create hundreds of thousands of new American jobs along the way. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor). Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I thank Ranking Member Pallone for yielding the time. I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 702. The bill is an irresponsible giveaway to Big Oil at the expense of America's national security, at the expense of American consumers, and our longstanding policy of working towards energy independence. Now, our current policy is not a ban. You can call it a ban, but it is not a ban. It allows and promotes oil exports to strategically important allies, to places in the national interest. It is a smart policy. But now Big Oil wants free rein to ship America's natural resources to countries not in our national interest. This bill will eviscerate our thoughtful policy. Despite assertions that the oil will go to allies in Europe and elsewhere, that is not supported by the facts. Who is most likely to benefit? Experts say China. The Energy Information Administration projects that China's oil consumption will double over the next 2 decades. China has been very aggressive all across the globe in exploiting and locking down natural resources. They have gone to Africa. They have gone to South America. While we have been fighting battles in Afghanistan, they have been locking down contracts for natural resources in Afghanistan. At the same time that America is dealing with Chinese cyber espionage and their geopolitical confrontations with our allies and the U.S., why would we help China gain a strategic foothold on America's natural resources? I would think that America's national security interests would compel you to defeat this bill. You should also vote this bill down and side with American consumers instead and American jobs. America is still heavily dependent on imports of crude oil. We still import 25 percent today. Any claims that sending American oil overseas would help consumers in America is entirely unsupported, no matter how many times they say it. Instead, what the studies show is that exporting American oil would feed the uncertainty of oil markets and likely increase costs to American consumers. Back home in Tampa right now you can go to the gas station and fill up your tank at about $1.99 per gallon. So it defies logic to say that changing this policy that is working for America right now would really lower the price. I don't think so. American jobs are also very likely to take a hit if this bill becomes law. Why? Because of the important jobs in the refining industry, the shipping industry. Those are American jobs. Side with the American jobs. This bill is very poor public policy. Exports will be determined only by Big Oil to serve the interests of Big Oil, ceding complete control of this strategic national asset. The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. PALLONE. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Just to close, Mr. Chairman, the cost to U.S. consumers, our policy of energy independence, our national security interests compel a ``no'' vote on this bill. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Cincinnati, the Buckeye State of Ohio (Mr. Chabot). Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I have the honor of leading the House Small Business Committee. A few months back we held a hearing on this very topic. We heard from small businesses about how this ban is holding them back. That is the untold story of this. This ban is hurting small businesses all across this country. America is now the largest producer of oil and gas in the world. Lifting this decades-old ban is an opportunity to jump-start the economy. It would help 1 million Americans find work. It would increase the GDP. It would narrow the trade deficit, attract new capital to the U.S., and stabilize the global energy supply. If America is going to lead the world in the 21st century, let's not keep one hand tied behind our back. Let's replace outdated energy policies with ones that are forward-thinking, ones that will create new jobs in a new American century. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. David Scott). Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentleman, this bill is about two things. It is about jobs and it is about national security. It will give us an opportunity to get Congress to join in with my good friend from North Dakota, Kevin Cramer, and Brad Ashford from Nebraska, because this is about jobs and nobody needs jobs more than African Americans. The hardest hit on unemployment is African American males. This allows us to be a part of being able to get language in that will help African American males get the kind of apprenticeship training with the Teamsters, with the AFL-CIO, with the operating engineers, all of those unions and contractors who are rebuilding this infrastructure for this oil. Now, on national security, make no mistake about it, ladies and gentlemen. What do you think Russia is doing over in the Middle East? They want dominance over energy in the world, and he who controls the energy in the world controls the world. That is why they want to prop up Syria, because that is the seaport to get it out of the Middle East. Stand up for jobs for the American people and protect the world from Russia. Vote to lift the ban on the oil exports. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I just want to say ``amen'' to what the gentleman from Georgia just said. Mr. Chairman, what time is remaining on each side? The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 15 minutes remaining. The gentleman from New Jersey has 7\1/2\ minutes remaining. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the entire delegation from the great State of North Dakota (Mr. Cramer), the original cosponsor of the bill. Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman. I have often said I don't know why it takes 36 Texans to do one person's job. I have to tell you, I was prepared to give a great speech and then I listened to my friend from Georgia and, quite honestly, I feel inadequate to the task. Because you stated it so eloquently and so beautifully, and I am committed to exactly what you talked about. So maybe what I will try to do instead in my remaining seconds is remind us of the context that it was 72 [[Page H6947]] years ago this week that the Yom Kippur War broke out that led to U.S. aid to Israel, which led to a 5 percent reduction out of OPEC of oil, which led to the very issue we are talking about today, that this historical context in a national security context is not irrelevant. Let's not, I would say, let history repeat itself, but let's use the peaceful tools of energy development while creating jobs in America replace the weapons of war in Europe and in the Middle East. Let's use our influence for good by selling this American-made product that is produced by American workers, and let's do it in a bipartisan fashion today. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan), on behalf of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar). Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman. I am normally on the opposite side of the gentleman on the congressional baseball team and normally with Congressman Doyle. So I hope we can win this one against Congressman Mike Doyle. So I thank the gentleman for the opportunity. Two or three points I would like to make, Mr. Chairman. One, in Ohio, lifting this ban means 16,000 jobs in Ohio, almost $3 billion in investment. Our friends, the operating engineers and the laborers who are going to do that work, are supportive of this bill. I know we have some issues with the refineries, and I think we need to continue to work on that and see if we can fix that issue. We have a number of studies that say the savings to the American consumer will be anywhere from 2 cents a gallon all the way up to 12 cents a gallon. Colombia University, Brookings, Aspen, Resources for the Future, all are saying this is going to reduce the cost of gas, which is a direct benefit for our consumers and our constituents who need it as we see this huge economic squeeze for the middle class. Lastly, I have been sitting on the Defense Appropriations Committee now for a number of years, and this issue here can directly benefit our ability to deal with what is happening in the Middle East. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BARTON. I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Ohio on the understanding that he will not play his best game against us next summer. Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I yield back. No. I am just kidding. I also would also like to say, sitting on the Defense Appropriations Committee, we sit in these classified briefings and we see what is happening with Russia, we see what Putin is doing, we see what is happening in the Middle East, the Ukraine. We need to export this oil. We need to export our natural gas. We need to have a bigger footprint in the world so that we can make sure that our allies have access to consistent energy flows coming here from the United States and creating jobs here in the United States. Michele Flournoy, CEO and Founder of the Center for New American Security, former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy under President Obama says: By lifting the ban on U.S. exports of crude oil, U.S. policymakers have an extraordinary opportunity to enhance not only our economic vitality, but also our national security. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Peterson). Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman. I support removing restrictions on the export of crude oil from the United States. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of H.R. 702. Current export laws are outdated, as we have heard. Since these laws were last visited nearly 40 years ago, U.S. oil production has increased significantly and the United States is now the largest producer of oil and gas. Studies have shown that lifting the current ban on crude oil exports would create jobs, many in the rural areas. We in our part of the world have seen the benefits that domestic drilling can provide by looking at our neighboring State of North Dakota. We need to do everything we can to support the use and production of domestic energy. H.R. 702 is an important part of that. Following this bill's approval, I hope all Members of Congress will continue to support an all-of-the-above domestic energy production strategy by considering the national security and the economic development benefits of not just oil production, but of biofuel production and related products. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support H.R. 702. {time} 1100 Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Sugar Land, Texas (Mr. Olson), a member of the committee and a sponsor of the bill. Mr. OLSON. Mr. Chair, this picture shows why we have to end this ban on crude exports. In October 1973, OPEC cut us off. We were getting 1.2 million barrels per day from OPEC, and that dropped down to a scant 19,000. Gas prices doubled. If you had to gas your lawn mower, you had to get in line behind cars. Because of American innovation, that world is gone. We are now awash in American crude oil. OPEC's days of dominance are over; but we can't deliver a knockout blow until we end the ban on American crude exports, which we will do in a few short minutes. When that happens, American families will have lower prices at the pump. Thug oil nations like Venezuela, Russia, and Iran will lose bite. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BARTON. I yield the gentleman from Texas an additional 15 seconds. Mr. OLSON. Mr. Chair, we will create thousands and thousands and thousands of good-paying American jobs. I ask my colleagues vote today to end the ban on crude oil exports. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the great Buckeye State of Ohio (Mr. Stivers), a member of the Armed Services Committee. Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his extraordinary work on this bill. This bill is important for our national security. It is important for jobs. We need to end the oil export ban so that we can export oil that has been generated as part of this energy revolution in this country that is going to be great for jobs and help our national security partners around the world. Let's make the world safer. Let's give America more jobs. Let's end the oil export ban. Please support this bill today. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer). Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, this is ill-advised legislation. My friends on the other side of the aisle claim 800,000 jobs, a million jobs. They don't have any real defined ability to provide such an estimate. Actually, this is a number that is made up because, as some of the speakers have acknowledged, there will be offsetting job losses as a result of what is going to happen, for example, in the refining industry or what is going to happen in terms of some of the transport. But that is beside the point. We actually have a policy that is working. There will come a time, perhaps, when it makes sense in a strategic matter to make an adjustment. Right now, the President has the latitude to be able to help some of our strategic partners. He has that flexibility. We are awash in oil in this country, and to expect that somehow exporting more of it is going to make a dramatic impact at the pump here is a pipe dream. It won't. It might make a modest impact. What we could do is provide a benefit to the large oil companies as part of a larger package that would help everybody. We have expiring tax provisions, for instance, dealing with the production tax credit, dealing with wind and solar that actually create far more jobs than will be found in the refining and in the oil production. And these are good, family-wage jobs all across the country Let's put together a package that speaks to alternative energy continuity, that speaks to conservation, that speaks to a long-term strategy that is a win-win. I am absolutely confident that Mr. Pallone and Mr. Barton could sit down and deal with a [[Page H6948]] package that would have far more benefit for America. If you are going to hand out another goodie to the oil companies, let's have a more comprehensive approach that meets our comprehensive energy needs. This bill doesn't do it. Mr. BARTON. May I ask how much time remains, Mr. Chair? The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 10\1/2\ minutes remaining, and the gentleman from New Jersey has 4\1/2\ minutes remaining. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Costa) on behalf of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar). Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chair, as some of my colleagues have mentioned, the ban on crude oil exports is an outdated policy. It was 1975 that it was enacted. A lot has changed since 1975. I believe this bipartisan, commonsense solution is needed to develop a comprehensive effort to deal with our energy policy in America that deals with both our short-term and our long-term needs. I think we have to use all the tools in our energy toolbox, and I think this is part of that effort. New technologies have provided the United States with an abundance of crude oil that is only continuing in nature, combined with our renewables and our other energy sources. We need to understand that this is about stimulating our economy and creating jobs, and it also has a very important geopolitical influence on bad actors, like Russia and Iran, who use energy as a political weapon. I understand there are concerns by my colleagues about eliminating this ban and the negative impacts it will have. I have some concerns with small and midsized domestic refineries, which I have represented. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the gentleman from California. Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chair, this is a work in progress. We obviously need to address a number of other issues with the Senate. I remind my colleagues, this is important. It is about jobs, the economy, and providing alternatives of energy to Russia and Iran, and that is why I support this legislation as we continue to work together in a bipartisan fashion. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from the Golden Gate State of California (Mr. Hunter), a distinguished subcommittee chairman of the Armed Services Committee. Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chair, I am voting for this bill overall. In California, we don't drill anymore, and we are cutting down on our refineries even, but this is important for the Nation. One big part of this bill is the Maritime Security Program. If you don't know it, over 90 percent of all the stuff that we transfer to Iraq, Afghanistan, anywhere where there are American troops--all of their gear, their tanks, their weapons, their ammo, everything, for the most part--is shipped on American-flag commercial vessels. Of the 50,000 cargo ships that travel the ocean every day, 79 of those are American-flag. That is it, 79 out of 50,000. Sixty of those are on call when America needs them to transfer our gear to our troops overseas. When I was a lieutenant in the Marine Corps, on my second tour in 2004, I drove down to the San Diego Port with my Marine battery, and we loaded up all the equipment that we would then fall in on in Iraq 2 months later. Without the Maritime Security Program plus-up that is in this bill, we would not be able to go fight wars. We would not be able to move our equipment. We would not be able to support our troops. This is a national security bill. It is not only national security because it is energy security, but it is national security because that is how we support our troops overseas is with the Maritime Security Program, which this bill pluses up. I just want to say thank you to the chairman and everybody who supports this. I would urge my colleagues to not just support energy security, but support national security. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson). Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I had planned to support this bill, as a matter of fact, as a cosponsor; but since I have been unable to remove myself from the cosponsorship, I wish to speak on the record regarding my opposition to this particular bill. While I believe that Congress should consider the potential for all energy sources to meet our Nation's current and future needs, I believe that this legislation lacks the proper safeguards and oversight for such a major change in our Nation's energy policy. The bill does not appropriately consider the implications of our national security, the economy, consumers, and, especially, the environment. Exporting crude oil does not increase demand for oil or definitively increase the number of U.S. jobs in the energy sector. On the contrary, many U.S. jobs that are downstream in the domestic refining process may be threatened. In addition, exporting oil to foreign countries for refining purposes would likely increase overall CO 2 emissions. The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chair, the bottom line is that we must consider many factors related to our energy portfolio before we lift any current restrictions. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 702. Since I am unable to remove myself as a cosponsor of the legislation, I would like to speak on the record regarding my opposition to this particular bill. While I believe that Congress should consider the potential for all energy sources to meet our nation's current and future needs, I believe that this legislation lacks the proper safeguards and oversight for such a major change in our nation's energy policy. The bill does not appropriately consider the implications for our national security, the economy, consumers, and especially the environment. Exporting crude oil does not increase demand for oil or definitively increase the number of U.S. jobs in the energy sector. On the contrary, many U.S. jobs that are downstream in the domestic refining process may be threatened. In addition, exporting oil to foreign countries for refining purposes will likely increase overall CO 2 emissions, thus amplifying the impacts of climate change. Facing the challenge of climate change requires us to be responsible and accountable for our own natural resources. This bill does not provide any recourse to mitigate or even examine these potential impacts, and thus ignores this responsibility entirely. It should be noted that the Obama Administration has made every effort to compromise by easing export restrictions where appropriate after careful review. The Commerce Department recently approved limited crude oil exchanges with Mexico. However, the President believes that unilaterally lifting the export ban is excessive, and I join him in his opposition. Lifting the crude oil ban for short-term gains with no accounting of the costs that will be incurred is ill-advised and short- sighted. The bottom line is that we must consider many factors related to our energy portfolio before we lift any current restrictions. Without serious deliberation and oversight of the potential environmental and economic impacts of such as significant shift in our national energy policy, I must urge my colleagues to vote no on this bill. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the Peach State of Georgia (Mr. Bishop) on behalf of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar). Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I come to the floor today to express my support of H.R. 702, much-needed legislation which will lift the arbitrary ban on the export of one of our country's most abundant natural resources: crude oil. The current ban on exports is a relic of a different time before we as a nation knew just how much crude oil we have stored in the earth across this country. We are entirely too dependent on foreign oil sources, particularly from countries who have no regard for the American economy. Today is different. In fact, from the period between 2000 and 2013, U.S. production of crude oil increased by nearly fourteenfold, from 250,000 barrels per day to 3.5 million. With this large amount of excess capacity, we can sell our oil to the global markets, which will bring U.S. crude prices in line with global prices, and global prices will go [[Page H6949]] down because of the increased supply. No less than 68 percent of consumers' cost of gasoline--and 57 percent for diesel fuel--come from the price of the source: crude oil. Numerous studies have shown that the increased global supply will lead to lower prices at the pump. Not only will consumers have more money to spend on school supplies, food, clothing, and other household staples, but the prices of these goods will go down because the cost to transport them from manufacturer to store will decrease. Possibly, more importantly, we have to consider the security implications of allowing the export of crude. We are in the position of showing the world that we can provide a stable source of energy to friendly countries around the globe. Our supplies will dilute the market share of unfriendly countries and weaken their grip on our democratic ally nations who have to depend on some of our unfriendly countries for their oil supplies. We can provide an alternative source to those who don't want to support our adversaries and their adversaries. So I thank my colleagues Mr. Cuellar and Mr. Barton for bringing forth this critically important legislation. I urge my colleagues in the House to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 702. Mr. PALLONE. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I only have two speakers, myself and Mr. Cuellar. I believe I have the right to close, so I would ask my friend from New Jersey how many speakers he still has. Mr. PALLONE. Just myself and Mr. Garamendi remain. Mr. BARTON. Well, at this time, I reserve the balance of my time. {time} 1115 Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time remains on my side? The CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey has 3\1/4\ minutes remaining. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi). Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, we have before us a very, very important issue. It is a national security issue. My good friend from San Diego spoke to one part of our Nation's security, and that is the ability of this Nation to move its interests around the world not just with airplanes, but with ships. Unfortunately, this is a very narrowly constructed piece of legislation that speaks to the interests of the petroleum industry and the many thousands of people who work there. We concede that. But this bill could also be a boon to another part of our Nation's security, and that is our maritime industry. Unfortunately, the bill does not do that. While it does deal with the Maritime Security Program--and that is good--it does not deal in full potential with what we can do, and that is to require that this strategic asset, oil, be shipped on American- built ships with American mariners. That is not in the bill. It should be. It could be. If it were, our shipyards and our mariners all around this Nation would have tens of thousands of jobs, and we would secure yet not only the interest of our petroleum industry but, also, the interest of our maritime industry as well as the shipyards upon which this Nation's national defense depends. Put it in the bill. Then let's see how many votes you can get. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar), my chief sponsor, the gentleman that represents south Texas and the Eagle Ford Shale. Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. Barton for the leadership he has provided on this bill. I rise in support of H.R. 702 that repeals the ban on crude oil. This ban reflects an America of yesterday. It is our job, as Members of Congress, that our laws reflect the America of tomorrow. If you look at why this is important, this ban hurts the economy and prevents the creation of jobs. This ban imposes an estimated $200 to $300 billion cost to the economy and discourages domestic, made-in- America crude oil production. By lifting the ban now, we will create 359,000 new jobs. How do I know? Because I represent the Eagle Ford and I have seen small-business people, men and women, that work very hard every single day to have this type of job. And I think we owe it to them and across the Nation. This ban also reduces the Federal direct spending by $1.4 billion, according to the CBO. So it also helps our deficit. This ban is something that we need to change, and we need to make sure that we lift this ban. What about gasoline prices? You heard Mr. Ryan. You heard other folks. According to the General Accounting Office, this will bring prices down from 1.5 cents to 13 cents. The CBO says the same thing: 5 cents to 10 cents. The administration's own agency, the Energy Information Administration, says it will bring it down one penny or remain. It doesn't go up. It goes down. This ban also doesn't allow us to use our powers in foreign policy. Why are we allowing Russia or Iran to dictate what happens in this world? This is why we need to make sure that we support the repealing of this ban. Now, who supports this? Mr. Barton, you know it is a bipartisan bill. Democrats and Republicans support this bill, but it is also supported by business, small-business owners, and by some of the labor organizations. We have talked to those labor organizations. Mr. Chairman, support H.R. 702, a bipartisan bill. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the remainder of my time. Mr. Chairman, let me point out that the administration, the President, has issued a SAP saying that he would veto this bill. This bill is going nowhere because of that veto and the potential for a veto. All this legislation does is to give a windfall of $30 billion in profits to the oil industry, no strings attached, no sacrifices required. The legislation is opposed by over 40 environmental groups: the United Steelworkers, the IBEW, the BlueGreen Alliance, and the Industrial Energy Consumers of America. Most importantly, Mr. Chairman, it is supported by the American public who, regardless of party, support investing in refineries at home rather than lifting crude export restrictions. In fact, around 70 percent of voters oppose allowing oil companies to export more U.S. oil. The Republican majority has spent the whole week doing little more than attacking women's health and assisting Big Oil for their big profits. It is time to come together in the name of energy and national security. In the name of common sense and economic good sense, I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have remaining? The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 3\3/4\ minutes remaining. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, we have had a very enlightening debate for the last hour. I would say 30 Members of Congress have stood up and spoken either in favor or opposition to the bill. I want it to be noted that a large number of my friends on the Democratic side have risen in support of the bill. I want to compliment Mr. Cuellar for his strong leadership in that area. This is a bipartisan bill. When we do our town hall meetings, Mr. Chairman, person after person stands up and says: Why can't you folks in Congress get along? Why don't you try to be positive? Why don't you try to do what is right for America? Why don't you work together on a bipartisan basis? Mr. Chairman, that is what this bill does. This is a bipartisan bill. We have a large number of Democratic cosponsors and a large number of Republicans. This bill will help all 50 States. As Mr. Bishop and Mr. Scott have stated on the Democratic side, it helps low income, it helps minorities, it helps women. It helps every sector of the economy, not just the oil industry, not just the roughnecks, not just the drillers. It helps truck drivers. It helps steelworkers. It helps refinery workers. It even helps computer programmers. You name it, it helps it. Some estimates are this bill, if enacted, would create as many as a million jobs. We know, for a fact, that the [[Page H6950]] collapse in oil prices in the last year and a half has cost the U.S. economy over 500,000 jobs, 750,000 jobs. Those are real people. That is not Big Oil, Mr. Chairman. That is people that get up every morning and kiss their wives, hop in their car, go to work and work hard 8, 10, 12 hours a day, get the bills at the end of the month and hope they have enough money to pay the bills. It is blue-collar America. It is not Big Oil. It is everybody in this country, Mr. Chairman. This bill is a market-based bill: willing buyer, willing seller. The U.S. has the largest oil reserves in the world. We have the capability to be number one in the world. Why on God's green Earth don't we use it? Why are we the only nation in the world that is restricted in one of the blessings that God has endowed our great Nation with? We could produce, if we wanted to, up to 20 million barrels a day. We are producing right now 9 million barrels a day. U.S. oil can go anywhere in the world if we allow it to. That is an economic asset. It is a military strategic asset. All we have to do is repeal an archaic law that was passed in 1975 when we couldn't export a barrel of oil if we wanted to. We were importing two-thirds of our oil. We have a bipartisan bill that helps everybody in America, that is in the economic interests of America, that is in the environmental interests of America, that is in the military strategic interests of America. Mr. Chairman, let's work together. Let's send this bill to the Senate with strong bipartisan support. God bless America. God bless this great country. Pass H.R. 702. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Washington, DC, October 5, 2015. Hon. Fred Upton, Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Upton: Thank you for consulting with the Foreign Affairs Committee on H.R. 702, a bill to adapt to changing crude oil market conditions, which was referred to us on February 4, 2015. I agreed that the Foreign Affairs Committee might be discharged from further action on this bill so that it could proceed expeditiously to the Floor, subject to the understanding that this waiver does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the future. I would request your support for the appointment of Foreign Affairs conferees during any House-Senate conference on this legislation. I respectfully ask that you place our letters on H.R. 702 into the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work with the Committee on Energy and Commerce as this measure moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, Edward R. Royce, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC, October 6, 2015. Hon. Edward R. Royce, Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Royce: Thank you for your assistance regarding H.R. 702, a bill to adapt to changing crude oil market conditions, which was referred to our respective committees on February 4, 2015. I appreciate your willingness to agree that the Foreign Affairs Committee might be discharged from further action on H.R. 702 so that it can proceed expeditiously to the floor, and I agree that this waiver does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition, I would support your request for the appointment of Foreign Affairs conferees during any House-Senate conference on this legislation. I will place our letters on H.R. 702 into the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill. Sincerely, Fred Upton, Chairman. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this legislation. Increased U.S. energy exports benefit our national security and foreign policy. The Administration has created an absurd situation. While they are lifting sanctions on Iranian crude oil, they are fighting to keep sanctions on American crude oil. It makes no sense. I am, however, concerned by language that would increase subsidy payments to U.S. shipping companies participating in the ``Maritime Security Program.'' By increasing our oil exports, as this legislation does, that's already a boon to U.S. shipping. So why the government subsidy? So I will support an amendment that is to be offered to strike this provision of the bill. But Mr. Chair, if this maritime subsidy is ultimately part of this legislation, the door is then open to offset it by eliminating yet another damaging subsidy: U.S. cargo preference for international food aid. Over the past three years, the Foreign Affairs Committee has led efforts to reform U.S. international food aid programs so we could reach more starving people in less time, and for less money. A stumbling block to this effort has been a requirement in U.S. law that U.S. food aid be shipped on U.S. vessels--even though many of them are foreign-owned. This requirement remains year-after-year despite the fact that the Defense Department has concluded that relieving a portion of our food aid budget from U.S. purchase and shipping requirements would have no effect on U.S. maritime security. If maintained in this bill, the proposed increase for ``Maritime Security Program'' payments literally ``sinks'' the arguments against food aid reform. One wasteful corporate subsidy is bad enough; a second that kills our ability to reform food aid and save lives would be beyond conscience, and something I am confident this body would wisely reject. Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 702, a bipartisan bill to lift the 40-year old, self-imposed, crude oil export ban. The United States is now among the top oil producing nations in the world. Lifting this export ban will bring us roaring back into the global oil markets at a time when market conditions are particularly competitive. Contrary to what some of my friends across the aisle may say, this bill would actually lower gas prices here at home. We live in a global economy, and participation in a global market leads to competitive pricing. The non-partisan Government Accountability Office--in addition to the world-renowned analytics firm, HIS--have both determined that enacting this bill will lower gas prices, create hundreds of thousands of jobs, and provide a much-needed boost our economy. With all these benefits, why would we continue to hold onto this export ban? The only reason it was imposed in the first place was in response to the Arab oil embargo. That was over 40 years ago. It is prudent to move past these decades-old issues, and instead focus on the issues we face today. Today, we are facing a dangerous nuclear deal with Iran--a deal of President Obama's making. And one component of this terrible deal is that sanctions will be lifted on Iran so that they will be able to access a much larger portion of the world oil market, yielding billions of dollars to their coffers. Why would we make a deal with Iran--a deal that allows them to export their oil so they can fund terrorism around the world--but still hold onto this self-imposed ban? Without this bill, the U.S. would be missing out on billions in direct revenue to the Treasury, not to mention the secondary revenue streams from improved economic conditions. Let's pass this bill to unleash economic growth. Let's pass this bill to create hundreds of thousands of much-needed jobs. Let's pass this bill to counterbalance the exports of Iran, Russia, and the OPEC nations. I urge my colleagues to pass this bipartisan bill. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss H.R. 702, a bill to ``Adapt to Changing Crude Oil Market Conditions.'' H.R. 702 repeals the law prohibiting the exports of crude oil that has been on the books for more than 40 years, a response to the Arab Oil Embargo led by OPEC in 1973 that sent oil prices soaring and inflicted substantial damage on the American economy. Let me express my appreciation to Chairman Emeritus Barton and Ranking Member Pallone for their leadership and commitment to American energy independence, economic growth, national security, and expanding opportunities and diversifying the energy sector workforce. I support H.R. 702 because it holds the promise of moving our country towards energy independence, create good-paying jobs, lowering gasoline prices, promoting our geopolitical interests, and strengthening our defense capabilities. But I strongly am ``pro-jobs,'' ``pro-growing economy,'' ``pro- sustainable environment and development,'' and for homeland and national security. That is why I carefully consider each energy legislative proposal brought to the floor on its individual merits and support them when they are sound, balanced, fair, and promote the national interest. As the Member of Congress from Houston, the energy capital of the nation, I have always been mindful of the importance and have strongly advocated for national energy policies [[Page H6951]] that will make our nation more energy independent, preserve and create jobs, and keep our nation's economy strong. The Eighteenth Congressional District, which I represent and is home to Shell Oil, ConocoPhillips, Chevron Phillips, BP Corporation of North America, Marathon Oil, Enterprise Products Partners (Oil and Gas Pipelines), and Halliburton (Oilfield Services), and many others. My constituents have a strong interest in policies that maintain or enhance the competitiveness of American petroleum energy business in the world oil markets. Mr. Chair, the world is very different than it was in 1973 when the ban on crude oil exports was adopted. And much of the change we see today is attributable to America's unconventional oil boom. U.S. crude production is now more than 11 million barrels per day according to the U.S. DOE's Energy Information Administration, up from 7 million barrel per day in 2008. And it is estimated that U.S. output will exceed 18 million barrels a day by 2040. Crude inventories are at an 80-year high, and imports have declined nearly 30 percent between 2005 and 2013. Mr. Chair, paradoxically, continuation of the crude oil export ban may pose one of the biggest threats to this U.S. production boom and to the economy. This is because increased production has led to a substantial decline in oil prices over the past year and the resulting decrease in revenues has forced U.S. producers in my district and elsewhere to slash investment and cancel projects. Since last autumn the industry has cut more than 125,000 jobs, including many in my district. I have met and know many of the employers and workers affected by industry job reductions. Lifting the crude oil export ban would offer American crude oil producers new markets for their product and would mean fewer layoffs. Studies by the highly respected Brookings Institution and other organizations suggest that the economic benefits to the nation of repealing the ban on crude oil exports would be substantial. Specifically, it is predicted that repeal of the crude oil export ban will: 1. generate over $1.4 billion in revenue to the federal treasury over the next 10 years from oil and gas leases, according to the Congressional Budget Office; 2. lower gasoline prices by 13 cents per gallon according to the Government Accountability Office; 3. support up to 964,000 additional American jobs; 4. allow the United States to help its allies, enhance its energy security, and weaken the influence and market power of OPEC and Russia; and 5. strengthen the 60-ship Maritime Security Fleet, assuring that United States flag ships and crews will be available to provide support to the military in defense of our national interests and our allies. The economic benefits projected to be derived from a repeal of the crude oil export ban are stunning in their magnitude: 1. 300,000 additional jobs by 2020; 2. $5.8 billion savings in fuel costs each year between 2015 and 2035; 3. $70 billion in additional investment in U.S. exploration, development, and production of crude oil between 2015 and 2020; 4. 500,000 barrels per day increase in domestic crude oil production in 2020; 5. $38 billion in additional economic activity in 2020; 6. $13.5 billion in additional federal, state, and local revenue in 2020; and a 7. $22 billion reduction in the U.S. trade deficit in 2020. It is estimated that in my own congressional district, lifting the ban would generate an additional 500 jobs and inject an additional $275 million into the local economy, resulting in an increase in government revenues in the amount of $227.7 million. Another positive impact of repealing the crude oil export ban is that the U.S. crude oil production would increase 1.2 million barrels per day average between 2016 and 2030. Additionally, manufacturing jobs are expected to increase by an average of 37,000 per year through 2025 and analysts predict that construction jobs will increase 217,000 in the peak year 2017, while related professional services jobs would grow by an average of 148,000 per year. Repeal of the crude oil export ban is expected to spur capital investment in machinery, exploration, and development by $7 billion in 2020. The gross domestic product would increase by nearly $73 billion in 2016 and by at least $134 billion in 2018. Total government revenues would increase by a combined $1.3 trillion between 2016 and 2030. The revenue generated translates to an expected average annual increase of $2,500 in disposable income per household, additional jobs for American workers, and lower gasoline prices for American consumers. As it relates to our geopolitical stance, Mr. Chair, lifting the crude export ban will enhance our national influence in international affairs because we will be stronger economically and more energy independent. This will enhance our ability to achieve our geopolitical objectives of maintaining peace and security across the globe which in turn furthers our national security interests. For all of these reasons, I support H.R. 702 and urge my colleagues to join me and also support Jackson Lee Amendments 9 and 10. The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5-minute rule. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Energy and Commerce, printed in the bill, it shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 114-29. That amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. The text of the amendment in the nature of the substitute is as follows: H.R. 702 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) The United States has enjoyed a renaissance in energy production, establishing the United States as the world's leading oil producer. (2) By authorizing crude oil exports, the Congress can spur domestic energy production, create and preserve jobs, help maintain and strengthen our independent shipping fleet that is essential to national defense, and generate State and Federal revenues. (3) An energy-secure United States that is a net exporter of energy has the potential to transform the security environment around the world, notably in Europe and the Middle East. (4) For our European allies and Israel, the presence of more United States oil in the market will offer more secure supply options, which will strengthen United States strategic alliances and help curtail the use of energy as a political weapon. (5) The 60-ship Maritime Security Fleet is a vital element of our military's strategic sealift and global response capability. It assures United States-flag ships and United States crews will be available to support the United States military when it needs to mobilize to protect our allies, and is the most prudent and economical solution to meet current and projected sealift requirements for the United States. (6) The Maritime Security Fleet program provides a labor base of skilled American mariners who are available to crew the United States Government-owned strategic sealift fleet, as well as the United States commercial fleet, in both peace and war. SEC. 2. REPEAL. Section 103 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6212) and the item relating thereto in the table of contents of that Act are repealed. SEC. 3. NATIONAL POLICY ON OIL EXPORT RESTRICTION. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, to promote the efficient exploration, production, storage, supply, marketing, pricing, and regulation of energy resources, including fossil fuels, no official of the Federal Government shall impose or enforce any restriction on the export of crude oil. SEC. 4. STUDY AND RECOMMENDATIONS. Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy shall conduct a study and transmit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate recommendations on the appropriate size, composition, and purpose of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. SEC. 5. SAVINGS CLAUSE. Nothing in this Act limits the authority of the President under the Constitution, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), or part B of title II of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6271 et seq.) to prohibit exports. SEC. 6. NATIONAL DEFENSE SEALIFT ENHANCEMENT. (a) Payments.--Section 53106(a)(1) of title 46, United States Code, is amended-- (1) in subparagraph (B), by striking the comma before ``for each''; (2) in subparagraph (C), by striking ``2016, 2017, and 2018;'' and inserting ``and 2016''; (3) by redesignating subparagraph (E) as subparagraph (G); and (4) by striking subparagraph (D) and inserting the following: ``(D) $4,999,950 for fiscal year 2017; ``(E) $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020; ``(F) $5,233,463 for fiscal year 2021; and''. (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--Section 53111 of title 46, United States Code, is amended-- (1) in paragraph (3), by striking ``2016, 2017, and 2018;'' and inserting ``and 2016''; (2) by redesignating paragraph (5) as paragraph (7); and (3) by striking paragraph (4) and inserting the following: [[Page H6952]] ``(4) $299,997,000 for fiscal year 2017; ``(5) $300,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020; ``(6) $314,007,780 for fiscal year 2021; and''. The CHAIR. No amendment to the amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be in order except those printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Each such amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the report, by a Member designated in the report, shall be considered read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question. Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Amash The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 2, lines 3 through 15, strike paragraphs (5) and (6). Page 3, line 18, through page 4, line 21, strike section 6. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Amash) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Chairman, my amendment removes a new section of the bill added by the Committee on Rules that increases funding for the Maritime Security Program by $500 million. My amendment does not eliminate the program. It simply keeps it at its current authorization level. Just last week the House passed the conference report for the National Defense Authorization Act. This defense policy bill, negotiated at length between House and Senate conferees, increases the annual subsidy for Maritime Security Program participants from $3.1 million per vessel to $3.5 million per vessel, a 12.9 percent increase. The provision, added quietly by the Committee on Rules, circumvents regular order and increases funding even more. As amended, H.R. 702 boosts per-vessel payments to $5 million per year, increasing the subsidy by a whopping 42 percent. The proper place for a discussion on funding for the Maritime Security Program is in a defense bill like the NDAA, not as part of a bill that lifts a ban on crude oil exports. This spending increase is all the more reckless, given our more than $18 trillion national debt. According to the Congressional Budget Office, lifting the export ban will increase receipts from Federal oil and gas leases by $1.4 billion over the next 10 years. We should use those receipts to reduce the deficit. Mr. Chairman, there are two ways we should amend bills. The first way is to go through the normal committee process, by introducing amendments during a markup. Members have the opportunity to debate and vote on amendments in the committee of jurisdiction. We should respect the work committees do by not altering the bills they report before we even consider the legislation on the House floor. The second way is to offer an amendment when the bill comes up for debate on the House floor. This gives all Representatives the opportunity to participate in the debate and represent their constituents by voting on the measure. Unfortunately, the Committee on Rules changed this bill behind closed doors late last week. The Maritime Security Program is a defense-related program that has nothing to do with oil exports or energy production. This provision has no place in H.R. 702, and its eleventh-hour addition by the Committee on Rules is the latest example of our broken legislative process. Mr. Chairman, we must protect this institution and the legislative process. Adding an unrelated provision to this bill behind closed doors is no way to legislate. I urge all Members to vote ``yes'' on my amendment to remove this unrelated $500 million spending increase so we can consider H.R. 702 as reported by the Committee on Energy and Commerce. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I seek time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Dold). The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/4\ minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Forbes). Mr. FORBES. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support H.R. 702 but, more importantly, to oppose this amendment. First of all, I would tell the gentleman, this amendment was considered and this provision was considered in the NDAA, and we actually did mark it up. The second thing is this is vital to the national security of this country to maintain the private sector sealift capacity. Our top military commanders have called MSP a vital element of our military strategic sealift and global response capability, and it is worth noting that 90 percent of all U.S. military cargo moved from Iraq and Afghanistan has been by American-flagged, American-crewed commercial vessels enrolled in the MSP program. {time} 1130 If we were to adopt this amendment, it would basically cost us $13 billion to re-create this. The U.S. Transportation Command has estimated it would cost $52 billion. In other words, Mr. Chairman, it would take us between 42 years and 168 years to recoup our costs. Let's defeat this amendment and protect the Maritime Security Program. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is about process. I recognize the concerns of my colleague. This should be handled in the NDAA or in a defense bill. I urge all Members to support my amendment eliminating this $500 million increase in spending and reject the Rules Committee's eleventh- hour revision that has nothing to do with crude oil exports. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chairman, I join my friend, Mr. Forbes, in opposition to this amendment. This amendment would harm America's national security. Under the program that it seeks to eliminate, the Pentagon reserves capacity on roughly 60 U.S.-flagged commercial ships to ensure the supply and transport of American troops. It is a program that supports our private sector as well, requiring the Defense Department to contract private commercial ships rather than building their own. So there was not redundancy, but complementary ability. It is a program that enhances America's national security by ensuring that our military can depend on U.S.-flagged and crewed vessels instead of foreign ones. It is a program that supports important domestic maritime jobs. In my view, we ought to reject this amendment. This legislation is, obviously, controversial. I hope this amendment is not controversial and that it receives overwhelming bipartisan opposition. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green). Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I represent the Port of Houston, and maritime transportation is vital to our success. Last year, the United States imported $2.4 trillion and exported $1.6 trillion in cargo and goods. Much of that cargo came to the United States on foreign-built ships, under foreign flags, and without U.S. citizens on board. Our maritime industry has been the bedrock of our economy since our founding. More cargo moves through our waterways than any other mode of transportation. We need to protect our domestic maritime industry, and that includes men and women that work on these ships. I have worked with the maritime unions, including the Seafarers and the Marine Engineers, since my first days in Congress. I want to thank my colleagues for supporting our U.S.-flagged maritime unions. I oppose this amendment because I support any effort to keep these folks working. I would like to take a minute and acknowledge a recent incident in the Atlantic Ocean. The disappearance of the El Faro resulted in the loss of life. I [[Page H6953]] want to extend my prayers to the families. Working on these ships is tough and can be hazardous, as we learned last week. It is my hope that we can defeat this amendment and ensure our economic viability and national security by putting U.S. crews and U.S. flags on more ships. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter). Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, to the gentleman from Michigan's point, this is the process. I chair the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee. I am also the vice chairman of the Seapower Subcommittee in the Armed Services Committee. Mr. Forbes is the chairman of the subcommittee that handles this stuff. This went through the process. This is the process. This is how it is supposed to work. There are only--I will say again--79 U.S.-flagged commercial vessels on the ocean today. That is 79 out of about 50,000; 60 of those are used in times of war. It would cost us billions of dollars to create a fleet that sits there mothballing until we go to war and then we get to use it. This is how the system works. This is the process, and this is how we keep national security strong. Republicans and Democrats realize this is the process. It is the right way to do it, and it shores up the Maritime Security Program for a decade. That is 10 years that we don't have to worry about this, and it is paid for. The gentleman from Michigan would have a point if this were not paid for. It is totally paid for. This is the right vehicle for it, and I would urge all my colleagues to vote against the gentleman's amendment and support maritime security and national security. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to Amash amendment that would undermine our domestic maritime industry and its workers. The Pacific Northwest has a proud maritime tradition that supports quality jobs and keeps our economy moving. The Maritime Security Program ensures that we have the ships and mariners to support our local, regional, and national economy--to keep folks employed and get goods to market. Having worked in economic development for a decade I believe the MSP is the kind of program we ought to back, not completely scrap. Let's not turn our back on the hard-working men and women that are out on the sea. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Amash). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan will be postponed. Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Delaney The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Mr. DELANEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 2, after line 15, insert the following: (7) The United States has reduced its oil consumption over the past decade, and increasing investment in clean energy technology and energy efficiency will lower energy prices, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and increase national security. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Delaney) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland. Mr. DELANEY. Mr. Chairman, recent data suggests that climate change is accelerating. As a result, the destabilizing effect it has on our environment is worsening. To my mind, this is a clear threat to American prosperity and global stability. Mr. Chairman, consider the fact that the Governor of the Bank of England in a speech recently said that he is very concerned that unless we respond to climate change, there will be a dramatic reduction in value of carbon assets, which will cause a financial crisis. As a country with the largest financial markets in the world, we should be concerned about that. Mr. Chairman, consider the fact that Citigroup recently put out a research report that said unless we deal with climate change, the effect on global GDP will be $44 trillion to the negative by 2050. That is twice the size of the U.S. economy. Mr. Chairman, consider the fact that the U.N. has estimated that unless we deal with climate change, 150 million people will be forced to be relocated by 2050; 20 million, alone, in Bangladesh. Put that in the context of the fact that in Syria we are seeing the effects of 7 million people being forced to be relocated. Again, Mr. Chairman, this is a clear threat to American prosperity, and the bad news is that our environment is worse. The good news is the technology is better for dealing with this problem. Consider the fact that, as we have doubled the installed base of solar energy in this country, we have reduced the cost of energy by 23 percent. It has happened over the last several cycles of doubling solar, and people expect it to continue. This is occurring because of good old-fashioned American innovation. And while I believe there should be policy prescriptions from the government that effectively cost and price carbon, at a minimum, Mr. Chairman, we should agree that by investing in clean energy technology, we will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we will lower energy costs for the American public, and we will increase national security. That is what the amendment that I have here today is designed to do. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment, but only in order to control the time. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. BARTON. Chairman Upton and I are prepared to accept the gentleman's amendment, but we do have some Republican speakers who would like to speak in favor of it. I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo). Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. First, Mr. Chairman, let me offer my support for the underlying bill, H.R. 702. Over the August district work period, I had the opportunity to visit an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico and see firsthand the safety regulations and enhancements that have been put in place by the industry in recent years. Two of the primary topics of discussion during our visit were safety and the environment. I was glad to learn the industry has put a lot of contingencies in place to make sure we can continue drilling for oil in a manner that is safe and responsible. I have joined my colleagues Mr. Delaney and Mr. Gibson in offering this simple amendment that would recognize our country is making progress in becoming more energy efficient; and that is better for the economy and the environment. It is also very important to note the other forms of energy that are benefiting our country's economy and its national security. Wind, solar, natural gas, and nuclear energy are all contributing greatly to our energy independence, and this amendment before us today acknowledges that we should continue to promote an all-of-the-above energy strategy for this 21st century. Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of this amendment. Mr. DELANEY. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the great city of Kinderhook, New York (Mr. Gibson). Mr. GIBSON. I thank the chairman for yielding and for his leadership. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. I am honored to be working with my colleagues John Delaney and Carlos Curbelo to offer this bipartisan amendment. This amendment adds another strategic dimension to this bill: support for [[Page H6954]] clean energy and energy efficiencies. On our way to energy independence, it is critical that we support research and development for clean energy technologies. In New York, we are doing a lot of this work supporting important programs like the SunShot program, with the ambitious goal of driving down the total cost of photovoltaics to 9 cents per kilowatt hour, which would allow it to compete with any other energy source and democratize energy, transforming the way we produce, convey, and consume energy. With improved technologies, we will also see more proliferation of wind power, hydroelectric power, and biomass energy complementing all other traditional energy sources, including crude oil, adding up to a stronger America. Mr. Chairman, this is a country that can do hard things. We have proven that time and again. With the proper focus and investment, we will dominate the clean energy world market. And when we do, we will drive down energy costs; we will grow our economy, strengthen our national security, and conserve our environment. I urge support of this amendment. Let's take a robust and holistic approach to energy independence. Mr. DELANEY. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleague and my friend from Texas for accepting this amendment. I want to thank my colleague from New York and my colleague from Florida for their support of their amendment and their insight into this issue. Again, I urge all my colleagues to support the amendment. It is very simple. It simply says that investing in basic research and investing in American innovation will, in fact, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which it has been proven to do; will, in fact, lower energy costs, which it has been proven to do; and will, in fact, increase national security in this great country. So, again, I want to I thank my colleagues for their support. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I accept the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Delaney). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Huffman The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 3, line 4, insert ``(a) Strategic Petroleum Reserve'' before ``Not later than''. Page 3, after line 10, insert the following: (b) Greenhouse Gas Emissions.--Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy shall conduct, and transmit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate the results of, a study on the net greenhouse gas emissions that will result from the repeal of the crude oil export ban under section 2. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer my amendment to H.R. 702. This is the only amendment that the majority would allow in order to help us understand the impacts of lifting the crude oil export ban on greenhouse gas emissions. Before the Rules Committee, Ranking Member Pallone and I offered two other amendments that would have more proactively studied the increase in greenhouse gas emissions caused by this bill. Instead, the majority only allowed this amendment, which requires that the Department of Energy do a report on the increasing greenhouse gas emissions caused by the lifting of the crude oil export ban, but still allows the ban to be lifted. {time} 1145 This is what the legislative process has come to, unfortunately, in this Chamber. Instead of analyzing full impacts before voting, the majority has adopted a ``pollute first, ask questions later'' approach. Repeal the restrictions on fossil fuel extraction and production, and then we will figure out the environmental impact later. Now, lifting this 40-year-old ban on exports could increase oil production by as much as 500,000 barrels a day. That is a significant increase that risks expanding production into sensitive areas off our coasts and our public lands. According to the Center for American Progress, this surge in production would result in an additional 515 million metric tons of carbon pollution each year. That is the equivalent of an additional 108 million passenger cars on the road or 135 coal-fired power plants put online. That is what this bill could do. That is why over 40 environmental groups are opposing it. Now, my Republican colleagues might dispute this study. It is the Center for American Progress. And so, when we hear studies from any group that is not funded by the fossil fuel industry, we typically hear them accused of being biased, left-leaning sources, and certainly they are welcome to make that argument. But doesn't that support the need for an established, nonpartisan source of assessments on the impacts to our environment for bills that this Congress considers? That is why today, Mr. Chairman, I am also introducing the Carbon Pollution Transparency Act of 2015. This is a bill that would require the CBO to estimate and report on the projected carbon footprint of each bill Congress considers. That way, we know before we vote how a bill would impact our climate and our environment. Members of Congress already rely on the fiscal impact estimates produced by the nonpartisan CBO to help us make good decisions, make up our minds. But we need to also take into account the environmental consequences of our votes. The American public has the right to know whether their Representatives in Washington are voting to help harm the environment, to worsen climate change, or whatever the impact may be. That is why my bill ensures that we have a fair judge, the CBO, for each bill that we consider on its environmental impact. But today we at least have an opportunity to require such a study as part of H.R. 702. It is not enough, but it is a step forward to fully understand the impacts of lifting the crude oil export ban and, potentially, the harm that would result to our environment. So I urge a ``yes'' vote on my amendment and a ``no'' vote on the underlying legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in mild opposition, and I may change my mind, depending on what the gentleman says. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BARTON. I want to make a deal with the gentleman. We want to be open and transparent. We are the open, transparent Congress. We will accept your amendment if you voice vote it and at least consider voting for the bill. But if you are going to rollcall vote it and vote against the bill, then I will oppose it, and we will defeat you on the rollcall vote. So I am going to make you a deal. I am not saying you have to vote for the bill. I am just saying I want you to think nice thoughts about the bill and consider voting for the bill, and then we will accept it on a voice vote, but we don't want any rollcall votes. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is advised to direct his remarks to the Chair. Mr. BARTON. Well, I hope the Chair was listening. I yield to my friend from California, if I have time to yield, to see what his thoughts are. Mr. HUFFMAN. Through the Chair, I would say to my friend, I appreciate the offer, but I don't think there could be anything more transparent than going on record and voting on these. Mr. BARTON. So the gentleman is going to ask for a rollcall vote? Mr. HUFFMAN. I am going to ask for a rollcall vote. Mr. BARTON. Then, Mr. Chairman, I oppose the gentleman's amendment and ask every Member to vote against the amendment. Mr. Chairman, we are not violently opposed to this. It is a study. I am confident that this bill will on a net basis [[Page H6955]] reduce greenhouse gases because the oil that would must probably be exported is produced under the strictest environmental regulations in the world. It also happens to be the easiest oil to refine because it is light sweet, which means it doesn't have a high sulfur content. When you run it through the cracking process, because it is lighter, it tends to separate into the various refined products more easily. So the gentleman's amendment is benign in nature in the sense that, if we were to conduct the study, I think the results from the study would be positive. Mr. HUFFMAN. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. BARTON. I will be happy yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. HUFFMAN. To my esteemed colleague and coach of the baseball team, in the spirit of thinking good thoughts, if you will think good thoughts about considering the impacts to our environment and our climate, I will accept your previous offer to voice vote this amendment, and maybe all of this great good thought stuff will get us home faster. Mr. BARTON. Reclaiming my time, I commend the gentleman for his thoughtful understanding from Mr. Pallone. And, with that, we accept the gentleman's amendment. I'm going to ask everybody to vote for it on a voice vote. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mrs. Lawrence The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 3, line 4, insert ``(a) Strategic Petroleum Reserve Study.--'' before ``Not later than''. Page 3, after line 10, insert the following: (b) Crude Oil Export Study.-- (1) In general.--The Department of Commerce, in consultation with the Department of Energy, and other departments as appropriate, shall conduct a study of the State and national implications of lifting the crude oil export ban with respect to consumers and the economy. (2) Contents.--The study conducted under paragraph (1) shall include an analysis of-- (A) the economic impact that exporting crude oil will have on the economy of the United States; (B) the economic impact that exporting crude oil will have on consumers, taking into account impacts on energy prices; (C) the economic impact that exporting crude oil will have on domestic manufacturing, taking into account impacts on employment; and (D) the economic impact that exporting crude oil will have on the refining sector, taking into account impacts on employment. (3) Report to congress.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Bureau of Industry and Security shall submit to Congress a report containing the results of the study conducted under paragraph (1). The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Michigan. Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that would direct the Department of Commerce, in consultation with the Department of Energy and other departments, as needed, to conduct a study. This study would measure the impact of exporting millions of barrels of domestically produced crude oil on Americans and our economy. Let's be clear. Lifting the crude oil export ban benefits very few. Let's also be clear about who does not benefit: American consumers and the American economy. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle will make the case for lifting the ban on crude oil exports. They will cite reports by the U.S. Department of Energy, the Congressional Budget Office, the Government Accountability Office, and various other organizations to support their claims. Some of the benefits they will list include claims of an increase in crude oil production, additional investment in crude oil production, and an increase in employment along the energy supply chain. But there is a problem with these claims, that the U.S. crude oil is already at peak production. According to a report by the EIA, production reached 9.7 million barrels 1 day in April of 2015, the highest levels since 1971. In 2015, production is expected to average 9.2 million barrels a day. We still import 7 million barrels of oil a day. Let's find a way to keep domestically produced crude oil within our borders, which benefits our consumers and the economy in the U.S. For example, the domestic gas prices are at record low levels due to the surplus of crude oil. According to the U.S. Federal Highway Administration, Americans drove nearly 2 trillion miles during the first 7 months of 2015, contributing to the high gas consumption and setting a record level. Lifting the ban now on U.S. crude oil benefits will undoubtedly raise prices. For consumers, these increases will result in higher gas prices at the pump and higher heating costs for families in the winter. As all of you know, the manufacturing industry is the backbone of Michigan's economy. While the U.S. manufacturing industry has struggled in the past, it has been one of the bright spots in our economy since the recession and remains a vital part of America's economy, as well as our Nation's economy. Since 2010, over 700,000 manufacturing jobs that were lost during the recession have been recovered. One major reason for this resurgence of the manufacturing sector is low energy prices. Up to one-third of all energy used in the United States goes into the manufacturing sector. Rushing to lift the ban on crude oil now would only hurt the manufacturing industry and dent its growth. Let us find a way to keep domestically produced crude oil within our own boundaries and allow the consumers and the economy to reap the benefits of lower energy prices. Let us put together a comprehensive study of the impact of lifting the U.S. crude oil export ban on the consumers and our economy first, before we rush to export millions of barrels of domestically produced crude oil. For the benefit of all Americans, for the benefit of our economy, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in mild opposition, but I could become a supporter of the amendment under certain conditions. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, if the gentlewoman from Michigan is willing to accept the same deal that the gentleman from California just accepted, we will accept the amendment. We will vote for it on a voice vote, and we will move on down the road to catch my plane at 1:40 from Reagan National Airport. Does the gentlewoman agree to voice vote it? Mrs. LAWRENCE. To the Chair, considering all that is happening here, I really need good thoughts, and I want to be part of the process of expanding good thoughts in Congress. So I will accept, sir. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in enthusiastic support of the gentlewoman's amendment and ask that it be voted for on a voice vote. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Messer The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 3, line 15, strike ``or''. Page 3, line 17, after ``(42 U.S.C. 6271 et seq.)'' insert the following: ``, the Trading With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App. 1 et seq.), or any other provision of law that imposes sanctions on a foreign person or foreign government (including any provision of law that prohibits or restricts United States persons from engaging in a transaction with a sanctioned person or government), including a foreign government that is designated as a state sponsor of terrorism,''. [[Page H6956]] The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana. Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chair, I want to thank my colleague and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton) for his leadership on this important bill, and I am hoping today to join the voice vote kumbaya, if possible. H.R. 702 is a commonsense legislation that repeals the outdated ban on crude oil exports. This ban was originally implemented when America was going through an energy crisis. I was very young then, but certainly remember the gas lines in the early 1970s. The truth is things are different today. America is one of the largest oil exporters, thanks to a boom in production all across our country. Gas prices are at historic lows, and refineries are near capacity. Yet, our laws do not reflect this new reality. Producers are still held captive to the domestic marketplace. It is long past time to modernize. This bill will pave the way for a new age of energy innovation in America. It will support and create thousands of U.S. jobs, good-paying jobs, and encourage the investment of millions of dollars into our economy. America now has opportunities that would have seemed unimaginable even a generation ago, potentially even a few years ago. We could now become a net exporter of energy. Think about that. And when we do, it will jump-start our economy, create thousands of good- paying jobs, and improve our national security and economic security as well. Now, Mr. Chair, I am offering a bipartisan amendment today that clarifies language in the bill to avoid creating any unintended consequences regarding terrorist enemies of our country. I want to thank my colleague from California (Mr. Lowenthal) for cosponsoring this amendment and Chairman Royce for working with us in crafting the amendment as well. While we should all want to see crude oil exports expanded, we do not want this bill to inadvertently help our enemies. My amendment very simply clarifies the bill's language to allow the administration to retain its ability to prohibit the export of crude oil to state sponsors of terrorism. I believe this amendment is consistent with the underlying goals of the bill. I encourage my colleagues to support its adoption. {time} 1200 Mr. BARTON. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. MESSER. I yield to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. BARTON. Chairman Upton and I strongly support the gentleman from Indiana's amendment. We commend him for offering it. We think it adds to the bill. Mr. MESSER. I thank the gentleman from Texas. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in mild opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. PALLONE. I support the amendment but would note that the best way to prevent our Nation's oil resources from falling into the hands of bad actors is to maintain the reasonable, time-tested controls on exports that are currently in place. If you are concerned about our oil falling into the wrong hands, then you should vote ``no'' on final passage of H.R. 702. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's comments. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana will be postponed. Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Messer The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Add at the end the following: SEC. 7. PROHIBITION ON EXPORTS OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, AND PETROCHEMICAL PRODUCTS TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN. Nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize the export of crude oil, refined petroleum products, and petrochemical products by or through any entity or person, wherever located, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to any entity or person located in, subject to the jurisdiction of, or sponsored by the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana. Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chair, again, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton) for his leadership on this important bill and reiterate my support for H.R. 702. This is commonsense legislation that repeals the outdated ban on crude oil exports. The U.S. is producing more oil today than ever before, and we could literally become a net exporter of energy, something that would have been unimaginable a generation ago and would have incredible results for our economy. The fact that we are the only advanced nation that prohibits the export of domestically produced oil holds us back. I believe very strongly that we should not empower our enemies unintentionally through this legislation, and this includes the Islamic Republic of Iran. My amendment today prohibits the export of crude oil, refined petroleum products, and petrochemical products to Iran. Obviously, Iran has oil. It has no need to import it from the United States. But my amendment goes beyond just crude oil. It ensures Iran will not inadvertently have access to other petroleum-based products produced in the U.S. Refined petroleum and petrochemical products are used to manufacture thousands of goods that we use every day. Things like plastics, asphalt, paints, and cell phones are manufactured in this way. It was only a few weeks ago in this very Chamber that we discussed the dangers of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the Iran nuclear deal. Despite being able to enrich uranium and self- police its nuclear facilities, Iran will receive sanctions relief to the tune of $150 billion. That is $150 billion pumped into a $400- billion-a-year national economy. $150 billion of that will, no doubt, be used by Iran to bankroll terrorist organizations, further destabilize the Middle East, and continue their work to wipe Israel off the map. Things should not be made easier for them. The intent of the underlying bill is not to aid and support Iran. It is to open up the U.S. energy sector, export oil, grow our economy, and create thousands of jobs. My amendment ensures that the intention of this bill is clear. I believe the amendment is consistent with the underlying goals of the bill, and I encourage my colleagues to support its adoption. Mr. BARTON. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. MESSER. I yield to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. BARTON. The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton), the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield), and myself support your amendment and ask that it be accepted. Mr. MESSER. I thank the gentleman. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, again, I rise in mild opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana. However, I would point out that Iran has the fourth largest number of proven oil reserves in the world. In fact, supporters of this bill often state concern over the [[Page H6957]] market impact of increased Iranian exports on domestic producers. So while it is hard to understand why we need to worry about our crude oil going to a country that is a major net exporter of oil, I have no objection to adopting this amendment and making really sure Iran doesn't get any of our oil and petroleum products. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MESSER. I appreciate the gentleman's comments. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana will be postponed. Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Cuellar The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of the bill, add the following new section: SEC. 7. PARTNERSHIPS WITH MINORITY SERVING INSTITUTIONS. (a) In General.--The Department of Energy shall continue to develop and broaden partnerships with minority serving institutions, including Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI) and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in the areas of oil and gas exploration, production, midstream, and refining. (b) Public-private Partnerships.--The Department of Energy shall encourage public Private partnerships between the energy sector and minority serving institutions, including Hispanic Serving Institutions and Historically Black Colleges and Universities. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Chairman, I am here, of course, to talk about an amendment to H.R. 702, this important legislation before us that will lift this outdated ban on the export of oil, modernize the U.S. energy economy, and create U.S. jobs. The amendment that I bring forward is to help Minority-Serving Institutions grow the leaders of the future in the oil and gas industry. The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that Hispanics will account for 74 percent of the growth in the Nation's labor force from 2010 to 2020. This amendment ensures that our Minority-Serving Institutions, such as Hispanic-Serving Institutions and Historically Black Colleges and Universities, can create a competitive and able workforce in our oil and gas industry. This will ensure that our Nation can continue to compete in the global market far into the future. Hispanic-Serving Institutions are about 12 percent of the nonprofit colleges and universities, yet they enroll 59 percent of all Hispanic students. The other part of this amendment, Mr. Chairman, is that it also calls for the Department of Energy to encourage public-private partnerships between the energy sector and Minority-Serving Institutions. This is an amendment that I think will be good for all workers across the Nation. I ask all Members to vote in favor of this amendment and to support the underlying bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I do support the gentleman's amendment. I want to commend him for his leadership on this issue. I hope we will accept it on a voice vote. I see Mr. Rush. I am willing to yield to my good friend from Chicago (Mr. Rush) if he wishes to speak on it. I was told he might. Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the bill. Mr. BARTON. I yield for the 1-minute prayer, not the 5-minute sermon. Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, I respectfully decline the time the gentleman was gracious to give. I really want my own time on the bill. The Acting CHAIR. The time has already been claimed. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush), which couldn't exceed 5 minutes because that is all I have. Mr. RUSH. I thank my friend for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I must say that I did not come here to Congress to shadowbox with the majority party over jobs and economic opportunities for the intergenerationally and chronically unemployed citizens of my district and similarly situated districts across the country. Mr. Chairman, my amendment, which was not allowed by the majority party, would have provided real solutions to real problems. My amendment would have put dollars in the pocketbooks of the unemployed minorities, the unemployed women, and the unemployed veterans of this Nation. Mr. Chairman, I must say, this amendment before us is like pouring perfume on an overused pigsty. It provides DOE--and I quote from the amendment, Mr. Chairman--it provides DOE with the authority to continue its ongoing work. In other words, it tells the Department of Energy: Do what you are already doing. Mr. Chairman, unlike the amendment I offered in the Rules Committee that was drafted with input and collaboration from the various stakeholders who would benefit most had it been adopted, there is no specific initiative, no program, and no objections in the Cuellar amendment. Mr. Chairman, the Rush amendment would have established--not encouraged, but established--partnerships between DOE, Commerce, the Small Business Administration, Minority Business Development Agency, industry, the National Minority Supplier Diversity Council, the Women's Business Enterprise Network Council, and minority chambers of commerce chapters across the Nation. The Rush amendment would have established programmatic commitments for diversity hiring for vendor and contracting opportunities within the supply chain through contractual obligations, incentives, and other means with a goal of no less than 10 percent participation by minority- owned firms by the year 2020. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would have created regional diversity supply chain specialty centers to develop strategies for minority business contracting and vendor opportunities, and to hold business development sessions in strategic locations where energy development exists or is expanding. The Rush amendment would have helped minority- and women-owned firms form consortiums and partnerships in order to better meet qualifications and capacities that industry is seeking. Mr. Chairman, the Rush amendment would have established a program to provide access to capital for loans, financing, and insurance assistance for minority- and women-owned businesses. Mr. Chairman, the Rush amendment would have established--not just encouraged, but established--public-private partnerships between minority-owned banks and private investors as well as provided grants to Minority-Serving Institutions to help recruit businesses for energy- related supply chain sector activity. Again, Mr. Chairman, I am not here to criticize my friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar). I am here to just bring out the differences between what an imaginary amendment would do and what a real amendment would do. Mr. BARTON. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the kind words of the gentleman from Illinois. I understand the amendment that he was trying to get in. Actually, I was trying to help try to get his amendment accepted, but it is up to the Rules Committee and the democracy there. This amendment is very simple. It is something that we have added in the [[Page H6958]] appropriation bill on different agencies. We all have voted for this in the appropriation bills time after time after time, and it is to help the Minority-Serving Institutions. I ask the gentleman from Texas and Members to please accept this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar). The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. The Chair understands that amendment No. 8 will not be offered. Amendment No. 9 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of the bill, add the following new section: SEC. 7. REPORT. Not later than 10 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Commerce shall jointly transmit to Congress a report that reviews the impact of lifting the oil export ban under this Act as it relates to promoting United States energy and national security. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas. {time} 1215 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me thank Mr. Pallone and Mr. Barton for their courtesies and as well the Rules Committee. Let me first of all say there has been a lot of discussion on the floor of the House regarding this bill and different opinions. Might I add that this is an important and vigorous discussion. I think this is the best of what this Congress is all about. Mr. Chairman, I would like to take note of H.R. 702, which many of us know came about because of the gas prices in the 1970s. This bill simply repeals that portion of the legislation that responded to that crisis. What I like in the bill is, of course, we have in the bill that we, as a Congress, will get a report some 120 days after dealing with the maintenance and the strength of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That is a very important national security item. A savings clause indicates, of course, that the President has all of his powers in the light of crisis and other issues to implement any necessary changes or any necessary restrictions on this legislation. My amendment tracks giving more information. Not later than 10 years after the date of enactment of this act, the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Commerce shall jointly transmit to Congress a report that reviews the impact of lifting the oil import ban under this act as relates to promoting, supporting, and providing for the United States energy and national security policy. Our number one responsibility is the American people--I understand that--both environmentally, which reflects to their own energy resources, and certainly with national security. This amendment allows for that report to be on the front side of 10 years. It could be 2 years from now, 3 years from now, and the Congress can dictate that. U.S. crude production bottomed in 2008 at about 7 million barrels a day. It is now more than 11 million barrels a day, and it is now possible to go up to 18 million barrels a day in 2040 under the strictest environmental concerns. But right now in my district--right now in my district--they are laying off thousands of people because there is no work. So I would argue to my colleagues that this amendment provides the insight on what is going on. This bill could provide the GDP would rise by 550 billion to 1.8 trillion between 2015 and 2039. It is estimated in my own congressional job lifting the ban would generate an additional 500 hundred jobs, an additional 270 million in the local economy, and increase government revenues in 227 million. This 10-year period under that--by the way, it is up to 10 years--is giving long enough time to provide a probative, intelligent assessment of whether there is irreversible damage. Amendment No. 9 operates as a safety valve and reassures that those who may be skeptical of lifting the export ban get reasonable opportunities to oppose it or get the right information. The same thing with those who may support it. It gives us a basis of empirical data rigorously analyzed. Mr. Chairman, my amendment can be summed up as follows: For those who are confident in the future, my amendment offers vindication. For those who are skeptical of the new change, my amendment will provide the evidence they need to prove their case. I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I would rise in mild opposition, which could turn to support. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Houston for offering it. Is she willing to do this on a voice vote and consider voting for the bill if we accept it? Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. BARTON. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Is the gentleman rising to support the gentlewoman's amendment with great enthusiasm? Mr. BARTON. I will if you rise to voice vote on your amendment. I will make it a package deal. I will give you this amendment and the next amendment double enthusiasm if they are both voice votes and you actually really do vote for the bill or at least start thinking about it strongly. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. BARTON. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentleman surmise that amendments that are passed by voice vote are still strong amendments? Mr. BARTON. Oh, they are. Ms. JACKSON LEE. And included in the bill? Mr. BARTON. Yes, ma'am. Ms. JACKSON LEE. As opposed to being susceptible to being gotten rid of? Mr. BARTON. No. You have got my word. I will be on the conference committee if we have one. Your amendments will be in the conference report that goes to the President if we get that far. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I am always eager to work with my friends on this side of aisle, Mr. Pallone. I am always eager to work when we are moving forward. And so I would offer my amendment and offer it for a voice vote. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in, as I just said I would, double enthusiastic support of her amendment, but I am going to be looking on that board when it comes time to vote. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me just simply say my amendment answers many of the concerns that have been expressed on the floor of the House by giving empirical data, not 10 years and beyond, but in a period up to 10 years, to let us make further informative decisions to provide for the energy resources of the American people, the national resources, and, of course, being able to provide for the national security. With that, I ask for support of the Jackson Lee amendment. Mr. Chair, let me express my appreciation to Chairman Emeritus Barton and Ranking Member Pallone for their leadership and commitment to American energy independence and economic growth and security. I also wish to thank Chairman Sessions, Ranking Member Slaughter, and the members of the Rules Committee for making in order Jackson Lee Amendment Number 9. Mr. Chair, thank you for the opportunity to explain my amendment, which provides: Sec. 7. Report. Not later than 10 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Commerce shall jointly transmit to Congress a report that reviews the impact of lifting the oil export ban under this Act as it relates to promoting United States energy and national security. As the Member of Congress from Houston, the energy capital of the nation, I have always [[Page H6959]] been mindful of the importance and have strongly advocated for national energy policies that will make our nation more energy independent, preserve and create jobs, and keep our nation's economy strong. The Eighteenth Congressional District, which I am proud to represent is home to Shell Oil, ConocoPhillips, Chevron Phillips, BP Corporation of North America, Marathon Oil, Enterprise Products Partners (Oil and Gas Pipelines), and Halliburton (Oilfield Services), and many others. I am strongly ``pro-jobs,'' ``pro-growing economy,'' ``pro- sustainable environment and development,'' and for homeland and national security. Volatile energy prices threaten economic security for millions of middle class Americans and hits consumers hard; rising gas prices strain budgets for millions of American families. It is a familiar story, but in order to restore lasting security for middle class families we need a smart and reasonable plan for American energy, not false promises or quick fixes. That is why I carefully consider each energy legislative proposal brought to the floor on its individual merits and support them when they are sound, balanced, fair, and promote the national interest. So my constituents have a strong interest in policies that maintain or enhance the competitiveness of American petroleum energy business in the world oil markets. Where they fall short, I believe in working across the aisle to improve them by offering constructive amendments. H.R. 702 repeals the law prohibiting the exports of crude oil that has been on the books for more than 40 years, a response to the Arab Oil Embargo led by OPEC in 1973 that sent oil prices soaring and inflicted substantial damage on the American economy. But much has changed since 1973; America's unconventional oil boom changed everything. U.S. crude production bottomed in 2008 at about 7 million barrels per day; now it is now more than 11 million barrels per day and according to the U.S. DOE's Energy Information Administration, U.S. output is estimated to top 18 million barrels a day by 2040. Crude inventories are at an 80-year high, and imports have declined nearly 30% between 2005 and 2013. Mr. Chair, paradoxically, continuation of the crude oil export ban may pose one of the biggest threats to this U.S. production boom and to the economy. This is because increased production has led to a substantial decline in oil prices over the past year and the resulting decrease in revenues has forced U.S. producers in my district and elsewhere to slash investment and cancel projects. Since last autumn the industry has cut more than 125,000 jobs, including many in my district. I have met and know many of the employers and workers affected by industry job reductions. Mr. Chair, lifting the crude oil export ban would offer American crude oil producers new markets for their product and would mean fewer layoffs. Studies by the highly respected Brookings Institution and other organizations suggest that the economic benefits to the nation of repealing the ban on crude oil exports would be substantial: 1. GDP could rise by $550 billion to $1.8 trillion between 2015 and 2039; 2. U.S. oil production could rise by 1.3 million to 2.9 million barrels per day in 2020; 3. 300,000 additional jobs created by 2020; 4. $5.8 billion in estimated reduced consumer fuel costs each year between 2015 and 2035; 5. up to $70 billion in additional investment in U.S. exploration, development, and production of crude oil between 2015 and 2020; 6. $13.5 billion in additional federal, state, and local revenue in 2020; 7. $22 billion reduction in the U.S. trade deficit in 2020; and 8. 100,000 barrels per day increase in refinery throughout between 2015 and 2035. It is estimated that in my own congressional district, lifting the ban would generate an additional 500 jobs and inject an additional $275 million into the local economy, resulting in an increase in government revenues in the amount of $227.7 million. Admittedly, these are predictions, projections, and forecasts made on the basis of the best information currently available. We hope they are accurate but candor requires that we acknowledge that no one can say with certainty they will come to pass. That is why it is essential that at an appropriate juncture we review and assess the impact on the American petroleum industry, the national economy, and consumers. And that is the purpose of Jackson Lee Amendment #9, which mandates a comprehensive review of the impact of crude oil export ban repeal after a 10 year period. This 10 year time period is long enough to accumulate data sufficient and probative enough to assess the impact of H.R. 702, but not so long as to prevent irreversible damage if the evaluation does not approximate the expected benefits reveals unintended adverse consequences. In sum, Jackson Lee Amendment Number 9 will help ensure that the brave new world of unrestricted crude oil exports by American producers is more than a leap of faith. Rather, Jackson Lee Amendment Number 9 operates as a safety valve and reassures those who may be skeptical of lifting the export ban that reasonable opportunities will exist to make an informed evaluation of the effect of the ban's repeal on our economy and national security. And it is important to emphasize Mr. Chair, that this evaluation will be based on empirical data rigorously analyzed. In short, Mr. Chair, my amendment can be summed up as follows: for those who are confident of the future, my amendment offers vindication. For those who are skeptical that the new change will work, my amendment will provide the evidence they need to prove their case. And for those who believe that maintaining the status quo is intolerable, my amendment offers a way forward. I urge all members to support Jackson Lee Amendment Number 9. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 10 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of the bill, add the following new section: SEC. 7. REPORT TO CONGRESS. Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Commerce shall jointly transmit to Congress a report analyzing how lifting the ban on crude oil exports will help create opportunities for veterans and women in the United States, while promoting energy and national security. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I ask that my amendment be considered by my colleagues. Mr. Chairman, my amendment requires within 180 days of enactment the Secretaries of Energy and Commerce submit a report to Congress analyzing how lifting the ban on crude oil, in particular, on exports, will create opportunities for veterans and women. Mr. Chairman, just a few days ago I went to an initiative called Stand Down. I have gone a number of years. Most military persons will understand it is where you come and stand down from battle. In this instance, they were veterans, many of them homeless, many of them in great need. Obviously, social services, substance abuse services, and others were offered there. What I heard from these men who wore the uniform in dignity is they want jobs. Mr. Chairman, I believe that this legislation will provide a strong pro-jobs agenda growing the economy. As my previous amendment said, I do not take lightly the impact of lifting the ban; therefore, my previous amendment would provide the insight on whether or not this is a positive impact. I can tell you that there is a great need, as has been discussed earlier, about collaborating with historically Black colleges and Hispanic-serving colleges. I have worked on those issues and have certainly seen the leadership of Mr. Rush and Mr. Cuellar. But I will tell you that it is indicated that State shale development supports American jobs. Mr. Chairman, $107,000 is the average salary that is provided by the energy company in energy jobs, 1.7 million employment attributed to upstream, unconventional oil and natural gas. Women fill 40 percent of the vacancies in oil and gas. Mr. Chairman, I will insert this into the Record. [[Page H6960]] [Apr. 23, 2014] The Energy Revolution is Creating Career Opportunities for Women and Minorities (By Cheryl Jackson) Minorities are projected to fill an unprecedented number of jobs in the oil, natural gas and petrochemical industries-- increasing from one-quarter of total jobs in 2010 to one- third by 2030--according to a new IHS report sponsored by API. ``The oil and natural gas industry pays wages significantly higher than the national average and can provide tremendous career opportunities for women and minorities,'' said Jack Gerard, API President and CEO. ``To lower unemployment and shrink the income inequality gap without spending a dime of taxpayer money, we encourage President Obama to embrace this pro-development energy opportunity.'' Of up to 1.3 million new job opportunities in the oil, natural gas and petrochemical industries predicted by 2030, almost 408,000 positions--32 percent of the total--are projected to be held by African American and Hispanic workers, according to the report. Women are estimated to fill 185,000 of those jobs, and 63 percent of new job opportunities will be in blue collar professions. ``We have the natural resources and the technology to be a global energy superpower with all the economic and national security benefits that entails,'' Gerard said. ``Smart energy policy will create tremendous opportunity for hundreds of thousands of workers--from those with just a high school diploma and some post-secondary training to those with post- graduate degrees.'' ``As the study highlights job opportunities, it signals the tremendous need to prepare African Americans, Hispanics and Women to be ready to fill the workforce gap'', said Paula Jackson, president and CEO of the American Association of Blacks in Energy. ``These jobs in the oil and natural gas industry don't just put people to work, they help to transform communities.'' ``This powerful and important report is a road map for workforce development stakeholders to align the content of their training with a sense of urgency to adequately prepare people for energy jobs,'' said Jose L. Perez, chairman and CEO Of Hispanics In Energy. ``Energy job replacement and growth is a clear pathway for diverse communities to rise from poverty to middle-class, what a rare opportunity.'' Ms. JACKSON LEE. The government and the administration are working to pair up and find jobs for veterans. The unemployment rate for veterans we have seen has been a constant issue, and it is going down. But we need to provide them with other opportunities. They were higher unemployment, as we can see, than the regular workforce. So my amendment wants to ensure that, if we lift this ban, women and veterans will benefit. We know, of course, that we have been pushing our educational facilities to engage in STEM, but what we need now is a pipeline for qualified veterans and women looking for jobs right now. Mr. Chairman, I would ask my colleagues to support this Jackson Lee amendment. It causes us to focus on these vulnerable populations--women and veterans--to direct them into the industry. Might I say to my constituents, the energy companies that I represent, a long list of names that I will not name at this time, that we hope that they are focused as well on expanding opportunities in the energy industry for veterans, returning soldiers, if you will, women, and, of course, across-the-board minorities. This is an industry that is moving and growing, and the opportunities should move and grow as well. With that, Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I only would like to say we support the amendment and we will honor the deal we just made on the prior amendment. I ask for a ``yes'' vote on a voice vote on the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Pallone. I hope that our colleagues have heard us to emphasize the creation of jobs along with the environment, national security, and the energy resources of America. Mr. Chair, again, let me express my appreciation to Chairman Emeritus Barton and Ranking Member Pallone for their leadership and commitment to American energy independence, economic growth, national security, and expanding opportunities and diversifying the energy sector workforce. Mr. Chair, thank you for the opportunity to explain my amendment, which provides: Sec. 7. Report. Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Commerce shall jointly transmit to Congress a report analyzing how lifting the ban on crude oil exports will help create opportunities for veterans and women in the United States, while promoting energy and national security. I also wish to thank Chairman Sessions, Ranking Member Slaughter, and the members of the Rules Committee for making in order Jackson Lee Amendment Number 10. As the Member of Congress from Houston, the energy capital of the nation, I have always been mindful of the importance and have strongly advocated for national energy policies that will make our nation more energy independent, preserve and create jobs, and keep our nation's economy strong. I strongly am ``pro-jobs,'' ``pro-growing economy,'' and ``pro- expanding economic opportunities for women, veterans, minorities, and small business!'' That is why I carefully consider each energy legislative proposal brought to the floor on its individual merits and support them when they are sound, balanced, promote the national interest, and expand economic opportunities for everyone, particularly for women, veterans, and members of underrepresented communities. My constituents have a strong interest in policies that maintain or enhance the competitiveness of American petroleum energy business in the world oil markets. Where they fall short, I believe in working across the aisle to improve them by offering constructive amendments. That is why I have offered Jackson Lee Amendment Number 10, which recognizes the fact that veterans, minorities, small businesses and women currently are significantly underrepresented in the oil and gas industries at all levels and severely underrepresented in the senior managerial, professional, board and ownership ranks. Jackson Lee Amendment Number 10 directs the Secretaries of Commerce and Energy to submit a report to Congress within 180 days assessing the beneficial impact, if any, that lifting the crude oil export ban holds for veterans and women. This report should shed light on any additional measures that should be taken to increase the participation of women and veterans in the petroleum industry as workers, executives, and entrepreneurs. Nationally, there were 1.2 million people employed in the oil and gas industry in 2010, only 17% of which are women. Our booming energy sector has been one of the great American success stories over the last decade, and remains a bright spot in our economy as it continues to fuel job creation. To continue this success and to ensure that opportunities and benefits are shared equitably, it is critical that we have a diverse energy workforce equipped with the skills, knowledge, and experiences needed to compete and win in the global economy. And there is no better place to look than from our pool of talented veterans and women? Women make up half our population and are increasing their presence in the STEM fields vital to success in the petroleum energy sector. Veterans not only have proved their mettle and leadership skills in defense of our country but also are among the most resourceful and resilient members of our society, possessing the mission-critical ethic necessary for success in the workplace. A pipeline of qualified veterans and women looking for employment could play a key role as the energy industry seeks qualified, motivated, and skilled workers and entrepreneurs. As a nation, we must remain committed to utilizing the talents of women and veterans if our nation is to meet the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities offered by a dynamic global energy market. Jackson Lee Amendment Number 10 helps us meet this challenge by providing critical information regarding the impact of lifting the crude oil export ban will have on creating opportunities for veterans and women. I urge all members to support Jackson Lee Amendment Number 10. Mr. Chairman, with that, I ask for support of the Jackson Lee amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). The amendment was agreed to. Announcement by the Acting Chair The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, last Thursday was a tragic day for the American maritime community and America. El Faro, an American flagship en route to Puerto Rico, was lost in Hurricane Joaquin and, with it, its 33 crew, including 28 Americans. In the hours after we learned El Faro was in trouble, the Coast Guard, DOD, and other government and private sector partners mobilized assets with search crews battling treacherous weather conditions in an attempt to find survivors; and we appreciate their efforts. Mr. Chair, today our thoughts and prayers are with the crewmembers' families and loved ones. I ask that the House observe a moment of silence to honor the brave men and women who served on the El Faro. The Acting CHAIR. Members will rise and observe a moment of silence.

The question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Dold) having assumed the chair, Mr. Hultgren, Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 702) to adapt to changing crude oil market conditions, and, pursuant to House Resolution 466, he reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. Motion to Recommit Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. HUFFMAN. I am opposed in its current form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. Huffman moves to recommit the bill H.R. 702 to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith, with the following amendment: Page 3, line 17, insert ``Nothing in this Act prevents the President or any other Federal official from enforcing Federal laws or regulations necessary to protect human health, the environment, or public safety, including the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.), the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96-129), the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107-355), the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety Act of 2006 (Pub. L. 109-468), or the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (Pub. L. 112-90).'' after ``prohibit exports.''. Mr. BARTON (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I reserve the right to make a point of order against the bill that it is not germane. The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved. The Clerk will continue to read. The Clerk continued to read. Mr. HUFFMAN (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that we suspend the reading. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Parliamentary Inquiry Mr. BARTON. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. BARTON. If I make a point of order that the motion to recommit is not germane and it, in fact, is not germane, there is no vote. Is that correct? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will not respond to a hypothetical. A point of order has been reserved. Point of Order Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, I make a point of order that the motion to recommit is not germane. Oh, it is germane. I withdraw the point of order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The point of order and the reservation of the point of order is withdrawn. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, let me begin with the usual stipulations. This is the final amendment to the bill. It won't kill the bill or send it back to committee. When this is adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended, so there is no procedural reason to oppose this motion to recommit. Let's talk about the substance. Now, we have heard a lot of debate this morning about the need to give Big Oil--the most profitable industry in the history of the world--yet another advantage. For years, Americans have been told that we have to ``drill, baby, drill.'' The theory that we always hear is that we need to extract every barrel of oil from every acre of American soil to keep gas prices low and to provide ``energy security.'' But as soon as American gas prices started to drop, the curtain was raised, and the truth was revealed. The real reason for ``drill, baby, drill,'' surprise, surprise, was to give Big Oil the chance to maximize their profits on the world market. It is not enough that they have been able to game the Tax Code for a century with billions of dollars of tax breaks not available to other taxpayers or businesses. It is not enough that they continue to enjoy access to our public lands and waters for oil drilling, even though they are no longer paying into the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the longstanding law that expired at the beginning of this month. As a reminder, for the past 50 years, the Land and Water Conservation Fund was an agreement, a compact between the American people and Big Oil. It said that when we let oil and gas companies drill and profit from drilling in Federal waters, they have to dedicate a fraction of the profits, just a fraction, to protect our great outdoors for future generations. The deal is that they have to dedicate a fraction of those profits to protecting our great outdoors for future generations so that our grandchildren will be able to hike and hunt and fish in our parks and wildlife refuges. The Land and Water Conservation Fund was shamefully allowed to lapse at the beginning of this month, and the majority hasn't scheduled a single vote--or even a hearing--to get it back on the books. No, all of these concessions to the oil and gas industry are not enough for this House. With today's bill, the House majority is saying that American oil and gas companies can drill more, export more, and realize even greater profits, no matter the environmental consequences, no matter the consequences to health and safety. As presently written, the underlying bill, H.R. 702, would permanently ensure that no export restrictions for any reason could be implemented or enforced in the future. That is what this bill says. That is breathtaking in its devotion to the oil and gas industry's agenda. Now, my motion to recommit would ensure that the President and Federal [[Page H6964]] Government agencies charged with protecting human health, the environment, and public safety can continue to do their job that constituents rely on them to do. Specifically, with this amendment, we will ensure that bedrock health and safety laws, like the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act, that laws like that will not be cast aside in favor of Big Oil's desire to sell more crude overseas. Now, if you think about it, this is a very straightforward motion. I just want to ask my colleagues a question: Should crude oil exports trump the Safe Drinking Water Act? Should Big Oil profits trump the need for pipeline safety and pipeline inspection? Of course not. We need to protect safe drinking water. We need to ensure pipeline safety. So, my colleagues, I urge you to vote ``yes'' on this MTR to improve this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BARTON. First of all, I want to thank the minority for giving us a one-page motion to recommit that I can actually read and understand. I have read it. I don't like it. It is not necessary. It is redundant. I oppose it. Please vote against it. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Recorded Vote Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule XX, this 5-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by 5- minute votes on passage of the bill, if ordered, and approval of the Journal, if ordered.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material in the Record on the bill, H.R. 702. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 466 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 702. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hultgren) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. {time} 1003 In the Committee of the Whole Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 702) to adapt to changing crude oil market conditions, with Mr. Hultgren in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Harper), a member of the committee. Mr. HARPER. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 702, but, more importantly, I rise today in support of American jobs. The U.S. daily production of oil has increased dramatically in the past 14 years. That number is projected to continue to increase due to advances in technology, but companies need a new market. At this point, the ban is not protecting the economy. Instead, the economy is being restricted, and Americans are being denied jobs. My district and State rely on good-paying oil industry jobs. At a time when our economy can't afford to see unemployment numbers rise, oil companies are being forced to cut back their workforce. Lifting the ban on crude oil exports will mean new jobs for Mississippians that will allow them to support their families. I urge my colleagues to support and vote for H.R. 702 and for American jobs. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 702, a poorly crafted bill that needlessly and recklessly sweeps away 40 years of critical energy protections for national security, our economy, consumers, and the environment. H.R. 702 is a blunt object that doesn't just undermine current protective authorities related to crude oil; it also prohibits any Federal official from taking any action at any time if that action either restricts or enforces a restriction on the export of oil. The term ``restriction'' is undefined and potentially dangerous in scope. The bill would also override any other law that would impose any restriction by any Federal official on exports. That means that the bill does nothing to preserve any environment or safety statutes or regulations, and it doesn't even preserve the Defense Production Act, one of the most important tools any President has to ensure our national energy security in the face of a threat. Let's be clear, Mr. Chairman. The President has already stated that he will veto this bill. Further, any legislation of this nature is completely unnecessary since the President already has the authority to ease or even remove restrictions on crude oil exports, and the Obama administration has taken major steps to exercise that authority by approving crude oil swaps with Mexico and applications for the export of condensate. The bottom line, Mr. Chairman, is that it is imperative for Congress to consider a host of factors before we lift the current restrictions and, certainly, if we are to completely dismantle our Nation's ability to restrict oil exports, as proposed by H.R. 702. First, Mr. Chairman, there are consumer impacts, especially related to the price of crude oil and gasoline. A recent study found that changes to U.S. oil export policy will have little to no impact on the future price of oil. What we do know is that changes in our crude oil policy will lead to a significant payday for oil producers, with increases in annual profits approaching $30 billion by 2025. Next, there are the impacts on our refinery capacity and associated jobs, well-paying middle class jobs that have grown over the past few years due to increased production. Unrestricted exports of crude oil put those jobs at jeopardy and could mean exporting those jobs and losing out on critical investments in future refining capacity. And finally, Mr. Chairman, there are, of course, the environmental and climate impacts of lifting the export ban. Energy policy is fundamentally linked to environmental policy. Each is a facet of the other. Increasing crude oil exports means increasing domestic production and its impacts on climate change, public health, worker safety, property owners, and protection of our drinking water supplies. As I have said before, this legislation eagerly embraces short-term profits and benefits without understanding or even considering the cost of such a major action. We simply can't afford to make that mistake. We should ensure we fully understand and consider the enduring consequences of our actions and choose the cleanest and most sustainable path forward. I don't believe, Mr. Chairman, that the potential impacts of H.R. 702 on national security, on the economy, on consumers, and on the environment can be considered acceptable. So, Mr. Chairman, increased crude exports certainly help oil companies. It is a bonanza for the oil companies, but without any guaranteed benefits for consumers. I urge my colleagues to join me and the President in saying ``no'' to this legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Parliamentary Inquiries Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I have a parliamentary inquiry. The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. BARTON. My understanding, in general debate, the majority, or proponents, have 30 minutes, and then the opponents have 30 minutes; is that correct? [[Page H6942]] The CHAIR. On this bill, yes, the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce each control 30 minutes. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar), the original Democrat sponsor, have 6 minutes of the proponent's time to control as he sees fit. The CHAIR. The Chair cannot entertain a unanimous consent request to change the scheme for control of general debate. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I have an additional parliamentary inquiry. The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. BARTON. Could the Chair educate the illiterate Member from Texas on how I could give Mr. Cuellar time that he may control on his side? If I can't yield it unanimously, how can I do that? The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas may yield from his own time to engage in debate, and may yield to Members on the other side of the aisle. Mr. BARTON. Continuing the parliamentary inquiry, if I do that, can he reserve part of that time, or does he have to use it all in one slot? The CHAIR. The other gentleman from Texas would not control the time. Mr. BARTON. He could not reserve any of it? The CHAIR. Correct. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson). Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for the time to speak on this bill, which I wholeheartedly support, because ending this oil export ban will not only boost our economy, it will also improve our foreign policy. I also rise with hesitation to a proposed amendment that would remove a provision of this bill boosting payments to the 60 ships of our maritime security fleet. These ships are essential in transporting cargo to the men and women of our Armed Forces who are serving overseas in harm's way. As evidence of this, 90 percent of all cargo moved to Iraq and Afghanistan has been transported on these privately owned ships. As of right now, Mr. Chairman, the stipend provided by the government is too low to make this program viable to those who have stepped up to defend our Nation against foreign threats. Without this increase, it is likely that participants will drop out of the program. This, obviously, is a national security threat. It is estimated that for the government to replicate this program, it would cost more than $50 billion in taxpayer money. This programs saves money while enhancing our security, and I encourage my colleagues to avoid supporting this amendment, but voting ``yes'' to lift this outdated oil export ban. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F. Doyle). Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this bill. I have been here in Congress for 21 years, and during that time, we always hear talk about we want to be energy-independent in the United States. My colleagues on both sides of the aisle always talk about the dream of energy independence, where we don't have to depend on any other country for our oil. It would change policy in the Middle East, and it would dramatically improve our national security. Well, the bad news is, Mr. Chairman, we are not energy-independent. We use 17 million barrels of oil a day, but we only produce 9 million, which means we are still importing nearly half of all the oil we use. Now, here is the good news, Mr. Chairman. Horizontal drilling and all this oil we are finding in the shale formations gives us a chance to be truly energy-independent. We could produce an additional 9 million barrels a day, and we wouldn't have to depend on any other country in the world for our oil. All we have to do is produce what we have in our own country and make sure that we have refinery capacity to take care of this light sweet crude, and we are energy-independent. So the question is, Mr. Chairman, why aren't we investing in our own domestic refinery capacity to keep high-paying jobs here in the United States in the refinery industry, in the maritime trades, and in manufacturing, like steelmaking? Why aren't we doing that for America while enhancing America's security? We had the former commander of the USS Cole, Kirk Lippold, testify before our committee. He highlighted ``the significant national security risks associated with greater oil imports.'' He said that ``too many times in recent history, the U.S. has made oil deals with hostile or unfriendly governments that actually threaten our foreign policy and our national security objectives. ``Lifting the export ban will undermine U.S. power projection capabilities by undermining the competitiveness of our U.S. refineries.'' Do we really want to undermine the U.S. military? And then we hear the story that, somehow, lifting this ban is going to help our European allies because it will reduce their dependence on Russian oil. Well, that is a myth, too. As Commander Lippold testified before our committee, ``the primary recipient of this U.S. exported oil is going to be Asia, specifically, China.'' {time} 1015 So we want to export U.S. oil to China and still have to import oil from countries that aren't necessarily friendly to us. Why would we do that? Mr. Chairman, H.R. 702 is deeply flawed because it doesn't allow for any future oversight of oil exports under any circumstances. Even if there is an oil spike or a shortage, there is no ``safety valve'' to ensure that we have enough of this critical resource for our Armed Forces, our industries, and our constituents. In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, this bill undermines our national security, and we are still importing an incredible amount of oil. This just defies common sense, and we should reject it. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Mimi Walters), a cosponsor of the bill. Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 702, legislation that would lift the 40-year-old ban on U.S. oil exports. In 1975, President Gerald Ford signed the ban into law in response to gasoline shortages and the Arab oil embargo. While the ban served a purpose nearly 40 years ago, much has changed since that time. Today we need an energy policy that aligns with our current economic and political climate. The United States is the largest petroleum and natural gas producer in the world. Our self-imposed export ban doesn't make sense and does nothing but hinder economic growth. If the ban is lifted this year, over 57,000 new supply chain jobs would be created in my home State of California by 2018, and nationwide nearly 450,000 new jobs would be created. Having the option to put U.S. crude oil on the world market would benefit Americans. Lifting the ban would create jobs, strengthen the U.S. economy, and help reduce our trade deficit. It would also provide the international marketplace with more options, in turn, limiting the ability of energy commodities to be used as political weapons. It is important to note that this bill doesn't require the U.S. to export crude oil. It simply provides the option needed for barrels to be used in the areas where they are needed most. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time so the Republicans can have another speaker. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hinojosa) at the request of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar), who is my original Democrat sponsor. Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support and as a cosponsor of H.R. 702, which lifts the ban on crude oil exports. Modern advances in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have allowed the United States access to large deposits of crude oil and natural gas. Last year our country produced over 350 million barrels of crude oil, and that number is steadily increasing. The crude oil in our deposits is lighter and sweeter than the traditional heavy crude oil our refineries process. The export ban hinders our access to international markets that need the [[Page H6943]] sweeter type of crude and that have the refinement infrastructure for it. I am convinced that lifting the outdated crude oil export ban will create jobs and economic opportunities for our communities as we strive for greater energy independence. In the great State of Texas, lifting the export ban is estimated to increase the annual GDP by over $7.1 billion and create over 40,000 new supply chain jobs. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BARTON. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds on behalf of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar). Mr. HINOJOSA. According to the Government Accountability Office, removing export restrictions will create employment opportunities, expand trade, and lower gasoline prices. The economic and political landscape has evolved since the ban's inception in the 1970s. I am confident that now is the time to repeal the ban on the export of crude oil to increase our economic and energy competitiveness. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 702. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green). Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 702. In the past 10 years, the United States has undergone an energy revolution. Our production of oil and gas has far exceeded all analysis or prediction. The success in the field has materialized into jobs in our district in the Houston area, both in the chemical and the refining industries. The price of oil dropped from $100 a barrel to $45 a barrel. Gasoline prices have fallen from $4 per gallon to less than $2 in Houston. I have represented our refinery complexes for many years. All of these benefited our economy and the consumer. Unfortunately, the success has brought hardship upon the upstream producers. The energy sector, which led our country out of the recession, has now laid off approximately 150,000 folks. Bloomberg estimated that 40 percent of those layoffs were in Texas. I know the oil patch is facing a tough and difficult time, and I want to help. That is why it is very difficult for me to oppose this bill today. I support crude oil exports while protecting our domestic manufacturing jobs, including refining. We have the resource. We should use as much as possible here at home and sell what is left. I am a legislator who would like to solve this problem, and I like working across the party lines to get results. In fact, I worked with my good friend from Texas, Joe Barton, on many issues during our years in Congress. In fact, Joe and I sat together for years at the Texas A&M football games until we realized A&M would lose when we sat next to each other. So last Saturday, when they beat Mississippi State, we sat a ways apart so we didn't jinx them. For months, I talked with Representative Barton about the crude export issue. The crude oil export ban has been in place since 1975. In the seventies, the United States was in a tough spot, and we put the ban in place to protect our national interests. That is more than 40 years of legislative history. Before we throw all of that away, we should make sure we have a policy that will make sense for the next 40 years. I am hoping we can craft a bill that would create a process at the Bureau of Industry and Security within the Department of Commerce that would establish an authorization and reporting requirements for crude oil. Crude oil is a valuable national resource, and the government should have some oversight as to where and when we send it overseas. We export liquefied natural gas through a process developed at the Department of Energy. I have not been a fan of that process, but we have worked to improve it. We should have some basic requirements at the Department of Commerce to oversee crude. Unlike LNG, crude is a raw commodity. Unlike refined products, raw crude oil doesn't have value added. Our refiners add value to that, and we export that refined product. So those are jobs created in our community. Building LNG terminals and exporting refined product creates good- paying jobs and lots of capital expenditure. If exporting crude is the right policy, then let's do it correctly. Let's maximize the benefits for the United States. Let's make sure U.S. crude doesn't end up in the hands of North Korea or any of our other foes. We need to know where this resource is going, how much of it is being sent, and how often it is being sent there. We need to ensure that, if at any time, a potential bad actor enters the marketplace; the Department of Commerce has the ability to enforce the law. The Department of Commerce is not an obstacle to exports. In fact, I have struggled to find a more industry-friendly government agency. The Department of Commerce has approved every application to export oil in the last five years. That's 138 permits. What's more impressive is Commerce approves 99 percent of all export applications, regardless of product. Now, I agree that the Department could approve permits more efficiently but that's something we can legislate. That's a ``fix'' I can support and believe would help our upstream producers. Unfortunately, we were unable to find that compromise. I did not want to oppose this bill but without changes it is not in the best interest of our country. The time to address exports is now but we cannot just open the tap and hope for the best. I do not want the United States to become a resource nation and I certainly do not want to go back to the days of the 1970s. I look forward to working on this issue again and hope that a reasonable, commonsense approach can be reached. I want folks in all sectors to get back to work. For these reasons, I am forced to oppose H.R. 702 and I urge all my colleagues to do the same. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds to respond to what the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green) just said. The whole concept of this bill is to let willing buyers interact with willing sellers in a free market, transparent fashion. If you subject the bill to some sort of a discretionary permitting requirement, as one of Mr. Gene Green's amendments would have done, you gut the bill. You destroy the entire purpose of the bill. So as much as I respect my good friend from Houston, Texas, I respectfully have to object to that amendment. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Lance), a member of the committee. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Chairman, I commend Chairman Emeritus Barton's tremendous leadership on this issue. I rise today in strong support of the bill, bipartisan in nature, which will create thousands of American jobs, generate billions of dollars in revenues to States and locals, and use our Nation's natural resources as a counterbalance to the rogue actors currently dominating world oil markets. American energy brings security and independence to the world and jobs and economic development to the United States. It makes no sense that Iranian oil will soon be permitted to flow, but American-made energy is left untapped. It is time to end the outdated restrictions on the export of U.S. oil and, instead, work to create and protect tens of thousands of U.S. jobs, enhance our national security, and help keep prices at the pump affordable for all consumers across the country. American energy brings growth, prosperity, security, and independence to the United States and our allies. Our Nation should counter Iran and create thousands of U.S. jobs in the process. Please vote for H.R. 702. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, may I ask how much time there is on both sides. The CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey has 20\1/2\ minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 24 minutes remaining. Mr. PALLONE. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the great State of New Mexico (Mr. Pearce), one of our original cosponsors and a strong proponent of this bill. [[Page H6944]] Mr. PEARCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I appreciate his work on this important proposition. Mr. Chairman, for almost my entire life, the Nation has worked under prevailing science that said we have reached peak energy, we are out, that we have to plan for the future because we have no more oil. Two years ago a discovery was found in New Mexico that will provide more oil from that one find than has been produced in our State from its entire history through the entire geographic part of New Mexico. The science was a lie. We are finding oil. What is happening right now is that the refineries use a heavy sour crude. The new finds in shale are producing light sweet, which is more valuable. It is easier to refine. Yet, that light sweet oil is sitting in the pipelines in New Mexico, trying to get to Houston. It is selling at $17 below the market cost because there is no destination. The Baltics have said they would use our oil, they would put our workers back to work. But this law prevents it. The law in place, H.R. 702, simply says: Open that door and put Americans back to work, Americans driving trucks, Americans at the convenient stores. Americans everywhere get the jobs. The idea that this somehow undercuts jobs is absolutely a frivolous idea to present on this House floor. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush), the ranking member of the subcommittee. Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, over the past couple of months, I have worked tirelessly to find a reasonable compromise with the sponsor of H.R. 702, my friend and colleague from Texas (Mr. Barton), that would allow me and others with similarly situated constituencies to support this bill. Although I share the concerns of many of my Democratic colleagues on how this bill might impact the environment and climate change, I have always stated that I believe in the all-of-the-above energy approach that balances environmental concerns and economic opportunities. Mr. Chairman, yesterday in the Rules Committee I advocated for an open rule process that would have allowed Democrats to offer amendments that would reflect priorities and concerns of the minority party. In fact, Mr. Chairman, I myself submitted an amendment that would have expanded access for minority- and women-owned firms to more fully participate in the energy supply chain, which we know will be greatly enhanced if the export ban is lifted. Mr. Chairman, although my friends in the environmental community wouldn't agree, in my district, we say: Oil is not just a commodity. Oil is indeed an economic opportunity. {time} 1030 Mr. Chairman, my most pressing concern is making sure up front and from the beginning that minority firms would be part of the pipeline economy and would directly benefit from vendor and contracting opportunities that lifting this ban would create. Instead, Mr. Chairman, despite positive rhetoric from members of the majority party, a closed rule was adopted. While my comprehensive amendment was not allowed, Members are asked to vote now on Trojan horse amendments that would do nothing to actually benefit minorities and women as my far-reaching amendment was designed to do. Rather than shielding the majority party from charges of creating a multibillion-dollar boondoggle for the energy industry, today there is not much in this bill as currently drafted that I can point to as really benefiting all segments of the American population. As I have said time and time and time again, cut us in or cut it out. Cut us in or cut it out. Cut women in or cut it out. Cut the minorities in or cut it out. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, we will put the gentleman from Illinois down as undecided on the bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Flores), who is the chairman of the Republican Study Committee and a member of the committee. He is from the home of the Fightin' Texas Aggies. Mr. FLORES. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 702. H.R. 702 results in five key benefits: Number one, it benefits the American consumer with resulting overall lower energy prices. This particularly benefits lower-income and lower- middle-income Americans, providing greater financial security for these hardworking families. Number two, it benefits the American producer and allows them to further reinvest in our domestic energy infrastructure, furthering our energy security and American jobs. Number three, it benefits our geopolitical standing and strengthens ties with our global friends and allies, and it hurts those countries like Russia, Iran, and Venezuela who are opposed to American interests around the world. Number four, it benefits the downstream refining community, as lower prices will stimulate volume demand for refined products. This volume gives them more financial capital to hire skilled American workers and to reinvest in their operation. Number five, it strengthens our national defense by enhancing the Maritime Security Program, which supports a robust Merchant Marine for use by our military during times of international crisis. These are five critical reasons why everybody wins after we lift the ban. The President has threatened to veto this commonsense bill, and hardworking American families all over this country should ask: Mr. President, why are you putting the interests of Iranian terrorists ahead of the interests of hardworking American families? Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge my colleagues to reject the Amash amendment and to support H.R. 702. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Eshoo). Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chairman, I thank our ranking member. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this legislation for several reasons. First, except in very narrow circumstances, the bill does not allow any limits--not any limits--on exports of domestic oil regardless of potential threats to our national security, and that is our top responsibility as Members--our national security. For decades there has been a bipartisan commitment in Congress and several administrations to energy independence and reducing our reliance on foreign oil. Given the continued dependence of our economy and our military on oil, energy independence remains critical to our national defense. But with little consideration of any national security implications, this bill allows unlimited exports of a critical strategic resource. Mr. Chairman, the United States still imports 26 percent of the oil we consume and remains the world's top importer. Every barrel exported under this bill would have to be replaced by a barrel imported from elsewhere, leaving us more reliant on foreign countries. The bill allows the President to limit exports only if he declares an emergency under the National Emergencies Act or the International Emergency Economic Powers Act or if he is directed by the International Energy Agency to respond to an international supply crisis. Outside of these narrow circumstances, the bill permits no restrictions on exports of crude oil. This means strategic considerations such as decreasing our reliance on imports from unfriendly regimes can play no part in deciding whether to allow exports. I don't think that is a good deal at all. The bill also will have drastic impacts on the U.S. shipbuilding industry, tanker fleet, and refineries, all of which are critical to our national defense. Congress has recognized for nearly 100 years that it benefits our national security to maintain a robust domestic shipbuilding industry and commercial shipping fleet. For example, crude exports from Alaska which were legalized in 1995 must be carried on U.S.-flagged vessels crewed by Americans. This bill contains no requirement that exports be carried on U.S.-flagged tankers. Under current law, the President can allow exports of crude oil if he finds they are in the national interest. This bill would allow unlimited exports regardless of whether they are in the national security interests of the United [[Page H6945]] States or not. I think that this is a slippery slope. Commander Kirk Lippold, the retired Navy Captain of the USS Cole, testified before Congress earlier this year. The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman. Ms. ESHOO. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Chairman, the retired Navy Captain of the USS Cole said the following: ``The national security implications of changing the existing policy regulating the export of crude oil are rife with unknown and probably unintended consequences that must be fully considered and addressed.'' I agree with Commander Lippold. This bill largely ignores those important national security concerns, and it is why I urge my colleagues to oppose it. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), from the energy capital of the world, Houston, Texas. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, the administration has worked very hard to make sure the export ban on crude oil from Iran is lifted. But the administration has threatened to veto this bill that would lift the crude oil sanction ban on American oil. That doesn't make any sense to me--help the Iranians sell their excess crude oil abroad, but prevent America from selling our excess crude oil abroad. That is nutty. Why does the President prefer the Iranians over Americans? It doesn't make any sense. The President should at least give us the same deal that he gave the Iranians: lift sanctions on them, lift the sanctions on American oil. We have a surplus. We need to sell it. ``Use all we can and sell the rest.'' That is the motto. And that is just the way it is. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I believe we are lopsided on the time a little again, so I would like to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Could we ask what the time differential is, Mr. Chairman? The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 20\1/2\ minutes remaining. The gentleman from New Jersey has 14 minutes remaining. Mr. BARTON. At this time, Mr. Chairman, I am very honored to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton). Chairman Upton is the distinguished chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee from the great State of Michigan and my good friend. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I really thank Chairman Emeritus Barton for doing a really significant, good job on getting this bill bipartisan support and working so hard over the last 18 months or so, and both in the last Congress and this Congress, to get this bill ready for the floor today. Mr. Chairman, much has changed since the ban on crude oil was put in place in 1975. At that time, Congress and President Ford were responding to the Arab oil embargo crisis in an effort to protect this country from the unwanted impacts of the unstable global crude oil market. But we got good news today. Times have changed, and one of the biggest threats to the American energy boom today is not an international actor but, rather, our own ban on oil exports. Lifting the crude oil export ban is a win for our economy, yes, it is. Study after study has shown that lifting the ban would actually lower prices at the pump, create thousands of jobs, generate hundreds of millions of dollars in economic benefits, and strengthen our geopolitical influence across the globe. It will actually also reduce the deficit by more than $1 billion with additional oil royalties. These are real benefits that will be felt not only in southwest Michigan, my district, but across the country; yet, somehow, this administration does not support this thoughtful solution. Let's look at the benefits. According to the nonpartisan GAO, lifting the ban could lower prices by 1.5 to 13 cents a gallon, real savings that add up for every family's budget. Some estimates suggest that it could support the creation of an average of 394,000 jobs. Additionally, the bill before us would boost royalty payments, as I indicated, from Federal oil and gas leases. Collectively, all of these gains provide the making of a success story that would greatly benefit our economy at a time of great uncertainty. This administration often likes to say that they are for an all-of- the-above energy policy, but the rhetoric, indeed, falls well short of reality. It doesn't make much sense that the White House is gung ho to lift the export ban in Iran, but when it comes to this country, the answer is ``no.'' The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, this bipartisan bill would strengthen our hand in foreign diplomacy at a time when America has lost its standing on the global stage. By exporting our excess crude oil, we can help our allies seeking a safe and secure supply of energy. Instead of being beholden to OPEC and Russia for their energy needs, they can instead rely on their friends, the United States of America. Creating jobs, keeping energy affordable, boosting energy production, and improving our energy security--that is what this bill does. I would urge my colleagues to support the Barton bill in a vote later on this morning. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps). Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 702. Not only does this bill incentivize more oil development while ignoring its impact on our climate, it also essentially guarantees billions more in profits for oil companies while doing virtually nothing to help consumers. There are many more important issues that we should be spending our time on to actually help American families, like raising the minimum wage and making college more affordable, but instead we are passing a bill to help oil companies make more money. Additionally, section 3 of the bill prohibits any Federal official from taking any action that could potentially restrict the export of oil. This broad language could seriously undermine critical health and safety responsibilities of the Federal Government. For example, under current law, the Secretary of Transportation has the authority to shut down a crude oil pipeline if it poses a threat to life, property, or the environment. But what if an oil pipeline leading to an export terminal were in imminent danger of rupturing? Would the Secretary still have the authority to shut down that line, or would that action be considered a restriction on exporting crude oil under this bill? Mr. Chairman, these are not hypothetical questions. This authority was recently used in my district to shut down line 901 of the Plains All American Pipeline when it ruptured last May. Since line 901 is the only way for the nearby offshore oil platforms to transport their oil to refineries, these platforms have had to shut down production entirely. Nearly 5 months after the spill, line 901 remains shut down, and there is no indication that it will be restarted in the near future. It is not hard to imagine a similar event happening again, and the Secretary's authority to protect public health, property, and the environment during such an event must not be undermined. {time} 1045 Yet, if this bill were law, the Secretary's authority could be preempted entirely by section 3 of this bill. In other words, the bill could create a scenario in which the perceived right of oil companies to export their oil supersedes our very real responsibility to protect public health and safety. The American people deserve better. This is a fatally flawed bill and sets the wrong priorities. I urge its defeat. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), from District One of the great Pelican State, the distinguished Republican whip. Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my friend from Texas for yielding, but also for his leadership in bringing this bill to the floor and building a strong bipartisan coalition to finally lift the ban on oil exports. Mr. Chairman, this is a relic of the 1970s that doesn't fit with today's [[Page H6946]] world economy, but it also doesn't fit with the revolution that has happened in American energy because of American technology. We have an abundance of natural resources now and an abundance of oil. We literally could be the Saudi Arabia of energy. Yet, there is a law that is on the books that bans the ability of the United States to export its own oil. There is no other nation in the world that has that limitation on their ability to sell that natural resource. Mr. Chairman, at a time when the President is actually supporting this horrible deal with Iran that, among other things, allows Iran to export their oil to the world markets, the President at the same time is saying he opposes this bill that allows America to export its oil. What is at stake, Mr. Chairman? What is at stake under this bill, if this bill passes, is it will create over 800,000 American jobs, good American jobs, here at home. If this bill passes, Mr. Chairman, we can actually create over $800 million to reduce the deficit, deficit reduction, just by passing this bill. What is also at stake, Mr. Chairman, if we pass this bill? We can help our allies around the world who don't want to have to get their oil from countries like Russia, where Vladimir Putin is using energy as a weapon against our friends. They can now get that energy from us. Creating American jobs along the way, everything about this says yes. It is time to lift this relic of the 1970s. Let's finally allow American oil to be exported on world markets when we have such an abundance and we have the ability to create hundreds of thousands of new American jobs along the way. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor). Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I thank Ranking Member Pallone for yielding the time. I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 702. The bill is an irresponsible giveaway to Big Oil at the expense of America's national security, at the expense of American consumers, and our longstanding policy of working towards energy independence. Now, our current policy is not a ban. You can call it a ban, but it is not a ban. It allows and promotes oil exports to strategically important allies, to places in the national interest. It is a smart policy. But now Big Oil wants free rein to ship America's natural resources to countries not in our national interest. This bill will eviscerate our thoughtful policy. Despite assertions that the oil will go to allies in Europe and elsewhere, that is not supported by the facts. Who is most likely to benefit? Experts say China. The Energy Information Administration projects that China's oil consumption will double over the next 2 decades. China has been very aggressive all across the globe in exploiting and locking down natural resources. They have gone to Africa. They have gone to South America. While we have been fighting battles in Afghanistan, they have been locking down contracts for natural resources in Afghanistan. At the same time that America is dealing with Chinese cyber espionage and their geopolitical confrontations with our allies and the U.S., why would we help China gain a strategic foothold on America's natural resources? I would think that America's national security interests would compel you to defeat this bill. You should also vote this bill down and side with American consumers instead and American jobs. America is still heavily dependent on imports of crude oil. We still import 25 percent today. Any claims that sending American oil overseas would help consumers in America is entirely unsupported, no matter how many times they say it. Instead, what the studies show is that exporting American oil would feed the uncertainty of oil markets and likely increase costs to American consumers. Back home in Tampa right now you can go to the gas station and fill up your tank at about $1.99 per gallon. So it defies logic to say that changing this policy that is working for America right now would really lower the price. I don't think so. American jobs are also very likely to take a hit if this bill becomes law. Why? Because of the important jobs in the refining industry, the shipping industry. Those are American jobs. Side with the American jobs. This bill is very poor public policy. Exports will be determined only by Big Oil to serve the interests of Big Oil, ceding complete control of this strategic national asset. The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. PALLONE. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Just to close, Mr. Chairman, the cost to U.S. consumers, our policy of energy independence, our national security interests compel a ``no'' vote on this bill. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Cincinnati, the Buckeye State of Ohio (Mr. Chabot). Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I have the honor of leading the House Small Business Committee. A few months back we held a hearing on this very topic. We heard from small businesses about how this ban is holding them back. That is the untold story of this. This ban is hurting small businesses all across this country. America is now the largest producer of oil and gas in the world. Lifting this decades-old ban is an opportunity to jump-start the economy. It would help 1 million Americans find work. It would increase the GDP. It would narrow the trade deficit, attract new capital to the U.S., and stabilize the global energy supply. If America is going to lead the world in the 21st century, let's not keep one hand tied behind our back. Let's replace outdated energy policies with ones that are forward-thinking, ones that will create new jobs in a new American century. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. David Scott). Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentleman, this bill is about two things. It is about jobs and it is about national security. It will give us an opportunity to get Congress to join in with my good friend from North Dakota, Kevin Cramer, and Brad Ashford from Nebraska, because this is about jobs and nobody needs jobs more than African Americans. The hardest hit on unemployment is African American males. This allows us to be a part of being able to get language in that will help African American males get the kind of apprenticeship training with the Teamsters, with the AFL-CIO, with the operating engineers, all of those unions and contractors who are rebuilding this infrastructure for this oil. Now, on national security, make no mistake about it, ladies and gentlemen. What do you think Russia is doing over in the Middle East? They want dominance over energy in the world, and he who controls the energy in the world controls the world. That is why they want to prop up Syria, because that is the seaport to get it out of the Middle East. Stand up for jobs for the American people and protect the world from Russia. Vote to lift the ban on the oil exports. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I just want to say ``amen'' to what the gentleman from Georgia just said. Mr. Chairman, what time is remaining on each side? The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 15 minutes remaining. The gentleman from New Jersey has 7\1/2\ minutes remaining. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the entire delegation from the great State of North Dakota (Mr. Cramer), the original cosponsor of the bill. Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman. I have often said I don't know why it takes 36 Texans to do one person's job. I have to tell you, I was prepared to give a great speech and then I listened to my friend from Georgia and, quite honestly, I feel inadequate to the task. Because you stated it so eloquently and so beautifully, and I am committed to exactly what you talked about. So maybe what I will try to do instead in my remaining seconds is remind us of the context that it was 72 [[Page H6947]] years ago this week that the Yom Kippur War broke out that led to U.S. aid to Israel, which led to a 5 percent reduction out of OPEC of oil, which led to the very issue we are talking about today, that this historical context in a national security context is not irrelevant. Let's not, I would say, let history repeat itself, but let's use the peaceful tools of energy development while creating jobs in America replace the weapons of war in Europe and in the Middle East. Let's use our influence for good by selling this American-made product that is produced by American workers, and let's do it in a bipartisan fashion today. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan), on behalf of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar). Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman. I am normally on the opposite side of the gentleman on the congressional baseball team and normally with Congressman Doyle. So I hope we can win this one against Congressman Mike Doyle. So I thank the gentleman for the opportunity. Two or three points I would like to make, Mr. Chairman. One, in Ohio, lifting this ban means 16,000 jobs in Ohio, almost $3 billion in investment. Our friends, the operating engineers and the laborers who are going to do that work, are supportive of this bill. I know we have some issues with the refineries, and I think we need to continue to work on that and see if we can fix that issue. We have a number of studies that say the savings to the American consumer will be anywhere from 2 cents a gallon all the way up to 12 cents a gallon. Colombia University, Brookings, Aspen, Resources for the Future, all are saying this is going to reduce the cost of gas, which is a direct benefit for our consumers and our constituents who need it as we see this huge economic squeeze for the middle class. Lastly, I have been sitting on the Defense Appropriations Committee now for a number of years, and this issue here can directly benefit our ability to deal with what is happening in the Middle East. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BARTON. I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Ohio on the understanding that he will not play his best game against us next summer. Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I yield back. No. I am just kidding. I also would also like to say, sitting on the Defense Appropriations Committee, we sit in these classified briefings and we see what is happening with Russia, we see what Putin is doing, we see what is happening in the Middle East, the Ukraine. We need to export this oil. We need to export our natural gas. We need to have a bigger footprint in the world so that we can make sure that our allies have access to consistent energy flows coming here from the United States and creating jobs here in the United States. Michele Flournoy, CEO and Founder of the Center for New American Security, former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy under President Obama says: By lifting the ban on U.S. exports of crude oil, U.S. policymakers have an extraordinary opportunity to enhance not only our economic vitality, but also our national security. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Peterson). Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman. I support removing restrictions on the export of crude oil from the United States. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of H.R. 702. Current export laws are outdated, as we have heard. Since these laws were last visited nearly 40 years ago, U.S. oil production has increased significantly and the United States is now the largest producer of oil and gas. Studies have shown that lifting the current ban on crude oil exports would create jobs, many in the rural areas. We in our part of the world have seen the benefits that domestic drilling can provide by looking at our neighboring State of North Dakota. We need to do everything we can to support the use and production of domestic energy. H.R. 702 is an important part of that. Following this bill's approval, I hope all Members of Congress will continue to support an all-of-the-above domestic energy production strategy by considering the national security and the economic development benefits of not just oil production, but of biofuel production and related products. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support H.R. 702. {time} 1100 Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Sugar Land, Texas (Mr. Olson), a member of the committee and a sponsor of the bill. Mr. OLSON. Mr. Chair, this picture shows why we have to end this ban on crude exports. In October 1973, OPEC cut us off. We were getting 1.2 million barrels per day from OPEC, and that dropped down to a scant 19,000. Gas prices doubled. If you had to gas your lawn mower, you had to get in line behind cars. Because of American innovation, that world is gone. We are now awash in American crude oil. OPEC's days of dominance are over; but we can't deliver a knockout blow until we end the ban on American crude exports, which we will do in a few short minutes. When that happens, American families will have lower prices at the pump. Thug oil nations like Venezuela, Russia, and Iran will lose bite. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BARTON. I yield the gentleman from Texas an additional 15 seconds. Mr. OLSON. Mr. Chair, we will create thousands and thousands and thousands of good-paying American jobs. I ask my colleagues vote today to end the ban on crude oil exports. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the great Buckeye State of Ohio (Mr. Stivers), a member of the Armed Services Committee. Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his extraordinary work on this bill. This bill is important for our national security. It is important for jobs. We need to end the oil export ban so that we can export oil that has been generated as part of this energy revolution in this country that is going to be great for jobs and help our national security partners around the world. Let's make the world safer. Let's give America more jobs. Let's end the oil export ban. Please support this bill today. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer). Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, this is ill-advised legislation. My friends on the other side of the aisle claim 800,000 jobs, a million jobs. They don't have any real defined ability to provide such an estimate. Actually, this is a number that is made up because, as some of the speakers have acknowledged, there will be offsetting job losses as a result of what is going to happen, for example, in the refining industry or what is going to happen in terms of some of the transport. But that is beside the point. We actually have a policy that is working. There will come a time, perhaps, when it makes sense in a strategic matter to make an adjustment. Right now, the President has the latitude to be able to help some of our strategic partners. He has that flexibility. We are awash in oil in this country, and to expect that somehow exporting more of it is going to make a dramatic impact at the pump here is a pipe dream. It won't. It might make a modest impact. What we could do is provide a benefit to the large oil companies as part of a larger package that would help everybody. We have expiring tax provisions, for instance, dealing with the production tax credit, dealing with wind and solar that actually create far more jobs than will be found in the refining and in the oil production. And these are good, family-wage jobs all across the country Let's put together a package that speaks to alternative energy continuity, that speaks to conservation, that speaks to a long-term strategy that is a win-win. I am absolutely confident that Mr. Pallone and Mr. Barton could sit down and deal with a [[Page H6948]] package that would have far more benefit for America. If you are going to hand out another goodie to the oil companies, let's have a more comprehensive approach that meets our comprehensive energy needs. This bill doesn't do it. Mr. BARTON. May I ask how much time remains, Mr. Chair? The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 10\1/2\ minutes remaining, and the gentleman from New Jersey has 4\1/2\ minutes remaining. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Costa) on behalf of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar). Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chair, as some of my colleagues have mentioned, the ban on crude oil exports is an outdated policy. It was 1975 that it was enacted. A lot has changed since 1975. I believe this bipartisan, commonsense solution is needed to develop a comprehensive effort to deal with our energy policy in America that deals with both our short-term and our long-term needs. I think we have to use all the tools in our energy toolbox, and I think this is part of that effort. New technologies have provided the United States with an abundance of crude oil that is only continuing in nature, combined with our renewables and our other energy sources. We need to understand that this is about stimulating our economy and creating jobs, and it also has a very important geopolitical influence on bad actors, like Russia and Iran, who use energy as a political weapon. I understand there are concerns by my colleagues about eliminating this ban and the negative impacts it will have. I have some concerns with small and midsized domestic refineries, which I have represented. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the gentleman from California. Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chair, this is a work in progress. We obviously need to address a number of other issues with the Senate. I remind my colleagues, this is important. It is about jobs, the economy, and providing alternatives of energy to Russia and Iran, and that is why I support this legislation as we continue to work together in a bipartisan fashion. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from the Golden Gate State of California (Mr. Hunter), a distinguished subcommittee chairman of the Armed Services Committee. Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chair, I am voting for this bill overall. In California, we don't drill anymore, and we are cutting down on our refineries even, but this is important for the Nation. One big part of this bill is the Maritime Security Program. If you don't know it, over 90 percent of all the stuff that we transfer to Iraq, Afghanistan, anywhere where there are American troops--all of their gear, their tanks, their weapons, their ammo, everything, for the most part--is shipped on American-flag commercial vessels. Of the 50,000 cargo ships that travel the ocean every day, 79 of those are American-flag. That is it, 79 out of 50,000. Sixty of those are on call when America needs them to transfer our gear to our troops overseas. When I was a lieutenant in the Marine Corps, on my second tour in 2004, I drove down to the San Diego Port with my Marine battery, and we loaded up all the equipment that we would then fall in on in Iraq 2 months later. Without the Maritime Security Program plus-up that is in this bill, we would not be able to go fight wars. We would not be able to move our equipment. We would not be able to support our troops. This is a national security bill. It is not only national security because it is energy security, but it is national security because that is how we support our troops overseas is with the Maritime Security Program, which this bill pluses up. I just want to say thank you to the chairman and everybody who supports this. I would urge my colleagues to not just support energy security, but support national security. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson). Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I had planned to support this bill, as a matter of fact, as a cosponsor; but since I have been unable to remove myself from the cosponsorship, I wish to speak on the record regarding my opposition to this particular bill. While I believe that Congress should consider the potential for all energy sources to meet our Nation's current and future needs, I believe that this legislation lacks the proper safeguards and oversight for such a major change in our Nation's energy policy. The bill does not appropriately consider the implications of our national security, the economy, consumers, and, especially, the environment. Exporting crude oil does not increase demand for oil or definitively increase the number of U.S. jobs in the energy sector. On the contrary, many U.S. jobs that are downstream in the domestic refining process may be threatened. In addition, exporting oil to foreign countries for refining purposes would likely increase overall CO 2 emissions. The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chair, the bottom line is that we must consider many factors related to our energy portfolio before we lift any current restrictions. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 702. Since I am unable to remove myself as a cosponsor of the legislation, I would like to speak on the record regarding my opposition to this particular bill. While I believe that Congress should consider the potential for all energy sources to meet our nation's current and future needs, I believe that this legislation lacks the proper safeguards and oversight for such a major change in our nation's energy policy. The bill does not appropriately consider the implications for our national security, the economy, consumers, and especially the environment. Exporting crude oil does not increase demand for oil or definitively increase the number of U.S. jobs in the energy sector. On the contrary, many U.S. jobs that are downstream in the domestic refining process may be threatened. In addition, exporting oil to foreign countries for refining purposes will likely increase overall CO 2 emissions, thus amplifying the impacts of climate change. Facing the challenge of climate change requires us to be responsible and accountable for our own natural resources. This bill does not provide any recourse to mitigate or even examine these potential impacts, and thus ignores this responsibility entirely. It should be noted that the Obama Administration has made every effort to compromise by easing export restrictions where appropriate after careful review. The Commerce Department recently approved limited crude oil exchanges with Mexico. However, the President believes that unilaterally lifting the export ban is excessive, and I join him in his opposition. Lifting the crude oil ban for short-term gains with no accounting of the costs that will be incurred is ill-advised and short- sighted. The bottom line is that we must consider many factors related to our energy portfolio before we lift any current restrictions. Without serious deliberation and oversight of the potential environmental and economic impacts of such as significant shift in our national energy policy, I must urge my colleagues to vote no on this bill. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the Peach State of Georgia (Mr. Bishop) on behalf of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar). Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I come to the floor today to express my support of H.R. 702, much-needed legislation which will lift the arbitrary ban on the export of one of our country's most abundant natural resources: crude oil. The current ban on exports is a relic of a different time before we as a nation knew just how much crude oil we have stored in the earth across this country. We are entirely too dependent on foreign oil sources, particularly from countries who have no regard for the American economy. Today is different. In fact, from the period between 2000 and 2013, U.S. production of crude oil increased by nearly fourteenfold, from 250,000 barrels per day to 3.5 million. With this large amount of excess capacity, we can sell our oil to the global markets, which will bring U.S. crude prices in line with global prices, and global prices will go [[Page H6949]] down because of the increased supply. No less than 68 percent of consumers' cost of gasoline--and 57 percent for diesel fuel--come from the price of the source: crude oil. Numerous studies have shown that the increased global supply will lead to lower prices at the pump. Not only will consumers have more money to spend on school supplies, food, clothing, and other household staples, but the prices of these goods will go down because the cost to transport them from manufacturer to store will decrease. Possibly, more importantly, we have to consider the security implications of allowing the export of crude. We are in the position of showing the world that we can provide a stable source of energy to friendly countries around the globe. Our supplies will dilute the market share of unfriendly countries and weaken their grip on our democratic ally nations who have to depend on some of our unfriendly countries for their oil supplies. We can provide an alternative source to those who don't want to support our adversaries and their adversaries. So I thank my colleagues Mr. Cuellar and Mr. Barton for bringing forth this critically important legislation. I urge my colleagues in the House to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 702. Mr. PALLONE. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I only have two speakers, myself and Mr. Cuellar. I believe I have the right to close, so I would ask my friend from New Jersey how many speakers he still has. Mr. PALLONE. Just myself and Mr. Garamendi remain. Mr. BARTON. Well, at this time, I reserve the balance of my time. {time} 1115 Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time remains on my side? The CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey has 3\1/4\ minutes remaining. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi). Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, we have before us a very, very important issue. It is a national security issue. My good friend from San Diego spoke to one part of our Nation's security, and that is the ability of this Nation to move its interests around the world not just with airplanes, but with ships. Unfortunately, this is a very narrowly constructed piece of legislation that speaks to the interests of the petroleum industry and the many thousands of people who work there. We concede that. But this bill could also be a boon to another part of our Nation's security, and that is our maritime industry. Unfortunately, the bill does not do that. While it does deal with the Maritime Security Program--and that is good--it does not deal in full potential with what we can do, and that is to require that this strategic asset, oil, be shipped on American- built ships with American mariners. That is not in the bill. It should be. It could be. If it were, our shipyards and our mariners all around this Nation would have tens of thousands of jobs, and we would secure yet not only the interest of our petroleum industry but, also, the interest of our maritime industry as well as the shipyards upon which this Nation's national defense depends. Put it in the bill. Then let's see how many votes you can get. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar), my chief sponsor, the gentleman that represents south Texas and the Eagle Ford Shale. Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. Barton for the leadership he has provided on this bill. I rise in support of H.R. 702 that repeals the ban on crude oil. This ban reflects an America of yesterday. It is our job, as Members of Congress, that our laws reflect the America of tomorrow. If you look at why this is important, this ban hurts the economy and prevents the creation of jobs. This ban imposes an estimated $200 to $300 billion cost to the economy and discourages domestic, made-in- America crude oil production. By lifting the ban now, we will create 359,000 new jobs. How do I know? Because I represent the Eagle Ford and I have seen small-business people, men and women, that work very hard every single day to have this type of job. And I think we owe it to them and across the Nation. This ban also reduces the Federal direct spending by $1.4 billion, according to the CBO. So it also helps our deficit. This ban is something that we need to change, and we need to make sure that we lift this ban. What about gasoline prices? You heard Mr. Ryan. You heard other folks. According to the General Accounting Office, this will bring prices down from 1.5 cents to 13 cents. The CBO says the same thing: 5 cents to 10 cents. The administration's own agency, the Energy Information Administration, says it will bring it down one penny or remain. It doesn't go up. It goes down. This ban also doesn't allow us to use our powers in foreign policy. Why are we allowing Russia or Iran to dictate what happens in this world? This is why we need to make sure that we support the repealing of this ban. Now, who supports this? Mr. Barton, you know it is a bipartisan bill. Democrats and Republicans support this bill, but it is also supported by business, small-business owners, and by some of the labor organizations. We have talked to those labor organizations. Mr. Chairman, support H.R. 702, a bipartisan bill. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the remainder of my time. Mr. Chairman, let me point out that the administration, the President, has issued a SAP saying that he would veto this bill. This bill is going nowhere because of that veto and the potential for a veto. All this legislation does is to give a windfall of $30 billion in profits to the oil industry, no strings attached, no sacrifices required. The legislation is opposed by over 40 environmental groups: the United Steelworkers, the IBEW, the BlueGreen Alliance, and the Industrial Energy Consumers of America. Most importantly, Mr. Chairman, it is supported by the American public who, regardless of party, support investing in refineries at home rather than lifting crude export restrictions. In fact, around 70 percent of voters oppose allowing oil companies to export more U.S. oil. The Republican majority has spent the whole week doing little more than attacking women's health and assisting Big Oil for their big profits. It is time to come together in the name of energy and national security. In the name of common sense and economic good sense, I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have remaining? The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 3\3/4\ minutes remaining. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, we have had a very enlightening debate for the last hour. I would say 30 Members of Congress have stood up and spoken either in favor or opposition to the bill. I want it to be noted that a large number of my friends on the Democratic side have risen in support of the bill. I want to compliment Mr. Cuellar for his strong leadership in that area. This is a bipartisan bill. When we do our town hall meetings, Mr. Chairman, person after person stands up and says: Why can't you folks in Congress get along? Why don't you try to be positive? Why don't you try to do what is right for America? Why don't you work together on a bipartisan basis? Mr. Chairman, that is what this bill does. This is a bipartisan bill. We have a large number of Democratic cosponsors and a large number of Republicans. This bill will help all 50 States. As Mr. Bishop and Mr. Scott have stated on the Democratic side, it helps low income, it helps minorities, it helps women. It helps every sector of the economy, not just the oil industry, not just the roughnecks, not just the drillers. It helps truck drivers. It helps steelworkers. It helps refinery workers. It even helps computer programmers. You name it, it helps it. Some estimates are this bill, if enacted, would create as many as a million jobs. We know, for a fact, that the [[Page H6950]] collapse in oil prices in the last year and a half has cost the U.S. economy over 500,000 jobs, 750,000 jobs. Those are real people. That is not Big Oil, Mr. Chairman. That is people that get up every morning and kiss their wives, hop in their car, go to work and work hard 8, 10, 12 hours a day, get the bills at the end of the month and hope they have enough money to pay the bills. It is blue-collar America. It is not Big Oil. It is everybody in this country, Mr. Chairman. This bill is a market-based bill: willing buyer, willing seller. The U.S. has the largest oil reserves in the world. We have the capability to be number one in the world. Why on God's green Earth don't we use it? Why are we the only nation in the world that is restricted in one of the blessings that God has endowed our great Nation with? We could produce, if we wanted to, up to 20 million barrels a day. We are producing right now 9 million barrels a day. U.S. oil can go anywhere in the world if we allow it to. That is an economic asset. It is a military strategic asset. All we have to do is repeal an archaic law that was passed in 1975 when we couldn't export a barrel of oil if we wanted to. We were importing two-thirds of our oil. We have a bipartisan bill that helps everybody in America, that is in the economic interests of America, that is in the environmental interests of America, that is in the military strategic interests of America. Mr. Chairman, let's work together. Let's send this bill to the Senate with strong bipartisan support. God bless America. God bless this great country. Pass H.R. 702. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Washington, DC, October 5, 2015. Hon. Fred Upton, Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Upton: Thank you for consulting with the Foreign Affairs Committee on H.R. 702, a bill to adapt to changing crude oil market conditions, which was referred to us on February 4, 2015. I agreed that the Foreign Affairs Committee might be discharged from further action on this bill so that it could proceed expeditiously to the Floor, subject to the understanding that this waiver does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the future. I would request your support for the appointment of Foreign Affairs conferees during any House-Senate conference on this legislation. I respectfully ask that you place our letters on H.R. 702 into the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work with the Committee on Energy and Commerce as this measure moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, Edward R. Royce, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC, October 6, 2015. Hon. Edward R. Royce, Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Royce: Thank you for your assistance regarding H.R. 702, a bill to adapt to changing crude oil market conditions, which was referred to our respective committees on February 4, 2015. I appreciate your willingness to agree that the Foreign Affairs Committee might be discharged from further action on H.R. 702 so that it can proceed expeditiously to the floor, and I agree that this waiver does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition, I would support your request for the appointment of Foreign Affairs conferees during any House-Senate conference on this legislation. I will place our letters on H.R. 702 into the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill. Sincerely, Fred Upton, Chairman. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this legislation. Increased U.S. energy exports benefit our national security and foreign policy. The Administration has created an absurd situation. While they are lifting sanctions on Iranian crude oil, they are fighting to keep sanctions on American crude oil. It makes no sense. I am, however, concerned by language that would increase subsidy payments to U.S. shipping companies participating in the ``Maritime Security Program.'' By increasing our oil exports, as this legislation does, that's already a boon to U.S. shipping. So why the government subsidy? So I will support an amendment that is to be offered to strike this provision of the bill. But Mr. Chair, if this maritime subsidy is ultimately part of this legislation, the door is then open to offset it by eliminating yet another damaging subsidy: U.S. cargo preference for international food aid. Over the past three years, the Foreign Affairs Committee has led efforts to reform U.S. international food aid programs so we could reach more starving people in less time, and for less money. A stumbling block to this effort has been a requirement in U.S. law that U.S. food aid be shipped on U.S. vessels--even though many of them are foreign-owned. This requirement remains year-after-year despite the fact that the Defense Department has concluded that relieving a portion of our food aid budget from U.S. purchase and shipping requirements would have no effect on U.S. maritime security. If maintained in this bill, the proposed increase for ``Maritime Security Program'' payments literally ``sinks'' the arguments against food aid reform. One wasteful corporate subsidy is bad enough; a second that kills our ability to reform food aid and save lives would be beyond conscience, and something I am confident this body would wisely reject. Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 702, a bipartisan bill to lift the 40-year old, self-imposed, crude oil export ban. The United States is now among the top oil producing nations in the world. Lifting this export ban will bring us roaring back into the global oil markets at a time when market conditions are particularly competitive. Contrary to what some of my friends across the aisle may say, this bill would actually lower gas prices here at home. We live in a global economy, and participation in a global market leads to competitive pricing. The non-partisan Government Accountability Office--in addition to the world-renowned analytics firm, HIS--have both determined that enacting this bill will lower gas prices, create hundreds of thousands of jobs, and provide a much-needed boost our economy. With all these benefits, why would we continue to hold onto this export ban? The only reason it was imposed in the first place was in response to the Arab oil embargo. That was over 40 years ago. It is prudent to move past these decades-old issues, and instead focus on the issues we face today. Today, we are facing a dangerous nuclear deal with Iran--a deal of President Obama's making. And one component of this terrible deal is that sanctions will be lifted on Iran so that they will be able to access a much larger portion of the world oil market, yielding billions of dollars to their coffers. Why would we make a deal with Iran--a deal that allows them to export their oil so they can fund terrorism around the world--but still hold onto this self-imposed ban? Without this bill, the U.S. would be missing out on billions in direct revenue to the Treasury, not to mention the secondary revenue streams from improved economic conditions. Let's pass this bill to unleash economic growth. Let's pass this bill to create hundreds of thousands of much-needed jobs. Let's pass this bill to counterbalance the exports of Iran, Russia, and the OPEC nations. I urge my colleagues to pass this bipartisan bill. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss H.R. 702, a bill to ``Adapt to Changing Crude Oil Market Conditions.'' H.R. 702 repeals the law prohibiting the exports of crude oil that has been on the books for more than 40 years, a response to the Arab Oil Embargo led by OPEC in 1973 that sent oil prices soaring and inflicted substantial damage on the American economy. Let me express my appreciation to Chairman Emeritus Barton and Ranking Member Pallone for their leadership and commitment to American energy independence, economic growth, national security, and expanding opportunities and diversifying the energy sector workforce. I support H.R. 702 because it holds the promise of moving our country towards energy independence, create good-paying jobs, lowering gasoline prices, promoting our geopolitical interests, and strengthening our defense capabilities. But I strongly am ``pro-jobs,'' ``pro-growing economy,'' ``pro- sustainable environment and development,'' and for homeland and national security. That is why I carefully consider each energy legislative proposal brought to the floor on its individual merits and support them when they are sound, balanced, fair, and promote the national interest. As the Member of Congress from Houston, the energy capital of the nation, I have always been mindful of the importance and have strongly advocated for national energy policies [[Page H6951]] that will make our nation more energy independent, preserve and create jobs, and keep our nation's economy strong. The Eighteenth Congressional District, which I represent and is home to Shell Oil, ConocoPhillips, Chevron Phillips, BP Corporation of North America, Marathon Oil, Enterprise Products Partners (Oil and Gas Pipelines), and Halliburton (Oilfield Services), and many others. My constituents have a strong interest in policies that maintain or enhance the competitiveness of American petroleum energy business in the world oil markets. Mr. Chair, the world is very different than it was in 1973 when the ban on crude oil exports was adopted. And much of the change we see today is attributable to America's unconventional oil boom. U.S. crude production is now more than 11 million barrels per day according to the U.S. DOE's Energy Information Administration, up from 7 million barrel per day in 2008. And it is estimated that U.S. output will exceed 18 million barrels a day by 2040. Crude inventories are at an 80-year high, and imports have declined nearly 30 percent between 2005 and 2013. Mr. Chair, paradoxically, continuation of the crude oil export ban may pose one of the biggest threats to this U.S. production boom and to the economy. This is because increased production has led to a substantial decline in oil prices over the past year and the resulting decrease in revenues has forced U.S. producers in my district and elsewhere to slash investment and cancel projects. Since last autumn the industry has cut more than 125,000 jobs, including many in my district. I have met and know many of the employers and workers affected by industry job reductions. Lifting the crude oil export ban would offer American crude oil producers new markets for their product and would mean fewer layoffs. Studies by the highly respected Brookings Institution and other organizations suggest that the economic benefits to the nation of repealing the ban on crude oil exports would be substantial. Specifically, it is predicted that repeal of the crude oil export ban will: 1. generate over $1.4 billion in revenue to the federal treasury over the next 10 years from oil and gas leases, according to the Congressional Budget Office; 2. lower gasoline prices by 13 cents per gallon according to the Government Accountability Office; 3. support up to 964,000 additional American jobs; 4. allow the United States to help its allies, enhance its energy security, and weaken the influence and market power of OPEC and Russia; and 5. strengthen the 60-ship Maritime Security Fleet, assuring that United States flag ships and crews will be available to provide support to the military in defense of our national interests and our allies. The economic benefits projected to be derived from a repeal of the crude oil export ban are stunning in their magnitude: 1. 300,000 additional jobs by 2020; 2. $5.8 billion savings in fuel costs each year between 2015 and 2035; 3. $70 billion in additional investment in U.S. exploration, development, and production of crude oil between 2015 and 2020; 4. 500,000 barrels per day increase in domestic crude oil production in 2020; 5. $38 billion in additional economic activity in 2020; 6. $13.5 billion in additional federal, state, and local revenue in 2020; and a 7. $22 billion reduction in the U.S. trade deficit in 2020. It is estimated that in my own congressional district, lifting the ban would generate an additional 500 jobs and inject an additional $275 million into the local economy, resulting in an increase in government revenues in the amount of $227.7 million. Another positive impact of repealing the crude oil export ban is that the U.S. crude oil production would increase 1.2 million barrels per day average between 2016 and 2030. Additionally, manufacturing jobs are expected to increase by an average of 37,000 per year through 2025 and analysts predict that construction jobs will increase 217,000 in the peak year 2017, while related professional services jobs would grow by an average of 148,000 per year. Repeal of the crude oil export ban is expected to spur capital investment in machinery, exploration, and development by $7 billion in 2020. The gross domestic product would increase by nearly $73 billion in 2016 and by at least $134 billion in 2018. Total government revenues would increase by a combined $1.3 trillion between 2016 and 2030. The revenue generated translates to an expected average annual increase of $2,500 in disposable income per household, additional jobs for American workers, and lower gasoline prices for American consumers. As it relates to our geopolitical stance, Mr. Chair, lifting the crude export ban will enhance our national influence in international affairs because we will be stronger economically and more energy independent. This will enhance our ability to achieve our geopolitical objectives of maintaining peace and security across the globe which in turn furthers our national security interests. For all of these reasons, I support H.R. 702 and urge my colleagues to join me and also support Jackson Lee Amendments 9 and 10. The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5-minute rule. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Energy and Commerce, printed in the bill, it shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 114-29. That amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. The text of the amendment in the nature of the substitute is as follows: H.R. 702 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) The United States has enjoyed a renaissance in energy production, establishing the United States as the world's leading oil producer. (2) By authorizing crude oil exports, the Congress can spur domestic energy production, create and preserve jobs, help maintain and strengthen our independent shipping fleet that is essential to national defense, and generate State and Federal revenues. (3) An energy-secure United States that is a net exporter of energy has the potential to transform the security environment around the world, notably in Europe and the Middle East. (4) For our European allies and Israel, the presence of more United States oil in the market will offer more secure supply options, which will strengthen United States strategic alliances and help curtail the use of energy as a political weapon. (5) The 60-ship Maritime Security Fleet is a vital element of our military's strategic sealift and global response capability. It assures United States-flag ships and United States crews will be available to support the United States military when it needs to mobilize to protect our allies, and is the most prudent and economical solution to meet current and projected sealift requirements for the United States. (6) The Maritime Security Fleet program provides a labor base of skilled American mariners who are available to crew the United States Government-owned strategic sealift fleet, as well as the United States commercial fleet, in both peace and war. SEC. 2. REPEAL. Section 103 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6212) and the item relating thereto in the table of contents of that Act are repealed. SEC. 3. NATIONAL POLICY ON OIL EXPORT RESTRICTION. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, to promote the efficient exploration, production, storage, supply, marketing, pricing, and regulation of energy resources, including fossil fuels, no official of the Federal Government shall impose or enforce any restriction on the export of crude oil. SEC. 4. STUDY AND RECOMMENDATIONS. Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy shall conduct a study and transmit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate recommendations on the appropriate size, composition, and purpose of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. SEC. 5. SAVINGS CLAUSE. Nothing in this Act limits the authority of the President under the Constitution, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), or part B of title II of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6271 et seq.) to prohibit exports. SEC. 6. NATIONAL DEFENSE SEALIFT ENHANCEMENT. (a) Payments.--Section 53106(a)(1) of title 46, United States Code, is amended-- (1) in subparagraph (B), by striking the comma before ``for each''; (2) in subparagraph (C), by striking ``2016, 2017, and 2018;'' and inserting ``and 2016''; (3) by redesignating subparagraph (E) as subparagraph (G); and (4) by striking subparagraph (D) and inserting the following: ``(D) $4,999,950 for fiscal year 2017; ``(E) $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020; ``(F) $5,233,463 for fiscal year 2021; and''. (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--Section 53111 of title 46, United States Code, is amended-- (1) in paragraph (3), by striking ``2016, 2017, and 2018;'' and inserting ``and 2016''; (2) by redesignating paragraph (5) as paragraph (7); and (3) by striking paragraph (4) and inserting the following: [[Page H6952]] ``(4) $299,997,000 for fiscal year 2017; ``(5) $300,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020; ``(6) $314,007,780 for fiscal year 2021; and''. The CHAIR. No amendment to the amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be in order except those printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Each such amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the report, by a Member designated in the report, shall be considered read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question. Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Amash The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 2, lines 3 through 15, strike paragraphs (5) and (6). Page 3, line 18, through page 4, line 21, strike section 6. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Amash) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Chairman, my amendment removes a new section of the bill added by the Committee on Rules that increases funding for the Maritime Security Program by $500 million. My amendment does not eliminate the program. It simply keeps it at its current authorization level. Just last week the House passed the conference report for the National Defense Authorization Act. This defense policy bill, negotiated at length between House and Senate conferees, increases the annual subsidy for Maritime Security Program participants from $3.1 million per vessel to $3.5 million per vessel, a 12.9 percent increase. The provision, added quietly by the Committee on Rules, circumvents regular order and increases funding even more. As amended, H.R. 702 boosts per-vessel payments to $5 million per year, increasing the subsidy by a whopping 42 percent. The proper place for a discussion on funding for the Maritime Security Program is in a defense bill like the NDAA, not as part of a bill that lifts a ban on crude oil exports. This spending increase is all the more reckless, given our more than $18 trillion national debt. According to the Congressional Budget Office, lifting the export ban will increase receipts from Federal oil and gas leases by $1.4 billion over the next 10 years. We should use those receipts to reduce the deficit. Mr. Chairman, there are two ways we should amend bills. The first way is to go through the normal committee process, by introducing amendments during a markup. Members have the opportunity to debate and vote on amendments in the committee of jurisdiction. We should respect the work committees do by not altering the bills they report before we even consider the legislation on the House floor. The second way is to offer an amendment when the bill comes up for debate on the House floor. This gives all Representatives the opportunity to participate in the debate and represent their constituents by voting on the measure. Unfortunately, the Committee on Rules changed this bill behind closed doors late last week. The Maritime Security Program is a defense-related program that has nothing to do with oil exports or energy production. This provision has no place in H.R. 702, and its eleventh-hour addition by the Committee on Rules is the latest example of our broken legislative process. Mr. Chairman, we must protect this institution and the legislative process. Adding an unrelated provision to this bill behind closed doors is no way to legislate. I urge all Members to vote ``yes'' on my amendment to remove this unrelated $500 million spending increase so we can consider H.R. 702 as reported by the Committee on Energy and Commerce. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I seek time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Dold). The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/4\ minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Forbes). Mr. FORBES. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support H.R. 702 but, more importantly, to oppose this amendment. First of all, I would tell the gentleman, this amendment was considered and this provision was considered in the NDAA, and we actually did mark it up. The second thing is this is vital to the national security of this country to maintain the private sector sealift capacity. Our top military commanders have called MSP a vital element of our military strategic sealift and global response capability, and it is worth noting that 90 percent of all U.S. military cargo moved from Iraq and Afghanistan has been by American-flagged, American-crewed commercial vessels enrolled in the MSP program. {time} 1130 If we were to adopt this amendment, it would basically cost us $13 billion to re-create this. The U.S. Transportation Command has estimated it would cost $52 billion. In other words, Mr. Chairman, it would take us between 42 years and 168 years to recoup our costs. Let's defeat this amendment and protect the Maritime Security Program. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is about process. I recognize the concerns of my colleague. This should be handled in the NDAA or in a defense bill. I urge all Members to support my amendment eliminating this $500 million increase in spending and reject the Rules Committee's eleventh- hour revision that has nothing to do with crude oil exports. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chairman, I join my friend, Mr. Forbes, in opposition to this amendment. This amendment would harm America's national security. Under the program that it seeks to eliminate, the Pentagon reserves capacity on roughly 60 U.S.-flagged commercial ships to ensure the supply and transport of American troops. It is a program that supports our private sector as well, requiring the Defense Department to contract private commercial ships rather than building their own. So there was not redundancy, but complementary ability. It is a program that enhances America's national security by ensuring that our military can depend on U.S.-flagged and crewed vessels instead of foreign ones. It is a program that supports important domestic maritime jobs. In my view, we ought to reject this amendment. This legislation is, obviously, controversial. I hope this amendment is not controversial and that it receives overwhelming bipartisan opposition. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green). Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I represent the Port of Houston, and maritime transportation is vital to our success. Last year, the United States imported $2.4 trillion and exported $1.6 trillion in cargo and goods. Much of that cargo came to the United States on foreign-built ships, under foreign flags, and without U.S. citizens on board. Our maritime industry has been the bedrock of our economy since our founding. More cargo moves through our waterways than any other mode of transportation. We need to protect our domestic maritime industry, and that includes men and women that work on these ships. I have worked with the maritime unions, including the Seafarers and the Marine Engineers, since my first days in Congress. I want to thank my colleagues for supporting our U.S.-flagged maritime unions. I oppose this amendment because I support any effort to keep these folks working. I would like to take a minute and acknowledge a recent incident in the Atlantic Ocean. The disappearance of the El Faro resulted in the loss of life. I [[Page H6953]] want to extend my prayers to the families. Working on these ships is tough and can be hazardous, as we learned last week. It is my hope that we can defeat this amendment and ensure our economic viability and national security by putting U.S. crews and U.S. flags on more ships. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter). Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, to the gentleman from Michigan's point, this is the process. I chair the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee. I am also the vice chairman of the Seapower Subcommittee in the Armed Services Committee. Mr. Forbes is the chairman of the subcommittee that handles this stuff. This went through the process. This is the process. This is how it is supposed to work. There are only--I will say again--79 U.S.-flagged commercial vessels on the ocean today. That is 79 out of about 50,000; 60 of those are used in times of war. It would cost us billions of dollars to create a fleet that sits there mothballing until we go to war and then we get to use it. This is how the system works. This is the process, and this is how we keep national security strong. Republicans and Democrats realize this is the process. It is the right way to do it, and it shores up the Maritime Security Program for a decade. That is 10 years that we don't have to worry about this, and it is paid for. The gentleman from Michigan would have a point if this were not paid for. It is totally paid for. This is the right vehicle for it, and I would urge all my colleagues to vote against the gentleman's amendment and support maritime security and national security. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to Amash amendment that would undermine our domestic maritime industry and its workers. The Pacific Northwest has a proud maritime tradition that supports quality jobs and keeps our economy moving. The Maritime Security Program ensures that we have the ships and mariners to support our local, regional, and national economy--to keep folks employed and get goods to market. Having worked in economic development for a decade I believe the MSP is the kind of program we ought to back, not completely scrap. Let's not turn our back on the hard-working men and women that are out on the sea. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Amash). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan will be postponed. Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Delaney The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Mr. DELANEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 2, after line 15, insert the following: (7) The United States has reduced its oil consumption over the past decade, and increasing investment in clean energy technology and energy efficiency will lower energy prices, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and increase national security. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Delaney) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland. Mr. DELANEY. Mr. Chairman, recent data suggests that climate change is accelerating. As a result, the destabilizing effect it has on our environment is worsening. To my mind, this is a clear threat to American prosperity and global stability. Mr. Chairman, consider the fact that the Governor of the Bank of England in a speech recently said that he is very concerned that unless we respond to climate change, there will be a dramatic reduction in value of carbon assets, which will cause a financial crisis. As a country with the largest financial markets in the world, we should be concerned about that. Mr. Chairman, consider the fact that Citigroup recently put out a research report that said unless we deal with climate change, the effect on global GDP will be $44 trillion to the negative by 2050. That is twice the size of the U.S. economy. Mr. Chairman, consider the fact that the U.N. has estimated that unless we deal with climate change, 150 million people will be forced to be relocated by 2050; 20 million, alone, in Bangladesh. Put that in the context of the fact that in Syria we are seeing the effects of 7 million people being forced to be relocated. Again, Mr. Chairman, this is a clear threat to American prosperity, and the bad news is that our environment is worse. The good news is the technology is better for dealing with this problem. Consider the fact that, as we have doubled the installed base of solar energy in this country, we have reduced the cost of energy by 23 percent. It has happened over the last several cycles of doubling solar, and people expect it to continue. This is occurring because of good old-fashioned American innovation. And while I believe there should be policy prescriptions from the government that effectively cost and price carbon, at a minimum, Mr. Chairman, we should agree that by investing in clean energy technology, we will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we will lower energy costs for the American public, and we will increase national security. That is what the amendment that I have here today is designed to do. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment, but only in order to control the time. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. BARTON. Chairman Upton and I are prepared to accept the gentleman's amendment, but we do have some Republican speakers who would like to speak in favor of it. I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo). Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. First, Mr. Chairman, let me offer my support for the underlying bill, H.R. 702. Over the August district work period, I had the opportunity to visit an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico and see firsthand the safety regulations and enhancements that have been put in place by the industry in recent years. Two of the primary topics of discussion during our visit were safety and the environment. I was glad to learn the industry has put a lot of contingencies in place to make sure we can continue drilling for oil in a manner that is safe and responsible. I have joined my colleagues Mr. Delaney and Mr. Gibson in offering this simple amendment that would recognize our country is making progress in becoming more energy efficient; and that is better for the economy and the environment. It is also very important to note the other forms of energy that are benefiting our country's economy and its national security. Wind, solar, natural gas, and nuclear energy are all contributing greatly to our energy independence, and this amendment before us today acknowledges that we should continue to promote an all-of-the-above energy strategy for this 21st century. Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of this amendment. Mr. DELANEY. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the great city of Kinderhook, New York (Mr. Gibson). Mr. GIBSON. I thank the chairman for yielding and for his leadership. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. I am honored to be working with my colleagues John Delaney and Carlos Curbelo to offer this bipartisan amendment. This amendment adds another strategic dimension to this bill: support for [[Page H6954]] clean energy and energy efficiencies. On our way to energy independence, it is critical that we support research and development for clean energy technologies. In New York, we are doing a lot of this work supporting important programs like the SunShot program, with the ambitious goal of driving down the total cost of photovoltaics to 9 cents per kilowatt hour, which would allow it to compete with any other energy source and democratize energy, transforming the way we produce, convey, and consume energy. With improved technologies, we will also see more proliferation of wind power, hydroelectric power, and biomass energy complementing all other traditional energy sources, including crude oil, adding up to a stronger America. Mr. Chairman, this is a country that can do hard things. We have proven that time and again. With the proper focus and investment, we will dominate the clean energy world market. And when we do, we will drive down energy costs; we will grow our economy, strengthen our national security, and conserve our environment. I urge support of this amendment. Let's take a robust and holistic approach to energy independence. Mr. DELANEY. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleague and my friend from Texas for accepting this amendment. I want to thank my colleague from New York and my colleague from Florida for their support of their amendment and their insight into this issue. Again, I urge all my colleagues to support the amendment. It is very simple. It simply says that investing in basic research and investing in American innovation will, in fact, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which it has been proven to do; will, in fact, lower energy costs, which it has been proven to do; and will, in fact, increase national security in this great country. So, again, I want to I thank my colleagues for their support. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I accept the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Delaney). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Huffman The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 3, line 4, insert ``(a) Strategic Petroleum Reserve'' before ``Not later than''. Page 3, after line 10, insert the following: (b) Greenhouse Gas Emissions.--Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy shall conduct, and transmit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate the results of, a study on the net greenhouse gas emissions that will result from the repeal of the crude oil export ban under section 2. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer my amendment to H.R. 702. This is the only amendment that the majority would allow in order to help us understand the impacts of lifting the crude oil export ban on greenhouse gas emissions. Before the Rules Committee, Ranking Member Pallone and I offered two other amendments that would have more proactively studied the increase in greenhouse gas emissions caused by this bill. Instead, the majority only allowed this amendment, which requires that the Department of Energy do a report on the increasing greenhouse gas emissions caused by the lifting of the crude oil export ban, but still allows the ban to be lifted. {time} 1145 This is what the legislative process has come to, unfortunately, in this Chamber. Instead of analyzing full impacts before voting, the majority has adopted a ``pollute first, ask questions later'' approach. Repeal the restrictions on fossil fuel extraction and production, and then we will figure out the environmental impact later. Now, lifting this 40-year-old ban on exports could increase oil production by as much as 500,000 barrels a day. That is a significant increase that risks expanding production into sensitive areas off our coasts and our public lands. According to the Center for American Progress, this surge in production would result in an additional 515 million metric tons of carbon pollution each year. That is the equivalent of an additional 108 million passenger cars on the road or 135 coal-fired power plants put online. That is what this bill could do. That is why over 40 environmental groups are opposing it. Now, my Republican colleagues might dispute this study. It is the Center for American Progress. And so, when we hear studies from any group that is not funded by the fossil fuel industry, we typically hear them accused of being biased, left-leaning sources, and certainly they are welcome to make that argument. But doesn't that support the need for an established, nonpartisan source of assessments on the impacts to our environment for bills that this Congress considers? That is why today, Mr. Chairman, I am also introducing the Carbon Pollution Transparency Act of 2015. This is a bill that would require the CBO to estimate and report on the projected carbon footprint of each bill Congress considers. That way, we know before we vote how a bill would impact our climate and our environment. Members of Congress already rely on the fiscal impact estimates produced by the nonpartisan CBO to help us make good decisions, make up our minds. But we need to also take into account the environmental consequences of our votes. The American public has the right to know whether their Representatives in Washington are voting to help harm the environment, to worsen climate change, or whatever the impact may be. That is why my bill ensures that we have a fair judge, the CBO, for each bill that we consider on its environmental impact. But today we at least have an opportunity to require such a study as part of H.R. 702. It is not enough, but it is a step forward to fully understand the impacts of lifting the crude oil export ban and, potentially, the harm that would result to our environment. So I urge a ``yes'' vote on my amendment and a ``no'' vote on the underlying legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in mild opposition, and I may change my mind, depending on what the gentleman says. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BARTON. I want to make a deal with the gentleman. We want to be open and transparent. We are the open, transparent Congress. We will accept your amendment if you voice vote it and at least consider voting for the bill. But if you are going to rollcall vote it and vote against the bill, then I will oppose it, and we will defeat you on the rollcall vote. So I am going to make you a deal. I am not saying you have to vote for the bill. I am just saying I want you to think nice thoughts about the bill and consider voting for the bill, and then we will accept it on a voice vote, but we don't want any rollcall votes. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is advised to direct his remarks to the Chair. Mr. BARTON. Well, I hope the Chair was listening. I yield to my friend from California, if I have time to yield, to see what his thoughts are. Mr. HUFFMAN. Through the Chair, I would say to my friend, I appreciate the offer, but I don't think there could be anything more transparent than going on record and voting on these. Mr. BARTON. So the gentleman is going to ask for a rollcall vote? Mr. HUFFMAN. I am going to ask for a rollcall vote. Mr. BARTON. Then, Mr. Chairman, I oppose the gentleman's amendment and ask every Member to vote against the amendment. Mr. Chairman, we are not violently opposed to this. It is a study. I am confident that this bill will on a net basis [[Page H6955]] reduce greenhouse gases because the oil that would must probably be exported is produced under the strictest environmental regulations in the world. It also happens to be the easiest oil to refine because it is light sweet, which means it doesn't have a high sulfur content. When you run it through the cracking process, because it is lighter, it tends to separate into the various refined products more easily. So the gentleman's amendment is benign in nature in the sense that, if we were to conduct the study, I think the results from the study would be positive. Mr. HUFFMAN. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. BARTON. I will be happy yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. HUFFMAN. To my esteemed colleague and coach of the baseball team, in the spirit of thinking good thoughts, if you will think good thoughts about considering the impacts to our environment and our climate, I will accept your previous offer to voice vote this amendment, and maybe all of this great good thought stuff will get us home faster. Mr. BARTON. Reclaiming my time, I commend the gentleman for his thoughtful understanding from Mr. Pallone. And, with that, we accept the gentleman's amendment. I'm going to ask everybody to vote for it on a voice vote. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mrs. Lawrence The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 3, line 4, insert ``(a) Strategic Petroleum Reserve Study.--'' before ``Not later than''. Page 3, after line 10, insert the following: (b) Crude Oil Export Study.-- (1) In general.--The Department of Commerce, in consultation with the Department of Energy, and other departments as appropriate, shall conduct a study of the State and national implications of lifting the crude oil export ban with respect to consumers and the economy.

(3) Report to congress.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Bureau of Industry and Security shall submit to Congress a report containing the results of the study conducted under paragraph (1). The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Michigan. Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that would direct the Department of Commerce, in consultation with the Department of Energy and other departments, as needed, to conduct a study. This study would measure the impact of exporting millions of barrels of domestically produced crude oil on Americans and our economy. Let's be clear. Lifting the crude oil export ban benefits very few. Let's also be clear about who does not benefit: American consumers and the American economy. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle will make the case for lifting the ban on crude oil exports. They will cite reports by the U.S. Department of Energy, the Congressional Budget Office, the Government Accountability Office, and various other organizations to support their claims. Some of the benefits they will list include claims of an increase in crude oil production, additional investment in crude oil production, and an increase in employment along the energy supply chain. But there is a problem with these claims, that the U.S. crude oil is already at peak production. According to a report by the EIA, production reached 9.7 million barrels 1 day in April of 2015, the highest levels since 1971. In 2015, production is expected to average 9.2 million barrels a day. We still import 7 million barrels of oil a day. Let's find a way to keep domestically produced crude oil within our borders, which benefits our consumers and the economy in the U.S. For example, the domestic gas prices are at record low levels due to the surplus of crude oil. According to the U.S. Federal Highway Administration, Americans drove nearly 2 trillion miles during the first 7 months of 2015, contributing to the high gas consumption and setting a record level. Lifting the ban now on U.S. crude oil benefits will undoubtedly raise prices. For consumers, these increases will result in higher gas prices at the pump and higher heating costs for families in the winter. As all of you know, the manufacturing industry is the backbone of Michigan's economy. While the U.S. manufacturing industry has struggled in the past, it has been one of the bright spots in our economy since the recession and remains a vital part of America's economy, as well as our Nation's economy. Since 2010, over 700,000 manufacturing jobs that were lost during the recession have been recovered. One major reason for this resurgence of the manufacturing sector is low energy prices. Up to one-third of all energy used in the United States goes into the manufacturing sector. Rushing to lift the ban on crude oil now would only hurt the manufacturing industry and dent its growth. Let us find a way to keep domestically produced crude oil within our own boundaries and allow the consumers and the economy to reap the benefits of lower energy prices. Let us put together a comprehensive study of the impact of lifting the U.S. crude oil export ban on the consumers and our economy first, before we rush to export millions of barrels of domestically produced crude oil. For the benefit of all Americans, for the benefit of our economy, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in mild opposition, but I could become a supporter of the amendment under certain conditions. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, if the gentlewoman from Michigan is willing to accept the same deal that the gentleman from California just accepted, we will accept the amendment. We will vote for it on a voice vote, and we will move on down the road to catch my plane at 1:40 from Reagan National Airport. Does the gentlewoman agree to voice vote it? Mrs. LAWRENCE. To the Chair, considering all that is happening here, I really need good thoughts, and I want to be part of the process of expanding good thoughts in Congress. So I will accept, sir. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in enthusiastic support of the gentlewoman's amendment and ask that it be voted for on a voice vote. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Messer The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 3, line 15, strike ``or''. Page 3, line 17, after ``(42 U.S.C. 6271 et seq.)'' insert the following: ``, the Trading With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App. 1 et seq.), or any other provision of law that imposes sanctions on a foreign person or foreign government (including any provision of law that prohibits or restricts United States persons from engaging in a transaction with a sanctioned person or government), including a foreign government that is designated as a state sponsor of terrorism,''. [[Page H6956]] The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana. Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chair, I want to thank my colleague and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton) for his leadership on this important bill, and I am hoping today to join the voice vote kumbaya, if possible. H.R. 702 is a commonsense legislation that repeals the outdated ban on crude oil exports. This ban was originally implemented when America was going through an energy crisis. I was very young then, but certainly remember the gas lines in the early 1970s. The truth is things are different today. America is one of the largest oil exporters, thanks to a boom in production all across our country. Gas prices are at historic lows, and refineries are near capacity. Yet, our laws do not reflect this new reality. Producers are still held captive to the domestic marketplace. It is long past time to modernize. This bill will pave the way for a new age of energy innovation in America. It will support and create thousands of U.S. jobs, good-paying jobs, and encourage the investment of millions of dollars into our economy. America now has opportunities that would have seemed unimaginable even a generation ago, potentially even a few years ago. We could now become a net exporter of energy. Think about that. And when we do, it will jump-start our economy, create thousands of good- paying jobs, and improve our national security and economic security as well. Now, Mr. Chair, I am offering a bipartisan amendment today that clarifies language in the bill to avoid creating any unintended consequences regarding terrorist enemies of our country. I want to thank my colleague from California (Mr. Lowenthal) for cosponsoring this amendment and Chairman Royce for working with us in crafting the amendment as well. While we should all want to see crude oil exports expanded, we do not want this bill to inadvertently help our enemies. My amendment very simply clarifies the bill's language to allow the administration to retain its ability to prohibit the export of crude oil to state sponsors of terrorism. I believe this amendment is consistent with the underlying goals of the bill. I encourage my colleagues to support its adoption. {time} 1200 Mr. BARTON. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. MESSER. I yield to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. BARTON. Chairman Upton and I strongly support the gentleman from Indiana's amendment. We commend him for offering it. We think it adds to the bill. Mr. MESSER. I thank the gentleman from Texas. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in mild opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. PALLONE. I support the amendment but would note that the best way to prevent our Nation's oil resources from falling into the hands of bad actors is to maintain the reasonable, time-tested controls on exports that are currently in place. If you are concerned about our oil falling into the wrong hands, then you should vote ``no'' on final passage of H.R. 702. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's comments. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana will be postponed. Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Messer The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Add at the end the following: SEC. 7. PROHIBITION ON EXPORTS OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, AND PETROCHEMICAL PRODUCTS TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN. Nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize the export of crude oil, refined petroleum products, and petrochemical products by or through any entity or person, wherever located, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to any entity or person located in, subject to the jurisdiction of, or sponsored by the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana. Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chair, again, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton) for his leadership on this important bill and reiterate my support for H.R. 702. This is commonsense legislation that repeals the outdated ban on crude oil exports. The U.S. is producing more oil today than ever before, and we could literally become a net exporter of energy, something that would have been unimaginable a generation ago and would have incredible results for our economy. The fact that we are the only advanced nation that prohibits the export of domestically produced oil holds us back. I believe very strongly that we should not empower our enemies unintentionally through this legislation, and this includes the Islamic Republic of Iran. My amendment today prohibits the export of crude oil, refined petroleum products, and petrochemical products to Iran. Obviously, Iran has oil. It has no need to import it from the United States. But my amendment goes beyond just crude oil. It ensures Iran will not inadvertently have access to other petroleum-based products produced in the U.S. Refined petroleum and petrochemical products are used to manufacture thousands of goods that we use every day. Things like plastics, asphalt, paints, and cell phones are manufactured in this way. It was only a few weeks ago in this very Chamber that we discussed the dangers of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the Iran nuclear deal. Despite being able to enrich uranium and self- police its nuclear facilities, Iran will receive sanctions relief to the tune of $150 billion. That is $150 billion pumped into a $400- billion-a-year national economy. $150 billion of that will, no doubt, be used by Iran to bankroll terrorist organizations, further destabilize the Middle East, and continue their work to wipe Israel off the map. Things should not be made easier for them. The intent of the underlying bill is not to aid and support Iran. It is to open up the U.S. energy sector, export oil, grow our economy, and create thousands of jobs. My amendment ensures that the intention of this bill is clear. I believe the amendment is consistent with the underlying goals of the bill, and I encourage my colleagues to support its adoption. Mr. BARTON. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. MESSER. I yield to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. BARTON. The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton), the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield), and myself support your amendment and ask that it be accepted. Mr. MESSER. I thank the gentleman. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, again, I rise in mild opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana. However, I would point out that Iran has the fourth largest number of proven oil reserves in the world. In fact, supporters of this bill often state concern over the [[Page H6957]] market impact of increased Iranian exports on domestic producers. So while it is hard to understand why we need to worry about our crude oil going to a country that is a major net exporter of oil, I have no objection to adopting this amendment and making really sure Iran doesn't get any of our oil and petroleum products. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MESSER. I appreciate the gentleman's comments. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana will be postponed. Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Cuellar The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of the bill, add the following new section: SEC. 7. PARTNERSHIPS WITH MINORITY SERVING INSTITUTIONS. (a) In General.--The Department of Energy shall continue to develop and broaden partnerships with minority serving institutions, including Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI) and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in the areas of oil and gas exploration, production, midstream, and refining. (b) Public-private Partnerships.--The Department of Energy shall encourage public Private partnerships between the energy sector and minority serving institutions, including Hispanic Serving Institutions and Historically Black Colleges and Universities. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Chairman, I am here, of course, to talk about an amendment to H.R. 702, this important legislation before us that will lift this outdated ban on the export of oil, modernize the U.S. energy economy, and create U.S. jobs. The amendment that I bring forward is to help Minority-Serving Institutions grow the leaders of the future in the oil and gas industry. The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that Hispanics will account for 74 percent of the growth in the Nation's labor force from 2010 to 2020. This amendment ensures that our Minority-Serving Institutions, such as Hispanic-Serving Institutions and Historically Black Colleges and Universities, can create a competitive and able workforce in our oil and gas industry. This will ensure that our Nation can continue to compete in the global market far into the future. Hispanic-Serving Institutions are about 12 percent of the nonprofit colleges and universities, yet they enroll 59 percent of all Hispanic students. The other part of this amendment, Mr. Chairman, is that it also calls for the Department of Energy to encourage public-private partnerships between the energy sector and Minority-Serving Institutions. This is an amendment that I think will be good for all workers across the Nation. I ask all Members to vote in favor of this amendment and to support the underlying bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I do support the gentleman's amendment. I want to commend him for his leadership on this issue. I hope we will accept it on a voice vote. I see Mr. Rush. I am willing to yield to my good friend from Chicago (Mr. Rush) if he wishes to speak on it. I was told he might. Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the bill. Mr. BARTON. I yield for the 1-minute prayer, not the 5-minute sermon. Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, I respectfully decline the time the gentleman was gracious to give. I really want my own time on the bill. The Acting CHAIR. The time has already been claimed. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush), which couldn't exceed 5 minutes because that is all I have. Mr. RUSH. I thank my friend for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I must say that I did not come here to Congress to shadowbox with the majority party over jobs and economic opportunities for the intergenerationally and chronically unemployed citizens of my district and similarly situated districts across the country. Mr. Chairman, my amendment, which was not allowed by the majority party, would have provided real solutions to real problems. My amendment would have put dollars in the pocketbooks of the unemployed minorities, the unemployed women, and the unemployed veterans of this Nation. Mr. Chairman, I must say, this amendment before us is like pouring perfume on an overused pigsty. It provides DOE--and I quote from the amendment, Mr. Chairman--it provides DOE with the authority to continue its ongoing work. In other words, it tells the Department of Energy: Do what you are already doing. Mr. Chairman, unlike the amendment I offered in the Rules Committee that was drafted with input and collaboration from the various stakeholders who would benefit most had it been adopted, there is no specific initiative, no program, and no objections in the Cuellar amendment. Mr. Chairman, the Rush amendment would have established--not encouraged, but established--partnerships between DOE, Commerce, the Small Business Administration, Minority Business Development Agency, industry, the National Minority Supplier Diversity Council, the Women's Business Enterprise Network Council, and minority chambers of commerce chapters across the Nation. The Rush amendment would have established programmatic commitments for diversity hiring for vendor and contracting opportunities within the supply chain through contractual obligations, incentives, and other means with a goal of no less than 10 percent participation by minority- owned firms by the year 2020. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would have created regional diversity supply chain specialty centers to develop strategies for minority business contracting and vendor opportunities, and to hold business development sessions in strategic locations where energy development exists or is expanding. The Rush amendment would have helped minority- and women-owned firms form consortiums and partnerships in order to better meet qualifications and capacities that industry is seeking. Mr. Chairman, the Rush amendment would have established a program to provide access to capital for loans, financing, and insurance assistance for minority- and women-owned businesses. Mr. Chairman, the Rush amendment would have established--not just encouraged, but established--public-private partnerships between minority-owned banks and private investors as well as provided grants to Minority-Serving Institutions to help recruit businesses for energy- related supply chain sector activity. Again, Mr. Chairman, I am not here to criticize my friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar). I am here to just bring out the differences between what an imaginary amendment would do and what a real amendment would do. Mr. BARTON. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the kind words of the gentleman from Illinois. I understand the amendment that he was trying to get in. Actually, I was trying to help try to get his amendment accepted, but it is up to the Rules Committee and the democracy there. This amendment is very simple. It is something that we have added in the [[Page H6958]] appropriation bill on different agencies. We all have voted for this in the appropriation bills time after time after time, and it is to help the Minority-Serving Institutions. I ask the gentleman from Texas and Members to please accept this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar). The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. The Chair understands that amendment No. 8 will not be offered. Amendment No. 9 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of the bill, add the following new section: SEC. 7. REPORT. Not later than 10 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Commerce shall jointly transmit to Congress a report that reviews the impact of lifting the oil export ban under this Act as it relates to promoting United States energy and national security. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas. {time} 1215 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me thank Mr. Pallone and Mr. Barton for their courtesies and as well the Rules Committee. Let me first of all say there has been a lot of discussion on the floor of the House regarding this bill and different opinions. Might I add that this is an important and vigorous discussion. I think this is the best of what this Congress is all about. Mr. Chairman, I would like to take note of H.R. 702, which many of us know came about because of the gas prices in the 1970s. This bill simply repeals that portion of the legislation that responded to that crisis. What I like in the bill is, of course, we have in the bill that we, as a Congress, will get a report some 120 days after dealing with the maintenance and the strength of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That is a very important national security item. A savings clause indicates, of course, that the President has all of his powers in the light of crisis and other issues to implement any necessary changes or any necessary restrictions on this legislation. My amendment tracks giving more information. Not later than 10 years after the date of enactment of this act, the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Commerce shall jointly transmit to Congress a report that reviews the impact of lifting the oil import ban under this act as relates to promoting, supporting, and providing for the United States energy and national security policy. Our number one responsibility is the American people--I understand that--both environmentally, which reflects to their own energy resources, and certainly with national security. This amendment allows for that report to be on the front side of 10 years. It could be 2 years from now, 3 years from now, and the Congress can dictate that. U.S. crude production bottomed in 2008 at about 7 million barrels a day. It is now more than 11 million barrels a day, and it is now possible to go up to 18 million barrels a day in 2040 under the strictest environmental concerns. But right now in my district--right now in my district--they are laying off thousands of people because there is no work. So I would argue to my colleagues that this amendment provides the insight on what is going on. This bill could provide the GDP would rise by 550 billion to 1.8 trillion between 2015 and 2039. It is estimated in my own congressional job lifting the ban would generate an additional 500 hundred jobs, an additional 270 million in the local economy, and increase government revenues in 227 million. This 10-year period under that--by the way, it is up to 10 years--is giving long enough time to provide a probative, intelligent assessment of whether there is irreversible damage. Amendment No. 9 operates as a safety valve and reassures that those who may be skeptical of lifting the export ban get reasonable opportunities to oppose it or get the right information. The same thing with those who may support it. It gives us a basis of empirical data rigorously analyzed. Mr. Chairman, my amendment can be summed up as follows: For those who are confident in the future, my amendment offers vindication. For those who are skeptical of the new change, my amendment will provide the evidence they need to prove their case. I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I would rise in mild opposition, which could turn to support. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Houston for offering it. Is she willing to do this on a voice vote and consider voting for the bill if we accept it? Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. BARTON. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Is the gentleman rising to support the gentlewoman's amendment with great enthusiasm? Mr. BARTON. I will if you rise to voice vote on your amendment. I will make it a package deal. I will give you this amendment and the next amendment double enthusiasm if they are both voice votes and you actually really do vote for the bill or at least start thinking about it strongly. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. BARTON. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentleman surmise that amendments that are passed by voice vote are still strong amendments? Mr. BARTON. Oh, they are. Ms. JACKSON LEE. And included in the bill? Mr. BARTON. Yes, ma'am. Ms. JACKSON LEE. As opposed to being susceptible to being gotten rid of? Mr. BARTON. No. You have got my word. I will be on the conference committee if we have one. Your amendments will be in the conference report that goes to the President if we get that far. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I am always eager to work with my friends on this side of aisle, Mr. Pallone. I am always eager to work when we are moving forward. And so I would offer my amendment and offer it for a voice vote. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in, as I just said I would, double enthusiastic support of her amendment, but I am going to be looking on that board when it comes time to vote. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me just simply say my amendment answers many of the concerns that have been expressed on the floor of the House by giving empirical data, not 10 years and beyond, but in a period up to 10 years, to let us make further informative decisions to provide for the energy resources of the American people, the national resources, and, of course, being able to provide for the national security. With that, I ask for support of the Jackson Lee amendment. Mr. Chair, let me express my appreciation to Chairman Emeritus Barton and Ranking Member Pallone for their leadership and commitment to American energy independence and economic growth and security. I also wish to thank Chairman Sessions, Ranking Member Slaughter, and the members of the Rules Committee for making in order Jackson Lee Amendment Number 9. Mr. Chair, thank you for the opportunity to explain my amendment, which provides: Sec. 7. Report. Not later than 10 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Commerce shall jointly transmit to Congress a report that reviews the impact of lifting the oil export ban under this Act as it relates to promoting United States energy and national security. As the Member of Congress from Houston, the energy capital of the nation, I have always [[Page H6959]] been mindful of the importance and have strongly advocated for national energy policies that will make our nation more energy independent, preserve and create jobs, and keep our nation's economy strong. The Eighteenth Congressional District, which I am proud to represent is home to Shell Oil, ConocoPhillips, Chevron Phillips, BP Corporation of North America, Marathon Oil, Enterprise Products Partners (Oil and Gas Pipelines), and Halliburton (Oilfield Services), and many others. I am strongly ``pro-jobs,'' ``pro-growing economy,'' ``pro- sustainable environment and development,'' and for homeland and national security. Volatile energy prices threaten economic security for millions of middle class Americans and hits consumers hard; rising gas prices strain budgets for millions of American families. It is a familiar story, but in order to restore lasting security for middle class families we need a smart and reasonable plan for American energy, not false promises or quick fixes. That is why I carefully consider each energy legislative proposal brought to the floor on its individual merits and support them when they are sound, balanced, fair, and promote the national interest. So my constituents have a strong interest in policies that maintain or enhance the competitiveness of American petroleum energy business in the world oil markets. Where they fall short, I believe in working across the aisle to improve them by offering constructive amendments. H.R. 702 repeals the law prohibiting the exports of crude oil that has been on the books for more than 40 years, a response to the Arab Oil Embargo led by OPEC in 1973 that sent oil prices soaring and inflicted substantial damage on the American economy. But much has changed since 1973; America's unconventional oil boom changed everything. U.S. crude production bottomed in 2008 at about 7 million barrels per day; now it is now more than 11 million barrels per day and according to the U.S. DOE's Energy Information Administration, U.S. output is estimated to top 18 million barrels a day by 2040. Crude inventories are at an 80-year high, and imports have declined nearly 30% between 2005 and 2013. Mr. Chair, paradoxically, continuation of the crude oil export ban may pose one of the biggest threats to this U.S. production boom and to the economy. This is because increased production has led to a substantial decline in oil prices over the past year and the resulting decrease in revenues has forced U.S. producers in my district and elsewhere to slash investment and cancel projects. Since last autumn the industry has cut more than 125,000 jobs, including many in my district. I have met and know many of the employers and workers affected by industry job reductions. Mr. Chair, lifting the crude oil export ban would offer American crude oil producers new markets for their product and would mean fewer layoffs. Studies by the highly respected Brookings Institution and other organizations suggest that the economic benefits to the nation of repealing the ban on crude oil exports would be substantial: 1. GDP could rise by $550 billion to $1.8 trillion between 2015 and 2039; 2. U.S. oil production could rise by 1.3 million to 2.9 million barrels per day in 2020; 3. 300,000 additional jobs created by 2020; 4. $5.8 billion in estimated reduced consumer fuel costs each year between 2015 and 2035; 5. up to $70 billion in additional investment in U.S. exploration, development, and production of crude oil between 2015 and 2020; 6. $13.5 billion in additional federal, state, and local revenue in 2020; 7. $22 billion reduction in the U.S. trade deficit in 2020; and 8. 100,000 barrels per day increase in refinery throughout between 2015 and 2035. It is estimated that in my own congressional district, lifting the ban would generate an additional 500 jobs and inject an additional $275 million into the local economy, resulting in an increase in government revenues in the amount of $227.7 million. Admittedly, these are predictions, projections, and forecasts made on the basis of the best information currently available. We hope they are accurate but candor requires that we acknowledge that no one can say with certainty they will come to pass. That is why it is essential that at an appropriate juncture we review and assess the impact on the American petroleum industry, the national economy, and consumers. And that is the purpose of Jackson Lee Amendment #9, which mandates a comprehensive review of the impact of crude oil export ban repeal after a 10 year period. This 10 year time period is long enough to accumulate data sufficient and probative enough to assess the impact of H.R. 702, but not so long as to prevent irreversible damage if the evaluation does not approximate the expected benefits reveals unintended adverse consequences. In sum, Jackson Lee Amendment Number 9 will help ensure that the brave new world of unrestricted crude oil exports by American producers is more than a leap of faith. Rather, Jackson Lee Amendment Number 9 operates as a safety valve and reassures those who may be skeptical of lifting the export ban that reasonable opportunities will exist to make an informed evaluation of the effect of the ban's repeal on our economy and national security. And it is important to emphasize Mr. Chair, that this evaluation will be based on empirical data rigorously analyzed. In short, Mr. Chair, my amendment can be summed up as follows: for those who are confident of the future, my amendment offers vindication. For those who are skeptical that the new change will work, my amendment will provide the evidence they need to prove their case. And for those who believe that maintaining the status quo is intolerable, my amendment offers a way forward. I urge all members to support Jackson Lee Amendment Number 9. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 10 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of the bill, add the following new section: SEC. 7. REPORT TO CONGRESS. Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Commerce shall jointly transmit to Congress a report analyzing how lifting the ban on crude oil exports will help create opportunities for veterans and women in the United States, while promoting energy and national security. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I ask that my amendment be considered by my colleagues. Mr. Chairman, my amendment requires within 180 days of enactment the Secretaries of Energy and Commerce submit a report to Congress analyzing how lifting the ban on crude oil, in particular, on exports, will create opportunities for veterans and women. Mr. Chairman, just a few days ago I went to an initiative called Stand Down. I have gone a number of years. Most military persons will understand it is where you come and stand down from battle. In this instance, they were veterans, many of them homeless, many of them in great need. Obviously, social services, substance abuse services, and others were offered there. What I heard from these men who wore the uniform in dignity is they want jobs. Mr. Chairman, I believe that this legislation will provide a strong pro-jobs agenda growing the economy. As my previous amendment said, I do not take lightly the impact of lifting the ban; therefore, my previous amendment would provide the insight on whether or not this is a positive impact. I can tell you that there is a great need, as has been discussed earlier, about collaborating with historically Black colleges and Hispanic-serving colleges. I have worked on those issues and have certainly seen the leadership of Mr. Rush and Mr. Cuellar. But I will tell you that it is indicated that State shale development supports American jobs. Mr. Chairman, $107,000 is the average salary that is provided by the energy company in energy jobs, 1.7 million employment attributed to upstream, unconventional oil and natural gas. Women fill 40 percent of the vacancies in oil and gas. Mr. Chairman, I will insert this into the Record. [[Page H6960]] [Apr. 23, 2014] The Energy Revolution is Creating Career Opportunities for Women and Minorities (By Cheryl Jackson) Minorities are projected to fill an unprecedented number of jobs in the oil, natural gas and petrochemical industries-- increasing from one-quarter of total jobs in 2010 to one- third by 2030--according to a new IHS report sponsored by API. ``The oil and natural gas industry pays wages significantly higher than the national average and can provide tremendous career opportunities for women and minorities,'' said Jack Gerard, API President and CEO. ``To lower unemployment and shrink the income inequality gap without spending a dime of taxpayer money, we encourage President Obama to embrace this pro-development energy opportunity.'' Of up to 1.3 million new job opportunities in the oil, natural gas and petrochemical industries predicted by 2030, almost 408,000 positions--32 percent of the total--are projected to be held by African American and Hispanic workers, according to the report. Women are estimated to fill 185,000 of those jobs, and 63 percent of new job opportunities will be in blue collar professions. ``We have the natural resources and the technology to be a global energy superpower with all the economic and national security benefits that entails,'' Gerard said. ``Smart energy policy will create tremendous opportunity for hundreds of thousands of workers--from those with just a high school diploma and some post-secondary training to those with post- graduate degrees.'' ``As the study highlights job opportunities, it signals the tremendous need to prepare African Americans, Hispanics and Women to be ready to fill the workforce gap'', said Paula Jackson, president and CEO of the American Association of Blacks in Energy. ``These jobs in the oil and natural gas industry don't just put people to work, they help to transform communities.'' ``This powerful and important report is a road map for workforce development stakeholders to align the content of their training with a sense of urgency to adequately prepare people for energy jobs,'' said Jose L. Perez, chairman and CEO Of Hispanics In Energy. ``Energy job replacement and growth is a clear pathway for diverse communities to rise from poverty to middle-class, what a rare opportunity.'' Ms. JACKSON LEE. The government and the administration are working to pair up and find jobs for veterans. The unemployment rate for veterans we have seen has been a constant issue, and it is going down. But we need to provide them with other opportunities. They were higher unemployment, as we can see, than the regular workforce. So my amendment wants to ensure that, if we lift this ban, women and veterans will benefit. We know, of course, that we have been pushing our educational facilities to engage in STEM, but what we need now is a pipeline for qualified veterans and women looking for jobs right now. Mr. Chairman, I would ask my colleagues to support this Jackson Lee amendment. It causes us to focus on these vulnerable populations--women and veterans--to direct them into the industry. Might I say to my constituents, the energy companies that I represent, a long list of names that I will not name at this time, that we hope that they are focused as well on expanding opportunities in the energy industry for veterans, returning soldiers, if you will, women, and, of course, across-the-board minorities. This is an industry that is moving and growing, and the opportunities should move and grow as well. With that, Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I only would like to say we support the amendment and we will honor the deal we just made on the prior amendment. I ask for a ``yes'' vote on a voice vote on the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Pallone. I hope that our colleagues have heard us to emphasize the creation of jobs along with the environment, national security, and the energy resources of America. Mr. Chair, again, let me express my appreciation to Chairman Emeritus Barton and Ranking Member Pallone for their leadership and commitment to American energy independence, economic growth, national security, and expanding opportunities and diversifying the energy sector workforce. Mr. Chair, thank you for the opportunity to explain my amendment, which provides: Sec. 7. Report. Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Commerce shall jointly transmit to Congress a report analyzing how lifting the ban on crude oil exports will help create opportunities for veterans and women in the United States, while promoting energy and national security. I also wish to thank Chairman Sessions, Ranking Member Slaughter, and the members of the Rules Committee for making in order Jackson Lee Amendment Number 10. As the Member of Congress from Houston, the energy capital of the nation, I have always been mindful of the importance and have strongly advocated for national energy policies that will make our nation more energy independent, preserve and create jobs, and keep our nation's economy strong. I strongly am ``pro-jobs,'' ``pro-growing economy,'' and ``pro- expanding economic opportunities for women, veterans, minorities, and small business!'' That is why I carefully consider each energy legislative proposal brought to the floor on its individual merits and support them when they are sound, balanced, promote the national interest, and expand economic opportunities for everyone, particularly for women, veterans, and members of underrepresented communities. My constituents have a strong interest in policies that maintain or enhance the competitiveness of American petroleum energy business in the world oil markets. Where they fall short, I believe in working across the aisle to improve them by offering constructive amendments. That is why I have offered Jackson Lee Amendment Number 10, which recognizes the fact that veterans, minorities, small businesses and women currently are significantly underrepresented in the oil and gas industries at all levels and severely underrepresented in the senior managerial, professional, board and ownership ranks. Jackson Lee Amendment Number 10 directs the Secretaries of Commerce and Energy to submit a report to Congress within 180 days assessing the beneficial impact, if any, that lifting the crude oil export ban holds for veterans and women. This report should shed light on any additional measures that should be taken to increase the participation of women and veterans in the petroleum industry as workers, executives, and entrepreneurs. Nationally, there were 1.2 million people employed in the oil and gas industry in 2010, only 17% of which are women. Our booming energy sector has been one of the great American success stories over the last decade, and remains a bright spot in our economy as it continues to fuel job creation. To continue this success and to ensure that opportunities and benefits are shared equitably, it is critical that we have a diverse energy workforce equipped with the skills, knowledge, and experiences needed to compete and win in the global economy. And there is no better place to look than from our pool of talented veterans and women? Women make up half our population and are increasing their presence in the STEM fields vital to success in the petroleum energy sector. Veterans not only have proved their mettle and leadership skills in defense of our country but also are among the most resourceful and resilient members of our society, possessing the mission-critical ethic necessary for success in the workplace. A pipeline of qualified veterans and women looking for employment could play a key role as the energy industry seeks qualified, motivated, and skilled workers and entrepreneurs. As a nation, we must remain committed to utilizing the talents of women and veterans if our nation is to meet the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities offered by a dynamic global energy market. Jackson Lee Amendment Number 10 helps us meet this challenge by providing critical information regarding the impact of lifting the crude oil export ban will have on creating opportunities for veterans and women. I urge all members to support Jackson Lee Amendment Number 10. Mr. Chairman, with that, I ask for support of the Jackson Lee amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR.

El Faro, an American flagship en route to Puerto Rico, was lost in Hurricane Joaquin and, with it, its 33 crew, including 28 Americans. In the hours after we learned El Faro was in trouble, the Coast Guard, DOD, and other government and private sector partners mobilized assets with search crews battling treacherous weather conditions in an attempt to find survivors; and we appreciate their efforts. Mr. Chair, today our thoughts and prayers are with the crewmembers' families and loved ones. I ask that the House observe a moment of silence to honor the brave men and women who served on the El Faro. The Acting CHAIR. Members will rise and observe a moment of silence.

Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. HUFFMAN. I am opposed in its current form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. Huffman moves to recommit the bill H.R. 702 to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith, with the following amendment: Page 3, line 17, insert ``Nothing in this Act prevents the President or any other Federal official from enforcing Federal laws or regulations necessary to protect human health, the environment, or public safety, including the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.), the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96-129), the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107-355), the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety Act of 2006 (Pub. L. 109-468), or the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (Pub. L. 112-90).'' after ``prohibit exports.''. Mr. BARTON (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I reserve the right to make a point of order against the bill that it is not germane. The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved. The Clerk will continue to read. The Clerk continued to read. Mr. HUFFMAN (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that we suspend the reading. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Parliamentary Inquiry Mr. BARTON. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. BARTON. If I make a point of order that the motion to recommit is not germane and it, in fact, is not germane, there is no vote. Is that correct? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will not respond to a hypothetical. A point of order has been reserved. Point of Order Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, I make a point of order that the motion to recommit is not germane. Oh, it is germane. I withdraw the point of order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The point of order and the reservation of the point of order is withdrawn. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, let me begin with the usual stipulations. This is the final amendment to the bill. It won't kill the bill or send it back to committee. When this is adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended, so there is no procedural reason to oppose this motion to recommit. Let's talk about the substance. Now, we have heard a lot of debate this morning about the need to give Big Oil--the most profitable industry in the history of the world--yet another advantage. For years, Americans have been told that we have to ``drill, baby, drill.'' The theory that we always hear is that we need to extract every barrel of oil from every acre of American soil to keep gas prices low and to provide ``energy security.'' But as soon as American gas prices started to drop, the curtain was raised, and the truth was revealed. The real reason for ``drill, baby, drill,'' surprise, surprise, was to give Big Oil the chance to maximize their profits on the world market. It is not enough that they have been able to game the Tax Code for a century with billions of dollars of tax breaks not available to other taxpayers or businesses. It is not enough that they continue to enjoy access to our public lands and waters for oil drilling, even though they are no longer paying into the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the longstanding law that expired at the beginning of this month. As a reminder, for the past 50 years, the Land and Water Conservation Fund was an agreement, a compact between the American people and Big Oil. It said that when we let oil and gas companies drill and profit from drilling in Federal waters, they have to dedicate a fraction of the profits, just a fraction, to protect our great outdoors for future generations. The deal is that they have to dedicate a fraction of those profits to protecting our great outdoors for future generations so that our grandchildren will be able to hike and hunt and fish in our parks and wildlife refuges. The Land and Water Conservation Fund was shamefully allowed to lapse at the beginning of this month, and the majority hasn't scheduled a single vote--or even a hearing--to get it back on the books. No, all of these concessions to the oil and gas industry are not enough for this House. With today's bill, the House majority is saying that American oil and gas companies can drill more, export more, and realize even greater profits, no matter the environmental consequences, no matter the consequences to health and safety. As presently written, the underlying bill, H.R. 702, would permanently ensure that no export restrictions for any reason could be implemented or enforced in the future. That is what this bill says. That is breathtaking in its devotion to the oil and gas industry's agenda. Now, my motion to recommit would ensure that the President and Federal [[Page H6964]] Government agencies charged with protecting human health, the environment, and public safety can continue to do their job that constituents rely on them to do. Specifically, with this amendment, we will ensure that bedrock health and safety laws, like the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act, that laws like that will not be cast aside in favor of Big Oil's desire to sell more crude overseas. Now, if you think about it, this is a very straightforward motion. I just want to ask my colleagues a question: Should crude oil exports trump the Safe Drinking Water Act? Should Big Oil profits trump the need for pipeline safety and pipeline inspection? Of course not. We need to protect safe drinking water. We need to ensure pipeline safety. So, my colleagues, I urge you to vote ``yes'' on this MTR to improve this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BARTON. First of all, I want to thank the minority for giving us a one-page motion to recommit that I can actually read and understand. I have read it. I don't like it. It is not necessary. It is redundant. I oppose it. Please vote against it. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Recorded Vote Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material in the Record on the bill, H.R. 702. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 466 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 702. The Chair appoints the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hultgren) to preside over the Committee of the Whole. {time} 1003 In the Committee of the Whole Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 702) to adapt to changing crude oil market conditions, with Mr. Hultgren in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the first time. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) each will control 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Harper), a member of the committee. Mr. HARPER. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 702, but, more importantly, I rise today in support of American jobs. The U.S. daily production of oil has increased dramatically in the past 14 years. That number is projected to continue to increase due to advances in technology, but companies need a new market. At this point, the ban is not protecting the economy. Instead, the economy is being restricted, and Americans are being denied jobs. My district and State rely on good-paying oil industry jobs. At a time when our economy can't afford to see unemployment numbers rise, oil companies are being forced to cut back their workforce. Lifting the ban on crude oil exports will mean new jobs for Mississippians that will allow them to support their families. I urge my colleagues to support and vote for H.R. 702 and for American jobs. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 702, a poorly crafted bill that needlessly and recklessly sweeps away 40 years of critical energy protections for national security, our economy, consumers, and the environment. H.R. 702 is a blunt object that doesn't just undermine current protective authorities related to crude oil; it also prohibits any Federal official from taking any action at any time if that action either restricts or enforces a restriction on the export of oil. The term ``restriction'' is undefined and potentially dangerous in scope. The bill would also override any other law that would impose any restriction by any Federal official on exports. That means that the bill does nothing to preserve any environment or safety statutes or regulations, and it doesn't even preserve the Defense Production Act, one of the most important tools any President has to ensure our national energy security in the face of a threat. Let's be clear, Mr. Chairman. The President has already stated that he will veto this bill. Further, any legislation of this nature is completely unnecessary since the President already has the authority to ease or even remove restrictions on crude oil exports, and the Obama administration has taken major steps to exercise that authority by approving crude oil swaps with Mexico and applications for the export of condensate. The bottom line, Mr. Chairman, is that it is imperative for Congress to consider a host of factors before we lift the current restrictions and, certainly, if we are to completely dismantle our Nation's ability to restrict oil exports, as proposed by H.R. 702. First, Mr. Chairman, there are consumer impacts, especially related to the price of crude oil and gasoline. A recent study found that changes to U.S. oil export policy will have little to no impact on the future price of oil. What we do know is that changes in our crude oil policy will lead to a significant payday for oil producers, with increases in annual profits approaching $30 billion by 2025. Next, there are the impacts on our refinery capacity and associated jobs, well-paying middle class jobs that have grown over the past few years due to increased production. Unrestricted exports of crude oil put those jobs at jeopardy and could mean exporting those jobs and losing out on critical investments in future refining capacity. And finally, Mr. Chairman, there are, of course, the environmental and climate impacts of lifting the export ban. Energy policy is fundamentally linked to environmental policy. Each is a facet of the other. Increasing crude oil exports means increasing domestic production and its impacts on climate change, public health, worker safety, property owners, and protection of our drinking water supplies. As I have said before, this legislation eagerly embraces short-term profits and benefits without understanding or even considering the cost of such a major action. We simply can't afford to make that mistake. We should ensure we fully understand and consider the enduring consequences of our actions and choose the cleanest and most sustainable path forward. I don't believe, Mr. Chairman, that the potential impacts of H.R. 702 on national security, on the economy, on consumers, and on the environment can be considered acceptable. So, Mr. Chairman, increased crude exports certainly help oil companies. It is a bonanza for the oil companies, but without any guaranteed benefits for consumers. I urge my colleagues to join me and the President in saying ``no'' to this legislation. I reserve the balance of my time. Parliamentary Inquiries Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I have a parliamentary inquiry. The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. BARTON. My understanding, in general debate, the majority, or proponents, have 30 minutes, and then the opponents have 30 minutes; is that correct? [[Page H6942]] The CHAIR. On this bill, yes, the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce each control 30 minutes. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar), the original Democrat sponsor, have 6 minutes of the proponent's time to control as he sees fit. The CHAIR. The Chair cannot entertain a unanimous consent request to change the scheme for control of general debate. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I have an additional parliamentary inquiry. The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. BARTON. Could the Chair educate the illiterate Member from Texas on how I could give Mr. Cuellar time that he may control on his side? If I can't yield it unanimously, how can I do that? The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas may yield from his own time to engage in debate, and may yield to Members on the other side of the aisle. Mr. BARTON. Continuing the parliamentary inquiry, if I do that, can he reserve part of that time, or does he have to use it all in one slot? The CHAIR. The other gentleman from Texas would not control the time. Mr. BARTON. He could not reserve any of it? The CHAIR. Correct. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson). Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for the time to speak on this bill, which I wholeheartedly support, because ending this oil export ban will not only boost our economy, it will also improve our foreign policy. I also rise with hesitation to a proposed amendment that would remove a provision of this bill boosting payments to the 60 ships of our maritime security fleet. These ships are essential in transporting cargo to the men and women of our Armed Forces who are serving overseas in harm's way. As evidence of this, 90 percent of all cargo moved to Iraq and Afghanistan has been transported on these privately owned ships. As of right now, Mr. Chairman, the stipend provided by the government is too low to make this program viable to those who have stepped up to defend our Nation against foreign threats. Without this increase, it is likely that participants will drop out of the program. This, obviously, is a national security threat. It is estimated that for the government to replicate this program, it would cost more than $50 billion in taxpayer money. This programs saves money while enhancing our security, and I encourage my colleagues to avoid supporting this amendment, but voting ``yes'' to lift this outdated oil export ban. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F. Doyle). Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this bill. I have been here in Congress for 21 years, and during that time, we always hear talk about we want to be energy-independent in the United States. My colleagues on both sides of the aisle always talk about the dream of energy independence, where we don't have to depend on any other country for our oil. It would change policy in the Middle East, and it would dramatically improve our national security. Well, the bad news is, Mr. Chairman, we are not energy-independent. We use 17 million barrels of oil a day, but we only produce 9 million, which means we are still importing nearly half of all the oil we use. Now, here is the good news, Mr. Chairman. Horizontal drilling and all this oil we are finding in the shale formations gives us a chance to be truly energy-independent. We could produce an additional 9 million barrels a day, and we wouldn't have to depend on any other country in the world for our oil. All we have to do is produce what we have in our own country and make sure that we have refinery capacity to take care of this light sweet crude, and we are energy-independent. So the question is, Mr. Chairman, why aren't we investing in our own domestic refinery capacity to keep high-paying jobs here in the United States in the refinery industry, in the maritime trades, and in manufacturing, like steelmaking? Why aren't we doing that for America while enhancing America's security? We had the former commander of the USS Cole, Kirk Lippold, testify before our committee. He highlighted ``the significant national security risks associated with greater oil imports.'' He said that ``too many times in recent history, the U.S. has made oil deals with hostile or unfriendly governments that actually threaten our foreign policy and our national security objectives. ``Lifting the export ban will undermine U.S. power projection capabilities by undermining the competitiveness of our U.S. refineries.'' Do we really want to undermine the U.S. military? And then we hear the story that, somehow, lifting this ban is going to help our European allies because it will reduce their dependence on Russian oil. Well, that is a myth, too. As Commander Lippold testified before our committee, ``the primary recipient of this U.S. exported oil is going to be Asia, specifically, China.'' {time} 1015 So we want to export U.S. oil to China and still have to import oil from countries that aren't necessarily friendly to us. Why would we do that? Mr. Chairman, H.R. 702 is deeply flawed because it doesn't allow for any future oversight of oil exports under any circumstances. Even if there is an oil spike or a shortage, there is no ``safety valve'' to ensure that we have enough of this critical resource for our Armed Forces, our industries, and our constituents. In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, this bill undermines our national security, and we are still importing an incredible amount of oil. This just defies common sense, and we should reject it. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Mimi Walters), a cosponsor of the bill. Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 702, legislation that would lift the 40-year-old ban on U.S. oil exports. In 1975, President Gerald Ford signed the ban into law in response to gasoline shortages and the Arab oil embargo. While the ban served a purpose nearly 40 years ago, much has changed since that time. Today we need an energy policy that aligns with our current economic and political climate. The United States is the largest petroleum and natural gas producer in the world. Our self-imposed export ban doesn't make sense and does nothing but hinder economic growth. If the ban is lifted this year, over 57,000 new supply chain jobs would be created in my home State of California by 2018, and nationwide nearly 450,000 new jobs would be created. Having the option to put U.S. crude oil on the world market would benefit Americans. Lifting the ban would create jobs, strengthen the U.S. economy, and help reduce our trade deficit. It would also provide the international marketplace with more options, in turn, limiting the ability of energy commodities to be used as political weapons. It is important to note that this bill doesn't require the U.S. to export crude oil. It simply provides the option needed for barrels to be used in the areas where they are needed most. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time so the Republicans can have another speaker. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hinojosa) at the request of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar), who is my original Democrat sponsor. Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support and as a cosponsor of H.R. 702, which lifts the ban on crude oil exports. Modern advances in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have allowed the United States access to large deposits of crude oil and natural gas. Last year our country produced over 350 million barrels of crude oil, and that number is steadily increasing. The crude oil in our deposits is lighter and sweeter than the traditional heavy crude oil our refineries process. The export ban hinders our access to international markets that need the [[Page H6943]] sweeter type of crude and that have the refinement infrastructure for it. I am convinced that lifting the outdated crude oil export ban will create jobs and economic opportunities for our communities as we strive for greater energy independence. In the great State of Texas, lifting the export ban is estimated to increase the annual GDP by over $7.1 billion and create over 40,000 new supply chain jobs. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BARTON. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds on behalf of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar). Mr. HINOJOSA. According to the Government Accountability Office, removing export restrictions will create employment opportunities, expand trade, and lower gasoline prices. The economic and political landscape has evolved since the ban's inception in the 1970s. I am confident that now is the time to repeal the ban on the export of crude oil to increase our economic and energy competitiveness. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 702. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green). Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 702. In the past 10 years, the United States has undergone an energy revolution. Our production of oil and gas has far exceeded all analysis or prediction. The success in the field has materialized into jobs in our district in the Houston area, both in the chemical and the refining industries. The price of oil dropped from $100 a barrel to $45 a barrel. Gasoline prices have fallen from $4 per gallon to less than $2 in Houston. I have represented our refinery complexes for many years. All of these benefited our economy and the consumer. Unfortunately, the success has brought hardship upon the upstream producers. The energy sector, which led our country out of the recession, has now laid off approximately 150,000 folks. Bloomberg estimated that 40 percent of those layoffs were in Texas. I know the oil patch is facing a tough and difficult time, and I want to help. That is why it is very difficult for me to oppose this bill today. I support crude oil exports while protecting our domestic manufacturing jobs, including refining. We have the resource. We should use as much as possible here at home and sell what is left. I am a legislator who would like to solve this problem, and I like working across the party lines to get results. In fact, I worked with my good friend from Texas, Joe Barton, on many issues during our years in Congress. In fact, Joe and I sat together for years at the Texas A&M football games until we realized A&M would lose when we sat next to each other. So last Saturday, when they beat Mississippi State, we sat a ways apart so we didn't jinx them. For months, I talked with Representative Barton about the crude export issue. The crude oil export ban has been in place since 1975. In the seventies, the United States was in a tough spot, and we put the ban in place to protect our national interests. That is more than 40 years of legislative history. Before we throw all of that away, we should make sure we have a policy that will make sense for the next 40 years. I am hoping we can craft a bill that would create a process at the Bureau of Industry and Security within the Department of Commerce that would establish an authorization and reporting requirements for crude oil. Crude oil is a valuable national resource, and the government should have some oversight as to where and when we send it overseas. We export liquefied natural gas through a process developed at the Department of Energy. I have not been a fan of that process, but we have worked to improve it. We should have some basic requirements at the Department of Commerce to oversee crude. Unlike LNG, crude is a raw commodity. Unlike refined products, raw crude oil doesn't have value added. Our refiners add value to that, and we export that refined product. So those are jobs created in our community. Building LNG terminals and exporting refined product creates good- paying jobs and lots of capital expenditure. If exporting crude is the right policy, then let's do it correctly. Let's maximize the benefits for the United States. Let's make sure U.S. crude doesn't end up in the hands of North Korea or any of our other foes. We need to know where this resource is going, how much of it is being sent, and how often it is being sent there. We need to ensure that, if at any time, a potential bad actor enters the marketplace; the Department of Commerce has the ability to enforce the law. The Department of Commerce is not an obstacle to exports. In fact, I have struggled to find a more industry-friendly government agency. The Department of Commerce has approved every application to export oil in the last five years. That's 138 permits. What's more impressive is Commerce approves 99 percent of all export applications, regardless of product. Now, I agree that the Department could approve permits more efficiently but that's something we can legislate. That's a ``fix'' I can support and believe would help our upstream producers. Unfortunately, we were unable to find that compromise. I did not want to oppose this bill but without changes it is not in the best interest of our country. The time to address exports is now but we cannot just open the tap and hope for the best. I do not want the United States to become a resource nation and I certainly do not want to go back to the days of the 1970s. I look forward to working on this issue again and hope that a reasonable, commonsense approach can be reached. I want folks in all sectors to get back to work. For these reasons, I am forced to oppose H.R. 702 and I urge all my colleagues to do the same. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds to respond to what the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green) just said. The whole concept of this bill is to let willing buyers interact with willing sellers in a free market, transparent fashion. If you subject the bill to some sort of a discretionary permitting requirement, as one of Mr. Gene Green's amendments would have done, you gut the bill. You destroy the entire purpose of the bill. So as much as I respect my good friend from Houston, Texas, I respectfully have to object to that amendment. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Lance), a member of the committee. Mr. LANCE. Mr. Chairman, I commend Chairman Emeritus Barton's tremendous leadership on this issue. I rise today in strong support of the bill, bipartisan in nature, which will create thousands of American jobs, generate billions of dollars in revenues to States and locals, and use our Nation's natural resources as a counterbalance to the rogue actors currently dominating world oil markets. American energy brings security and independence to the world and jobs and economic development to the United States. It makes no sense that Iranian oil will soon be permitted to flow, but American-made energy is left untapped. It is time to end the outdated restrictions on the export of U.S. oil and, instead, work to create and protect tens of thousands of U.S. jobs, enhance our national security, and help keep prices at the pump affordable for all consumers across the country. American energy brings growth, prosperity, security, and independence to the United States and our allies. Our Nation should counter Iran and create thousands of U.S. jobs in the process. Please vote for H.R. 702. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, may I ask how much time there is on both sides. The CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey has 20\1/2\ minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 24 minutes remaining. Mr. PALLONE. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the great State of New Mexico (Mr. Pearce), one of our original cosponsors and a strong proponent of this bill. [[Page H6944]] Mr. PEARCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I appreciate his work on this important proposition. Mr. Chairman, for almost my entire life, the Nation has worked under prevailing science that said we have reached peak energy, we are out, that we have to plan for the future because we have no more oil. Two years ago a discovery was found in New Mexico that will provide more oil from that one find than has been produced in our State from its entire history through the entire geographic part of New Mexico. The science was a lie. We are finding oil. What is happening right now is that the refineries use a heavy sour crude. The new finds in shale are producing light sweet, which is more valuable. It is easier to refine. Yet, that light sweet oil is sitting in the pipelines in New Mexico, trying to get to Houston. It is selling at $17 below the market cost because there is no destination. The Baltics have said they would use our oil, they would put our workers back to work. But this law prevents it. The law in place, H.R. 702, simply says: Open that door and put Americans back to work, Americans driving trucks, Americans at the convenient stores. Americans everywhere get the jobs. The idea that this somehow undercuts jobs is absolutely a frivolous idea to present on this House floor. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush), the ranking member of the subcommittee. Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, over the past couple of months, I have worked tirelessly to find a reasonable compromise with the sponsor of H.R. 702, my friend and colleague from Texas (Mr. Barton), that would allow me and others with similarly situated constituencies to support this bill. Although I share the concerns of many of my Democratic colleagues on how this bill might impact the environment and climate change, I have always stated that I believe in the all-of-the-above energy approach that balances environmental concerns and economic opportunities. Mr. Chairman, yesterday in the Rules Committee I advocated for an open rule process that would have allowed Democrats to offer amendments that would reflect priorities and concerns of the minority party. In fact, Mr. Chairman, I myself submitted an amendment that would have expanded access for minority- and women-owned firms to more fully participate in the energy supply chain, which we know will be greatly enhanced if the export ban is lifted. Mr. Chairman, although my friends in the environmental community wouldn't agree, in my district, we say: Oil is not just a commodity. Oil is indeed an economic opportunity. {time} 1030 Mr. Chairman, my most pressing concern is making sure up front and from the beginning that minority firms would be part of the pipeline economy and would directly benefit from vendor and contracting opportunities that lifting this ban would create. Instead, Mr. Chairman, despite positive rhetoric from members of the majority party, a closed rule was adopted. While my comprehensive amendment was not allowed, Members are asked to vote now on Trojan horse amendments that would do nothing to actually benefit minorities and women as my far-reaching amendment was designed to do. Rather than shielding the majority party from charges of creating a multibillion-dollar boondoggle for the energy industry, today there is not much in this bill as currently drafted that I can point to as really benefiting all segments of the American population. As I have said time and time and time again, cut us in or cut it out. Cut us in or cut it out. Cut women in or cut it out. Cut the minorities in or cut it out. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, we will put the gentleman from Illinois down as undecided on the bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Flores), who is the chairman of the Republican Study Committee and a member of the committee. He is from the home of the Fightin' Texas Aggies. Mr. FLORES. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 702. H.R. 702 results in five key benefits: Number one, it benefits the American consumer with resulting overall lower energy prices. This particularly benefits lower-income and lower- middle-income Americans, providing greater financial security for these hardworking families. Number two, it benefits the American producer and allows them to further reinvest in our domestic energy infrastructure, furthering our energy security and American jobs. Number three, it benefits our geopolitical standing and strengthens ties with our global friends and allies, and it hurts those countries like Russia, Iran, and Venezuela who are opposed to American interests around the world. Number four, it benefits the downstream refining community, as lower prices will stimulate volume demand for refined products. This volume gives them more financial capital to hire skilled American workers and to reinvest in their operation. Number five, it strengthens our national defense by enhancing the Maritime Security Program, which supports a robust Merchant Marine for use by our military during times of international crisis. These are five critical reasons why everybody wins after we lift the ban. The President has threatened to veto this commonsense bill, and hardworking American families all over this country should ask: Mr. President, why are you putting the interests of Iranian terrorists ahead of the interests of hardworking American families? Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge my colleagues to reject the Amash amendment and to support H.R. 702. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Eshoo). Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chairman, I thank our ranking member. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this legislation for several reasons. First, except in very narrow circumstances, the bill does not allow any limits--not any limits--on exports of domestic oil regardless of potential threats to our national security, and that is our top responsibility as Members--our national security. For decades there has been a bipartisan commitment in Congress and several administrations to energy independence and reducing our reliance on foreign oil. Given the continued dependence of our economy and our military on oil, energy independence remains critical to our national defense. But with little consideration of any national security implications, this bill allows unlimited exports of a critical strategic resource. Mr. Chairman, the United States still imports 26 percent of the oil we consume and remains the world's top importer. Every barrel exported under this bill would have to be replaced by a barrel imported from elsewhere, leaving us more reliant on foreign countries. The bill allows the President to limit exports only if he declares an emergency under the National Emergencies Act or the International Emergency Economic Powers Act or if he is directed by the International Energy Agency to respond to an international supply crisis. Outside of these narrow circumstances, the bill permits no restrictions on exports of crude oil. This means strategic considerations such as decreasing our reliance on imports from unfriendly regimes can play no part in deciding whether to allow exports. I don't think that is a good deal at all. The bill also will have drastic impacts on the U.S. shipbuilding industry, tanker fleet, and refineries, all of which are critical to our national defense. Congress has recognized for nearly 100 years that it benefits our national security to maintain a robust domestic shipbuilding industry and commercial shipping fleet. For example, crude exports from Alaska which were legalized in 1995 must be carried on U.S.-flagged vessels crewed by Americans. This bill contains no requirement that exports be carried on U.S.-flagged tankers. Under current law, the President can allow exports of crude oil if he finds they are in the national interest. This bill would allow unlimited exports regardless of whether they are in the national security interests of the United [[Page H6945]] States or not. I think that this is a slippery slope. Commander Kirk Lippold, the retired Navy Captain of the USS Cole, testified before Congress earlier this year. The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman. Ms. ESHOO. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Chairman, the retired Navy Captain of the USS Cole said the following: ``The national security implications of changing the existing policy regulating the export of crude oil are rife with unknown and probably unintended consequences that must be fully considered and addressed.'' I agree with Commander Lippold. This bill largely ignores those important national security concerns, and it is why I urge my colleagues to oppose it. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), from the energy capital of the world, Houston, Texas. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, the administration has worked very hard to make sure the export ban on crude oil from Iran is lifted. But the administration has threatened to veto this bill that would lift the crude oil sanction ban on American oil. That doesn't make any sense to me--help the Iranians sell their excess crude oil abroad, but prevent America from selling our excess crude oil abroad. That is nutty. Why does the President prefer the Iranians over Americans? It doesn't make any sense. The President should at least give us the same deal that he gave the Iranians: lift sanctions on them, lift the sanctions on American oil. We have a surplus. We need to sell it. ``Use all we can and sell the rest.'' That is the motto. And that is just the way it is. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I believe we are lopsided on the time a little again, so I would like to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Could we ask what the time differential is, Mr. Chairman? The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 20\1/2\ minutes remaining. The gentleman from New Jersey has 14 minutes remaining. Mr. BARTON. At this time, Mr. Chairman, I am very honored to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton). Chairman Upton is the distinguished chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee from the great State of Michigan and my good friend. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I really thank Chairman Emeritus Barton for doing a really significant, good job on getting this bill bipartisan support and working so hard over the last 18 months or so, and both in the last Congress and this Congress, to get this bill ready for the floor today. Mr. Chairman, much has changed since the ban on crude oil was put in place in 1975. At that time, Congress and President Ford were responding to the Arab oil embargo crisis in an effort to protect this country from the unwanted impacts of the unstable global crude oil market. But we got good news today. Times have changed, and one of the biggest threats to the American energy boom today is not an international actor but, rather, our own ban on oil exports. Lifting the crude oil export ban is a win for our economy, yes, it is. Study after study has shown that lifting the ban would actually lower prices at the pump, create thousands of jobs, generate hundreds of millions of dollars in economic benefits, and strengthen our geopolitical influence across the globe. It will actually also reduce the deficit by more than $1 billion with additional oil royalties. These are real benefits that will be felt not only in southwest Michigan, my district, but across the country; yet, somehow, this administration does not support this thoughtful solution. Let's look at the benefits. According to the nonpartisan GAO, lifting the ban could lower prices by 1.5 to 13 cents a gallon, real savings that add up for every family's budget. Some estimates suggest that it could support the creation of an average of 394,000 jobs. Additionally, the bill before us would boost royalty payments, as I indicated, from Federal oil and gas leases. Collectively, all of these gains provide the making of a success story that would greatly benefit our economy at a time of great uncertainty. This administration often likes to say that they are for an all-of- the-above energy policy, but the rhetoric, indeed, falls well short of reality. It doesn't make much sense that the White House is gung ho to lift the export ban in Iran, but when it comes to this country, the answer is ``no.'' The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman. Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, this bipartisan bill would strengthen our hand in foreign diplomacy at a time when America has lost its standing on the global stage. By exporting our excess crude oil, we can help our allies seeking a safe and secure supply of energy. Instead of being beholden to OPEC and Russia for their energy needs, they can instead rely on their friends, the United States of America. Creating jobs, keeping energy affordable, boosting energy production, and improving our energy security--that is what this bill does. I would urge my colleagues to support the Barton bill in a vote later on this morning. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps). Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 702. Not only does this bill incentivize more oil development while ignoring its impact on our climate, it also essentially guarantees billions more in profits for oil companies while doing virtually nothing to help consumers. There are many more important issues that we should be spending our time on to actually help American families, like raising the minimum wage and making college more affordable, but instead we are passing a bill to help oil companies make more money. Additionally, section 3 of the bill prohibits any Federal official from taking any action that could potentially restrict the export of oil. This broad language could seriously undermine critical health and safety responsibilities of the Federal Government. For example, under current law, the Secretary of Transportation has the authority to shut down a crude oil pipeline if it poses a threat to life, property, or the environment. But what if an oil pipeline leading to an export terminal were in imminent danger of rupturing? Would the Secretary still have the authority to shut down that line, or would that action be considered a restriction on exporting crude oil under this bill? Mr. Chairman, these are not hypothetical questions. This authority was recently used in my district to shut down line 901 of the Plains All American Pipeline when it ruptured last May. Since line 901 is the only way for the nearby offshore oil platforms to transport their oil to refineries, these platforms have had to shut down production entirely. Nearly 5 months after the spill, line 901 remains shut down, and there is no indication that it will be restarted in the near future. It is not hard to imagine a similar event happening again, and the Secretary's authority to protect public health, property, and the environment during such an event must not be undermined. {time} 1045 Yet, if this bill were law, the Secretary's authority could be preempted entirely by section 3 of this bill. In other words, the bill could create a scenario in which the perceived right of oil companies to export their oil supersedes our very real responsibility to protect public health and safety. The American people deserve better. This is a fatally flawed bill and sets the wrong priorities. I urge its defeat. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), from District One of the great Pelican State, the distinguished Republican whip. Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my friend from Texas for yielding, but also for his leadership in bringing this bill to the floor and building a strong bipartisan coalition to finally lift the ban on oil exports. Mr. Chairman, this is a relic of the 1970s that doesn't fit with today's [[Page H6946]] world economy, but it also doesn't fit with the revolution that has happened in American energy because of American technology. We have an abundance of natural resources now and an abundance of oil. We literally could be the Saudi Arabia of energy. Yet, there is a law that is on the books that bans the ability of the United States to export its own oil. There is no other nation in the world that has that limitation on their ability to sell that natural resource. Mr. Chairman, at a time when the President is actually supporting this horrible deal with Iran that, among other things, allows Iran to export their oil to the world markets, the President at the same time is saying he opposes this bill that allows America to export its oil. What is at stake, Mr. Chairman? What is at stake under this bill, if this bill passes, is it will create over 800,000 American jobs, good American jobs, here at home. If this bill passes, Mr. Chairman, we can actually create over $800 million to reduce the deficit, deficit reduction, just by passing this bill. What is also at stake, Mr. Chairman, if we pass this bill? We can help our allies around the world who don't want to have to get their oil from countries like Russia, where Vladimir Putin is using energy as a weapon against our friends. They can now get that energy from us. Creating American jobs along the way, everything about this says yes. It is time to lift this relic of the 1970s. Let's finally allow American oil to be exported on world markets when we have such an abundance and we have the ability to create hundreds of thousands of new American jobs along the way. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor). Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I thank Ranking Member Pallone for yielding the time. I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 702. The bill is an irresponsible giveaway to Big Oil at the expense of America's national security, at the expense of American consumers, and our longstanding policy of working towards energy independence. Now, our current policy is not a ban. You can call it a ban, but it is not a ban. It allows and promotes oil exports to strategically important allies, to places in the national interest. It is a smart policy. But now Big Oil wants free rein to ship America's natural resources to countries not in our national interest. This bill will eviscerate our thoughtful policy. Despite assertions that the oil will go to allies in Europe and elsewhere, that is not supported by the facts. Who is most likely to benefit? Experts say China. The Energy Information Administration projects that China's oil consumption will double over the next 2 decades. China has been very aggressive all across the globe in exploiting and locking down natural resources. They have gone to Africa. They have gone to South America. While we have been fighting battles in Afghanistan, they have been locking down contracts for natural resources in Afghanistan. At the same time that America is dealing with Chinese cyber espionage and their geopolitical confrontations with our allies and the U.S., why would we help China gain a strategic foothold on America's natural resources? I would think that America's national security interests would compel you to defeat this bill. You should also vote this bill down and side with American consumers instead and American jobs. America is still heavily dependent on imports of crude oil. We still import 25 percent today. Any claims that sending American oil overseas would help consumers in America is entirely unsupported, no matter how many times they say it. Instead, what the studies show is that exporting American oil would feed the uncertainty of oil markets and likely increase costs to American consumers. Back home in Tampa right now you can go to the gas station and fill up your tank at about $1.99 per gallon. So it defies logic to say that changing this policy that is working for America right now would really lower the price. I don't think so. American jobs are also very likely to take a hit if this bill becomes law. Why? Because of the important jobs in the refining industry, the shipping industry. Those are American jobs. Side with the American jobs. This bill is very poor public policy. Exports will be determined only by Big Oil to serve the interests of Big Oil, ceding complete control of this strategic national asset. The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. PALLONE. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds. Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Just to close, Mr. Chairman, the cost to U.S. consumers, our policy of energy independence, our national security interests compel a ``no'' vote on this bill. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Cincinnati, the Buckeye State of Ohio (Mr. Chabot). Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Chairman, I have the honor of leading the House Small Business Committee. A few months back we held a hearing on this very topic. We heard from small businesses about how this ban is holding them back. That is the untold story of this. This ban is hurting small businesses all across this country. America is now the largest producer of oil and gas in the world. Lifting this decades-old ban is an opportunity to jump-start the economy. It would help 1 million Americans find work. It would increase the GDP. It would narrow the trade deficit, attract new capital to the U.S., and stabilize the global energy supply. If America is going to lead the world in the 21st century, let's not keep one hand tied behind our back. Let's replace outdated energy policies with ones that are forward-thinking, ones that will create new jobs in a new American century. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. David Scott). Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentleman, this bill is about two things. It is about jobs and it is about national security. It will give us an opportunity to get Congress to join in with my good friend from North Dakota, Kevin Cramer, and Brad Ashford from Nebraska, because this is about jobs and nobody needs jobs more than African Americans. The hardest hit on unemployment is African American males. This allows us to be a part of being able to get language in that will help African American males get the kind of apprenticeship training with the Teamsters, with the AFL-CIO, with the operating engineers, all of those unions and contractors who are rebuilding this infrastructure for this oil. Now, on national security, make no mistake about it, ladies and gentlemen. What do you think Russia is doing over in the Middle East? They want dominance over energy in the world, and he who controls the energy in the world controls the world. That is why they want to prop up Syria, because that is the seaport to get it out of the Middle East. Stand up for jobs for the American people and protect the world from Russia. Vote to lift the ban on the oil exports. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I just want to say ``amen'' to what the gentleman from Georgia just said. Mr. Chairman, what time is remaining on each side? The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 15 minutes remaining. The gentleman from New Jersey has 7\1/2\ minutes remaining. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the entire delegation from the great State of North Dakota (Mr. Cramer), the original cosponsor of the bill. Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman. I have often said I don't know why it takes 36 Texans to do one person's job. I have to tell you, I was prepared to give a great speech and then I listened to my friend from Georgia and, quite honestly, I feel inadequate to the task. Because you stated it so eloquently and so beautifully, and I am committed to exactly what you talked about. So maybe what I will try to do instead in my remaining seconds is remind us of the context that it was 72 [[Page H6947]] years ago this week that the Yom Kippur War broke out that led to U.S. aid to Israel, which led to a 5 percent reduction out of OPEC of oil, which led to the very issue we are talking about today, that this historical context in a national security context is not irrelevant. Let's not, I would say, let history repeat itself, but let's use the peaceful tools of energy development while creating jobs in America replace the weapons of war in Europe and in the Middle East. Let's use our influence for good by selling this American-made product that is produced by American workers, and let's do it in a bipartisan fashion today. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan), on behalf of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar). Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman. I am normally on the opposite side of the gentleman on the congressional baseball team and normally with Congressman Doyle. So I hope we can win this one against Congressman Mike Doyle. So I thank the gentleman for the opportunity. Two or three points I would like to make, Mr. Chairman. One, in Ohio, lifting this ban means 16,000 jobs in Ohio, almost $3 billion in investment. Our friends, the operating engineers and the laborers who are going to do that work, are supportive of this bill. I know we have some issues with the refineries, and I think we need to continue to work on that and see if we can fix that issue. We have a number of studies that say the savings to the American consumer will be anywhere from 2 cents a gallon all the way up to 12 cents a gallon. Colombia University, Brookings, Aspen, Resources for the Future, all are saying this is going to reduce the cost of gas, which is a direct benefit for our consumers and our constituents who need it as we see this huge economic squeeze for the middle class. Lastly, I have been sitting on the Defense Appropriations Committee now for a number of years, and this issue here can directly benefit our ability to deal with what is happening in the Middle East. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BARTON. I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Ohio on the understanding that he will not play his best game against us next summer. Mr. RYAN of Ohio. I yield back. No. I am just kidding. I also would also like to say, sitting on the Defense Appropriations Committee, we sit in these classified briefings and we see what is happening with Russia, we see what Putin is doing, we see what is happening in the Middle East, the Ukraine. We need to export this oil. We need to export our natural gas. We need to have a bigger footprint in the world so that we can make sure that our allies have access to consistent energy flows coming here from the United States and creating jobs here in the United States. Michele Flournoy, CEO and Founder of the Center for New American Security, former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy under President Obama says: By lifting the ban on U.S. exports of crude oil, U.S. policymakers have an extraordinary opportunity to enhance not only our economic vitality, but also our national security. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Peterson). Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman. I support removing restrictions on the export of crude oil from the United States. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of H.R. 702. Current export laws are outdated, as we have heard. Since these laws were last visited nearly 40 years ago, U.S. oil production has increased significantly and the United States is now the largest producer of oil and gas. Studies have shown that lifting the current ban on crude oil exports would create jobs, many in the rural areas. We in our part of the world have seen the benefits that domestic drilling can provide by looking at our neighboring State of North Dakota. We need to do everything we can to support the use and production of domestic energy. H.R. 702 is an important part of that. Following this bill's approval, I hope all Members of Congress will continue to support an all-of-the-above domestic energy production strategy by considering the national security and the economic development benefits of not just oil production, but of biofuel production and related products. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support H.R. 702. {time} 1100 Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Sugar Land, Texas (Mr. Olson), a member of the committee and a sponsor of the bill. Mr. OLSON. Mr. Chair, this picture shows why we have to end this ban on crude exports. In October 1973, OPEC cut us off. We were getting 1.2 million barrels per day from OPEC, and that dropped down to a scant 19,000. Gas prices doubled. If you had to gas your lawn mower, you had to get in line behind cars. Because of American innovation, that world is gone. We are now awash in American crude oil. OPEC's days of dominance are over; but we can't deliver a knockout blow until we end the ban on American crude exports, which we will do in a few short minutes. When that happens, American families will have lower prices at the pump. Thug oil nations like Venezuela, Russia, and Iran will lose bite. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BARTON. I yield the gentleman from Texas an additional 15 seconds. Mr. OLSON. Mr. Chair, we will create thousands and thousands and thousands of good-paying American jobs. I ask my colleagues vote today to end the ban on crude oil exports. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the great Buckeye State of Ohio (Mr. Stivers), a member of the Armed Services Committee. Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his extraordinary work on this bill. This bill is important for our national security. It is important for jobs. We need to end the oil export ban so that we can export oil that has been generated as part of this energy revolution in this country that is going to be great for jobs and help our national security partners around the world. Let's make the world safer. Let's give America more jobs. Let's end the oil export ban. Please support this bill today. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer). Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, this is ill-advised legislation. My friends on the other side of the aisle claim 800,000 jobs, a million jobs. They don't have any real defined ability to provide such an estimate. Actually, this is a number that is made up because, as some of the speakers have acknowledged, there will be offsetting job losses as a result of what is going to happen, for example, in the refining industry or what is going to happen in terms of some of the transport. But that is beside the point. We actually have a policy that is working. There will come a time, perhaps, when it makes sense in a strategic matter to make an adjustment. Right now, the President has the latitude to be able to help some of our strategic partners. He has that flexibility. We are awash in oil in this country, and to expect that somehow exporting more of it is going to make a dramatic impact at the pump here is a pipe dream. It won't. It might make a modest impact. What we could do is provide a benefit to the large oil companies as part of a larger package that would help everybody. We have expiring tax provisions, for instance, dealing with the production tax credit, dealing with wind and solar that actually create far more jobs than will be found in the refining and in the oil production. And these are good, family-wage jobs all across the country Let's put together a package that speaks to alternative energy continuity, that speaks to conservation, that speaks to a long-term strategy that is a win-win. I am absolutely confident that Mr. Pallone and Mr. Barton could sit down and deal with a [[Page H6948]] package that would have far more benefit for America. If you are going to hand out another goodie to the oil companies, let's have a more comprehensive approach that meets our comprehensive energy needs. This bill doesn't do it. Mr. BARTON. May I ask how much time remains, Mr. Chair? The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 10\1/2\ minutes remaining, and the gentleman from New Jersey has 4\1/2\ minutes remaining. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Costa) on behalf of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar). Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chair, as some of my colleagues have mentioned, the ban on crude oil exports is an outdated policy. It was 1975 that it was enacted. A lot has changed since 1975. I believe this bipartisan, commonsense solution is needed to develop a comprehensive effort to deal with our energy policy in America that deals with both our short-term and our long-term needs. I think we have to use all the tools in our energy toolbox, and I think this is part of that effort. New technologies have provided the United States with an abundance of crude oil that is only continuing in nature, combined with our renewables and our other energy sources. We need to understand that this is about stimulating our economy and creating jobs, and it also has a very important geopolitical influence on bad actors, like Russia and Iran, who use energy as a political weapon. I understand there are concerns by my colleagues about eliminating this ban and the negative impacts it will have. I have some concerns with small and midsized domestic refineries, which I have represented. The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the gentleman from California. Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chair, this is a work in progress. We obviously need to address a number of other issues with the Senate. I remind my colleagues, this is important. It is about jobs, the economy, and providing alternatives of energy to Russia and Iran, and that is why I support this legislation as we continue to work together in a bipartisan fashion. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from the Golden Gate State of California (Mr. Hunter), a distinguished subcommittee chairman of the Armed Services Committee. Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chair, I am voting for this bill overall. In California, we don't drill anymore, and we are cutting down on our refineries even, but this is important for the Nation. One big part of this bill is the Maritime Security Program. If you don't know it, over 90 percent of all the stuff that we transfer to Iraq, Afghanistan, anywhere where there are American troops--all of their gear, their tanks, their weapons, their ammo, everything, for the most part--is shipped on American-flag commercial vessels. Of the 50,000 cargo ships that travel the ocean every day, 79 of those are American-flag. That is it, 79 out of 50,000. Sixty of those are on call when America needs them to transfer our gear to our troops overseas. When I was a lieutenant in the Marine Corps, on my second tour in 2004, I drove down to the San Diego Port with my Marine battery, and we loaded up all the equipment that we would then fall in on in Iraq 2 months later. Without the Maritime Security Program plus-up that is in this bill, we would not be able to go fight wars. We would not be able to move our equipment. We would not be able to support our troops. This is a national security bill. It is not only national security because it is energy security, but it is national security because that is how we support our troops overseas is with the Maritime Security Program, which this bill pluses up. I just want to say thank you to the chairman and everybody who supports this. I would urge my colleagues to not just support energy security, but support national security. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson). Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I had planned to support this bill, as a matter of fact, as a cosponsor; but since I have been unable to remove myself from the cosponsorship, I wish to speak on the record regarding my opposition to this particular bill. While I believe that Congress should consider the potential for all energy sources to meet our Nation's current and future needs, I believe that this legislation lacks the proper safeguards and oversight for such a major change in our Nation's energy policy. The bill does not appropriately consider the implications of our national security, the economy, consumers, and, especially, the environment. Exporting crude oil does not increase demand for oil or definitively increase the number of U.S. jobs in the energy sector. On the contrary, many U.S. jobs that are downstream in the domestic refining process may be threatened. In addition, exporting oil to foreign countries for refining purposes would likely increase overall CO 2 emissions. The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chair, the bottom line is that we must consider many factors related to our energy portfolio before we lift any current restrictions. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 702. Since I am unable to remove myself as a cosponsor of the legislation, I would like to speak on the record regarding my opposition to this particular bill. While I believe that Congress should consider the potential for all energy sources to meet our nation's current and future needs, I believe that this legislation lacks the proper safeguards and oversight for such a major change in our nation's energy policy. The bill does not appropriately consider the implications for our national security, the economy, consumers, and especially the environment. Exporting crude oil does not increase demand for oil or definitively increase the number of U.S. jobs in the energy sector. On the contrary, many U.S. jobs that are downstream in the domestic refining process may be threatened. In addition, exporting oil to foreign countries for refining purposes will likely increase overall CO 2 emissions, thus amplifying the impacts of climate change. Facing the challenge of climate change requires us to be responsible and accountable for our own natural resources. This bill does not provide any recourse to mitigate or even examine these potential impacts, and thus ignores this responsibility entirely. It should be noted that the Obama Administration has made every effort to compromise by easing export restrictions where appropriate after careful review. The Commerce Department recently approved limited crude oil exchanges with Mexico. However, the President believes that unilaterally lifting the export ban is excessive, and I join him in his opposition. Lifting the crude oil ban for short-term gains with no accounting of the costs that will be incurred is ill-advised and short- sighted. The bottom line is that we must consider many factors related to our energy portfolio before we lift any current restrictions. Without serious deliberation and oversight of the potential environmental and economic impacts of such as significant shift in our national energy policy, I must urge my colleagues to vote no on this bill. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the Peach State of Georgia (Mr. Bishop) on behalf of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar). Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I come to the floor today to express my support of H.R. 702, much-needed legislation which will lift the arbitrary ban on the export of one of our country's most abundant natural resources: crude oil. The current ban on exports is a relic of a different time before we as a nation knew just how much crude oil we have stored in the earth across this country. We are entirely too dependent on foreign oil sources, particularly from countries who have no regard for the American economy. Today is different. In fact, from the period between 2000 and 2013, U.S. production of crude oil increased by nearly fourteenfold, from 250,000 barrels per day to 3.5 million. With this large amount of excess capacity, we can sell our oil to the global markets, which will bring U.S. crude prices in line with global prices, and global prices will go [[Page H6949]] down because of the increased supply. No less than 68 percent of consumers' cost of gasoline--and 57 percent for diesel fuel--come from the price of the source: crude oil. Numerous studies have shown that the increased global supply will lead to lower prices at the pump. Not only will consumers have more money to spend on school supplies, food, clothing, and other household staples, but the prices of these goods will go down because the cost to transport them from manufacturer to store will decrease. Possibly, more importantly, we have to consider the security implications of allowing the export of crude. We are in the position of showing the world that we can provide a stable source of energy to friendly countries around the globe. Our supplies will dilute the market share of unfriendly countries and weaken their grip on our democratic ally nations who have to depend on some of our unfriendly countries for their oil supplies. We can provide an alternative source to those who don't want to support our adversaries and their adversaries. So I thank my colleagues Mr. Cuellar and Mr. Barton for bringing forth this critically important legislation. I urge my colleagues in the House to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 702. Mr. PALLONE. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I only have two speakers, myself and Mr. Cuellar. I believe I have the right to close, so I would ask my friend from New Jersey how many speakers he still has. Mr. PALLONE. Just myself and Mr. Garamendi remain. Mr. BARTON. Well, at this time, I reserve the balance of my time. {time} 1115 Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time remains on my side? The CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey has 3\1/4\ minutes remaining. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi). Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, we have before us a very, very important issue. It is a national security issue. My good friend from San Diego spoke to one part of our Nation's security, and that is the ability of this Nation to move its interests around the world not just with airplanes, but with ships. Unfortunately, this is a very narrowly constructed piece of legislation that speaks to the interests of the petroleum industry and the many thousands of people who work there. We concede that. But this bill could also be a boon to another part of our Nation's security, and that is our maritime industry. Unfortunately, the bill does not do that. While it does deal with the Maritime Security Program--and that is good--it does not deal in full potential with what we can do, and that is to require that this strategic asset, oil, be shipped on American- built ships with American mariners. That is not in the bill. It should be. It could be. If it were, our shipyards and our mariners all around this Nation would have tens of thousands of jobs, and we would secure yet not only the interest of our petroleum industry but, also, the interest of our maritime industry as well as the shipyards upon which this Nation's national defense depends. Put it in the bill. Then let's see how many votes you can get. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar), my chief sponsor, the gentleman that represents south Texas and the Eagle Ford Shale. Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. Barton for the leadership he has provided on this bill. I rise in support of H.R. 702 that repeals the ban on crude oil. This ban reflects an America of yesterday. It is our job, as Members of Congress, that our laws reflect the America of tomorrow. If you look at why this is important, this ban hurts the economy and prevents the creation of jobs. This ban imposes an estimated $200 to $300 billion cost to the economy and discourages domestic, made-in- America crude oil production. By lifting the ban now, we will create 359,000 new jobs. How do I know? Because I represent the Eagle Ford and I have seen small-business people, men and women, that work very hard every single day to have this type of job. And I think we owe it to them and across the Nation. This ban also reduces the Federal direct spending by $1.4 billion, according to the CBO. So it also helps our deficit. This ban is something that we need to change, and we need to make sure that we lift this ban. What about gasoline prices? You heard Mr. Ryan. You heard other folks. According to the General Accounting Office, this will bring prices down from 1.5 cents to 13 cents. The CBO says the same thing: 5 cents to 10 cents. The administration's own agency, the Energy Information Administration, says it will bring it down one penny or remain. It doesn't go up. It goes down. This ban also doesn't allow us to use our powers in foreign policy. Why are we allowing Russia or Iran to dictate what happens in this world? This is why we need to make sure that we support the repealing of this ban. Now, who supports this? Mr. Barton, you know it is a bipartisan bill. Democrats and Republicans support this bill, but it is also supported by business, small-business owners, and by some of the labor organizations. We have talked to those labor organizations. Mr. Chairman, support H.R. 702, a bipartisan bill. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the remainder of my time. Mr. Chairman, let me point out that the administration, the President, has issued a SAP saying that he would veto this bill. This bill is going nowhere because of that veto and the potential for a veto. All this legislation does is to give a windfall of $30 billion in profits to the oil industry, no strings attached, no sacrifices required. The legislation is opposed by over 40 environmental groups: the United Steelworkers, the IBEW, the BlueGreen Alliance, and the Industrial Energy Consumers of America. Most importantly, Mr. Chairman, it is supported by the American public who, regardless of party, support investing in refineries at home rather than lifting crude export restrictions. In fact, around 70 percent of voters oppose allowing oil companies to export more U.S. oil. The Republican majority has spent the whole week doing little more than attacking women's health and assisting Big Oil for their big profits. It is time to come together in the name of energy and national security. In the name of common sense and economic good sense, I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have remaining? The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 3\3/4\ minutes remaining. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. (Mr. BARTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, we have had a very enlightening debate for the last hour. I would say 30 Members of Congress have stood up and spoken either in favor or opposition to the bill. I want it to be noted that a large number of my friends on the Democratic side have risen in support of the bill. I want to compliment Mr. Cuellar for his strong leadership in that area. This is a bipartisan bill. When we do our town hall meetings, Mr. Chairman, person after person stands up and says: Why can't you folks in Congress get along? Why don't you try to be positive? Why don't you try to do what is right for America? Why don't you work together on a bipartisan basis? Mr. Chairman, that is what this bill does. This is a bipartisan bill. We have a large number of Democratic cosponsors and a large number of Republicans. This bill will help all 50 States. As Mr. Bishop and Mr. Scott have stated on the Democratic side, it helps low income, it helps minorities, it helps women. It helps every sector of the economy, not just the oil industry, not just the roughnecks, not just the drillers. It helps truck drivers. It helps steelworkers. It helps refinery workers. It even helps computer programmers. You name it, it helps it. Some estimates are this bill, if enacted, would create as many as a million jobs. We know, for a fact, that the [[Page H6950]] collapse in oil prices in the last year and a half has cost the U.S. economy over 500,000 jobs, 750,000 jobs. Those are real people. That is not Big Oil, Mr. Chairman. That is people that get up every morning and kiss their wives, hop in their car, go to work and work hard 8, 10, 12 hours a day, get the bills at the end of the month and hope they have enough money to pay the bills. It is blue-collar America. It is not Big Oil. It is everybody in this country, Mr. Chairman. This bill is a market-based bill: willing buyer, willing seller. The U.S. has the largest oil reserves in the world. We have the capability to be number one in the world. Why on God's green Earth don't we use it? Why are we the only nation in the world that is restricted in one of the blessings that God has endowed our great Nation with? We could produce, if we wanted to, up to 20 million barrels a day. We are producing right now 9 million barrels a day. U.S. oil can go anywhere in the world if we allow it to. That is an economic asset. It is a military strategic asset. All we have to do is repeal an archaic law that was passed in 1975 when we couldn't export a barrel of oil if we wanted to. We were importing two-thirds of our oil. We have a bipartisan bill that helps everybody in America, that is in the economic interests of America, that is in the environmental interests of America, that is in the military strategic interests of America. Mr. Chairman, let's work together. Let's send this bill to the Senate with strong bipartisan support. God bless America. God bless this great country. Pass H.R. 702. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Washington, DC, October 5, 2015. Hon. Fred Upton, Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Upton: Thank you for consulting with the Foreign Affairs Committee on H.R. 702, a bill to adapt to changing crude oil market conditions, which was referred to us on February 4, 2015. I agreed that the Foreign Affairs Committee might be discharged from further action on this bill so that it could proceed expeditiously to the Floor, subject to the understanding that this waiver does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the future. I would request your support for the appointment of Foreign Affairs conferees during any House-Senate conference on this legislation. I respectfully ask that you place our letters on H.R. 702 into the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work with the Committee on Energy and Commerce as this measure moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, Edward R. Royce, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC, October 6, 2015. Hon. Edward R. Royce, Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Royce: Thank you for your assistance regarding H.R. 702, a bill to adapt to changing crude oil market conditions, which was referred to our respective committees on February 4, 2015. I appreciate your willingness to agree that the Foreign Affairs Committee might be discharged from further action on H.R. 702 so that it can proceed expeditiously to the floor, and I agree that this waiver does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition, I would support your request for the appointment of Foreign Affairs conferees during any House-Senate conference on this legislation. I will place our letters on H.R. 702 into the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill. Sincerely, Fred Upton, Chairman. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this legislation. Increased U.S. energy exports benefit our national security and foreign policy. The Administration has created an absurd situation. While they are lifting sanctions on Iranian crude oil, they are fighting to keep sanctions on American crude oil. It makes no sense. I am, however, concerned by language that would increase subsidy payments to U.S. shipping companies participating in the ``Maritime Security Program.'' By increasing our oil exports, as this legislation does, that's already a boon to U.S. shipping. So why the government subsidy? So I will support an amendment that is to be offered to strike this provision of the bill. But Mr. Chair, if this maritime subsidy is ultimately part of this legislation, the door is then open to offset it by eliminating yet another damaging subsidy: U.S. cargo preference for international food aid. Over the past three years, the Foreign Affairs Committee has led efforts to reform U.S. international food aid programs so we could reach more starving people in less time, and for less money. A stumbling block to this effort has been a requirement in U.S. law that U.S. food aid be shipped on U.S. vessels--even though many of them are foreign-owned. This requirement remains year-after-year despite the fact that the Defense Department has concluded that relieving a portion of our food aid budget from U.S. purchase and shipping requirements would have no effect on U.S. maritime security. If maintained in this bill, the proposed increase for ``Maritime Security Program'' payments literally ``sinks'' the arguments against food aid reform. One wasteful corporate subsidy is bad enough; a second that kills our ability to reform food aid and save lives would be beyond conscience, and something I am confident this body would wisely reject. Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 702, a bipartisan bill to lift the 40-year old, self-imposed, crude oil export ban. The United States is now among the top oil producing nations in the world. Lifting this export ban will bring us roaring back into the global oil markets at a time when market conditions are particularly competitive. Contrary to what some of my friends across the aisle may say, this bill would actually lower gas prices here at home. We live in a global economy, and participation in a global market leads to competitive pricing. The non-partisan Government Accountability Office--in addition to the world-renowned analytics firm, HIS--have both determined that enacting this bill will lower gas prices, create hundreds of thousands of jobs, and provide a much-needed boost our economy. With all these benefits, why would we continue to hold onto this export ban? The only reason it was imposed in the first place was in response to the Arab oil embargo. That was over 40 years ago. It is prudent to move past these decades-old issues, and instead focus on the issues we face today. Today, we are facing a dangerous nuclear deal with Iran--a deal of President Obama's making. And one component of this terrible deal is that sanctions will be lifted on Iran so that they will be able to access a much larger portion of the world oil market, yielding billions of dollars to their coffers. Why would we make a deal with Iran--a deal that allows them to export their oil so they can fund terrorism around the world--but still hold onto this self-imposed ban? Without this bill, the U.S. would be missing out on billions in direct revenue to the Treasury, not to mention the secondary revenue streams from improved economic conditions. Let's pass this bill to unleash economic growth. Let's pass this bill to create hundreds of thousands of much-needed jobs. Let's pass this bill to counterbalance the exports of Iran, Russia, and the OPEC nations. I urge my colleagues to pass this bipartisan bill. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss H.R. 702, a bill to ``Adapt to Changing Crude Oil Market Conditions.'' H.R. 702 repeals the law prohibiting the exports of crude oil that has been on the books for more than 40 years, a response to the Arab Oil Embargo led by OPEC in 1973 that sent oil prices soaring and inflicted substantial damage on the American economy. Let me express my appreciation to Chairman Emeritus Barton and Ranking Member Pallone for their leadership and commitment to American energy independence, economic growth, national security, and expanding opportunities and diversifying the energy sector workforce. I support H.R. 702 because it holds the promise of moving our country towards energy independence, create good-paying jobs, lowering gasoline prices, promoting our geopolitical interests, and strengthening our defense capabilities. But I strongly am ``pro-jobs,'' ``pro-growing economy,'' ``pro- sustainable environment and development,'' and for homeland and national security. That is why I carefully consider each energy legislative proposal brought to the floor on its individual merits and support them when they are sound, balanced, fair, and promote the national interest. As the Member of Congress from Houston, the energy capital of the nation, I have always been mindful of the importance and have strongly advocated for national energy policies [[Page H6951]] that will make our nation more energy independent, preserve and create jobs, and keep our nation's economy strong. The Eighteenth Congressional District, which I represent and is home to Shell Oil, ConocoPhillips, Chevron Phillips, BP Corporation of North America, Marathon Oil, Enterprise Products Partners (Oil and Gas Pipelines), and Halliburton (Oilfield Services), and many others. My constituents have a strong interest in policies that maintain or enhance the competitiveness of American petroleum energy business in the world oil markets. Mr. Chair, the world is very different than it was in 1973 when the ban on crude oil exports was adopted. And much of the change we see today is attributable to America's unconventional oil boom. U.S. crude production is now more than 11 million barrels per day according to the U.S. DOE's Energy Information Administration, up from 7 million barrel per day in 2008. And it is estimated that U.S. output will exceed 18 million barrels a day by 2040. Crude inventories are at an 80-year high, and imports have declined nearly 30 percent between 2005 and 2013. Mr. Chair, paradoxically, continuation of the crude oil export ban may pose one of the biggest threats to this U.S. production boom and to the economy. This is because increased production has led to a substantial decline in oil prices over the past year and the resulting decrease in revenues has forced U.S. producers in my district and elsewhere to slash investment and cancel projects. Since last autumn the industry has cut more than 125,000 jobs, including many in my district. I have met and know many of the employers and workers affected by industry job reductions. Lifting the crude oil export ban would offer American crude oil producers new markets for their product and would mean fewer layoffs. Studies by the highly respected Brookings Institution and other organizations suggest that the economic benefits to the nation of repealing the ban on crude oil exports would be substantial. Specifically, it is predicted that repeal of the crude oil export ban will: 1. generate over $1.4 billion in revenue to the federal treasury over the next 10 years from oil and gas leases, according to the Congressional Budget Office; 2. lower gasoline prices by 13 cents per gallon according to the Government Accountability Office; 3. support up to 964,000 additional American jobs; 4. allow the United States to help its allies, enhance its energy security, and weaken the influence and market power of OPEC and Russia; and 5. strengthen the 60-ship Maritime Security Fleet, assuring that United States flag ships and crews will be available to provide support to the military in defense of our national interests and our allies. The economic benefits projected to be derived from a repeal of the crude oil export ban are stunning in their magnitude: 1. 300,000 additional jobs by 2020; 2. $5.8 billion savings in fuel costs each year between 2015 and 2035; 3. $70 billion in additional investment in U.S. exploration, development, and production of crude oil between 2015 and 2020; 4. 500,000 barrels per day increase in domestic crude oil production in 2020; 5. $38 billion in additional economic activity in 2020; 6. $13.5 billion in additional federal, state, and local revenue in 2020; and a 7. $22 billion reduction in the U.S. trade deficit in 2020. It is estimated that in my own congressional district, lifting the ban would generate an additional 500 jobs and inject an additional $275 million into the local economy, resulting in an increase in government revenues in the amount of $227.7 million. Another positive impact of repealing the crude oil export ban is that the U.S. crude oil production would increase 1.2 million barrels per day average between 2016 and 2030. Additionally, manufacturing jobs are expected to increase by an average of 37,000 per year through 2025 and analysts predict that construction jobs will increase 217,000 in the peak year 2017, while related professional services jobs would grow by an average of 148,000 per year. Repeal of the crude oil export ban is expected to spur capital investment in machinery, exploration, and development by $7 billion in 2020. The gross domestic product would increase by nearly $73 billion in 2016 and by at least $134 billion in 2018. Total government revenues would increase by a combined $1.3 trillion between 2016 and 2030. The revenue generated translates to an expected average annual increase of $2,500 in disposable income per household, additional jobs for American workers, and lower gasoline prices for American consumers. As it relates to our geopolitical stance, Mr. Chair, lifting the crude export ban will enhance our national influence in international affairs because we will be stronger economically and more energy independent. This will enhance our ability to achieve our geopolitical objectives of maintaining peace and security across the globe which in turn furthers our national security interests. For all of these reasons, I support H.R. 702 and urge my colleagues to join me and also support Jackson Lee Amendments 9 and 10. The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired. Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5-minute rule. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Energy and Commerce, printed in the bill, it shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 114-29. That amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. The text of the amendment in the nature of the substitute is as follows: H.R. 702 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) The United States has enjoyed a renaissance in energy production, establishing the United States as the world's leading oil producer. (2) By authorizing crude oil exports, the Congress can spur domestic energy production, create and preserve jobs, help maintain and strengthen our independent shipping fleet that is essential to national defense, and generate State and Federal revenues. (3) An energy-secure United States that is a net exporter of energy has the potential to transform the security environment around the world, notably in Europe and the Middle East. (4) For our European allies and Israel, the presence of more United States oil in the market will offer more secure supply options, which will strengthen United States strategic alliances and help curtail the use of energy as a political weapon. (5) The 60-ship Maritime Security Fleet is a vital element of our military's strategic sealift and global response capability. It assures United States-flag ships and United States crews will be available to support the United States military when it needs to mobilize to protect our allies, and is the most prudent and economical solution to meet current and projected sealift requirements for the United States. (6) The Maritime Security Fleet program provides a labor base of skilled American mariners who are available to crew the United States Government-owned strategic sealift fleet, as well as the United States commercial fleet, in both peace and war. SEC. 2. REPEAL. Section 103 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6212) and the item relating thereto in the table of contents of that Act are repealed. SEC. 3. NATIONAL POLICY ON OIL EXPORT RESTRICTION. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, to promote the efficient exploration, production, storage, supply, marketing, pricing, and regulation of energy resources, including fossil fuels, no official of the Federal Government shall impose or enforce any restriction on the export of crude oil. SEC. 4. STUDY AND RECOMMENDATIONS. Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy shall conduct a study and transmit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate recommendations on the appropriate size, composition, and purpose of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. SEC. 5. SAVINGS CLAUSE. Nothing in this Act limits the authority of the President under the Constitution, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), or part B of title II of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6271 et seq.) to prohibit exports. SEC. 6. NATIONAL DEFENSE SEALIFT ENHANCEMENT. (a) Payments.--Section 53106(a)(1) of title 46, United States Code, is amended-- (1) in subparagraph (B), by striking the comma before ``for each''; (2) in subparagraph (C), by striking ``2016, 2017, and 2018;'' and inserting ``and 2016''; (3) by redesignating subparagraph (E) as subparagraph (G); and (4) by striking subparagraph (D) and inserting the following: ``(D) $4,999,950 for fiscal year 2017; ``(E) $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020; ``(F) $5,233,463 for fiscal year 2021; and''. (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--Section 53111 of title 46, United States Code, is amended-- (1) in paragraph (3), by striking ``2016, 2017, and 2018;'' and inserting ``and 2016''; (2) by redesignating paragraph (5) as paragraph (7); and (3) by striking paragraph (4) and inserting the following: [[Page H6952]] ``(4) $299,997,000 for fiscal year 2017; ``(5) $300,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020; ``(6) $314,007,780 for fiscal year 2021; and''. The CHAIR. No amendment to the amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be in order except those printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Each such amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the report, by a Member designated in the report, shall be considered read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question. Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Amash The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 2, lines 3 through 15, strike paragraphs (5) and (6). Page 3, line 18, through page 4, line 21, strike section 6. The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Amash) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Chairman, my amendment removes a new section of the bill added by the Committee on Rules that increases funding for the Maritime Security Program by $500 million. My amendment does not eliminate the program. It simply keeps it at its current authorization level. Just last week the House passed the conference report for the National Defense Authorization Act. This defense policy bill, negotiated at length between House and Senate conferees, increases the annual subsidy for Maritime Security Program participants from $3.1 million per vessel to $3.5 million per vessel, a 12.9 percent increase. The provision, added quietly by the Committee on Rules, circumvents regular order and increases funding even more. As amended, H.R. 702 boosts per-vessel payments to $5 million per year, increasing the subsidy by a whopping 42 percent. The proper place for a discussion on funding for the Maritime Security Program is in a defense bill like the NDAA, not as part of a bill that lifts a ban on crude oil exports. This spending increase is all the more reckless, given our more than $18 trillion national debt. According to the Congressional Budget Office, lifting the export ban will increase receipts from Federal oil and gas leases by $1.4 billion over the next 10 years. We should use those receipts to reduce the deficit. Mr. Chairman, there are two ways we should amend bills. The first way is to go through the normal committee process, by introducing amendments during a markup. Members have the opportunity to debate and vote on amendments in the committee of jurisdiction. We should respect the work committees do by not altering the bills they report before we even consider the legislation on the House floor. The second way is to offer an amendment when the bill comes up for debate on the House floor. This gives all Representatives the opportunity to participate in the debate and represent their constituents by voting on the measure. Unfortunately, the Committee on Rules changed this bill behind closed doors late last week. The Maritime Security Program is a defense-related program that has nothing to do with oil exports or energy production. This provision has no place in H.R. 702, and its eleventh-hour addition by the Committee on Rules is the latest example of our broken legislative process. Mr. Chairman, we must protect this institution and the legislative process. Adding an unrelated provision to this bill behind closed doors is no way to legislate. I urge all Members to vote ``yes'' on my amendment to remove this unrelated $500 million spending increase so we can consider H.R. 702 as reported by the Committee on Energy and Commerce. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I seek time in opposition. The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Dold). The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/4\ minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Forbes). Mr. FORBES. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support H.R. 702 but, more importantly, to oppose this amendment. First of all, I would tell the gentleman, this amendment was considered and this provision was considered in the NDAA, and we actually did mark it up. The second thing is this is vital to the national security of this country to maintain the private sector sealift capacity. Our top military commanders have called MSP a vital element of our military strategic sealift and global response capability, and it is worth noting that 90 percent of all U.S. military cargo moved from Iraq and Afghanistan has been by American-flagged, American-crewed commercial vessels enrolled in the MSP program. {time} 1130 If we were to adopt this amendment, it would basically cost us $13 billion to re-create this. The U.S. Transportation Command has estimated it would cost $52 billion. In other words, Mr. Chairman, it would take us between 42 years and 168 years to recoup our costs. Let's defeat this amendment and protect the Maritime Security Program. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is about process. I recognize the concerns of my colleague. This should be handled in the NDAA or in a defense bill. I urge all Members to support my amendment eliminating this $500 million increase in spending and reject the Rules Committee's eleventh- hour revision that has nothing to do with crude oil exports. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chairman, I join my friend, Mr. Forbes, in opposition to this amendment. This amendment would harm America's national security. Under the program that it seeks to eliminate, the Pentagon reserves capacity on roughly 60 U.S.-flagged commercial ships to ensure the supply and transport of American troops. It is a program that supports our private sector as well, requiring the Defense Department to contract private commercial ships rather than building their own. So there was not redundancy, but complementary ability. It is a program that enhances America's national security by ensuring that our military can depend on U.S.-flagged and crewed vessels instead of foreign ones. It is a program that supports important domestic maritime jobs. In my view, we ought to reject this amendment. This legislation is, obviously, controversial. I hope this amendment is not controversial and that it receives overwhelming bipartisan opposition. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green). Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I represent the Port of Houston, and maritime transportation is vital to our success. Last year, the United States imported $2.4 trillion and exported $1.6 trillion in cargo and goods. Much of that cargo came to the United States on foreign-built ships, under foreign flags, and without U.S. citizens on board. Our maritime industry has been the bedrock of our economy since our founding. More cargo moves through our waterways than any other mode of transportation. We need to protect our domestic maritime industry, and that includes men and women that work on these ships. I have worked with the maritime unions, including the Seafarers and the Marine Engineers, since my first days in Congress. I want to thank my colleagues for supporting our U.S.-flagged maritime unions. I oppose this amendment because I support any effort to keep these folks working. I would like to take a minute and acknowledge a recent incident in the Atlantic Ocean. The disappearance of the El Faro resulted in the loss of life. I [[Page H6953]] want to extend my prayers to the families. Working on these ships is tough and can be hazardous, as we learned last week. It is my hope that we can defeat this amendment and ensure our economic viability and national security by putting U.S. crews and U.S. flags on more ships. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter). Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, to the gentleman from Michigan's point, this is the process. I chair the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee. I am also the vice chairman of the Seapower Subcommittee in the Armed Services Committee. Mr. Forbes is the chairman of the subcommittee that handles this stuff. This went through the process. This is the process. This is how it is supposed to work. There are only--I will say again--79 U.S.-flagged commercial vessels on the ocean today. That is 79 out of about 50,000; 60 of those are used in times of war. It would cost us billions of dollars to create a fleet that sits there mothballing until we go to war and then we get to use it. This is how the system works. This is the process, and this is how we keep national security strong. Republicans and Democrats realize this is the process. It is the right way to do it, and it shores up the Maritime Security Program for a decade. That is 10 years that we don't have to worry about this, and it is paid for. The gentleman from Michigan would have a point if this were not paid for. It is totally paid for. This is the right vehicle for it, and I would urge all my colleagues to vote against the gentleman's amendment and support maritime security and national security. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to Amash amendment that would undermine our domestic maritime industry and its workers. The Pacific Northwest has a proud maritime tradition that supports quality jobs and keeps our economy moving. The Maritime Security Program ensures that we have the ships and mariners to support our local, regional, and national economy--to keep folks employed and get goods to market. Having worked in economic development for a decade I believe the MSP is the kind of program we ought to back, not completely scrap. Let's not turn our back on the hard-working men and women that are out on the sea. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Amash). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. Mr. AMASH. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan will be postponed. Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Delaney The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Mr. DELANEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 2, after line 15, insert the following: (7) The United States has reduced its oil consumption over the past decade, and increasing investment in clean energy technology and energy efficiency will lower energy prices, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and increase national security. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Delaney) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland. Mr. DELANEY. Mr. Chairman, recent data suggests that climate change is accelerating. As a result, the destabilizing effect it has on our environment is worsening. To my mind, this is a clear threat to American prosperity and global stability. Mr. Chairman, consider the fact that the Governor of the Bank of England in a speech recently said that he is very concerned that unless we respond to climate change, there will be a dramatic reduction in value of carbon assets, which will cause a financial crisis. As a country with the largest financial markets in the world, we should be concerned about that. Mr. Chairman, consider the fact that Citigroup recently put out a research report that said unless we deal with climate change, the effect on global GDP will be $44 trillion to the negative by 2050. That is twice the size of the U.S. economy. Mr. Chairman, consider the fact that the U.N. has estimated that unless we deal with climate change, 150 million people will be forced to be relocated by 2050; 20 million, alone, in Bangladesh. Put that in the context of the fact that in Syria we are seeing the effects of 7 million people being forced to be relocated. Again, Mr. Chairman, this is a clear threat to American prosperity, and the bad news is that our environment is worse. The good news is the technology is better for dealing with this problem. Consider the fact that, as we have doubled the installed base of solar energy in this country, we have reduced the cost of energy by 23 percent. It has happened over the last several cycles of doubling solar, and people expect it to continue. This is occurring because of good old-fashioned American innovation. And while I believe there should be policy prescriptions from the government that effectively cost and price carbon, at a minimum, Mr. Chairman, we should agree that by investing in clean energy technology, we will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we will lower energy costs for the American public, and we will increase national security. That is what the amendment that I have here today is designed to do. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment, but only in order to control the time. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. BARTON. Chairman Upton and I are prepared to accept the gentleman's amendment, but we do have some Republican speakers who would like to speak in favor of it. I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo). Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. First, Mr. Chairman, let me offer my support for the underlying bill, H.R. 702. Over the August district work period, I had the opportunity to visit an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico and see firsthand the safety regulations and enhancements that have been put in place by the industry in recent years. Two of the primary topics of discussion during our visit were safety and the environment. I was glad to learn the industry has put a lot of contingencies in place to make sure we can continue drilling for oil in a manner that is safe and responsible. I have joined my colleagues Mr. Delaney and Mr. Gibson in offering this simple amendment that would recognize our country is making progress in becoming more energy efficient; and that is better for the economy and the environment. It is also very important to note the other forms of energy that are benefiting our country's economy and its national security. Wind, solar, natural gas, and nuclear energy are all contributing greatly to our energy independence, and this amendment before us today acknowledges that we should continue to promote an all-of-the-above energy strategy for this 21st century. Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of this amendment. Mr. DELANEY. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the great city of Kinderhook, New York (Mr. Gibson). Mr. GIBSON. I thank the chairman for yielding and for his leadership. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. I am honored to be working with my colleagues John Delaney and Carlos Curbelo to offer this bipartisan amendment. This amendment adds another strategic dimension to this bill: support for [[Page H6954]] clean energy and energy efficiencies. On our way to energy independence, it is critical that we support research and development for clean energy technologies. In New York, we are doing a lot of this work supporting important programs like the SunShot program, with the ambitious goal of driving down the total cost of photovoltaics to 9 cents per kilowatt hour, which would allow it to compete with any other energy source and democratize energy, transforming the way we produce, convey, and consume energy. With improved technologies, we will also see more proliferation of wind power, hydroelectric power, and biomass energy complementing all other traditional energy sources, including crude oil, adding up to a stronger America. Mr. Chairman, this is a country that can do hard things. We have proven that time and again. With the proper focus and investment, we will dominate the clean energy world market. And when we do, we will drive down energy costs; we will grow our economy, strengthen our national security, and conserve our environment. I urge support of this amendment. Let's take a robust and holistic approach to energy independence. Mr. DELANEY. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleague and my friend from Texas for accepting this amendment. I want to thank my colleague from New York and my colleague from Florida for their support of their amendment and their insight into this issue. Again, I urge all my colleagues to support the amendment. It is very simple. It simply says that investing in basic research and investing in American innovation will, in fact, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which it has been proven to do; will, in fact, lower energy costs, which it has been proven to do; and will, in fact, increase national security in this great country. So, again, I want to I thank my colleagues for their support. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I accept the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Delaney). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Huffman The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 3, line 4, insert ``(a) Strategic Petroleum Reserve'' before ``Not later than''. Page 3, after line 10, insert the following: (b) Greenhouse Gas Emissions.--Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy shall conduct, and transmit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate the results of, a study on the net greenhouse gas emissions that will result from the repeal of the crude oil export ban under section 2. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer my amendment to H.R. 702. This is the only amendment that the majority would allow in order to help us understand the impacts of lifting the crude oil export ban on greenhouse gas emissions. Before the Rules Committee, Ranking Member Pallone and I offered two other amendments that would have more proactively studied the increase in greenhouse gas emissions caused by this bill. Instead, the majority only allowed this amendment, which requires that the Department of Energy do a report on the increasing greenhouse gas emissions caused by the lifting of the crude oil export ban, but still allows the ban to be lifted. {time} 1145 This is what the legislative process has come to, unfortunately, in this Chamber. Instead of analyzing full impacts before voting, the majority has adopted a ``pollute first, ask questions later'' approach. Repeal the restrictions on fossil fuel extraction and production, and then we will figure out the environmental impact later. Now, lifting this 40-year-old ban on exports could increase oil production by as much as 500,000 barrels a day. That is a significant increase that risks expanding production into sensitive areas off our coasts and our public lands. According to the Center for American Progress, this surge in production would result in an additional 515 million metric tons of carbon pollution each year. That is the equivalent of an additional 108 million passenger cars on the road or 135 coal-fired power plants put online. That is what this bill could do. That is why over 40 environmental groups are opposing it. Now, my Republican colleagues might dispute this study. It is the Center for American Progress. And so, when we hear studies from any group that is not funded by the fossil fuel industry, we typically hear them accused of being biased, left-leaning sources, and certainly they are welcome to make that argument. But doesn't that support the need for an established, nonpartisan source of assessments on the impacts to our environment for bills that this Congress considers? That is why today, Mr. Chairman, I am also introducing the Carbon Pollution Transparency Act of 2015. This is a bill that would require the CBO to estimate and report on the projected carbon footprint of each bill Congress considers. That way, we know before we vote how a bill would impact our climate and our environment. Members of Congress already rely on the fiscal impact estimates produced by the nonpartisan CBO to help us make good decisions, make up our minds. But we need to also take into account the environmental consequences of our votes. The American public has the right to know whether their Representatives in Washington are voting to help harm the environment, to worsen climate change, or whatever the impact may be. That is why my bill ensures that we have a fair judge, the CBO, for each bill that we consider on its environmental impact. But today we at least have an opportunity to require such a study as part of H.R. 702. It is not enough, but it is a step forward to fully understand the impacts of lifting the crude oil export ban and, potentially, the harm that would result to our environment. So I urge a ``yes'' vote on my amendment and a ``no'' vote on the underlying legislation. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in mild opposition, and I may change my mind, depending on what the gentleman says. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BARTON. I want to make a deal with the gentleman. We want to be open and transparent. We are the open, transparent Congress. We will accept your amendment if you voice vote it and at least consider voting for the bill. But if you are going to rollcall vote it and vote against the bill, then I will oppose it, and we will defeat you on the rollcall vote. So I am going to make you a deal. I am not saying you have to vote for the bill. I am just saying I want you to think nice thoughts about the bill and consider voting for the bill, and then we will accept it on a voice vote, but we don't want any rollcall votes. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is advised to direct his remarks to the Chair. Mr. BARTON. Well, I hope the Chair was listening. I yield to my friend from California, if I have time to yield, to see what his thoughts are. Mr. HUFFMAN. Through the Chair, I would say to my friend, I appreciate the offer, but I don't think there could be anything more transparent than going on record and voting on these. Mr. BARTON. So the gentleman is going to ask for a rollcall vote? Mr. HUFFMAN. I am going to ask for a rollcall vote. Mr. BARTON. Then, Mr. Chairman, I oppose the gentleman's amendment and ask every Member to vote against the amendment. Mr. Chairman, we are not violently opposed to this. It is a study. I am confident that this bill will on a net basis [[Page H6955]] reduce greenhouse gases because the oil that would must probably be exported is produced under the strictest environmental regulations in the world. It also happens to be the easiest oil to refine because it is light sweet, which means it doesn't have a high sulfur content. When you run it through the cracking process, because it is lighter, it tends to separate into the various refined products more easily. So the gentleman's amendment is benign in nature in the sense that, if we were to conduct the study, I think the results from the study would be positive. Mr. HUFFMAN. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. BARTON. I will be happy yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. HUFFMAN. To my esteemed colleague and coach of the baseball team, in the spirit of thinking good thoughts, if you will think good thoughts about considering the impacts to our environment and our climate, I will accept your previous offer to voice vote this amendment, and maybe all of this great good thought stuff will get us home faster. Mr. BARTON. Reclaiming my time, I commend the gentleman for his thoughtful understanding from Mr. Pallone. And, with that, we accept the gentleman's amendment. I'm going to ask everybody to vote for it on a voice vote. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mrs. Lawrence The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 3, line 4, insert ``(a) Strategic Petroleum Reserve Study.--'' before ``Not later than''. Page 3, after line 10, insert the following: (b) Crude Oil Export Study.-- (1) In general.--The Department of Commerce, in consultation with the Department of Energy, and other departments as appropriate, shall conduct a study of the State and national implications of lifting the crude oil export ban with respect to consumers and the economy. (2) Contents.--The study conducted under paragraph (1) shall include an analysis of-- (A) the economic impact that exporting crude oil will have on the economy of the United States; (B) the economic impact that exporting crude oil will have on consumers, taking into account impacts on energy prices; (C) the economic impact that exporting crude oil will have on domestic manufacturing, taking into account impacts on employment; and (D) the economic impact that exporting crude oil will have on the refining sector, taking into account impacts on employment. (3) Report to congress.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Bureau of Industry and Security shall submit to Congress a report containing the results of the study conducted under paragraph (1). The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Michigan. Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that would direct the Department of Commerce, in consultation with the Department of Energy and other departments, as needed, to conduct a study. This study would measure the impact of exporting millions of barrels of domestically produced crude oil on Americans and our economy. Let's be clear. Lifting the crude oil export ban benefits very few. Let's also be clear about who does not benefit: American consumers and the American economy. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle will make the case for lifting the ban on crude oil exports. They will cite reports by the U.S. Department of Energy, the Congressional Budget Office, the Government Accountability Office, and various other organizations to support their claims. Some of the benefits they will list include claims of an increase in crude oil production, additional investment in crude oil production, and an increase in employment along the energy supply chain. But there is a problem with these claims, that the U.S. crude oil is already at peak production. According to a report by the EIA, production reached 9.7 million barrels 1 day in April of 2015, the highest levels since 1971. In 2015, production is expected to average 9.2 million barrels a day. We still import 7 million barrels of oil a day. Let's find a way to keep domestically produced crude oil within our borders, which benefits our consumers and the economy in the U.S. For example, the domestic gas prices are at record low levels due to the surplus of crude oil. According to the U.S. Federal Highway Administration, Americans drove nearly 2 trillion miles during the first 7 months of 2015, contributing to the high gas consumption and setting a record level. Lifting the ban now on U.S. crude oil benefits will undoubtedly raise prices. For consumers, these increases will result in higher gas prices at the pump and higher heating costs for families in the winter. As all of you know, the manufacturing industry is the backbone of Michigan's economy. While the U.S. manufacturing industry has struggled in the past, it has been one of the bright spots in our economy since the recession and remains a vital part of America's economy, as well as our Nation's economy. Since 2010, over 700,000 manufacturing jobs that were lost during the recession have been recovered. One major reason for this resurgence of the manufacturing sector is low energy prices. Up to one-third of all energy used in the United States goes into the manufacturing sector. Rushing to lift the ban on crude oil now would only hurt the manufacturing industry and dent its growth. Let us find a way to keep domestically produced crude oil within our own boundaries and allow the consumers and the economy to reap the benefits of lower energy prices. Let us put together a comprehensive study of the impact of lifting the U.S. crude oil export ban on the consumers and our economy first, before we rush to export millions of barrels of domestically produced crude oil. For the benefit of all Americans, for the benefit of our economy, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in mild opposition, but I could become a supporter of the amendment under certain conditions. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, if the gentlewoman from Michigan is willing to accept the same deal that the gentleman from California just accepted, we will accept the amendment. We will vote for it on a voice vote, and we will move on down the road to catch my plane at 1:40 from Reagan National Airport. Does the gentlewoman agree to voice vote it? Mrs. LAWRENCE. To the Chair, considering all that is happening here, I really need good thoughts, and I want to be part of the process of expanding good thoughts in Congress. So I will accept, sir. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in enthusiastic support of the gentlewoman's amendment and ask that it be voted for on a voice vote. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Messer The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Page 3, line 15, strike ``or''. Page 3, line 17, after ``(42 U.S.C. 6271 et seq.)'' insert the following: ``, the Trading With the Enemy Act (50 U.S.C. App. 1 et seq.), or any other provision of law that imposes sanctions on a foreign person or foreign government (including any provision of law that prohibits or restricts United States persons from engaging in a transaction with a sanctioned person or government), including a foreign government that is designated as a state sponsor of terrorism,''. [[Page H6956]] The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana. Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chair, I want to thank my colleague and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton) for his leadership on this important bill, and I am hoping today to join the voice vote kumbaya, if possible. H.R. 702 is a commonsense legislation that repeals the outdated ban on crude oil exports. This ban was originally implemented when America was going through an energy crisis. I was very young then, but certainly remember the gas lines in the early 1970s. The truth is things are different today. America is one of the largest oil exporters, thanks to a boom in production all across our country. Gas prices are at historic lows, and refineries are near capacity. Yet, our laws do not reflect this new reality. Producers are still held captive to the domestic marketplace. It is long past time to modernize. This bill will pave the way for a new age of energy innovation in America. It will support and create thousands of U.S. jobs, good-paying jobs, and encourage the investment of millions of dollars into our economy. America now has opportunities that would have seemed unimaginable even a generation ago, potentially even a few years ago. We could now become a net exporter of energy. Think about that. And when we do, it will jump-start our economy, create thousands of good- paying jobs, and improve our national security and economic security as well. Now, Mr. Chair, I am offering a bipartisan amendment today that clarifies language in the bill to avoid creating any unintended consequences regarding terrorist enemies of our country. I want to thank my colleague from California (Mr. Lowenthal) for cosponsoring this amendment and Chairman Royce for working with us in crafting the amendment as well. While we should all want to see crude oil exports expanded, we do not want this bill to inadvertently help our enemies. My amendment very simply clarifies the bill's language to allow the administration to retain its ability to prohibit the export of crude oil to state sponsors of terrorism. I believe this amendment is consistent with the underlying goals of the bill. I encourage my colleagues to support its adoption. {time} 1200 Mr. BARTON. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. MESSER. I yield to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. BARTON. Chairman Upton and I strongly support the gentleman from Indiana's amendment. We commend him for offering it. We think it adds to the bill. Mr. MESSER. I thank the gentleman from Texas. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in mild opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. PALLONE. I support the amendment but would note that the best way to prevent our Nation's oil resources from falling into the hands of bad actors is to maintain the reasonable, time-tested controls on exports that are currently in place. If you are concerned about our oil falling into the wrong hands, then you should vote ``no'' on final passage of H.R. 702. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's comments. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana will be postponed. Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Messer The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: Add at the end the following: SEC. 7. PROHIBITION ON EXPORTS OF CRUDE OIL, REFINED PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, AND PETROCHEMICAL PRODUCTS TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN. Nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize the export of crude oil, refined petroleum products, and petrochemical products by or through any entity or person, wherever located, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to any entity or person located in, subject to the jurisdiction of, or sponsored by the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana. Mr. MESSER. Mr. Chair, again, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton) for his leadership on this important bill and reiterate my support for H.R. 702. This is commonsense legislation that repeals the outdated ban on crude oil exports. The U.S. is producing more oil today than ever before, and we could literally become a net exporter of energy, something that would have been unimaginable a generation ago and would have incredible results for our economy. The fact that we are the only advanced nation that prohibits the export of domestically produced oil holds us back. I believe very strongly that we should not empower our enemies unintentionally through this legislation, and this includes the Islamic Republic of Iran. My amendment today prohibits the export of crude oil, refined petroleum products, and petrochemical products to Iran. Obviously, Iran has oil. It has no need to import it from the United States. But my amendment goes beyond just crude oil. It ensures Iran will not inadvertently have access to other petroleum-based products produced in the U.S. Refined petroleum and petrochemical products are used to manufacture thousands of goods that we use every day. Things like plastics, asphalt, paints, and cell phones are manufactured in this way. It was only a few weeks ago in this very Chamber that we discussed the dangers of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the Iran nuclear deal. Despite being able to enrich uranium and self- police its nuclear facilities, Iran will receive sanctions relief to the tune of $150 billion. That is $150 billion pumped into a $400- billion-a-year national economy. $150 billion of that will, no doubt, be used by Iran to bankroll terrorist organizations, further destabilize the Middle East, and continue their work to wipe Israel off the map. Things should not be made easier for them. The intent of the underlying bill is not to aid and support Iran. It is to open up the U.S. energy sector, export oil, grow our economy, and create thousands of jobs. My amendment ensures that the intention of this bill is clear. I believe the amendment is consistent with the underlying goals of the bill, and I encourage my colleagues to support its adoption. Mr. BARTON. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. MESSER. I yield to the gentleman from Texas. Mr. BARTON. The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton), the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield), and myself support your amendment and ask that it be accepted. Mr. MESSER. I thank the gentleman. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, again, I rise in mild opposition to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana. However, I would point out that Iran has the fourth largest number of proven oil reserves in the world. In fact, supporters of this bill often state concern over the [[Page H6957]] market impact of increased Iranian exports on domestic producers. So while it is hard to understand why we need to worry about our crude oil going to a country that is a major net exporter of oil, I have no objection to adopting this amendment and making really sure Iran doesn't get any of our oil and petroleum products. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. MESSER. I appreciate the gentleman's comments. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer). The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Indiana will be postponed. Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Cuellar The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of the bill, add the following new section: SEC. 7. PARTNERSHIPS WITH MINORITY SERVING INSTITUTIONS. (a) In General.--The Department of Energy shall continue to develop and broaden partnerships with minority serving institutions, including Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI) and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in the areas of oil and gas exploration, production, midstream, and refining. (b) Public-private Partnerships.--The Department of Energy shall encourage public Private partnerships between the energy sector and minority serving institutions, including Hispanic Serving Institutions and Historically Black Colleges and Universities. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Chairman, I am here, of course, to talk about an amendment to H.R. 702, this important legislation before us that will lift this outdated ban on the export of oil, modernize the U.S. energy economy, and create U.S. jobs. The amendment that I bring forward is to help Minority-Serving Institutions grow the leaders of the future in the oil and gas industry. The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that Hispanics will account for 74 percent of the growth in the Nation's labor force from 2010 to 2020. This amendment ensures that our Minority-Serving Institutions, such as Hispanic-Serving Institutions and Historically Black Colleges and Universities, can create a competitive and able workforce in our oil and gas industry. This will ensure that our Nation can continue to compete in the global market far into the future. Hispanic-Serving Institutions are about 12 percent of the nonprofit colleges and universities, yet they enroll 59 percent of all Hispanic students. The other part of this amendment, Mr. Chairman, is that it also calls for the Department of Energy to encourage public-private partnerships between the energy sector and Minority-Serving Institutions. This is an amendment that I think will be good for all workers across the Nation. I ask all Members to vote in favor of this amendment and to support the underlying bill. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I do support the gentleman's amendment. I want to commend him for his leadership on this issue. I hope we will accept it on a voice vote. I see Mr. Rush. I am willing to yield to my good friend from Chicago (Mr. Rush) if he wishes to speak on it. I was told he might. Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the bill. Mr. BARTON. I yield for the 1-minute prayer, not the 5-minute sermon. Mr. RUSH. Mr. Chairman, I respectfully decline the time the gentleman was gracious to give. I really want my own time on the bill. The Acting CHAIR. The time has already been claimed. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush), which couldn't exceed 5 minutes because that is all I have. Mr. RUSH. I thank my friend for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I must say that I did not come here to Congress to shadowbox with the majority party over jobs and economic opportunities for the intergenerationally and chronically unemployed citizens of my district and similarly situated districts across the country. Mr. Chairman, my amendment, which was not allowed by the majority party, would have provided real solutions to real problems. My amendment would have put dollars in the pocketbooks of the unemployed minorities, the unemployed women, and the unemployed veterans of this Nation. Mr. Chairman, I must say, this amendment before us is like pouring perfume on an overused pigsty. It provides DOE--and I quote from the amendment, Mr. Chairman--it provides DOE with the authority to continue its ongoing work. In other words, it tells the Department of Energy: Do what you are already doing. Mr. Chairman, unlike the amendment I offered in the Rules Committee that was drafted with input and collaboration from the various stakeholders who would benefit most had it been adopted, there is no specific initiative, no program, and no objections in the Cuellar amendment. Mr. Chairman, the Rush amendment would have established--not encouraged, but established--partnerships between DOE, Commerce, the Small Business Administration, Minority Business Development Agency, industry, the National Minority Supplier Diversity Council, the Women's Business Enterprise Network Council, and minority chambers of commerce chapters across the Nation. The Rush amendment would have established programmatic commitments for diversity hiring for vendor and contracting opportunities within the supply chain through contractual obligations, incentives, and other means with a goal of no less than 10 percent participation by minority- owned firms by the year 2020. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would have created regional diversity supply chain specialty centers to develop strategies for minority business contracting and vendor opportunities, and to hold business development sessions in strategic locations where energy development exists or is expanding. The Rush amendment would have helped minority- and women-owned firms form consortiums and partnerships in order to better meet qualifications and capacities that industry is seeking. Mr. Chairman, the Rush amendment would have established a program to provide access to capital for loans, financing, and insurance assistance for minority- and women-owned businesses. Mr. Chairman, the Rush amendment would have established--not just encouraged, but established--public-private partnerships between minority-owned banks and private investors as well as provided grants to Minority-Serving Institutions to help recruit businesses for energy- related supply chain sector activity. Again, Mr. Chairman, I am not here to criticize my friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar). I am here to just bring out the differences between what an imaginary amendment would do and what a real amendment would do. Mr. BARTON. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the kind words of the gentleman from Illinois. I understand the amendment that he was trying to get in. Actually, I was trying to help try to get his amendment accepted, but it is up to the Rules Committee and the democracy there. This amendment is very simple. It is something that we have added in the [[Page H6958]] appropriation bill on different agencies. We all have voted for this in the appropriation bills time after time after time, and it is to help the Minority-Serving Institutions. I ask the gentleman from Texas and Members to please accept this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar). The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. The Chair understands that amendment No. 8 will not be offered. Amendment No. 9 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of the bill, add the following new section: SEC. 7. REPORT. Not later than 10 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Commerce shall jointly transmit to Congress a report that reviews the impact of lifting the oil export ban under this Act as it relates to promoting United States energy and national security. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas. {time} 1215 Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me thank Mr. Pallone and Mr. Barton for their courtesies and as well the Rules Committee. Let me first of all say there has been a lot of discussion on the floor of the House regarding this bill and different opinions. Might I add that this is an important and vigorous discussion. I think this is the best of what this Congress is all about. Mr. Chairman, I would like to take note of H.R. 702, which many of us know came about because of the gas prices in the 1970s. This bill simply repeals that portion of the legislation that responded to that crisis. What I like in the bill is, of course, we have in the bill that we, as a Congress, will get a report some 120 days after dealing with the maintenance and the strength of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That is a very important national security item. A savings clause indicates, of course, that the President has all of his powers in the light of crisis and other issues to implement any necessary changes or any necessary restrictions on this legislation. My amendment tracks giving more information. Not later than 10 years after the date of enactment of this act, the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Commerce shall jointly transmit to Congress a report that reviews the impact of lifting the oil import ban under this act as relates to promoting, supporting, and providing for the United States energy and national security policy. Our number one responsibility is the American people--I understand that--both environmentally, which reflects to their own energy resources, and certainly with national security. This amendment allows for that report to be on the front side of 10 years. It could be 2 years from now, 3 years from now, and the Congress can dictate that. U.S. crude production bottomed in 2008 at about 7 million barrels a day. It is now more than 11 million barrels a day, and it is now possible to go up to 18 million barrels a day in 2040 under the strictest environmental concerns. But right now in my district--right now in my district--they are laying off thousands of people because there is no work. So I would argue to my colleagues that this amendment provides the insight on what is going on. This bill could provide the GDP would rise by 550 billion to 1.8 trillion between 2015 and 2039. It is estimated in my own congressional job lifting the ban would generate an additional 500 hundred jobs, an additional 270 million in the local economy, and increase government revenues in 227 million. This 10-year period under that--by the way, it is up to 10 years--is giving long enough time to provide a probative, intelligent assessment of whether there is irreversible damage. Amendment No. 9 operates as a safety valve and reassures that those who may be skeptical of lifting the export ban get reasonable opportunities to oppose it or get the right information. The same thing with those who may support it. It gives us a basis of empirical data rigorously analyzed. Mr. Chairman, my amendment can be summed up as follows: For those who are confident in the future, my amendment offers vindication. For those who are skeptical of the new change, my amendment will provide the evidence they need to prove their case. I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I would rise in mild opposition, which could turn to support. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Houston for offering it. Is she willing to do this on a voice vote and consider voting for the bill if we accept it? Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. BARTON. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Is the gentleman rising to support the gentlewoman's amendment with great enthusiasm? Mr. BARTON. I will if you rise to voice vote on your amendment. I will make it a package deal. I will give you this amendment and the next amendment double enthusiasm if they are both voice votes and you actually really do vote for the bill or at least start thinking about it strongly. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. BARTON. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentleman surmise that amendments that are passed by voice vote are still strong amendments? Mr. BARTON. Oh, they are. Ms. JACKSON LEE. And included in the bill? Mr. BARTON. Yes, ma'am. Ms. JACKSON LEE. As opposed to being susceptible to being gotten rid of? Mr. BARTON. No. You have got my word. I will be on the conference committee if we have one. Your amendments will be in the conference report that goes to the President if we get that far. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I am always eager to work with my friends on this side of aisle, Mr. Pallone. I am always eager to work when we are moving forward. And so I would offer my amendment and offer it for a voice vote. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in, as I just said I would, double enthusiastic support of her amendment, but I am going to be looking on that board when it comes time to vote. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me just simply say my amendment answers many of the concerns that have been expressed on the floor of the House by giving empirical data, not 10 years and beyond, but in a period up to 10 years, to let us make further informative decisions to provide for the energy resources of the American people, the national resources, and, of course, being able to provide for the national security. With that, I ask for support of the Jackson Lee amendment. Mr. Chair, let me express my appreciation to Chairman Emeritus Barton and Ranking Member Pallone for their leadership and commitment to American energy independence and economic growth and security. I also wish to thank Chairman Sessions, Ranking Member Slaughter, and the members of the Rules Committee for making in order Jackson Lee Amendment Number 9. Mr. Chair, thank you for the opportunity to explain my amendment, which provides: Sec. 7. Report. Not later than 10 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Commerce shall jointly transmit to Congress a report that reviews the impact of lifting the oil export ban under this Act as it relates to promoting United States energy and national security. As the Member of Congress from Houston, the energy capital of the nation, I have always [[Page H6959]] been mindful of the importance and have strongly advocated for national energy policies that will make our nation more energy independent, preserve and create jobs, and keep our nation's economy strong. The Eighteenth Congressional District, which I am proud to represent is home to Shell Oil, ConocoPhillips, Chevron Phillips, BP Corporation of North America, Marathon Oil, Enterprise Products Partners (Oil and Gas Pipelines), and Halliburton (Oilfield Services), and many others. I am strongly ``pro-jobs,'' ``pro-growing economy,'' ``pro- sustainable environment and development,'' and for homeland and national security. Volatile energy prices threaten economic security for millions of middle class Americans and hits consumers hard; rising gas prices strain budgets for millions of American families. It is a familiar story, but in order to restore lasting security for middle class families we need a smart and reasonable plan for American energy, not false promises or quick fixes. That is why I carefully consider each energy legislative proposal brought to the floor on its individual merits and support them when they are sound, balanced, fair, and promote the national interest. So my constituents have a strong interest in policies that maintain or enhance the competitiveness of American petroleum energy business in the world oil markets. Where they fall short, I believe in working across the aisle to improve them by offering constructive amendments. H.R. 702 repeals the law prohibiting the exports of crude oil that has been on the books for more than 40 years, a response to the Arab Oil Embargo led by OPEC in 1973 that sent oil prices soaring and inflicted substantial damage on the American economy. But much has changed since 1973; America's unconventional oil boom changed everything. U.S. crude production bottomed in 2008 at about 7 million barrels per day; now it is now more than 11 million barrels per day and according to the U.S. DOE's Energy Information Administration, U.S. output is estimated to top 18 million barrels a day by 2040. Crude inventories are at an 80-year high, and imports have declined nearly 30% between 2005 and 2013. Mr. Chair, paradoxically, continuation of the crude oil export ban may pose one of the biggest threats to this U.S. production boom and to the economy. This is because increased production has led to a substantial decline in oil prices over the past year and the resulting decrease in revenues has forced U.S. producers in my district and elsewhere to slash investment and cancel projects. Since last autumn the industry has cut more than 125,000 jobs, including many in my district. I have met and know many of the employers and workers affected by industry job reductions. Mr. Chair, lifting the crude oil export ban would offer American crude oil producers new markets for their product and would mean fewer layoffs. Studies by the highly respected Brookings Institution and other organizations suggest that the economic benefits to the nation of repealing the ban on crude oil exports would be substantial: 1. GDP could rise by $550 billion to $1.8 trillion between 2015 and 2039; 2. U.S. oil production could rise by 1.3 million to 2.9 million barrels per day in 2020; 3. 300,000 additional jobs created by 2020; 4. $5.8 billion in estimated reduced consumer fuel costs each year between 2015 and 2035; 5. up to $70 billion in additional investment in U.S. exploration, development, and production of crude oil between 2015 and 2020; 6. $13.5 billion in additional federal, state, and local revenue in 2020; 7. $22 billion reduction in the U.S. trade deficit in 2020; and 8. 100,000 barrels per day increase in refinery throughout between 2015 and 2035. It is estimated that in my own congressional district, lifting the ban would generate an additional 500 jobs and inject an additional $275 million into the local economy, resulting in an increase in government revenues in the amount of $227.7 million. Admittedly, these are predictions, projections, and forecasts made on the basis of the best information currently available. We hope they are accurate but candor requires that we acknowledge that no one can say with certainty they will come to pass. That is why it is essential that at an appropriate juncture we review and assess the impact on the American petroleum industry, the national economy, and consumers. And that is the purpose of Jackson Lee Amendment #9, which mandates a comprehensive review of the impact of crude oil export ban repeal after a 10 year period. This 10 year time period is long enough to accumulate data sufficient and probative enough to assess the impact of H.R. 702, but not so long as to prevent irreversible damage if the evaluation does not approximate the expected benefits reveals unintended adverse consequences. In sum, Jackson Lee Amendment Number 9 will help ensure that the brave new world of unrestricted crude oil exports by American producers is more than a leap of faith. Rather, Jackson Lee Amendment Number 9 operates as a safety valve and reassures those who may be skeptical of lifting the export ban that reasonable opportunities will exist to make an informed evaluation of the effect of the ban's repeal on our economy and national security. And it is important to emphasize Mr. Chair, that this evaluation will be based on empirical data rigorously analyzed. In short, Mr. Chair, my amendment can be summed up as follows: for those who are confident of the future, my amendment offers vindication. For those who are skeptical that the new change will work, my amendment will provide the evidence they need to prove their case. And for those who believe that maintaining the status quo is intolerable, my amendment offers a way forward. I urge all members to support Jackson Lee Amendment Number 9. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee). The amendment was agreed to. Amendment No. 10 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 printed in part B of House Report 114-290. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of the bill, add the following new section: SEC. 7. REPORT TO CONGRESS. Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Commerce shall jointly transmit to Congress a report analyzing how lifting the ban on crude oil exports will help create opportunities for veterans and women in the United States, while promoting energy and national security. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I ask that my amendment be considered by my colleagues. Mr. Chairman, my amendment requires within 180 days of enactment the Secretaries of Energy and Commerce submit a report to Congress analyzing how lifting the ban on crude oil, in particular, on exports, will create opportunities for veterans and women. Mr. Chairman, just a few days ago I went to an initiative called Stand Down. I have gone a number of years. Most military persons will understand it is where you come and stand down from battle. In this instance, they were veterans, many of them homeless, many of them in great need. Obviously, social services, substance abuse services, and others were offered there. What I heard from these men who wore the uniform in dignity is they want jobs. Mr. Chairman, I believe that this legislation will provide a strong pro-jobs agenda growing the economy. As my previous amendment said, I do not take lightly the impact of lifting the ban; therefore, my previous amendment would provide the insight on whether or not this is a positive impact. I can tell you that there is a great need, as has been discussed earlier, about collaborating with historically Black colleges and Hispanic-serving colleges. I have worked on those issues and have certainly seen the leadership of Mr. Rush and Mr. Cuellar. But I will tell you that it is indicated that State shale development supports American jobs. Mr. Chairman, $107,000 is the average salary that is provided by the energy company in energy jobs, 1.7 million employment attributed to upstream, unconventional oil and natural gas. Women fill 40 percent of the vacancies in oil and gas. Mr. Chairman, I will insert this into the Record. [[Page H6960]] [Apr. 23, 2014] The Energy Revolution is Creating Career Opportunities for Women and Minorities (By Cheryl Jackson) Minorities are projected to fill an unprecedented number of jobs in the oil, natural gas and petrochemical industries-- increasing from one-quarter of total jobs in 2010 to one- third by 2030--according to a new IHS report sponsored by API. ``The oil and natural gas industry pays wages significantly higher than the national average and can provide tremendous career opportunities for women and minorities,'' said Jack Gerard, API President and CEO. ``To lower unemployment and shrink the income inequality gap without spending a dime of taxpayer money, we encourage President Obama to embrace this pro-development energy opportunity.'' Of up to 1.3 million new job opportunities in the oil, natural gas and petrochemical industries predicted by 2030, almost 408,000 positions--32 percent of the total--are projected to be held by African American and Hispanic workers, according to the report. Women are estimated to fill 185,000 of those jobs, and 63 percent of new job opportunities will be in blue collar professions. ``We have the natural resources and the technology to be a global energy superpower with all the economic and national security benefits that entails,'' Gerard said. ``Smart energy policy will create tremendous opportunity for hundreds of thousands of workers--from those with just a high school diploma and some post-secondary training to those with post- graduate degrees.'' ``As the study highlights job opportunities, it signals the tremendous need to prepare African Americans, Hispanics and Women to be ready to fill the workforce gap'', said Paula Jackson, president and CEO of the American Association of Blacks in Energy. ``These jobs in the oil and natural gas industry don't just put people to work, they help to transform communities.'' ``This powerful and important report is a road map for workforce development stakeholders to align the content of their training with a sense of urgency to adequately prepare people for energy jobs,'' said Jose L. Perez, chairman and CEO Of Hispanics In Energy. ``Energy job replacement and growth is a clear pathway for diverse communities to rise from poverty to middle-class, what a rare opportunity.'' Ms. JACKSON LEE. The government and the administration are working to pair up and find jobs for veterans. The unemployment rate for veterans we have seen has been a constant issue, and it is going down. But we need to provide them with other opportunities. They were higher unemployment, as we can see, than the regular workforce. So my amendment wants to ensure that, if we lift this ban, women and veterans will benefit. We know, of course, that we have been pushing our educational facilities to engage in STEM, but what we need now is a pipeline for qualified veterans and women looking for jobs right now. Mr. Chairman, I would ask my colleagues to support this Jackson Lee amendment. It causes us to focus on these vulnerable populations--women and veterans--to direct them into the industry. Might I say to my constituents, the energy companies that I represent, a long list of names that I will not name at this time, that we hope that they are focused as well on expanding opportunities in the energy industry for veterans, returning soldiers, if you will, women, and, of course, across-the-board minorities. This is an industry that is moving and growing, and the opportunities should move and grow as well. With that, Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment. The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. There was no objection. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Chairman, I only would like to say we support the amendment and we will honor the deal we just made on the prior amendment. I ask for a ``yes'' vote on a voice vote on the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Pallone. I hope that our colleagues have heard us to emphasize the creation of jobs along with the environment, national security, and the energy resources of America. Mr. Chair, again, let me express my appreciation to Chairman Emeritus Barton and Ranking Member Pallone for their leadership and commitment to American energy independence, economic growth, national security, and expanding opportunities and diversifying the energy sector workforce. Mr. Chair, thank you for the opportunity to explain my amendment, which provides: Sec. 7. Report. Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Commerce shall jointly transmit to Congress a report analyzing how lifting the ban on crude oil exports will help create opportunities for veterans and women in the United States, while promoting energy and national security. I also wish to thank Chairman Sessions, Ranking Member Slaughter, and the members of the Rules Committee for making in order Jackson Lee Amendment Number 10. As the Member of Congress from Houston, the energy capital of the nation, I have always been mindful of the importance and have strongly advocated for national energy policies that will make our nation more energy independent, preserve and create jobs, and keep our nation's economy strong. I strongly am ``pro-jobs,'' ``pro-growing economy,'' and ``pro- expanding economic opportunities for women, veterans, minorities, and small business!'' That is why I carefully consider each energy legislative proposal brought to the floor on its individual merits and support them when they are sound, balanced, promote the national interest, and expand economic opportunities for everyone, particularly for women, veterans, and members of underrepresented communities. My constituents have a strong interest in policies that maintain or enhance the competitiveness of American petroleum energy business in the world oil markets. Where they fall short, I believe in working across the aisle to improve them by offering constructive amendments. That is why I have offered Jackson Lee Amendment Number 10, which recognizes the fact that veterans, minorities, small businesses and women currently are significantly underrepresented in the oil and gas industries at all levels and severely underrepresented in the senior managerial, professional, board and ownership ranks. Jackson Lee Amendment Number 10 directs the Secretaries of Commerce and Energy to submit a report to Congress within 180 days assessing the beneficial impact, if any, that lifting the crude oil export ban holds for veterans and women. This report should shed light on any additional measures that should be taken to increase the participation of women and veterans in the petroleum industry as workers, executives, and entrepreneurs. Nationally, there were 1.2 million people employed in the oil and gas industry in 2010, only 17% of which are women. Our booming energy sector has been one of the great American success stories over the last decade, and remains a bright spot in our economy as it continues to fuel job creation. To continue this success and to ensure that opportunities and benefits are shared equitably, it is critical that we have a diverse energy workforce equipped with the skills, knowledge, and experiences needed to compete and win in the global economy. And there is no better place to look than from our pool of talented veterans and women? Women make up half our population and are increasing their presence in the STEM fields vital to success in the petroleum energy sector. Veterans not only have proved their mettle and leadership skills in defense of our country but also are among the most resourceful and resilient members of our society, possessing the mission-critical ethic necessary for success in the workplace. A pipeline of qualified veterans and women looking for employment could play a key role as the energy industry seeks qualified, motivated, and skilled workers and entrepreneurs. As a nation, we must remain committed to utilizing the talents of women and veterans if our nation is to meet the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities offered by a dynamic global energy market. Jackson Lee Amendment Number 10 helps us meet this challenge by providing critical information regarding the impact of lifting the crude oil export ban will have on creating opportunities for veterans and women. I urge all members to support Jackson Lee Amendment Number 10. Mr. Chairman, with that, I ask for support of the Jackson Lee amendment. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, last Thursday was a tragic day for the American maritime community and America. El Faro, an American flagship en route to Puerto Rico, was lost in Hurricane Joaquin and, with it, its 33 crew, including 28 Americans. In the hours after we learned El Faro was in trouble, the Coast Guard, DOD, and other government and private sector partners mobilized assets with search crews battling treacherous weather conditions in an attempt to find survivors; and we appreciate their efforts. Mr. Chair, today our thoughts and prayers are with the crewmembers' families and loved ones. I ask that the House observe a moment of silence to honor the brave men and women who served on the El Faro. The Acting CHAIR. Members will rise and observe a moment of silence.

The question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises. Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Dold) having assumed the chair, Mr. Hultgren, Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 702) to adapt to changing crude oil market conditions, and, pursuant to House Resolution 466, he reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered. Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment reported from the Committee of the Whole? If not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. The amendment was agreed to. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill. The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time. Motion to Recommit Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill? Mr. HUFFMAN. I am opposed in its current form. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to recommit. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. Huffman moves to recommit the bill H.R. 702 to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, with instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith, with the following amendment: Page 3, line 17, insert ``Nothing in this Act prevents the President or any other Federal official from enforcing Federal laws or regulations necessary to protect human health, the environment, or public safety, including the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.), the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Act of 1979 (Pub. L. 96-129), the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107-355), the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety Act of 2006 (Pub. L. 109-468), or the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (Pub. L. 112-90).'' after ``prohibit exports.''. Mr. BARTON (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I reserve the right to make a point of order against the bill that it is not germane. The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved. The Clerk will continue to read. The Clerk continued to read. Mr. HUFFMAN (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that we suspend the reading. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Parliamentary Inquiry Mr. BARTON. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. BARTON. If I make a point of order that the motion to recommit is not germane and it, in fact, is not germane, there is no vote. Is that correct? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will not respond to a hypothetical. A point of order has been reserved. Point of Order Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, I make a point of order that the motion to recommit is not germane. Oh, it is germane. I withdraw the point of order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The point of order and the reservation of the point of order is withdrawn. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, let me begin with the usual stipulations. This is the final amendment to the bill. It won't kill the bill or send it back to committee. When this is adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended, so there is no procedural reason to oppose this motion to recommit. Let's talk about the substance. Now, we have heard a lot of debate this morning about the need to give Big Oil--the most profitable industry in the history of the world--yet another advantage. For years, Americans have been told that we have to ``drill, baby, drill.'' The theory that we always hear is that we need to extract every barrel of oil from every acre of American soil to keep gas prices low and to provide ``energy security.'' But as soon as American gas prices started to drop, the curtain was raised, and the truth was revealed. The real reason for ``drill, baby, drill,'' surprise, surprise, was to give Big Oil the chance to maximize their profits on the world market. It is not enough that they have been able to game the Tax Code for a century with billions of dollars of tax breaks not available to other taxpayers or businesses. It is not enough that they continue to enjoy access to our public lands and waters for oil drilling, even though they are no longer paying into the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the longstanding law that expired at the beginning of this month. As a reminder, for the past 50 years, the Land and Water Conservation Fund was an agreement, a compact between the American people and Big Oil. It said that when we let oil and gas companies drill and profit from drilling in Federal waters, they have to dedicate a fraction of the profits, just a fraction, to protect our great outdoors for future generations. The deal is that they have to dedicate a fraction of those profits to protecting our great outdoors for future generations so that our grandchildren will be able to hike and hunt and fish in our parks and wildlife refuges. The Land and Water Conservation Fund was shamefully allowed to lapse at the beginning of this month, and the majority hasn't scheduled a single vote--or even a hearing--to get it back on the books. No, all of these concessions to the oil and gas industry are not enough for this House. With today's bill, the House majority is saying that American oil and gas companies can drill more, export more, and realize even greater profits, no matter the environmental consequences, no matter the consequences to health and safety. As presently written, the underlying bill, H.R. 702, would permanently ensure that no export restrictions for any reason could be implemented or enforced in the future. That is what this bill says. That is breathtaking in its devotion to the oil and gas industry's agenda. Now, my motion to recommit would ensure that the President and Federal [[Page H6964]] Government agencies charged with protecting human health, the environment, and public safety can continue to do their job that constituents rely on them to do. Specifically, with this amendment, we will ensure that bedrock health and safety laws, like the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act, that laws like that will not be cast aside in favor of Big Oil's desire to sell more crude overseas. Now, if you think about it, this is a very straightforward motion. I just want to ask my colleagues a question: Should crude oil exports trump the Safe Drinking Water Act? Should Big Oil profits trump the need for pipeline safety and pipeline inspection? Of course not. We need to protect safe drinking water. We need to ensure pipeline safety. So, my colleagues, I urge you to vote ``yes'' on this MTR to improve this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. BARTON. First of all, I want to thank the minority for giving us a one-page motion to recommit that I can actually read and understand. I have read it. I don't like it. It is not necessary. It is redundant. I oppose it. Please vote against it. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. There was no objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. Recorded Vote Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore.

it also prohibits any federal official from taking any action at any time if that action either restricts or enforces a restriction on the export of oil. the term ``restriction'' is undefined and potentially dangerous in scope. the bill would also override any other law that would impose any restriction by any federal official on exports. that means that the bill does nothing to preserve any environment or safety statutes or regulations, and it doesn't even preserve the defense production act, one of the most important tools any president has to ensure our national energy security in the face of a threat. let's be clear, mr. chairman. the president has already stated that he will veto this bill. further, any legislation of this nature is completely unnecessary since the president already has the authority to ease or even remove restrictions on crude oil exports, and the obama administration has taken major steps to exercise that authority by approving crude oil swaps with mexico and applications for the export of condensate. the bottom line, mr. chairman, is that it is imperative for congress to consider a host of factors before we lift the current restrictions and, certainly, if we are to completely dismantle our nation's ability to restrict oil exports, as proposed by h.r. 702. first, mr. chairman, there are consumer impacts, especially related to the price of crude oil and gasoline. a recent study found that changes to u.s. oil export policy will have little to no impact on the future price of oil. what we do know is that changes in our crude oil policy will lead to a significant payday for oil producers, with increases in annual profits approaching $30 billion by 2025. next, there are the impacts on our refinery capacity and associated jobs, well-paying middle class jobs that have grown over the past few years due to increased production. unrestricted exports of crude oil put those jobs at jeopardy and could mean exporting those jobs and losing out on critical investments in future refining capacity. and finally, mr. chairman, there are, of course, the environmental and climate impacts of lifting the export ban. energy policy is fundamentally linked to environmental policy. each is a facet of the other. increasing crude oil exports means increasing domestic production and its impacts on climate change, public health, worker safety, property owners, and protection of our drinking water supplies. as i have said before, this legislation eagerly embraces short-term profits and benefits without understanding or even considering the cost of such a major action. we simply can't afford to make that mistake. we should ensure we fully understand and consider the enduring consequences of our actions and choose the cleanest and most sustainable path forward. i don't believe, mr. chairman, that the potential impacts of h.r. 702 on national security, on the economy, on consumers, and on the environment can be considered acceptable. so, mr. chairman, increased crude exports certainly help oil companies. it is a bonanza for the oil companies, but without any guaranteed benefits for consumers. i urge my colleagues to join me and the president in saying ``no'' to this legislation. i reserve the balance of my time. parliamentary inquiries mr. barton. mr. chairman, i have a parliamentary inquiry. the chair. the gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. mr. barton. my understanding, in general debate, the majority, or proponents, have 30 minutes, and then the opponents have 30 minutes; is that correct? [[page h6942]] the chair. on this bill, yes, the chair and ranking minority member of the committee on energy and commerce each control 30 minutes. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from texas (mr. cuellar), the original democrat sponsor, have 6 minutes of the proponent's time to control as he sees fit. the chair. the chair cannot entertain a unanimous consent request to change the scheme for control of general debate. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i have an additional parliamentary inquiry. the chair. the gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. mr. barton. could the chair educate the illiterate member from texas on how i could give mr. cuellar time that he may control on his side? if i can't yield it unanimously, how can i do that? the chair. the gentleman from texas may yield from his own time to engage in debate, and may yield to members on the other side of the aisle. mr. barton. continuing the parliamentary inquiry, if i do that, can he reserve part of that time, or does he have to use it all in one slot? the chair. the other gentleman from texas would not control the time. mr. barton. he could not reserve any of it? the chair. correct. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. thompson). mr. thompson of pennsylvania. mr. chairman, i thank my colleague for the time to speak on this bill, which i wholeheartedly support, because ending this oil export ban will not only boost our economy, it will also improve our foreign policy. i also rise with hesitation to a proposed amendment that would remove a provision of this bill boosting payments to the 60 ships of our maritime security fleet. these ships are essential in transporting cargo to the men and women of our armed forces who are serving overseas in harm's way. as evidence of this, 90 percent of all cargo moved to iraq and afghanistan has been transported on these privately owned ships. as of right now, mr. chairman, the stipend provided by the government is too low to make this program viable to those who have stepped up to defend our nation against foreign threats. without this increase, it is likely that participants will drop out of the program. this, obviously, is a national security threat. it is estimated that for the government to replicate this program, it would cost more than $50 billion in taxpayer money. this programs saves money while enhancing our security, and i encourage my colleagues to avoid supporting this amendment, but voting ``yes'' to lift this outdated oil export ban. mr. pallone. mr. chairman, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from pennsylvania (mr. michael f. doyle). mr. michael f. doyle of pennsylvania. mr. chairman, i rise in strong opposition to this bill. i have been here in congress for 21 years, and during that time, we always hear talk about we want to be energy-independent in the united states. my colleagues on both sides of the aisle always talk about the dream of energy independence, where we don't have to depend on any other country for our oil. it would change policy in the middle east, and it would dramatically improve our national security. well, the bad news is, mr. chairman, we are not energy-independent. we use 17 million barrels of oil a day, but we only produce 9 million, which means we are still importing nearly half of all the oil we use. now, here is the good news, mr. chairman. horizontal drilling and all this oil we are finding in the shale formations gives us a chance to be truly energy-independent. we could produce an additional 9 million barrels a day, and we wouldn't have to depend on any other country in the world for our oil. all we have to do is produce what we have in our own country and make sure that we have refinery capacity to take care of this light sweet crude, and we are energy-independent. so the question is, mr. chairman, why aren't we investing in our own domestic refinery capacity to keep high-paying jobs here in the united states in the refinery industry, in the maritime trades, and in manufacturing, like steelmaking? why aren't we doing that for america while enhancing america's security? we had the former commander of the uss cole, kirk lippold, testify before our committee. he highlighted ``the significant national security risks associated with greater oil imports.'' he said that ``too many times in recent history, the u.s. has made oil deals with hostile or unfriendly governments that actually threaten our foreign policy and our national security objectives. ``lifting the export ban will undermine u.s. power projection capabilities by undermining the competitiveness of our u.s. refineries.'' do we really want to undermine the u.s. military? and then we hear the story that, somehow, lifting this ban is going to help our european allies because it will reduce their dependence on russian oil. well, that is a myth, too. as commander lippold testified before our committee, ``the primary recipient of this u.s. exported oil is going to be asia, specifically, china.'' {time} 1015 so we want to export u.s. oil to china and still have to import oil from countries that aren't necessarily friendly to us. why would we do that? mr. chairman, h.r. 702 is deeply flawed because it doesn't allow for any future oversight of oil exports under any circumstances. even if there is an oil spike or a shortage, there is no ``safety valve'' to ensure that we have enough of this critical resource for our armed forces, our industries, and our constituents. in conclusion, mr. chairman, this bill undermines our national security, and we are still importing an incredible amount of oil. this just defies common sense, and we should reject it. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from california (mrs. mimi walters), a cosponsor of the bill. mrs. mimi walters of california. mr. chairman, i rise today in support of h.r. 702, legislation that would lift the 40-year-old ban on u.s. oil exports. in 1975, president gerald ford signed the ban into law in response to gasoline shortages and the arab oil embargo. while the ban served a purpose nearly 40 years ago, much has changed since that time. today we need an energy policy that aligns with our current economic and political climate. the united states is the largest petroleum and natural gas producer in the world. our self-imposed export ban doesn't make sense and does nothing but hinder economic growth. if the ban is lifted this year, over 57,000 new supply chain jobs would be created in my home state of california by 2018, and nationwide nearly 450,000 new jobs would be created. having the option to put u.s. crude oil on the world market would benefit americans. lifting the ban would create jobs, strengthen the u.s. economy, and help reduce our trade deficit. it would also provide the international marketplace with more options, in turn, limiting the ability of energy commodities to be used as political weapons. it is important to note that this bill doesn't require the u.s. to export crude oil. it simply provides the option needed for barrels to be used in the areas where they are needed most. i urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation. mr. pallone. mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time so the republicans can have another speaker. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from texas (mr. hinojosa) at the request of the gentleman from texas (mr. cuellar), who is my original democrat sponsor. mr. hinojosa. mr. chairman, i rise today in support and as a cosponsor of h.r. 702, which lifts the ban on crude oil exports. modern advances in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have allowed the united states access to large deposits of crude oil and natural gas. last year our country produced over 350 million barrels of crude oil, and that number is steadily increasing. the crude oil in our deposits is lighter and sweeter than the traditional heavy crude oil our refineries process. the export ban hinders our access to international markets that need the [[page h6943]] sweeter type of crude and that have the refinement infrastructure for it. i am convinced that lifting the outdated crude oil export ban will create jobs and economic opportunities for our communities as we strive for greater energy independence. in the great state of texas, lifting the export ban is estimated to increase the annual gdp by over $7.1 billion and create over 40,000 new supply chain jobs. the chair. the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. barton. i yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds on behalf of the gentleman from texas (mr. cuellar). mr. hinojosa. according to the government accountability office, removing export restrictions will create employment opportunities, expand trade, and lower gasoline prices. the economic and political landscape has evolved since the ban's inception in the 1970s. i am confident that now is the time to repeal the ban on the export of crude oil to increase our economic and energy competitiveness. mr. chairman, i urge my colleagues to support h.r. 702. mr. pallone. mr. chairman, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from texas (mr. gene green). mr. gene green of texas. mr. chairman, i rise in opposition to h.r. 702. in the past 10 years, the united states has undergone an energy revolution. our production of oil and gas has far exceeded all analysis or prediction. the success in the field has materialized into jobs in our district in the houston area, both in the chemical and the refining industries. the price of oil dropped from $100 a barrel to $45 a barrel. gasoline prices have fallen from $4 per gallon to less than $2 in houston. i have represented our refinery complexes for many years. all of these benefited our economy and the consumer. unfortunately, the success has brought hardship upon the upstream producers. the energy sector, which led our country out of the recession, has now laid off approximately 150,000 folks. bloomberg estimated that 40 percent of those layoffs were in texas. i know the oil patch is facing a tough and difficult time, and i want to help. that is why it is very difficult for me to oppose this bill today. i support crude oil exports while protecting our domestic manufacturing jobs, including refining. we have the resource. we should use as much as possible here at home and sell what is left. i am a legislator who would like to solve this problem, and i like working across the party lines to get results. in fact, i worked with my good friend from texas, joe barton, on many issues during our years in congress. in fact, joe and i sat together for years at the texas a&m football games until we realized a&m would lose when we sat next to each other. so last saturday, when they beat mississippi state, we sat a ways apart so we didn't jinx them. for months, i talked with representative barton about the crude export issue. the crude oil export ban has been in place since 1975. in the seventies, the united states was in a tough spot, and we put the ban in place to protect our national interests. that is more than 40 years of legislative history. before we throw all of that away, we should make sure we have a policy that will make sense for the next 40 years. i am hoping we can craft a bill that would create a process at the bureau of industry and security within the department of commerce that would establish an authorization and reporting requirements for crude oil. crude oil is a valuable national resource, and the government should have some oversight as to where and when we send it overseas. we export liquefied natural gas through a process developed at the department of energy. i have not been a fan of that process, but we have worked to improve it. we should have some basic requirements at the department of commerce to oversee crude. unlike lng, crude is a raw commodity. unlike refined products, raw crude oil doesn't have value added. our refiners add value to that, and we export that refined product. so those are jobs created in our community. building lng terminals and exporting refined product creates good- paying jobs and lots of capital expenditure. if exporting crude is the right policy, then let's do it correctly. let's maximize the benefits for the united states. let's make sure u.s. crude doesn't end up in the hands of north korea or any of our other foes. we need to know where this resource is going, how much of it is being sent, and how often it is being sent there. we need to ensure that, if at any time, a potential bad actor enters the marketplace; the department of commerce has the ability to enforce the law. the department of commerce is not an obstacle to exports. in fact, i have struggled to find a more industry-friendly government agency. the department of commerce has approved every application to export oil in the last five years. that's 138 permits. what's more impressive is commerce approves 99 percent of all export applications, regardless of product. now, i agree that the department could approve permits more efficiently but that's something we can legislate. that's a ``fix'' i can support and believe would help our upstream producers. unfortunately, we were unable to find that compromise. i did not want to oppose this bill but without changes it is not in the best interest of our country. the time to address exports is now but we cannot just open the tap and hope for the best. i do not want the united states to become a resource nation and i certainly do not want to go back to the days of the 1970s. i look forward to working on this issue again and hope that a reasonable, commonsense approach can be reached. i want folks in all sectors to get back to work. for these reasons, i am forced to oppose h.r. 702 and i urge all my colleagues to do the same. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i yield myself 30 seconds to respond to what the gentleman from texas (mr. gene green) just said. the whole concept of this bill is to let willing buyers interact with willing sellers in a free market, transparent fashion. if you subject the bill to some sort of a discretionary permitting requirement, as one of mr. gene green's amendments would have done, you gut the bill. you destroy the entire purpose of the bill. so as much as i respect my good friend from houston, texas, i respectfully have to object to that amendment. i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from new jersey (mr. lance), a member of the committee. mr. lance. mr. chairman, i commend chairman emeritus barton's tremendous leadership on this issue. i rise today in strong support of the bill, bipartisan in nature, which will create thousands of american jobs, generate billions of dollars in revenues to states and locals, and use our nation's natural resources as a counterbalance to the rogue actors currently dominating world oil markets. american energy brings security and independence to the world and jobs and economic development to the united states. it makes no sense that iranian oil will soon be permitted to flow, but american-made energy is left untapped. it is time to end the outdated restrictions on the export of u.s. oil and, instead, work to create and protect tens of thousands of u.s. jobs, enhance our national security, and help keep prices at the pump affordable for all consumers across the country. american energy brings growth, prosperity, security, and independence to the united states and our allies. our nation should counter iran and create thousands of u.s. jobs in the process. please vote for h.r. 702. mr. pallone. mr. chairman, may i ask how much time there is on both sides. the chair. the gentleman from new jersey has 20\1/2\ minutes remaining. the gentleman from texas has 24 minutes remaining. mr. pallone. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the great state of new mexico (mr. pearce), one of our original cosponsors and a strong proponent of this bill. [[page h6944]] mr. pearce. i thank the gentleman for yielding. i appreciate his work on this important proposition. mr. chairman, for almost my entire life, the nation has worked under prevailing science that said we have reached peak energy, we are out, that we have to plan for the future because we have no more oil. two years ago a discovery was found in new mexico that will provide more oil from that one find than has been produced in our state from its entire history through the entire geographic part of new mexico. the science was a lie. we are finding oil. what is happening right now is that the refineries use a heavy sour crude. the new finds in shale are producing light sweet, which is more valuable. it is easier to refine. yet, that light sweet oil is sitting in the pipelines in new mexico, trying to get to houston. it is selling at $17 below the market cost because there is no destination. the baltics have said they would use our oil, they would put our workers back to work. but this law prevents it. the law in place, h.r. 702, simply says: open that door and put americans back to work, americans driving trucks, americans at the convenient stores. americans everywhere get the jobs. the idea that this somehow undercuts jobs is absolutely a frivolous idea to present on this house floor. mr. pallone. mr. chairman, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from illinois (mr. rush), the ranking member of the subcommittee. mr. rush. mr. chairman, over the past couple of months, i have worked tirelessly to find a reasonable compromise with the sponsor of h.r. 702, my friend and colleague from texas (mr. barton), that would allow me and others with similarly situated constituencies to support this bill. although i share the concerns of many of my democratic colleagues on how this bill might impact the environment and climate change, i have always stated that i believe in the all-of-the-above energy approach that balances environmental concerns and economic opportunities. mr. chairman, yesterday in the rules committee i advocated for an open rule process that would have allowed democrats to offer amendments that would reflect priorities and concerns of the minority party. in fact, mr. chairman, i myself submitted an amendment that would have expanded access for minority- and women-owned firms to more fully participate in the energy supply chain, which we know will be greatly enhanced if the export ban is lifted. mr. chairman, although my friends in the environmental community wouldn't agree, in my district, we say: oil is not just a commodity. oil is indeed an economic opportunity. {time} 1030 mr. chairman, my most pressing concern is making sure up front and from the beginning that minority firms would be part of the pipeline economy and would directly benefit from vendor and contracting opportunities that lifting this ban would create. instead, mr. chairman, despite positive rhetoric from members of the majority party, a closed rule was adopted. while my comprehensive amendment was not allowed, members are asked to vote now on trojan horse amendments that would do nothing to actually benefit minorities and women as my far-reaching amendment was designed to do. rather than shielding the majority party from charges of creating a multibillion-dollar boondoggle for the energy industry, today there is not much in this bill as currently drafted that i can point to as really benefiting all segments of the american population. as i have said time and time and time again, cut us in or cut it out. cut us in or cut it out. cut women in or cut it out. cut the minorities in or cut it out. mr. barton. mr. chairman, we will put the gentleman from illinois down as undecided on the bill. mr. chairman, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from texas (mr. flores), who is the chairman of the republican study committee and a member of the committee. he is from the home of the fightin' texas aggies. mr. flores. mr. chairman, i rise in strong support of h.r. 702. h.r. 702 results in five key benefits: number one, it benefits the american consumer with resulting overall lower energy prices. this particularly benefits lower-income and lower- middle-income americans, providing greater financial security for these hardworking families. number two, it benefits the american producer and allows them to further reinvest in our domestic energy infrastructure, furthering our energy security and american jobs. number three, it benefits our geopolitical standing and strengthens ties with our global friends and allies, and it hurts those countries like russia, iran, and venezuela who are opposed to american interests around the world. number four, it benefits the downstream refining community, as lower prices will stimulate volume demand for refined products. this volume gives them more financial capital to hire skilled american workers and to reinvest in their operation. number five, it strengthens our national defense by enhancing the maritime security program, which supports a robust merchant marine for use by our military during times of international crisis. these are five critical reasons why everybody wins after we lift the ban. the president has threatened to veto this commonsense bill, and hardworking american families all over this country should ask: mr. president, why are you putting the interests of iranian terrorists ahead of the interests of hardworking american families? mr. chairman, i strongly urge my colleagues to reject the amash amendment and to support h.r. 702. mr. pallone. mr. chairman, i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from california (ms. eshoo). ms. eshoo. mr. chairman, i thank our ranking member. mr. chairman, i oppose this legislation for several reasons. first, except in very narrow circumstances, the bill does not allow any limits--not any limits--on exports of domestic oil regardless of potential threats to our national security, and that is our top responsibility as members--our national security. for decades there has been a bipartisan commitment in congress and several administrations to energy independence and reducing our reliance on foreign oil. given the continued dependence of our economy and our military on oil, energy independence remains critical to our national defense. but with little consideration of any national security implications, this bill allows unlimited exports of a critical strategic resource. mr. chairman, the united states still imports 26 percent of the oil we consume and remains the world's top importer. every barrel exported under this bill would have to be replaced by a barrel imported from elsewhere, leaving us more reliant on foreign countries. the bill allows the president to limit exports only if he declares an emergency under the national emergencies act or the international emergency economic powers act or if he is directed by the international energy agency to respond to an international supply crisis. outside of these narrow circumstances, the bill permits no restrictions on exports of crude oil. this means strategic considerations such as decreasing our reliance on imports from unfriendly regimes can play no part in deciding whether to allow exports. i don't think that is a good deal at all. the bill also will have drastic impacts on the u.s. shipbuilding industry, tanker fleet, and refineries, all of which are critical to our national defense. congress has recognized for nearly 100 years that it benefits our national security to maintain a robust domestic shipbuilding industry and commercial shipping fleet. for example, crude exports from alaska which were legalized in 1995 must be carried on u.s.-flagged vessels crewed by americans. this bill contains no requirement that exports be carried on u.s.-flagged tankers. under current law, the president can allow exports of crude oil if he finds they are in the national interest. this bill would allow unlimited exports regardless of whether they are in the national security interests of the united [[page h6945]] states or not. i think that this is a slippery slope. commander kirk lippold, the retired navy captain of the uss cole, testified before congress earlier this year. the chair. the time of the gentlewoman has expired. mr. pallone. mr. chairman, i yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman. ms. eshoo. i thank the gentleman. mr. chairman, the retired navy captain of the uss cole said the following: ``the national security implications of changing the existing policy regulating the export of crude oil are rife with unknown and probably unintended consequences that must be fully considered and addressed.'' i agree with commander lippold. this bill largely ignores those important national security concerns, and it is why i urge my colleagues to oppose it. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from texas (mr. poe), from the energy capital of the world, houston, texas. mr. poe of texas. mr. chairman, i thank the gentleman for yielding. mr. chairman, the administration has worked very hard to make sure the export ban on crude oil from iran is lifted. but the administration has threatened to veto this bill that would lift the crude oil sanction ban on american oil. that doesn't make any sense to me--help the iranians sell their excess crude oil abroad, but prevent america from selling our excess crude oil abroad. that is nutty. why does the president prefer the iranians over americans? it doesn't make any sense. the president should at least give us the same deal that he gave the iranians: lift sanctions on them, lift the sanctions on american oil. we have a surplus. we need to sell it. ``use all we can and sell the rest.'' that is the motto. and that is just the way it is. mr. pallone. mr. chairman, i believe we are lopsided on the time a little again, so i would like to reserve the balance of my time. mr. barton. could we ask what the time differential is, mr. chairman? the chair. the gentleman from texas has 20\1/2\ minutes remaining. the gentleman from new jersey has 14 minutes remaining. mr. barton. at this time, mr. chairman, i am very honored to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from michigan (mr. upton). chairman upton is the distinguished chairman of the energy and commerce committee from the great state of michigan and my good friend. mr. upton. mr. chairman, i really thank chairman emeritus barton for doing a really significant, good job on getting this bill bipartisan support and working so hard over the last 18 months or so, and both in the last congress and this congress, to get this bill ready for the floor today. mr. chairman, much has changed since the ban on crude oil was put in place in 1975. at that time, congress and president ford were responding to the arab oil embargo crisis in an effort to protect this country from the unwanted impacts of the unstable global crude oil market. but we got good news today. times have changed, and one of the biggest threats to the american energy boom today is not an international actor but, rather, our own ban on oil exports. lifting the crude oil export ban is a win for our economy, yes, it is. study after study has shown that lifting the ban would actually lower prices at the pump, create thousands of jobs, generate hundreds of millions of dollars in economic benefits, and strengthen our geopolitical influence across the globe. it will actually also reduce the deficit by more than $1 billion with additional oil royalties. these are real benefits that will be felt not only in southwest michigan, my district, but across the country; yet, somehow, this administration does not support this thoughtful solution. let's look at the benefits. according to the nonpartisan gao, lifting the ban could lower prices by 1.5 to 13 cents a gallon, real savings that add up for every family's budget. some estimates suggest that it could support the creation of an average of 394,000 jobs. additionally, the bill before us would boost royalty payments, as i indicated, from federal oil and gas leases. collectively, all of these gains provide the making of a success story that would greatly benefit our economy at a time of great uncertainty. this administration often likes to say that they are for an all-of- the-above energy policy, but the rhetoric, indeed, falls well short of reality. it doesn't make much sense that the white house is gung ho to lift the export ban in iran, but when it comes to this country, the answer is ``no.'' the chair. the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman. mr. upton. mr. chairman, this bipartisan bill would strengthen our hand in foreign diplomacy at a time when america has lost its standing on the global stage. by exporting our excess crude oil, we can help our allies seeking a safe and secure supply of energy. instead of being beholden to opec and russia for their energy needs, they can instead rely on their friends, the united states of america. creating jobs, keeping energy affordable, boosting energy production, and improving our energy security--that is what this bill does. i would urge my colleagues to support the barton bill in a vote later on this morning. mr. pallone. mr. chairman, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from california (mrs. capps). mrs. capps. mr. chairman, i thank my colleague for yielding. mr. chairman, i rise in opposition to h.r. 702. not only does this bill incentivize more oil development while ignoring its impact on our climate, it also essentially guarantees billions more in profits for oil companies while doing virtually nothing to help consumers. there are many more important issues that we should be spending our time on to actually help american families, like raising the minimum wage and making college more affordable, but instead we are passing a bill to help oil companies make more money. additionally, section 3 of the bill prohibits any federal official from taking any action that could potentially restrict the export of oil. this broad language could seriously undermine critical health and safety responsibilities of the federal government. for example, under current law, the secretary of transportation has the authority to shut down a crude oil pipeline if it poses a threat to life, property, or the environment. but what if an oil pipeline leading to an export terminal were in imminent danger of rupturing? would the secretary still have the authority to shut down that line, or would that action be considered a restriction on exporting crude oil under this bill? mr. chairman, these are not hypothetical questions. this authority was recently used in my district to shut down line 901 of the plains all american pipeline when it ruptured last may. since line 901 is the only way for the nearby offshore oil platforms to transport their oil to refineries, these platforms have had to shut down production entirely. nearly 5 months after the spill, line 901 remains shut down, and there is no indication that it will be restarted in the near future. it is not hard to imagine a similar event happening again, and the secretary's authority to protect public health, property, and the environment during such an event must not be undermined. {time} 1045 yet, if this bill were law, the secretary's authority could be preempted entirely by section 3 of this bill. in other words, the bill could create a scenario in which the perceived right of oil companies to export their oil supersedes our very real responsibility to protect public health and safety. the american people deserve better. this is a fatally flawed bill and sets the wrong priorities. i urge its defeat. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from louisiana (mr. scalise), from district one of the great pelican state, the distinguished republican whip. mr. scalise. mr. chairman, i want to thank my friend from texas for yielding, but also for his leadership in bringing this bill to the floor and building a strong bipartisan coalition to finally lift the ban on oil exports. mr. chairman, this is a relic of the 1970s that doesn't fit with today's [[page h6946]] world economy, but it also doesn't fit with the revolution that has happened in american energy because of american technology. we have an abundance of natural resources now and an abundance of oil. we literally could be the saudi arabia of energy. yet, there is a law that is on the books that bans the ability of the united states to export its own oil. there is no other nation in the world that has that limitation on their ability to sell that natural resource. mr. chairman, at a time when the president is actually supporting this horrible deal with iran that, among other things, allows iran to export their oil to the world markets, the president at the same time is saying he opposes this bill that allows america to export its oil. what is at stake, mr. chairman? what is at stake under this bill, if this bill passes, is it will create over 800,000 american jobs, good american jobs, here at home. if this bill passes, mr. chairman, we can actually create over $800 million to reduce the deficit, deficit reduction, just by passing this bill. what is also at stake, mr. chairman, if we pass this bill? we can help our allies around the world who don't want to have to get their oil from countries like russia, where vladimir putin is using energy as a weapon against our friends. they can now get that energy from us. creating american jobs along the way, everything about this says yes. it is time to lift this relic of the 1970s. let's finally allow american oil to be exported on world markets when we have such an abundance and we have the ability to create hundreds of thousands of new american jobs along the way. i urge my colleagues to support the bill. mr. pallone. mr. chairman, i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from florida (ms. castor). ms. castor of florida. mr. chairman, i thank ranking member pallone for yielding the time. i rise in strong opposition to h.r. 702. the bill is an irresponsible giveaway to big oil at the expense of america's national security, at the expense of american consumers, and our longstanding policy of working towards energy independence. now, our current policy is not a ban. you can call it a ban, but it is not a ban. it allows and promotes oil exports to strategically important allies, to places in the national interest. it is a smart policy. but now big oil wants free rein to ship america's natural resources to countries not in our national interest. this bill will eviscerate our thoughtful policy. despite assertions that the oil will go to allies in europe and elsewhere, that is not supported by the facts. who is most likely to benefit? experts say china. the energy information administration projects that china's oil consumption will double over the next 2 decades. china has been very aggressive all across the globe in exploiting and locking down natural resources. they have gone to africa. they have gone to south america. while we have been fighting battles in afghanistan, they have been locking down contracts for natural resources in afghanistan. at the same time that america is dealing with chinese cyber espionage and their geopolitical confrontations with our allies and the u.s., why would we help china gain a strategic foothold on america's natural resources? i would think that america's national security interests would compel you to defeat this bill. you should also vote this bill down and side with american consumers instead and american jobs. america is still heavily dependent on imports of crude oil. we still import 25 percent today. any claims that sending american oil overseas would help consumers in america is entirely unsupported, no matter how many times they say it. instead, what the studies show is that exporting american oil would feed the uncertainty of oil markets and likely increase costs to american consumers. back home in tampa right now you can go to the gas station and fill up your tank at about $1.99 per gallon. so it defies logic to say that changing this policy that is working for america right now would really lower the price. i don't think so. american jobs are also very likely to take a hit if this bill becomes law. why? because of the important jobs in the refining industry, the shipping industry. those are american jobs. side with the american jobs. this bill is very poor public policy. exports will be determined only by big oil to serve the interests of big oil, ceding complete control of this strategic national asset. the chair. the time of the gentlewoman has expired. mr. pallone. i yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds. ms. castor of florida. just to close, mr. chairman, the cost to u.s. consumers, our policy of energy independence, our national security interests compel a ``no'' vote on this bill. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from cincinnati, the buckeye state of ohio (mr. chabot). mr. chabot. mr. chairman, i have the honor of leading the house small business committee. a few months back we held a hearing on this very topic. we heard from small businesses about how this ban is holding them back. that is the untold story of this. this ban is hurting small businesses all across this country. america is now the largest producer of oil and gas in the world. lifting this decades-old ban is an opportunity to jump-start the economy. it would help 1 million americans find work. it would increase the gdp. it would narrow the trade deficit, attract new capital to the u.s., and stabilize the global energy supply. if america is going to lead the world in the 21st century, let's not keep one hand tied behind our back. let's replace outdated energy policies with ones that are forward-thinking, ones that will create new jobs in a new american century. mr. pallone. mr. chairman, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from georgia (mr. david scott). mr. david scott of georgia. mr. chairman, ladies and gentleman, this bill is about two things. it is about jobs and it is about national security. it will give us an opportunity to get congress to join in with my good friend from north dakota, kevin cramer, and brad ashford from nebraska, because this is about jobs and nobody needs jobs more than african americans. the hardest hit on unemployment is african american males. this allows us to be a part of being able to get language in that will help african american males get the kind of apprenticeship training with the teamsters, with the afl-cio, with the operating engineers, all of those unions and contractors who are rebuilding this infrastructure for this oil. now, on national security, make no mistake about it, ladies and gentlemen. what do you think russia is doing over in the middle east? they want dominance over energy in the world, and he who controls the energy in the world controls the world. that is why they want to prop up syria, because that is the seaport to get it out of the middle east. stand up for jobs for the american people and protect the world from russia. vote to lift the ban on the oil exports. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i just want to say ``amen'' to what the gentleman from georgia just said. mr. chairman, what time is remaining on each side? the chair. the gentleman from texas has 15 minutes remaining. the gentleman from new jersey has 7\1/2\ minutes remaining. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i yield 1 minute to the entire delegation from the great state of north dakota (mr. cramer), the original cosponsor of the bill. mr. cramer. mr. chairman, i thank the chairman. i have often said i don't know why it takes 36 texans to do one person's job. i have to tell you, i was prepared to give a great speech and then i listened to my friend from georgia and, quite honestly, i feel inadequate to the task. because you stated it so eloquently and so beautifully, and i am committed to exactly what you talked about. so maybe what i will try to do instead in my remaining seconds is remind us of the context that it was 72 [[page h6947]] years ago this week that the yom kippur war broke out that led to u.s. aid to israel, which led to a 5 percent reduction out of opec of oil, which led to the very issue we are talking about today, that this historical context in a national security context is not irrelevant. let's not, i would say, let history repeat itself, but let's use the peaceful tools of energy development while creating jobs in america replace the weapons of war in europe and in the middle east. let's use our influence for good by selling this american-made product that is produced by american workers, and let's do it in a bipartisan fashion today. mr. pallone. mr. chairman, i continue to reserve the balance of my time. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from ohio (mr. ryan), on behalf of the gentleman from texas (mr. cuellar). mr. ryan of ohio. mr. chairman, i thank the gentleman. i am normally on the opposite side of the gentleman on the congressional baseball team and normally with congressman doyle. so i hope we can win this one against congressman mike doyle. so i thank the gentleman for the opportunity. two or three points i would like to make, mr. chairman. one, in ohio, lifting this ban means 16,000 jobs in ohio, almost $3 billion in investment. our friends, the operating engineers and the laborers who are going to do that work, are supportive of this bill. i know we have some issues with the refineries, and i think we need to continue to work on that and see if we can fix that issue. we have a number of studies that say the savings to the american consumer will be anywhere from 2 cents a gallon all the way up to 12 cents a gallon. colombia university, brookings, aspen, resources for the future, all are saying this is going to reduce the cost of gas, which is a direct benefit for our consumers and our constituents who need it as we see this huge economic squeeze for the middle class. lastly, i have been sitting on the defense appropriations committee now for a number of years, and this issue here can directly benefit our ability to deal with what is happening in the middle east. the chair. the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. barton. i yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from ohio on the understanding that he will not play his best game against us next summer. mr. ryan of ohio. i yield back. no. i am just kidding. i also would also like to say, sitting on the defense appropriations committee, we sit in these classified briefings and we see what is happening with russia, we see what putin is doing, we see what is happening in the middle east, the ukraine. we need to export this oil. we need to export our natural gas. we need to have a bigger footprint in the world so that we can make sure that our allies have access to consistent energy flows coming here from the united states and creating jobs here in the united states. michele flournoy, ceo and founder of the center for new american security, former under secretary of defense for policy under president obama says: by lifting the ban on u.s. exports of crude oil, u.s. policymakers have an extraordinary opportunity to enhance not only our economic vitality, but also our national security. mr. pallone. mr. chairman, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from minnesota (mr. peterson). mr. peterson. mr. chairman, i thank the gentleman. i support removing restrictions on the export of crude oil from the united states. i urge my colleagues to vote in support of h.r. 702. current export laws are outdated, as we have heard. since these laws were last visited nearly 40 years ago, u.s. oil production has increased significantly and the united states is now the largest producer of oil and gas. studies have shown that lifting the current ban on crude oil exports would create jobs, many in the rural areas. we in our part of the world have seen the benefits that domestic drilling can provide by looking at our neighboring state of north dakota. we need to do everything we can to support the use and production of domestic energy. h.r. 702 is an important part of that. following this bill's approval, i hope all members of congress will continue to support an all-of-the-above domestic energy production strategy by considering the national security and the economic development benefits of not just oil production, but of biofuel production and related products. mr. chairman, i strongly support h.r. 702. {time} 1100 mr. barton. mr. chair, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from sugar land, texas (mr. olson), a member of the committee and a sponsor of the bill. mr. olson. mr. chair, this picture shows why we have to end this ban on crude exports. in october 1973, opec cut us off. we were getting 1.2 million barrels per day from opec, and that dropped down to a scant 19,000. gas prices doubled. if you had to gas your lawn mower, you had to get in line behind cars. because of american innovation, that world is gone. we are now awash in american crude oil. opec's days of dominance are over; but we can't deliver a knockout blow until we end the ban on american crude exports, which we will do in a few short minutes. when that happens, american families will have lower prices at the pump. thug oil nations like venezuela, russia, and iran will lose bite. the chair. the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. barton. i yield the gentleman from texas an additional 15 seconds. mr. olson. mr. chair, we will create thousands and thousands and thousands of good-paying american jobs. i ask my colleagues vote today to end the ban on crude oil exports. mr. pallone. mr. chair, i continue to reserve the balance of my time. mr. barton. mr. chair, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the great buckeye state of ohio (mr. stivers), a member of the armed services committee. mr. stivers. mr. chair, i thank the gentleman from texas for his extraordinary work on this bill. this bill is important for our national security. it is important for jobs. we need to end the oil export ban so that we can export oil that has been generated as part of this energy revolution in this country that is going to be great for jobs and help our national security partners around the world. let's make the world safer. let's give america more jobs. let's end the oil export ban. please support this bill today. mr. pallone. mr. chair, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from oregon (mr. blumenauer). mr. blumenauer. mr. chair, this is ill-advised legislation. my friends on the other side of the aisle claim 800,000 jobs, a million jobs. they don't have any real defined ability to provide such an estimate. actually, this is a number that is made up because, as some of the speakers have acknowledged, there will be offsetting job losses as a result of what is going to happen, for example, in the refining industry or what is going to happen in terms of some of the transport. but that is beside the point. we actually have a policy that is working. there will come a time, perhaps, when it makes sense in a strategic matter to make an adjustment. right now, the president has the latitude to be able to help some of our strategic partners. he has that flexibility. we are awash in oil in this country, and to expect that somehow exporting more of it is going to make a dramatic impact at the pump here is a pipe dream. it won't. it might make a modest impact. what we could do is provide a benefit to the large oil companies as part of a larger package that would help everybody. we have expiring tax provisions, for instance, dealing with the production tax credit, dealing with wind and solar that actually create far more jobs than will be found in the refining and in the oil production. and these are good, family-wage jobs all across the country let's put together a package that speaks to alternative energy continuity, that speaks to conservation, that speaks to a long-term strategy that is a win-win. i am absolutely confident that mr. pallone and mr. barton could sit down and deal with a [[page h6948]] package that would have far more benefit for america. if you are going to hand out another goodie to the oil companies, let's have a more comprehensive approach that meets our comprehensive energy needs. this bill doesn't do it. mr. barton. may i ask how much time remains, mr. chair? the chair. the gentleman from texas has 10\1/2\ minutes remaining, and the gentleman from new jersey has 4\1/2\ minutes remaining. mr. barton. mr. chair, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from california (mr. costa) on behalf of the gentleman from texas (mr. cuellar). mr. costa. mr. chair, as some of my colleagues have mentioned, the ban on crude oil exports is an outdated policy. it was 1975 that it was enacted. a lot has changed since 1975. i believe this bipartisan, commonsense solution is needed to develop a comprehensive effort to deal with our energy policy in america that deals with both our short-term and our long-term needs. i think we have to use all the tools in our energy toolbox, and i think this is part of that effort. new technologies have provided the united states with an abundance of crude oil that is only continuing in nature, combined with our renewables and our other energy sources. we need to understand that this is about stimulating our economy and creating jobs, and it also has a very important geopolitical influence on bad actors, like russia and iran, who use energy as a political weapon. i understand there are concerns by my colleagues about eliminating this ban and the negative impacts it will have. i have some concerns with small and midsized domestic refineries, which i have represented. the chair. the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. barton. mr. chair, i yield an additional 15 seconds to the gentleman from california. mr. costa. mr. chair, this is a work in progress. we obviously need to address a number of other issues with the senate. i remind my colleagues, this is important. it is about jobs, the economy, and providing alternatives of energy to russia and iran, and that is why i support this legislation as we continue to work together in a bipartisan fashion. mr. pallone. mr. chair, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. barton. i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from the golden gate state of california (mr. hunter), a distinguished subcommittee chairman of the armed services committee. mr. hunter. mr. chair, i am voting for this bill overall. in california, we don't drill anymore, and we are cutting down on our refineries even, but this is important for the nation. one big part of this bill is the maritime security program. if you don't know it, over 90 percent of all the stuff that we transfer to iraq, afghanistan, anywhere where there are american troops--all of their gear, their tanks, their weapons, their ammo, everything, for the most part--is shipped on american-flag commercial vessels. of the 50,000 cargo ships that travel the ocean every day, 79 of those are american-flag. that is it, 79 out of 50,000. sixty of those are on call when america needs them to transfer our gear to our troops overseas. when i was a lieutenant in the marine corps, on my second tour in 2004, i drove down to the san diego port with my marine battery, and we loaded up all the equipment that we would then fall in on in iraq 2 months later. without the maritime security program plus-up that is in this bill, we would not be able to go fight wars. we would not be able to move our equipment. we would not be able to support our troops. this is a national security bill. it is not only national security because it is energy security, but it is national security because that is how we support our troops overseas is with the maritime security program, which this bill pluses up. i just want to say thank you to the chairman and everybody who supports this. i would urge my colleagues to not just support energy security, but support national security. mr. pallone. mr. chairman, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from texas (ms. eddie bernice johnson). ms. eddie bernice johnson of texas. mr. chairman, i had planned to support this bill, as a matter of fact, as a cosponsor; but since i have been unable to remove myself from the cosponsorship, i wish to speak on the record regarding my opposition to this particular bill. while i believe that congress should consider the potential for all energy sources to meet our nation's current and future needs, i believe that this legislation lacks the proper safeguards and oversight for such a major change in our nation's energy policy. the bill does not appropriately consider the implications of our national security, the economy, consumers, and, especially, the environment. exporting crude oil does not increase demand for oil or definitively increase the number of u.s. jobs in the energy sector. on the contrary, many u.s. jobs that are downstream in the domestic refining process may be threatened. in addition, exporting oil to foreign countries for refining purposes would likely increase overall co 2 emissions. the chair. the time of the gentlewoman has expired. mr. pallone. mr. chairman, i yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from texas. ms. eddie bernice johnson of texas. mr. chair, the bottom line is that we must consider many factors related to our energy portfolio before we lift any current restrictions. mr. chair, i rise in strong opposition to h.r. 702. since i am unable to remove myself as a cosponsor of the legislation, i would like to speak on the record regarding my opposition to this particular bill. while i believe that congress should consider the potential for all energy sources to meet our nation's current and future needs, i believe that this legislation lacks the proper safeguards and oversight for such a major change in our nation's energy policy. the bill does not appropriately consider the implications for our national security, the economy, consumers, and especially the environment. exporting crude oil does not increase demand for oil or definitively increase the number of u.s. jobs in the energy sector. on the contrary, many u.s. jobs that are downstream in the domestic refining process may be threatened. in addition, exporting oil to foreign countries for refining purposes will likely increase overall co 2 emissions, thus amplifying the impacts of climate change. facing the challenge of climate change requires us to be responsible and accountable for our own natural resources. this bill does not provide any recourse to mitigate or even examine these potential impacts, and thus ignores this responsibility entirely. it should be noted that the obama administration has made every effort to compromise by easing export restrictions where appropriate after careful review. the commerce department recently approved limited crude oil exchanges with mexico. however, the president believes that unilaterally lifting the export ban is excessive, and i join him in his opposition. lifting the crude oil ban for short-term gains with no accounting of the costs that will be incurred is ill-advised and short- sighted. the bottom line is that we must consider many factors related to our energy portfolio before we lift any current restrictions. without serious deliberation and oversight of the potential environmental and economic impacts of such as significant shift in our national energy policy, i must urge my colleagues to vote no on this bill. mr. barton. mr. chair, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the peach state of georgia (mr. bishop) on behalf of the gentleman from texas (mr. cuellar). mr. bishop of georgia. mr. chair, i come to the floor today to express my support of h.r. 702, much-needed legislation which will lift the arbitrary ban on the export of one of our country's most abundant natural resources: crude oil. the current ban on exports is a relic of a different time before we as a nation knew just how much crude oil we have stored in the earth across this country. we are entirely too dependent on foreign oil sources, particularly from countries who have no regard for the american economy. today is different. in fact, from the period between 2000 and 2013, u.s. production of crude oil increased by nearly fourteenfold, from 250,000 barrels per day to 3.5 million. with this large amount of excess capacity, we can sell our oil to the global markets, which will bring u.s. crude prices in line with global prices, and global prices will go [[page h6949]] down because of the increased supply. no less than 68 percent of consumers' cost of gasoline--and 57 percent for diesel fuel--come from the price of the source: crude oil. numerous studies have shown that the increased global supply will lead to lower prices at the pump. not only will consumers have more money to spend on school supplies, food, clothing, and other household staples, but the prices of these goods will go down because the cost to transport them from manufacturer to store will decrease. possibly, more importantly, we have to consider the security implications of allowing the export of crude. we are in the position of showing the world that we can provide a stable source of energy to friendly countries around the globe. our supplies will dilute the market share of unfriendly countries and weaken their grip on our democratic ally nations who have to depend on some of our unfriendly countries for their oil supplies. we can provide an alternative source to those who don't want to support our adversaries and their adversaries. so i thank my colleagues mr. cuellar and mr. barton for bringing forth this critically important legislation. i urge my colleagues in the house to vote ``yes'' on h.r. 702. mr. pallone. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i only have two speakers, myself and mr. cuellar. i believe i have the right to close, so i would ask my friend from new jersey how many speakers he still has. mr. pallone. just myself and mr. garamendi remain. mr. barton. well, at this time, i reserve the balance of my time. {time} 1115 mr. pallone. mr. chair, may i inquire how much time remains on my side? the chair. the gentleman from new jersey has 3\1/4\ minutes remaining. mr. pallone. mr. chair, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from california (mr. garamendi). mr. garamendi. mr. chairman, we have before us a very, very important issue. it is a national security issue. my good friend from san diego spoke to one part of our nation's security, and that is the ability of this nation to move its interests around the world not just with airplanes, but with ships. unfortunately, this is a very narrowly constructed piece of legislation that speaks to the interests of the petroleum industry and the many thousands of people who work there. we concede that. but this bill could also be a boon to another part of our nation's security, and that is our maritime industry. unfortunately, the bill does not do that. while it does deal with the maritime security program--and that is good--it does not deal in full potential with what we can do, and that is to require that this strategic asset, oil, be shipped on american- built ships with american mariners. that is not in the bill. it should be. it could be. if it were, our shipyards and our mariners all around this nation would have tens of thousands of jobs, and we would secure yet not only the interest of our petroleum industry but, also, the interest of our maritime industry as well as the shipyards upon which this nation's national defense depends. put it in the bill. then let's see how many votes you can get. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from texas (mr. cuellar), my chief sponsor, the gentleman that represents south texas and the eagle ford shale. mr. cuellar. mr. chair, i thank mr. barton for the leadership he has provided on this bill. i rise in support of h.r. 702 that repeals the ban on crude oil. this ban reflects an america of yesterday. it is our job, as members of congress, that our laws reflect the america of tomorrow. if you look at why this is important, this ban hurts the economy and prevents the creation of jobs. this ban imposes an estimated $200 to $300 billion cost to the economy and discourages domestic, made-in- america crude oil production. by lifting the ban now, we will create 359,000 new jobs. how do i know? because i represent the eagle ford and i have seen small-business people, men and women, that work very hard every single day to have this type of job. and i think we owe it to them and across the nation. this ban also reduces the federal direct spending by $1.4 billion, according to the cbo. so it also helps our deficit. this ban is something that we need to change, and we need to make sure that we lift this ban. what about gasoline prices? you heard mr. ryan. you heard other folks. according to the general accounting office, this will bring prices down from 1.5 cents to 13 cents. the cbo says the same thing: 5 cents to 10 cents. the administration's own agency, the energy information administration, says it will bring it down one penny or remain. it doesn't go up. it goes down. this ban also doesn't allow us to use our powers in foreign policy. why are we allowing russia or iran to dictate what happens in this world? this is why we need to make sure that we support the repealing of this ban. now, who supports this? mr. barton, you know it is a bipartisan bill. democrats and republicans support this bill, but it is also supported by business, small-business owners, and by some of the labor organizations. we have talked to those labor organizations. mr. chairman, support h.r. 702, a bipartisan bill. mr. pallone. mr. chairman, i yield myself the remainder of my time. mr. chairman, let me point out that the administration, the president, has issued a sap saying that he would veto this bill. this bill is going nowhere because of that veto and the potential for a veto. all this legislation does is to give a windfall of $30 billion in profits to the oil industry, no strings attached, no sacrifices required. the legislation is opposed by over 40 environmental groups: the united steelworkers, the ibew, the bluegreen alliance, and the industrial energy consumers of america. most importantly, mr. chairman, it is supported by the american public who, regardless of party, support investing in refineries at home rather than lifting crude export restrictions. in fact, around 70 percent of voters oppose allowing oil companies to export more u.s. oil. the republican majority has spent the whole week doing little more than attacking women's health and assisting big oil for their big profits. it is time to come together in the name of energy and national security. in the name of common sense and economic good sense, i urge a ``no'' vote on this bill. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. barton. mr. chairman, may i inquire how much time i have remaining? the chair. the gentleman from texas has 3\3/4\ minutes remaining. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i yield myself the balance of my time. (mr. barton asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) mr. barton. mr. chairman, we have had a very enlightening debate for the last hour. i would say 30 members of congress have stood up and spoken either in favor or opposition to the bill. i want it to be noted that a large number of my friends on the democratic side have risen in support of the bill. i want to compliment mr. cuellar for his strong leadership in that area. this is a bipartisan bill. when we do our town hall meetings, mr. chairman, person after person stands up and says: why can't you folks in congress get along? why don't you try to be positive? why don't you try to do what is right for america? why don't you work together on a bipartisan basis? mr. chairman, that is what this bill does. this is a bipartisan bill. we have a large number of democratic cosponsors and a large number of republicans. this bill will help all 50 states. as mr. bishop and mr. scott have stated on the democratic side, it helps low income, it helps minorities, it helps women. it helps every sector of the economy, not just the oil industry, not just the roughnecks, not just the drillers. it helps truck drivers. it helps steelworkers. it helps refinery workers. it even helps computer programmers. you name it, it helps it. some estimates are this bill, if enacted, would create as many as a million jobs. we know, for a fact, that the [[page h6950]] collapse in oil prices in the last year and a half has cost the u.s. economy over 500,000 jobs, 750,000 jobs. those are real people. that is not big oil, mr. chairman. that is people that get up every morning and kiss their wives, hop in their car, go to work and work hard 8, 10, 12 hours a day, get the bills at the end of the month and hope they have enough money to pay the bills. it is blue-collar america. it is not big oil. it is everybody in this country, mr. chairman. this bill is a market-based bill: willing buyer, willing seller. the u.s. has the largest oil reserves in the world. we have the capability to be number one in the world. why on god's green earth don't we use it? why are we the only nation in the world that is restricted in one of the blessings that god has endowed our great nation with? we could produce, if we wanted to, up to 20 million barrels a day. we are producing right now 9 million barrels a day. u.s. oil can go anywhere in the world if we allow it to. that is an economic asset. it is a military strategic asset. all we have to do is repeal an archaic law that was passed in 1975 when we couldn't export a barrel of oil if we wanted to. we were importing two-thirds of our oil. we have a bipartisan bill that helps everybody in america, that is in the economic interests of america, that is in the environmental interests of america, that is in the military strategic interests of america. mr. chairman, let's work together. let's send this bill to the senate with strong bipartisan support. god bless america. god bless this great country. pass h.r. 702. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. house of representatives, committee on foreign affairs, washington, dc, october 5, 2015. hon. fred upton, chairman, committee on energy and commerce, house of representatives, washington, dc. dear chairman upton: thank you for consulting with the foreign affairs committee on h.r. 702, a bill to adapt to changing crude oil market conditions, which was referred to us on february 4, 2015. i agreed that the foreign affairs committee might be discharged from further action on this bill so that it could proceed expeditiously to the floor, subject to the understanding that this waiver does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the foreign affairs committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the future. i would request your support for the appointment of foreign affairs conferees during any house-senate conference on this legislation. i respectfully ask that you place our letters on h.r. 702 into the congressional record during floor consideration of the bill. i appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work with the committee on energy and commerce as this measure moves through the legislative process. sincerely, edward r. royce, chairman. ____ house of representatives, committee on energy and commerce, washington, dc, october 6, 2015. hon. edward r. royce, chairman, committee on foreign affairs, rayburn house office building, washington, dc. dear chairman royce: thank you for your assistance regarding h.r. 702, a bill to adapt to changing crude oil market conditions, which was referred to our respective committees on february 4, 2015. i appreciate your willingness to agree that the foreign affairs committee might be discharged from further action on h.r. 702 so that it can proceed expeditiously to the floor, and i agree that this waiver does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the foreign affairs committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the future. in addition, i would support your request for the appointment of foreign affairs conferees during any house-senate conference on this legislation. i will place our letters on h.r. 702 into the congressional record during floor consideration of the bill. sincerely, fred upton, chairman. mr. royce. mr. chair, i rise in support of this legislation. increased u.s. energy exports benefit our national security and foreign policy. the administration has created an absurd situation. while they are lifting sanctions on iranian crude oil, they are fighting to keep sanctions on american crude oil. it makes no sense. i am, however, concerned by language that would increase subsidy payments to u.s. shipping companies participating in the ``maritime security program.'' by increasing our oil exports, as this legislation does, that's already a boon to u.s. shipping. so why the government subsidy? so i will support an amendment that is to be offered to strike this provision of the bill. but mr. chair, if this maritime subsidy is ultimately part of this legislation, the door is then open to offset it by eliminating yet another damaging subsidy: u.s. cargo preference for international food aid. over the past three years, the foreign affairs committee has led efforts to reform u.s. international food aid programs so we could reach more starving people in less time, and for less money. a stumbling block to this effort has been a requirement in u.s. law that u.s. food aid be shipped on u.s. vessels--even though many of them are foreign-owned. this requirement remains year-after-year despite the fact that the defense department has concluded that relieving a portion of our food aid budget from u.s. purchase and shipping requirements would have no effect on u.s. maritime security. if maintained in this bill, the proposed increase for ``maritime security program'' payments literally ``sinks'' the arguments against food aid reform. one wasteful corporate subsidy is bad enough; a second that kills our ability to reform food aid and save lives would be beyond conscience, and something i am confident this body would wisely reject. mrs. comstock. mr. chair, i rise today in support of h.r. 702, a bipartisan bill to lift the 40-year old, self-imposed, crude oil export ban. the united states is now among the top oil producing nations in the world. lifting this export ban will bring us roaring back into the global oil markets at a time when market conditions are particularly competitive. contrary to what some of my friends across the aisle may say, this bill would actually lower gas prices here at home. we live in a global economy, and participation in a global market leads to competitive pricing. the non-partisan government accountability office--in addition to the world-renowned analytics firm, his--have both determined that enacting this bill will lower gas prices, create hundreds of thousands of jobs, and provide a much-needed boost our economy. with all these benefits, why would we continue to hold onto this export ban? the only reason it was imposed in the first place was in response to the arab oil embargo. that was over 40 years ago. it is prudent to move past these decades-old issues, and instead focus on the issues we face today. today, we are facing a dangerous nuclear deal with iran--a deal of president obama's making. and one component of this terrible deal is that sanctions will be lifted on iran so that they will be able to access a much larger portion of the world oil market, yielding billions of dollars to their coffers. why would we make a deal with iran--a deal that allows them to export their oil so they can fund terrorism around the world--but still hold onto this self-imposed ban? without this bill, the u.s. would be missing out on billions in direct revenue to the treasury, not to mention the secondary revenue streams from improved economic conditions. let's pass this bill to unleash economic growth. let's pass this bill to create hundreds of thousands of much-needed jobs. let's pass this bill to counterbalance the exports of iran, russia, and the opec nations. i urge my colleagues to pass this bipartisan bill. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, i rise to discuss h.r. 702, a bill to ``adapt to changing crude oil market conditions.'' h.r. 702 repeals the law prohibiting the exports of crude oil that has been on the books for more than 40 years, a response to the arab oil embargo led by opec in 1973 that sent oil prices soaring and inflicted substantial damage on the american economy. let me express my appreciation to chairman emeritus barton and ranking member pallone for their leadership and commitment to american energy independence, economic growth, national security, and expanding opportunities and diversifying the energy sector workforce. i support h.r. 702 because it holds the promise of moving our country towards energy independence, create good-paying jobs, lowering gasoline prices, promoting our geopolitical interests, and strengthening our defense capabilities. but i strongly am ``pro-jobs,'' ``pro-growing economy,'' ``pro- sustainable environment and development,'' and for homeland and national security. that is why i carefully consider each energy legislative proposal brought to the floor on its individual merits and support them when they are sound, balanced, fair, and promote the national interest. as the member of congress from houston, the energy capital of the nation, i have always been mindful of the importance and have strongly advocated for national energy policies [[page h6951]] that will make our nation more energy independent, preserve and create jobs, and keep our nation's economy strong. the eighteenth congressional district, which i represent and is home to shell oil, conocophillips, chevron phillips, bp corporation of north america, marathon oil, enterprise products partners (oil and gas pipelines), and halliburton (oilfield services), and many others. my constituents have a strong interest in policies that maintain or enhance the competitiveness of american petroleum energy business in the world oil markets. mr. chair, the world is very different than it was in 1973 when the ban on crude oil exports was adopted. and much of the change we see today is attributable to america's unconventional oil boom. u.s. crude production is now more than 11 million barrels per day according to the u.s. doe's energy information administration, up from 7 million barrel per day in 2008. and it is estimated that u.s. output will exceed 18 million barrels a day by 2040. crude inventories are at an 80-year high, and imports have declined nearly 30 percent between 2005 and 2013. mr. chair, paradoxically, continuation of the crude oil export ban may pose one of the biggest threats to this u.s. production boom and to the economy. this is because increased production has led to a substantial decline in oil prices over the past year and the resulting decrease in revenues has forced u.s. producers in my district and elsewhere to slash investment and cancel projects. since last autumn the industry has cut more than 125,000 jobs, including many in my district. i have met and know many of the employers and workers affected by industry job reductions. lifting the crude oil export ban would offer american crude oil producers new markets for their product and would mean fewer layoffs. studies by the highly respected brookings institution and other organizations suggest that the economic benefits to the nation of repealing the ban on crude oil exports would be substantial. specifically, it is predicted that repeal of the crude oil export ban will: 1. generate over $1.4 billion in revenue to the federal treasury over the next 10 years from oil and gas leases, according to the congressional budget office; 2. lower gasoline prices by 13 cents per gallon according to the government accountability office; 3. support up to 964,000 additional american jobs; 4. allow the united states to help its allies, enhance its energy security, and weaken the influence and market power of opec and russia; and 5. strengthen the 60-ship maritime security fleet, assuring that united states flag ships and crews will be available to provide support to the military in defense of our national interests and our allies. the economic benefits projected to be derived from a repeal of the crude oil export ban are stunning in their magnitude: 1. 300,000 additional jobs by 2020; 2. $5.8 billion savings in fuel costs each year between 2015 and 2035; 3. $70 billion in additional investment in u.s. exploration, development, and production of crude oil between 2015 and 2020; 4. 500,000 barrels per day increase in domestic crude oil production in 2020; 5. $38 billion in additional economic activity in 2020; 6. $13.5 billion in additional federal, state, and local revenue in 2020; and a 7. $22 billion reduction in the u.s. trade deficit in 2020. it is estimated that in my own congressional district, lifting the ban would generate an additional 500 jobs and inject an additional $275 million into the local economy, resulting in an increase in government revenues in the amount of $227.7 million. another positive impact of repealing the crude oil export ban is that the u.s. crude oil production would increase 1.2 million barrels per day average between 2016 and 2030. additionally, manufacturing jobs are expected to increase by an average of 37,000 per year through 2025 and analysts predict that construction jobs will increase 217,000 in the peak year 2017, while related professional services jobs would grow by an average of 148,000 per year. repeal of the crude oil export ban is expected to spur capital investment in machinery, exploration, and development by $7 billion in 2020. the gross domestic product would increase by nearly $73 billion in 2016 and by at least $134 billion in 2018. total government revenues would increase by a combined $1.3 trillion between 2016 and 2030. the revenue generated translates to an expected average annual increase of $2,500 in disposable income per household, additional jobs for american workers, and lower gasoline prices for american consumers. as it relates to our geopolitical stance, mr. chair, lifting the crude export ban will enhance our national influence in international affairs because we will be stronger economically and more energy independent. this will enhance our ability to achieve our geopolitical objectives of maintaining peace and security across the globe which in turn furthers our national security interests. for all of these reasons, i support h.r. 702 and urge my colleagues to join me and also support jackson lee amendments 9 and 10. the chair. all time for general debate has expired. pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5-minute rule. in lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the committee on energy and commerce, printed in the bill, it shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of rules committee print 114-29. that amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. the text of the amendment in the nature of the substitute is as follows: h.r. 702 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. findings. the congress finds the following: (1) the united states has enjoyed a renaissance in energy production, establishing the united states as the world's leading oil producer. (2) by authorizing crude oil exports, the congress can spur domestic energy production, create and preserve jobs, help maintain and strengthen our independent shipping fleet that is essential to national defense, and generate state and federal revenues. (3) an energy-secure united states that is a net exporter of energy has the potential to transform the security environment around the world, notably in europe and the middle east. (4) for our european allies and israel, the presence of more united states oil in the market will offer more secure supply options, which will strengthen united states strategic alliances and help curtail the use of energy as a political weapon. (5) the 60-ship maritime security fleet is a vital element of our military's strategic sealift and global response capability. it assures united states-flag ships and united states crews will be available to support the united states military when it needs to mobilize to protect our allies, and is the most prudent and economical solution to meet current and projected sealift requirements for the united states. (6) the maritime security fleet program provides a labor base of skilled american mariners who are available to crew the united states government-owned strategic sealift fleet, as well as the united states commercial fleet, in both peace and war. sec. 2. repeal. section 103 of the energy policy and conservation act (42 u.s.c. 6212) and the item relating thereto in the table of contents of that act are repealed. sec. 3. national policy on oil export restriction. notwithstanding any other provision of law, to promote the efficient exploration, production, storage, supply, marketing, pricing, and regulation of energy resources, including fossil fuels, no official of the federal government shall impose or enforce any restriction on the export of crude oil. sec. 4. study and recommendations. not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this act, the secretary of energy shall conduct a study and transmit to the committee on energy and commerce of the house of representatives and the committee on energy and natural resources of the senate recommendations on the appropriate size, composition, and purpose of the strategic petroleum reserve. sec. 5. savings clause. nothing in this act limits the authority of the president under the constitution, the international emergency economic powers act (50 u.s.c. 1701 et seq.), the national emergencies act (50 u.s.c. 1601 et seq.), or part b of title ii of the energy policy and conservation act (42 u.s.c. 6271 et seq.) to prohibit exports. sec. 6. national defense sealift enhancement. (a) payments.--section 53106(a)(1) of title 46, united states code, is amended-- (1) in subparagraph (b), by striking the comma before ``for each''; (2) in subparagraph (c), by striking ``2016, 2017, and 2018;'' and inserting ``and 2016''; (3) by redesignating subparagraph (e) as subparagraph (g); and (4) by striking subparagraph (d) and inserting the following: ``(d) $4,999,950 for fiscal year 2017; ``(e) $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020; ``(f) $5,233,463 for fiscal year 2021; and''. (b) authorization of appropriations.--section 53111 of title 46, united states code, is amended-- (1) in paragraph (3), by striking ``2016, 2017, and 2018;'' and inserting ``and 2016''; (2) by

fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020; ``(6) $314,007,780 for fiscal year 2021; and''. the chair. no amendment to the amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be in order except those printed in part b of house report 114-290. each such amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the report, by a member designated in the report, shall be considered read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question. amendment no. 1 offered by mr. amash the chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 1 printed in part b of house report 114-290. mr. amash. mr. chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: page 2, lines 3 through 15, strike paragraphs (5) and (6). page 3, line 18, through page 4, line 21, strike section 6. the chair. pursuant to house resolution 466, the gentleman from michigan (mr. amash) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from michigan. mr. amash. mr. chairman, my amendment removes a new section of the bill added by the committee on rules that increases funding for the maritime security program by $500 million. my amendment does not eliminate the program. it simply keeps it at its current authorization level. just last week the house passed the conference report for the national defense authorization act. this defense policy bill, negotiated at length between house and senate conferees, increases the annual subsidy for maritime security program participants from $3.1 million per vessel to $3.5 million per vessel, a 12.9 percent increase. the provision, added quietly by the committee on rules, circumvents regular order and increases funding even more. as amended, h.r. 702 boosts per-vessel payments to $5 million per year, increasing the subsidy by a whopping 42 percent. the proper place for a discussion on funding for the maritime security program is in a defense bill like the ndaa, not as part of a bill that lifts a ban on crude oil exports. this spending increase is all the more reckless, given our more than $18 trillion national debt. according to the congressional budget office, lifting the export ban will increase receipts from federal oil and gas leases by $1.4 billion over the next 10 years. we should use those receipts to reduce the deficit. mr. chairman, there are two ways we should amend bills. the first way is to go through the normal committee process, by introducing amendments during a markup. members have the opportunity to debate and vote on amendments in the committee of jurisdiction. we should respect the work committees do by not altering the bills they report before we even consider the legislation on the house floor. the second way is to offer an amendment when the bill comes up for debate on the house floor. this gives all representatives the opportunity to participate in the debate and represent their constituents by voting on the measure. unfortunately, the committee on rules changed this bill behind closed doors late last week. the maritime security program is a defense-related program that has nothing to do with oil exports or energy production. this provision has no place in h.r. 702, and its eleventh-hour addition by the committee on rules is the latest example of our broken legislative process. mr. chairman, we must protect this institution and the legislative process. adding an unrelated provision to this bill behind closed doors is no way to legislate. i urge all members to vote ``yes'' on my amendment to remove this unrelated $500 million spending increase so we can consider h.r. 702 as reported by the committee on energy and commerce. mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. pallone. mr. chairman, i seek time in opposition. the acting chair (mr. dold). the gentleman from new jersey is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. pallone. mr. chairman, i yield 1\1/4\ minutes to the gentleman from virginia (mr. forbes). mr. forbes. mr. chairman, i rise today to support h.r. 702 but, more importantly, to oppose this amendment. first of all, i would tell the gentleman, this amendment was considered and this provision was considered in the ndaa, and we actually did mark it up. the second thing is this is vital to the national security of this country to maintain the private sector sealift capacity. our top military commanders have called msp a vital element of our military strategic sealift and global response capability, and it is worth noting that 90 percent of all u.s. military cargo moved from iraq and afghanistan has been by american-flagged, american-crewed commercial vessels enrolled in the msp program. {time} 1130 if we were to adopt this amendment, it would basically cost us $13 billion to re-create this. the u.s. transportation command has estimated it would cost $52 billion. in other words, mr. chairman, it would take us between 42 years and 168 years to recoup our costs. let's defeat this amendment and protect the maritime security program. mr. amash. mr. chairman, this amendment is about process. i recognize the concerns of my colleague. this should be handled in the ndaa or in a defense bill. i urge all members to support my amendment eliminating this $500 million increase in spending and reject the rules committee's eleventh- hour revision that has nothing to do with crude oil exports. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. pallone. mr. chairman, i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from maryland (mr. hoyer), the democratic whip. mr. hoyer. mr. chairman, i join my friend, mr. forbes, in opposition to this amendment. this amendment would harm america's national security. under the program that it seeks to eliminate, the pentagon reserves capacity on roughly 60 u.s.-flagged commercial ships to ensure the supply and transport of american troops. it is a program that supports our private sector as well, requiring the defense department to contract private commercial ships rather than building their own. so there was not redundancy, but complementary ability. it is a program that enhances america's national security by ensuring that our military can depend on u.s.-flagged and crewed vessels instead of foreign ones. it is a program that supports important domestic maritime jobs. in my view, we ought to reject this amendment. this legislation is, obviously, controversial. i hope this amendment is not controversial and that it receives overwhelming bipartisan opposition. mr. pallone. mr. chairman, i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from texas (mr. gene green). mr. gene green of texas. mr. chairman, i rise in opposition to the amendment. i represent the port of houston, and maritime transportation is vital to our success. last year, the united states imported $2.4 trillion and exported $1.6 trillion in cargo and goods. much of that cargo came to the united states on foreign-built ships, under foreign flags, and without u.s. citizens on board. our maritime industry has been the bedrock of our economy since our founding. more cargo moves through our waterways than any other mode of transportation. we need to protect our domestic maritime industry, and that includes men and women that work on these ships. i have worked with the maritime unions, including the seafarers and the marine engineers, since my first days in congress. i want to thank my colleagues for supporting our u.s.-flagged maritime unions. i oppose this amendment because i support any effort to keep these folks working. i would like to take a minute and acknowledge a recent incident in the atlantic ocean. the disappearance of the el faro resulted in the loss of life. i [[page h6953]] want to extend my prayers to the families. working on these ships is tough and can be hazardous, as we learned last week. it is my hope that we can defeat this amendment and ensure our economic viability and national security by putting u.s. crews and u.s. flags on more ships. i urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. mr. pallone. mr. chairman, i yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from california (mr. hunter). mr. hunter. mr. chairman, to the gentleman from michigan's point, this is the process. i chair the coast guard and maritime transportation subcommittee. i am also the vice chairman of the seapower subcommittee in the armed services committee. mr. forbes is the chairman of the subcommittee that handles this stuff. this went through the process. this is the process. this is how it is supposed to work. there are only--i will say again--79 u.s.-flagged commercial vessels on the ocean today. that is 79 out of about 50,000; 60 of those are used in times of war. it would cost us billions of dollars to create a fleet that sits there mothballing until we go to war and then we get to use it. this is how the system works. this is the process, and this is how we keep national security strong. republicans and democrats realize this is the process. it is the right way to do it, and it shores up the maritime security program for a decade. that is 10 years that we don't have to worry about this, and it is paid for. the gentleman from michigan would have a point if this were not paid for. it is totally paid for. this is the right vehicle for it, and i would urge all my colleagues to vote against the gentleman's amendment and support maritime security and national security. mr. pallone. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. kilmer. mr. chair, i rise in opposition to amash amendment that would undermine our domestic maritime industry and its workers. the pacific northwest has a proud maritime tradition that supports quality jobs and keeps our economy moving. the maritime security program ensures that we have the ships and mariners to support our local, regional, and national economy--to keep folks employed and get goods to market. having worked in economic development for a decade i believe the msp is the kind of program we ought to back, not completely scrap. let's not turn our back on the hard-working men and women that are out on the sea. i urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. the acting chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from michigan (mr. amash). the question was taken; and the acting chair announced that the noes appeared to have it. mr. amash. mr. chairman, i demand a recorded vote. the acting chair. pursuant to clause 6 of rule xviii, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from michigan will be postponed. amendment no. 2 offered by mr. delaney the acting chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 2 printed in part b of house report 114-290. mr. delaney. mr. chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the acting chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: page 2, after line 15, insert the following: (7) the united states has reduced its oil consumption over the past decade, and increasing investment in clean energy technology and energy efficiency will lower energy prices, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and increase national security. the acting chair. pursuant to house resolution 466, the gentleman from maryland (mr. delaney) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from maryland. mr. delaney. mr. chairman, recent data suggests that climate change is accelerating. as a result, the destabilizing effect it has on our environment is worsening. to my mind, this is a clear threat to american prosperity and global stability. mr. chairman, consider the fact that the governor of the bank of england in a speech recently said that he is very concerned that unless we respond to climate change, there will be a dramatic reduction in value of carbon assets, which will cause a financial crisis. as a country with the largest financial markets in the world, we should be concerned about that. mr. chairman, consider the fact that citigroup recently put out a research report that said unless we deal with climate change, the effect on global gdp will be $44 trillion to the negative by 2050. that is twice the size of the u.s. economy. mr. chairman, consider the fact that the u.n. has estimated that unless we deal with climate change, 150 million people will be forced to be relocated by 2050; 20 million, alone, in bangladesh. put that in the context of the fact that in syria we are seeing the effects of 7 million people being forced to be relocated. again, mr. chairman, this is a clear threat to american prosperity, and the bad news is that our environment is worse. the good news is the technology is better for dealing with this problem. consider the fact that, as we have doubled the installed base of solar energy in this country, we have reduced the cost of energy by 23 percent. it has happened over the last several cycles of doubling solar, and people expect it to continue. this is occurring because of good old-fashioned american innovation. and while i believe there should be policy prescriptions from the government that effectively cost and price carbon, at a minimum, mr. chairman, we should agree that by investing in clean energy technology, we will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we will lower energy costs for the american public, and we will increase national security. that is what the amendment that i have here today is designed to do. mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i rise in opposition to the amendment, but only in order to control the time. the acting chair. without objection, the gentleman from texas is recognized for 5 minutes. there was no objection. mr. barton. chairman upton and i are prepared to accept the gentleman's amendment, but we do have some republican speakers who would like to speak in favor of it. i yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from florida (mr. curbelo). mr. curbelo of florida. mr. chairman, i thank the gentleman for yielding. first, mr. chairman, let me offer my support for the underlying bill, h.r. 702. over the august district work period, i had the opportunity to visit an oil rig in the gulf of mexico and see firsthand the safety regulations and enhancements that have been put in place by the industry in recent years. two of the primary topics of discussion during our visit were safety and the environment. i was glad to learn the industry has put a lot of contingencies in place to make sure we can continue drilling for oil in a manner that is safe and responsible. i have joined my colleagues mr. delaney and mr. gibson in offering this simple amendment that would recognize our country is making progress in becoming more energy efficient; and that is better for the economy and the environment. it is also very important to note the other forms of energy that are benefiting our country's economy and its national security. wind, solar, natural gas, and nuclear energy are all contributing greatly to our energy independence, and this amendment before us today acknowledges that we should continue to promote an all-of-the-above energy strategy for this 21st century. mr. chairman, i urge adoption of this amendment. mr. delaney. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. barton. i yield 1 minute to the gentleman from the great city of kinderhook, new york (mr. gibson). mr. gibson. i thank the chairman for yielding and for his leadership. mr. chairman, i rise in support of this amendment. i am honored to be working with my colleagues john delaney and carlos curbelo to offer this bipartisan amendment. this amendment adds another strategic dimension to this bill: support for [[page h6954]] clean energy and energy efficiencies. on our way to energy independence, it is critical that we support research and development for clean energy technologies. in new york, we are doing a lot of this work supporting important programs like the sunshot program, with the ambitious goal of driving down the total cost of photovoltaics to 9 cents per kilowatt hour, which would allow it to compete with any other energy source and democratize energy, transforming the way we produce, convey, and consume energy. with improved technologies, we will also see more proliferation of wind power, hydroelectric power, and biomass energy complementing all other traditional energy sources, including crude oil, adding up to a stronger america. mr. chairman, this is a country that can do hard things. we have proven that time and again. with the proper focus and investment, we will dominate the clean energy world market. and when we do, we will drive down energy costs; we will grow our economy, strengthen our national security, and conserve our environment. i urge support of this amendment. let's take a robust and holistic approach to energy independence. mr. delaney. mr. chairman, i want to thank my colleague and my friend from texas for accepting this amendment. i want to thank my colleague from new york and my colleague from florida for their support of their amendment and their insight into this issue. again, i urge all my colleagues to support the amendment. it is very simple. it simply says that investing in basic research and investing in american innovation will, in fact, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which it has been proven to do; will, in fact, lower energy costs, which it has been proven to do; and will, in fact, increase national security in this great country. so, again, i want to i thank my colleagues for their support. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i accept the amendment. i yield back the balance of my time. the acting chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from maryland (mr. delaney). the amendment was agreed to. amendment no. 3 offered by mr. huffman the acting chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 3 printed in part b of house report 114-290. mr. huffman. mr. chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the acting chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: page 3, line 4, insert ``(a) strategic petroleum reserve'' before ``not later than''. page 3, after line 10, insert the following: (b) greenhouse gas emissions.--not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of this act, the secretary of energy shall conduct, and transmit to the committee on energy and commerce of the house of representatives and the committee on energy and natural resources of the senate the results of, a study on the net greenhouse gas emissions that will result from the repeal of the crude oil export ban under section 2. the acting chair. pursuant to house resolution 466, the gentleman from california (mr. huffman) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from california. mr. huffman. mr. chairman, i rise to offer my amendment to h.r. 702. this is the only amendment that the majority would allow in order to help us understand the impacts of lifting the crude oil export ban on greenhouse gas emissions. before the rules committee, ranking member pallone and i offered two other amendments that would have more proactively studied the increase in greenhouse gas emissions caused by this bill. instead, the majority only allowed this amendment, which requires that the department of energy do a report on the increasing greenhouse gas emissions caused by the lifting of the crude oil export ban, but still allows the ban to be lifted. {time} 1145 this is what the legislative process has come to, unfortunately, in this chamber. instead of analyzing full impacts before voting, the majority has adopted a ``pollute first, ask questions later'' approach. repeal the restrictions on fossil fuel extraction and production, and then we will figure out the environmental impact later. now, lifting this 40-year-old ban on exports could increase oil production by as much as 500,000 barrels a day. that is a significant increase that risks expanding production into sensitive areas off our coasts and our public lands. according to the center for american progress, this surge in production would result in an additional 515 million metric tons of carbon pollution each year. that is the equivalent of an additional 108 million passenger cars on the road or 135 coal-fired power plants put online. that is what this bill could do. that is why over 40 environmental groups are opposing it. now, my republican colleagues might dispute this study. it is the center for american progress. and so, when we hear studies from any group that is not funded by the fossil fuel industry, we typically hear them accused of being biased, left-leaning sources, and certainly they are welcome to make that argument. but doesn't that support the need for an established, nonpartisan source of assessments on the impacts to our environment for bills that this congress considers? that is why today, mr. chairman, i am also introducing the carbon pollution transparency act of 2015. this is a bill that would require the cbo to estimate and report on the projected carbon footprint of each bill congress considers. that way, we know before we vote how a bill would impact our climate and our environment. members of congress already rely on the fiscal impact estimates produced by the nonpartisan cbo to help us make good decisions, make up our minds. but we need to also take into account the environmental consequences of our votes. the american public has the right to know whether their representatives in washington are voting to help harm the environment, to worsen climate change, or whatever the impact may be. that is why my bill ensures that we have a fair judge, the cbo, for each bill that we consider on its environmental impact. but today we at least have an opportunity to require such a study as part of h.r. 702. it is not enough, but it is a step forward to fully understand the impacts of lifting the crude oil export ban and, potentially, the harm that would result to our environment. so i urge a ``yes'' vote on my amendment and a ``no'' vote on the underlying legislation. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i rise in mild opposition, and i may change my mind, depending on what the gentleman says. the acting chair. the gentleman from texas is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. barton. i want to make a deal with the gentleman. we want to be open and transparent. we are the open, transparent congress. we will accept your amendment if you voice vote it and at least consider voting for the bill. but if you are going to rollcall vote it and vote against the bill, then i will oppose it, and we will defeat you on the rollcall vote. so i am going to make you a deal. i am not saying you have to vote for the bill. i am just saying i want you to think nice thoughts about the bill and consider voting for the bill, and then we will accept it on a voice vote, but we don't want any rollcall votes. the acting chair. the gentleman from texas is advised to direct his remarks to the chair. mr. barton. well, i hope the chair was listening. i yield to my friend from california, if i have time to yield, to see what his thoughts are. mr. huffman. through the chair, i would say to my friend, i appreciate the offer, but i don't think there could be anything more transparent than going on record and voting on these. mr. barton. so the gentleman is going to ask for a rollcall vote? mr. huffman. i am going to ask for a rollcall vote. mr. barton. then, mr. chairman, i oppose the gentleman's amendment and ask every member to vote against the amendment. mr. chairman, we are not violently opposed to this. it is a study. i am confident that this bill will on a net basis [[page h6955]] reduce greenhouse gases because the oil that would must probably be exported is produced under the strictest environmental regulations in the world. it also happens to be the easiest oil to refine because it is light sweet, which means it doesn't have a high sulfur content. when you run it through the cracking process, because it is lighter, it tends to separate into the various refined products more easily. so the gentleman's amendment is benign in nature in the sense that, if we were to conduct the study, i think the results from the study would be positive. mr. huffman. will the gentleman yield? mr. barton. i will be happy yield to the gentleman from california. mr. huffman. to my esteemed colleague and coach of the baseball team, in the spirit of thinking good thoughts, if you will think good thoughts about considering the impacts to our environment and our climate, i will accept your previous offer to voice vote this amendment, and maybe all of this great good thought stuff will get us home faster. mr. barton. reclaiming my time, i commend the gentleman for his thoughtful understanding from mr. pallone. and, with that, we accept the gentleman's amendment. i'm going to ask everybody to vote for it on a voice vote. i yield back the balance of my time. the acting chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from california (mr. huffman). the amendment was agreed to. amendment no. 4 offered by mrs. lawrence the acting chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 4 printed in part b of house report 114-290. mrs. lawrence. mr. chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the acting chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: page 3, line 4, insert ``(a) strategic petroleum reserve study.--'' before ``not later than''. page 3, after line 10, insert the following: (b) crude oil export study.-- (1) in general.--the department of commerce, in consultation with the department of energy, and other departments as appropriate, shall conduct a study of the state and national implications of lifting the crude oil export ban with respect to consumers and the economy. (2) contents.--the study conducted under paragraph (1) shall include an analysis of-- (a) the economic impact that exporting crude oil will have on the economy of the united states; (b) the economic impact that exporting crude oil will have on consumers, taking into account impacts on energy prices; (c) the economic impact that exporting crude oil will have on domestic manufacturing, taking into account impacts on employment; and (d) the economic impact that exporting crude oil will have on the refining sector, taking into account impacts on employment. (3) report to congress.--not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this act, the bureau of industry and security shall submit to congress a report containing the results of the study conducted under paragraph (1). the acting chair. pursuant to house resolution 466, the gentlewoman from michigan (mrs. lawrence) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentlewoman from michigan. mrs. lawrence. mr. chairman, i rise today to offer an amendment that would direct the department of commerce, in consultation with the department of energy and other departments, as needed, to conduct a study. this study would measure the impact of exporting millions of barrels of domestically produced crude oil on americans and our economy. let's be clear. lifting the crude oil export ban benefits very few. let's also be clear about who does not benefit: american consumers and the american economy. my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will make the case for lifting the ban on crude oil exports. they will cite reports by the u.s. department of energy, the congressional budget office, the government accountability office, and various other organizations to support their claims. some of the benefits they will list include claims of an increase in crude oil production, additional investment in crude oil production, and an increase in employment along the energy supply chain. but there is a problem with these claims, that the u.s. crude oil is already at peak production. according to a report by the eia, production reached 9.7 million barrels 1 day in april of 2015, the highest levels since 1971. in 2015, production is expected to average 9.2 million barrels a day. we still import 7 million barrels of oil a day. let's find a way to keep domestically produced crude oil within our borders, which benefits our consumers and the economy in the u.s. for example, the domestic gas prices are at record low levels due to the surplus of crude oil. according to the u.s. federal highway administration, americans drove nearly 2 trillion miles during the first 7 months of 2015, contributing to the high gas consumption and setting a record level. lifting the ban now on u.s. crude oil benefits will undoubtedly raise prices. for consumers, these increases will result in higher gas prices at the pump and higher heating costs for families in the winter. as all of you know, the manufacturing industry is the backbone of michigan's economy. while the u.s. manufacturing industry has struggled in the past, it has been one of the bright spots in our economy since the recession and remains a vital part of america's economy, as well as our nation's economy. since 2010, over 700,000 manufacturing jobs that were lost during the recession have been recovered. one major reason for this resurgence of the manufacturing sector is low energy prices. up to one-third of all energy used in the united states goes into the manufacturing sector. rushing to lift the ban on crude oil now would only hurt the manufacturing industry and dent its growth. let us find a way to keep domestically produced crude oil within our own boundaries and allow the consumers and the economy to reap the benefits of lower energy prices. let us put together a comprehensive study of the impact of lifting the u.s. crude oil export ban on the consumers and our economy first, before we rush to export millions of barrels of domestically produced crude oil. for the benefit of all americans, for the benefit of our economy, i urge my colleagues to support my amendment. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i rise in mild opposition, but i could become a supporter of the amendment under certain conditions. the acting chair. the gentleman from texas is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. barton. mr. chairman, if the gentlewoman from michigan is willing to accept the same deal that the gentleman from california just accepted, we will accept the amendment. we will vote for it on a voice vote, and we will move on down the road to catch my plane at 1:40 from reagan national airport. does the gentlewoman agree to voice vote it? mrs. lawrence. to the chair, considering all that is happening here, i really need good thoughts, and i want to be part of the process of expanding good thoughts in congress. so i will accept, sir. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i rise in enthusiastic support of the gentlewoman's amendment and ask that it be voted for on a voice vote. i yield back the balance of my time. the acting chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from michigan (mrs. lawrence). the amendment was agreed to. amendment no. 5 offered by mr. messer the acting chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 5 printed in part b of house report 114-290. mr. messer. mr. chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the acting chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: page 3, line 15, strike ``or''. page 3, line 17, after ``(42 u.s.c. 6271 et seq.)'' insert the following: ``, the trading with the enemy act (50 u.s.c. app. 1 et seq.), or any other provision of law that imposes sanctions on a foreign person or foreign government (including any provision of law that prohibits or restricts united states persons from engaging in a transaction with a sanctioned person or government), including a foreign government that is designated as a state sponsor of terrorism,''. [[page h6956]] the acting chair. pursuant to house resolution 466, the gentleman from indiana (mr. messer) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from indiana. mr. messer. mr. chair, i want to thank my colleague and the gentleman from texas (mr. barton) for his leadership on this important bill, and i am hoping today to join the voice vote kumbaya, if possible. h.r. 702 is a commonsense legislation that repeals the outdated ban on crude oil exports. this ban was originally implemented when america was going through an energy crisis. i was very young then, but certainly remember the gas lines in the early 1970s. the truth is things are different today. america is one of the largest oil exporters, thanks to a boom in production all across our country. gas prices are at historic lows, and refineries are near capacity. yet, our laws do not reflect this new reality. producers are still held captive to the domestic marketplace. it is long past time to modernize. this bill will pave the way for a new age of energy innovation in america. it will support and create thousands of u.s. jobs, good-paying jobs, and encourage the investment of millions of dollars into our economy. america now has opportunities that would have seemed unimaginable even a generation ago, potentially even a few years ago. we could now become a net exporter of energy. think about that. and when we do, it will jump-start our economy, create thousands of good- paying jobs, and improve our national security and economic security as well. now, mr. chair, i am offering a bipartisan amendment today that clarifies language in the bill to avoid creating any unintended consequences regarding terrorist enemies of our country. i want to thank my colleague from california (mr. lowenthal) for cosponsoring this amendment and chairman royce for working with us in crafting the amendment as well. while we should all want to see crude oil exports expanded, we do not want this bill to inadvertently help our enemies. my amendment very simply clarifies the bill's language to allow the administration to retain its ability to prohibit the export of crude oil to state sponsors of terrorism. i believe this amendment is consistent with the underlying goals of the bill. i encourage my colleagues to support its adoption. {time} 1200 mr. barton. will the gentleman yield? mr. messer. i yield to the gentleman from texas. mr. barton. chairman upton and i strongly support the gentleman from indiana's amendment. we commend him for offering it. we think it adds to the bill. mr. messer. i thank the gentleman from texas. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. pallone. mr. chairman, i rise in mild opposition to the amendment. the acting chair. the gentleman from new jersey is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. pallone. i support the amendment but would note that the best way to prevent our nation's oil resources from falling into the hands of bad actors is to maintain the reasonable, time-tested controls on exports that are currently in place. if you are concerned about our oil falling into the wrong hands, then you should vote ``no'' on final passage of h.r. 702. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. messer. mr. chairman, i appreciate the gentleman's comments. i urge my colleagues to support the amendment. i yield back the balance of my time. the acting chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from indiana (mr. messer). the question was taken; and the acting chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. mr. pallone. mr. chairman, i demand a recorded vote. the acting chair. pursuant to clause 6 of rule xviii, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from indiana will be postponed. amendment no. 6 offered by mr. messer the acting chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 6 printed in part b of house report 114-290. mr. messer. mr. chair, i have an amendment at the desk. the acting chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: add at the end the following: sec. 7. prohibition on exports of crude oil, refined petroleum products, and petrochemical products to the islamic republic of iran. nothing in this act shall be construed to authorize the export of crude oil, refined petroleum products, and petrochemical products by or through any entity or person, wherever located, subject to the jurisdiction of the united states to any entity or person located in, subject to the jurisdiction of, or sponsored by the islamic republic of iran. the acting chair. pursuant to house resolution 466, the gentleman from indiana (mr. messer) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from indiana. mr. messer. mr. chair, again, i want to thank the gentleman from texas (mr. barton) for his leadership on this important bill and reiterate my support for h.r. 702. this is commonsense legislation that repeals the outdated ban on crude oil exports. the u.s. is producing more oil today than ever before, and we could literally become a net exporter of energy, something that would have been unimaginable a generation ago and would have incredible results for our economy. the fact that we are the only advanced nation that prohibits the export of domestically produced oil holds us back. i believe very strongly that we should not empower our enemies unintentionally through this legislation, and this includes the islamic republic of iran. my amendment today prohibits the export of crude oil, refined petroleum products, and petrochemical products to iran. obviously, iran has oil. it has no need to import it from the united states. but my amendment goes beyond just crude oil. it ensures iran will not inadvertently have access to other petroleum-based products produced in the u.s. refined petroleum and petrochemical products are used to manufacture thousands of goods that we use every day. things like plastics, asphalt, paints, and cell phones are manufactured in this way. it was only a few weeks ago in this very chamber that we discussed the dangers of the joint comprehensive plan of action, also known as the iran nuclear deal. despite being able to enrich uranium and self- police its nuclear facilities, iran will receive sanctions relief to the tune of $150 billion. that is $150 billion pumped into a $400- billion-a-year national economy. $150 billion of that will, no doubt, be used by iran to bankroll terrorist organizations, further destabilize the middle east, and continue their work to wipe israel off the map. things should not be made easier for them. the intent of the underlying bill is not to aid and support iran. it is to open up the u.s. energy sector, export oil, grow our economy, and create thousands of jobs. my amendment ensures that the intention of this bill is clear. i believe the amendment is consistent with the underlying goals of the bill, and i encourage my colleagues to support its adoption. mr. barton. will the gentleman yield? mr. messer. i yield to the gentleman from texas. mr. barton. the gentleman from michigan (mr. upton), the gentleman from kentucky (mr. whitfield), and myself support your amendment and ask that it be accepted. mr. messer. i thank the gentleman. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. pallone. mr. chairman, again, i rise in mild opposition to the amendment. the acting chair. the gentleman from new jersey is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. pallone. mr. chairman, i support the amendment offered by the gentleman from indiana. however, i would point out that iran has the fourth largest number of proven oil reserves in the world. in fact, supporters of this bill often state concern over the [[page h6957]] market impact of increased iranian exports on domestic producers. so while it is hard to understand why we need to worry about our crude oil going to a country that is a major net exporter of oil, i have no objection to adopting this amendment and making really sure iran doesn't get any of our oil and petroleum products. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. messer. i appreciate the gentleman's comments. i yield back the balance of my time. the acting chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from indiana (mr. messer). the question was taken; and the acting chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it. mr. pallone. mr. chairman, i demand a recorded vote. the acting chair. pursuant to clause 6 of rule xviii, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from indiana will be postponed. amendment no. 7 offered by mr. cuellar the acting chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 7 printed in part b of house report 114-290. mr. cuellar. mr. chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the acting chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: at the end of the bill, add the following new section: sec. 7. partnerships with minority serving institutions. (a) in general.--the department of energy shall continue to develop and broaden partnerships with minority serving institutions, including hispanic serving institutions (hsi) and historically black colleges and universities (hbcus) in the areas of oil and gas exploration, production, midstream, and refining. (b) public-private partnerships.--the department of energy shall encourage public private partnerships between the energy sector and minority serving institutions, including hispanic serving institutions and historically black colleges and universities. the acting chair. pursuant to house resolution 466, the gentleman from texas (mr. cuellar) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from texas. mr. cuellar. mr. chairman, i am here, of course, to talk about an amendment to h.r. 702, this important legislation before us that will lift this outdated ban on the export of oil, modernize the u.s. energy economy, and create u.s. jobs. the amendment that i bring forward is to help minority-serving institutions grow the leaders of the future in the oil and gas industry. the bureau of labor statistics predicts that hispanics will account for 74 percent of the growth in the nation's labor force from 2010 to 2020. this amendment ensures that our minority-serving institutions, such as hispanic-serving institutions and historically black colleges and universities, can create a competitive and able workforce in our oil and gas industry. this will ensure that our nation can continue to compete in the global market far into the future. hispanic-serving institutions are about 12 percent of the nonprofit colleges and universities, yet they enroll 59 percent of all hispanic students. the other part of this amendment, mr. chairman, is that it also calls for the department of energy to encourage public-private partnerships between the energy sector and minority-serving institutions. this is an amendment that i think will be good for all workers across the nation. i ask all members to vote in favor of this amendment and to support the underlying bill. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i claim the time in opposition, although i am not opposed to the amendment. the acting chair. without objection, the gentleman from texas is recognized for 5 minutes. there was no objection. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i do support the gentleman's amendment. i want to commend him for his leadership on this issue. i hope we will accept it on a voice vote. i see mr. rush. i am willing to yield to my good friend from chicago (mr. rush) if he wishes to speak on it. i was told he might. mr. rush. mr. chairman, i rise in opposition to the bill. mr. barton. i yield for the 1-minute prayer, not the 5-minute sermon. mr. rush. mr. chairman, i respectfully decline the time the gentleman was gracious to give. i really want my own time on the bill. the acting chair. the time has already been claimed. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from illinois (mr. rush), which couldn't exceed 5 minutes because that is all i have. mr. rush. i thank my friend for yielding. mr. chairman, i must say that i did not come here to congress to shadowbox with the majority party over jobs and economic opportunities for the intergenerationally and chronically unemployed citizens of my district and similarly situated districts across the country. mr. chairman, my amendment, which was not allowed by the majority party, would have provided real solutions to real problems. my amendment would have put dollars in the pocketbooks of the unemployed minorities, the unemployed women, and the unemployed veterans of this nation. mr. chairman, i must say, this amendment before us is like pouring perfume on an overused pigsty. it provides doe--and i quote from the amendment, mr. chairman--it provides doe with the authority to continue its ongoing work. in other words, it tells the department of energy: do what you are already doing. mr. chairman, unlike the amendment i offered in the rules committee that was drafted with input and collaboration from the various stakeholders who would benefit most had it been adopted, there is no specific initiative, no program, and no objections in the cuellar amendment. mr. chairman, the rush amendment would have established--not encouraged, but established--partnerships between doe, commerce, the small business administration, minority business development agency, industry, the national minority supplier diversity council, the women's business enterprise network council, and minority chambers of commerce chapters across the nation. the rush amendment would have established programmatic commitments for diversity hiring for vendor and contracting opportunities within the supply chain through contractual obligations, incentives, and other means with a goal of no less than 10 percent participation by minority- owned firms by the year 2020. mr. chairman, my amendment would have created regional diversity supply chain specialty centers to develop strategies for minority business contracting and vendor opportunities, and to hold business development sessions in strategic locations where energy development exists or is expanding. the rush amendment would have helped minority- and women-owned firms form consortiums and partnerships in order to better meet qualifications and capacities that industry is seeking. mr. chairman, the rush amendment would have established a program to provide access to capital for loans, financing, and insurance assistance for minority- and women-owned businesses. mr. chairman, the rush amendment would have established--not just encouraged, but established--public-private partnerships between minority-owned banks and private investors as well as provided grants to minority-serving institutions to help recruit businesses for energy- related supply chain sector activity. again, mr. chairman, i am not here to criticize my friend, the gentleman from texas (mr. cuellar). i am here to just bring out the differences between what an imaginary amendment would do and what a real amendment would do. mr. barton. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. cuellar. mr. chairman, i appreciate the kind words of the gentleman from illinois. i understand the amendment that he was trying to get in. actually, i was trying to help try to get his amendment accepted, but it is up to the rules committee and the democracy there. this amendment is very simple. it is something that we have added in the [[page h6958]] appropriation bill on different agencies. we all have voted for this in the appropriation bills time after time after time, and it is to help the minority-serving institutions. i ask the gentleman from texas and members to please accept this amendment. i yield back the balance of my time. the acting chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from texas (mr. cuellar). the amendment was agreed to. the acting chair. the chair understands that amendment no. 8 will not be offered. amendment no. 9 offered by ms. jackson lee the acting chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 9 printed in part b of house report 114-290. ms. jackson lee. mr. chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the acting chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: at the end of the bill, add the following new section: sec. 7. report. not later than 10 years after the date of enactment of this act, the secretary of energy and the secretary of commerce shall jointly transmit to congress a report that reviews the impact of lifting the oil export ban under this act as it relates to promoting united states energy and national security. the acting chair. pursuant to house resolution 466, the gentlewoman from texas (ms. jackson lee) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentlewoman from texas. {time} 1215 ms. jackson lee. mr. chairman, let me thank mr. pallone and mr. barton for their courtesies and as well the rules committee. let me first of all say there has been a lot of discussion on the floor of the house regarding this bill and different opinions. might i add that this is an important and vigorous discussion. i think this is the best of what this congress is all about. mr. chairman, i would like to take note of h.r. 702, which many of us know came about because of the gas prices in the 1970s. this bill simply repeals that portion of the legislation that responded to that crisis. what i like in the bill is, of course, we have in the bill that we, as a congress, will get a report some 120 days after dealing with the maintenance and the strength of the strategic petroleum reserve. that is a very important national security item. a savings clause indicates, of course, that the president has all of his powers in the light of crisis and other issues to implement any necessary changes or any necessary restrictions on this legislation. my amendment tracks giving more information. not later than 10 years after the date of enactment of this act, the secretary of energy and the secretary of commerce shall jointly transmit to congress a report that reviews the impact of lifting the oil import ban under this act as relates to promoting, supporting, and providing for the united states energy and national security policy. our number one responsibility is the american people--i understand that--both environmentally, which reflects to their own energy resources, and certainly with national security. this amendment allows for that report to be on the front side of 10 years. it could be 2 years from now, 3 years from now, and the congress can dictate that. u.s. crude production bottomed in 2008 at about 7 million barrels a day. it is now more than 11 million barrels a day, and it is now possible to go up to 18 million barrels a day in 2040 under the strictest environmental concerns. but right now in my district--right now in my district--they are laying off thousands of people because there is no work. so i would argue to my colleagues that this amendment provides the insight on what is going on. this bill could provide the gdp would rise by 550 billion to 1.8 trillion between 2015 and 2039. it is estimated in my own congressional job lifting the ban would generate an additional 500 hundred jobs, an additional 270 million in the local economy, and increase government revenues in 227 million. this 10-year period under that--by the way, it is up to 10 years--is giving long enough time to provide a probative, intelligent assessment of whether there is irreversible damage. amendment no. 9 operates as a safety valve and reassures that those who may be skeptical of lifting the export ban get reasonable opportunities to oppose it or get the right information. the same thing with those who may support it. it gives us a basis of empirical data rigorously analyzed. mr. chairman, my amendment can be summed up as follows: for those who are confident in the future, my amendment offers vindication. for those who are skeptical of the new change, my amendment will provide the evidence they need to prove their case. i ask my colleagues to support the jackson lee amendment. mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i would rise in mild opposition, which could turn to support. the acting chair. the gentleman from texas is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i want to thank the gentlewoman from houston for offering it. is she willing to do this on a voice vote and consider voting for the bill if we accept it? ms. jackson lee. will the gentleman yield? mr. barton. i yield to the gentlewoman from texas. ms. jackson lee. is the gentleman rising to support the gentlewoman's amendment with great enthusiasm? mr. barton. i will if you rise to voice vote on your amendment. i will make it a package deal. i will give you this amendment and the next amendment double enthusiasm if they are both voice votes and you actually really do vote for the bill or at least start thinking about it strongly. ms. jackson lee. will the gentleman yield? mr. barton. i yield to the gentlewoman from texas. ms. jackson lee. will the gentleman surmise that amendments that are passed by voice vote are still strong amendments? mr. barton. oh, they are. ms. jackson lee. and included in the bill? mr. barton. yes, ma'am. ms. jackson lee. as opposed to being susceptible to being gotten rid of? mr. barton. no. you have got my word. i will be on the conference committee if we have one. your amendments will be in the conference report that goes to the president if we get that far. ms. jackson lee. mr. chairman, i am always eager to work with my friends on this side of aisle, mr. pallone. i am always eager to work when we are moving forward. and so i would offer my amendment and offer it for a voice vote. mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i rise in, as i just said i would, double enthusiastic support of her amendment, but i am going to be looking on that board when it comes time to vote. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. ms. jackson lee. mr. chairman, let me just simply say my amendment answers many of the concerns that have been expressed on the floor of the house by giving empirical data, not 10 years and beyond, but in a period up to 10 years, to let us make further informative decisions to provide for the energy resources of the american people, the national resources, and, of course, being able to provide for the national security. with that, i ask for support of the jackson lee amendment. mr. chair, let me express my appreciation to chairman emeritus barton and ranking member pallone for their leadership and commitment to american energy independence and economic growth and security. i also wish to thank chairman sessions, ranking member slaughter, and the members of the rules committee for making in order jackson lee amendment number 9. mr. chair, thank you for the opportunity to explain my amendment, which provides: sec. 7. report. not later than 10 years after the date of enactment of this act, the secretary of energy and the secretary of commerce shall jointly transmit to congress a report that reviews the impact of lifting the oil export ban under this act as it relates to promoting united states energy and national security. as the member of congress from houston, the energy capital of the nation, i have always [[page h6959]] been mindful of the importance and have strongly advocated for national energy policies that will make our nation more energy independent, preserve and create jobs, and keep our nation's economy strong. the eighteenth congressional district, which i am proud to represent is home to shell oil, conocophillips, chevron phillips, bp corporation of north america, marathon oil, enterprise products partners (oil and gas pipelines), and halliburton (oilfield services), and many others. i am strongly ``pro-jobs,'' ``pro-growing economy,'' ``pro- sustainable environment and development,'' and for homeland and national security. volatile energy prices threaten economic security for millions of middle class americans and hits consumers hard; rising gas prices strain budgets for millions of american families. it is a familiar story, but in order to restore lasting security for middle class families we need a smart and reasonable plan for american energy, not false promises or quick fixes. that is why i carefully consider each energy legislative proposal brought to the floor on its individual merits and support them when they are sound, balanced, fair, and promote the national interest. so my constituents have a strong interest in policies that maintain or enhance the competitiveness of american petroleum energy business in the world oil markets. where they fall short, i believe in working across the aisle to improve them by offering constructive amendments. h.r. 702 repeals the law prohibiting the exports of crude oil that has been on the books for more than 40 years, a response to the arab oil embargo led by opec in 1973 that sent oil prices soaring and inflicted substantial damage on the american economy. but much has changed since 1973; america's unconventional oil boom changed everything. u.s. crude production bottomed in 2008 at about 7 million barrels per day; now it is now more than 11 million barrels per day and according to the u.s. doe's energy information administration, u.s. output is estimated to top 18 million barrels a day by 2040. crude inventories are at an 80-year high, and imports have declined nearly 30% between 2005 and 2013. mr. chair, paradoxically, continuation of the crude oil export ban may pose one of the biggest threats to this u.s. production boom and to the economy. this is because increased production has led to a substantial decline in oil prices over the past year and the resulting decrease in revenues has forced u.s. producers in my district and elsewhere to slash investment and cancel projects. since last autumn the industry has cut more than 125,000 jobs, including many in my district. i have met and know many of the employers and workers affected by industry job reductions. mr. chair, lifting the crude oil export ban would offer american crude oil producers new markets for their product and would mean fewer layoffs. studies by the highly respected brookings institution and other organizations suggest that the economic benefits to the nation of repealing the ban on crude oil exports would be substantial: 1. gdp could rise by $550 billion to $1.8 trillion between 2015 and 2039; 2. u.s. oil production could rise by 1.3 million to 2.9 million barrels per day in 2020; 3. 300,000 additional jobs created by 2020; 4. $5.8 billion in estimated reduced consumer fuel costs each year between 2015 and 2035; 5. up to $70 billion in additional investment in u.s. exploration, development, and production of crude oil between 2015 and 2020; 6. $13.5 billion in additional federal, state, and local revenue in 2020; 7. $22 billion reduction in the u.s. trade deficit in 2020; and 8. 100,000 barrels per day increase in refinery throughout between 2015 and 2035. it is estimated that in my own congressional district, lifting the ban would generate an additional 500 jobs and inject an additional $275 million into the local economy, resulting in an increase in government revenues in the amount of $227.7 million. admittedly, these are predictions, projections, and forecasts made on the basis of the best information currently available. we hope they are accurate but candor requires that we acknowledge that no one can say with certainty they will come to pass. that is why it is essential that at an appropriate juncture we review and assess the impact on the american petroleum industry, the national economy, and consumers. and that is the purpose of jackson lee amendment #9, which mandates a comprehensive review of the impact of crude oil export ban repeal after a 10 year period. this 10 year time period is long enough to accumulate data sufficient and probative enough to assess the impact of h.r. 702, but not so long as to prevent irreversible damage if the evaluation does not approximate the expected benefits reveals unintended adverse consequences. in sum, jackson lee amendment number 9 will help ensure that the brave new world of unrestricted crude oil exports by american producers is more than a leap of faith. rather, jackson lee amendment number 9 operates as a safety valve and reassures those who may be skeptical of lifting the export ban that reasonable opportunities will exist to make an informed evaluation of the effect of the ban's repeal on our economy and national security. and it is important to emphasize mr. chair, that this evaluation will be based on empirical data rigorously analyzed. in short, mr. chair, my amendment can be summed up as follows: for those who are confident of the future, my amendment offers vindication. for those who are skeptical that the new change will work, my amendment will provide the evidence they need to prove their case. and for those who believe that maintaining the status quo is intolerable, my amendment offers a way forward. i urge all members to support jackson lee amendment number 9. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. the acting chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from texas (ms. jackson lee). the amendment was agreed to. amendment no. 10 offered by ms. jackson lee the acting chair. it is now in order to consider amendment no. 10 printed in part b of house report 114-290. ms. jackson lee. mr. chairman, i have an amendment at the desk. the acting chair. the clerk will designate the amendment. the text of the amendment is as follows: at the end of the bill, add the following new section: sec. 7. report to congress. not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this act, the secretary of energy and the secretary of commerce shall jointly transmit to congress a report analyzing how lifting the ban on crude oil exports will help create opportunities for veterans and women in the united states, while promoting energy and national security. the acting chair. pursuant to house resolution 466, the gentlewoman from texas (ms. jackson lee) and a member opposed each will control 5 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentlewoman from texas. ms. jackson lee. mr. chairman, i ask that my amendment be considered by my colleagues. mr. chairman, my amendment requires within 180 days of enactment the secretaries of energy and commerce submit a report to congress analyzing how lifting the ban on crude oil, in particular, on exports, will create opportunities for veterans and women. mr. chairman, just a few days ago i went to an initiative called stand down. i have gone a number of years. most military persons will understand it is where you come and stand down from battle. in this instance, they were veterans, many of them homeless, many of them in great need. obviously, social services, substance abuse services, and others were offered there. what i heard from these men who wore the uniform in dignity is they want jobs. mr. chairman, i believe that this legislation will provide a strong pro-jobs agenda growing the economy. as my previous amendment said, i do not take lightly the impact of lifting the ban; therefore, my previous amendment would provide the insight on whether or not this is a positive impact. i can tell you that there is a great need, as has been discussed earlier, about collaborating with historically black colleges and hispanic-serving colleges. i have worked on those issues and have certainly seen the leadership of mr. rush and mr. cuellar. but i will tell you that it is indicated that state shale development supports american jobs. mr. chairman, $107,000 is the average salary that is provided by the energy company in energy jobs, 1.7 million employment attributed to upstream, unconventional oil and natural gas. women fill 40 percent of the vacancies in oil and gas. mr. chairman, i will insert this into the record. [[page h6960]] [apr. 23, 2014] the energy revolution is creating career opportunities for women and minorities (by cheryl jackson) minorities are projected to fill an unprecedented number of jobs in the oil, natural gas and petrochemical industries-- increasing from one-quarter of total jobs in 2010 to one- third by 2030--according to a new ihs report sponsored by api. ``the oil and natural gas industry pays wages significantly higher than the national average and can provide tremendous career opportunities for women and minorities,'' said jack gerard, api president and ceo. ``to lower unemployment and shrink the income inequality gap without spending a dime of taxpayer money, we encourage president obama to embrace this pro-development energy opportunity.'' of up to 1.3 million new job opportunities in the oil, natural gas and petrochemical industries predicted by 2030, almost 408,000 positions--32 percent of the total--are projected to be held by african american and hispanic workers, according to the report. women are estimated to fill 185,000 of those jobs, and 63 percent of new job opportunities will be in blue collar professions. ``we have the natural resources and the technology to be a global energy superpower with all the economic and national security benefits that entails,'' gerard said. ``smart energy policy will create tremendous opportunity for hundreds of thousands of workers--from those with just a high school diploma and some post-secondary training to those with post- graduate degrees.'' ``as the study highlights job opportunities, it signals the tremendous need to prepare african americans, hispanics and women to be ready to fill the workforce gap'', said paula jackson, president and ceo of the american association of blacks in energy. ``these jobs in the oil and natural gas industry don't just put people to work, they help to transform communities.'' ``this powerful and important report is a road map for workforce development stakeholders to align the content of their training with a sense of urgency to adequately prepare people for energy jobs,'' said jose l. perez, chairman and ceo of hispanics in energy. ``energy job replacement and growth is a clear pathway for diverse communities to rise from poverty to middle-class, what a rare opportunity.'' ms. jackson lee. the government and the administration are working to pair up and find jobs for veterans. the unemployment rate for veterans we have seen has been a constant issue, and it is going down. but we need to provide them with other opportunities. they were higher unemployment, as we can see, than the regular workforce. so my amendment wants to ensure that, if we lift this ban, women and veterans will benefit. we know, of course, that we have been pushing our educational facilities to engage in stem, but what we need now is a pipeline for qualified veterans and women looking for jobs right now. mr. chairman, i would ask my colleagues to support this jackson lee amendment. it causes us to focus on these vulnerable populations--women and veterans--to direct them into the industry. might i say to my constituents, the energy companies that i represent, a long list of names that i will not name at this time, that we hope that they are focused as well on expanding opportunities in the energy industry for veterans, returning soldiers, if you will, women, and, of course, across-the-board minorities. this is an industry that is moving and growing, and the opportunities should move and grow as well. with that, mr. chairman, i ask my colleagues to support the jackson lee amendment. mr. chairman, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i rise in opposition, although i am not opposed to the amendment. the acting chair. without objection, the gentleman from texas is recognized for 5 minutes. there was no objection. mr. barton. mr. chairman, i only would like to say we support the amendment and we will honor the deal we just made on the prior amendment. i ask for a ``yes'' vote on a voice vote on the amendment. mr. chairman, i yield back the balance of my time. ms. jackson lee. mr. chairman, i thank the gentleman. i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. chairman, i thank mr. pallone. i hope that our colleagues have heard us to emphasize the creation of jobs along with the environment, national security, and the energy resources of america. mr. chair, again, let me express my appreciation to chairman emeritus barton and ranking member pallone for their leadership and commitment to american energy independence, economic growth, national security, and expanding opportunities and diversifying the energy sector workforce. mr. chair, thank you for the opportunity to explain my amendment, which provides: sec. 7. report. not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this act, the secretary of energy and the secretary of commerce shall jointly transmit to congress a report analyzing how lifting the ban on crude oil exports will help create opportunities for veterans and women in the united states, while promoting energy and national security. i also wish to thank chairman sessions, ranking member slaughter, and the members of the rules committee for making in order jackson lee amendment number 10. as the member of congress from houston, the energy capital of the nation, i have always been mindful of the importance and have strongly advocated for national energy policies that will make our nation more energy independent, preserve and create jobs, and keep our nation's economy strong. i strongly am ``pro-jobs,'' ``pro-growing economy,'' and ``pro- expanding economic opportunities for women, veterans, minorities, and small business!'' that is why i carefully consider each energy legislative proposal brought to the floor on its individual merits and support them when they are sound, balanced, promote the national interest, and expand economic opportunities for everyone, particularly for women, veterans, and members of underrepresented communities. my constituents have a strong interest in policies that maintain or enhance the competitiveness of american petroleum energy business in the world oil markets. where they fall short, i believe in working across the aisle to improve them by offering constructive amendments. that is why i have offered jackson lee amendment number 10, which recognizes the fact that veterans, minorities, small businesses and women currently are significantly underrepresented in the oil and gas industries at all levels and severely underrepresented in the senior managerial, professional, board and ownership ranks. jackson lee amendment number 10 directs the secretaries of commerce and energy to submit a report to congress within 180 days assessing the beneficial impact, if any, that lifting the crude oil export ban holds for veterans and women. this report should shed light on any additional measures that should be taken to increase the participation of women and veterans in the petroleum industry as workers, executives, and entrepreneurs. nationally, there were 1.2 million people employed in the oil and gas industry in 2010, only 17% of which are women. our booming energy sector has been one of the great american success stories over the last decade, and remains a bright spot in our economy as it continues to fuel job creation. to continue this success and to ensure that opportunities and benefits are shared equitably, it is critical that we have a diverse energy workforce equipped with the skills, knowledge, and experiences needed to compete and win in the global economy. and there is no better place to look than from our pool of talented veterans and women? women make up half our population and are increasing their presence in the stem fields vital to success in the petroleum energy sector. veterans not only have proved their mettle and leadership skills in defense of our country but also are among the most resourceful and resilient members of our society, possessing the mission-critical ethic necessary for success in the workplace. a pipeline of qualified veterans and women looking for employment could play a key role as the energy industry seeks qualified, motivated, and skilled workers and entrepreneurs. as a nation, we must remain committed to utilizing the talents of women and veterans if our nation is to meet the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities offered by a dynamic global energy market. jackson lee amendment number 10 helps us meet this challenge by providing critical information regarding the impact of lifting the crude oil export ban will have on creating opportunities for veterans and women. i urge all members to support jackson lee amendment number 10. mr. chairman, with that, i ask for support of the jackson lee amendment. i yield back the balance of my time. the acting chair. the

oh, it is germane. i withdraw the point of order. the speaker pro tempore. the point of order and the reservation of the point of order is withdrawn. the gentleman from california is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. huffman. mr. speaker, let me begin with the usual stipulations. this is the final amendment to the bill. it won't kill the bill or send it back to committee. when this is adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended, so there is no procedural reason to oppose this motion to recommit. let's talk about the substance. now, we have heard a lot of debate this morning about the need to give big oil--the most profitable industry in the history of the world--yet another advantage. for years, americans have been told that we have to ``drill, baby, drill.'' the theory that we always hear is that we need to extract every barrel of oil from every acre of american soil to keep gas prices low and to provide ``energy security.'' but as soon as american gas prices started to drop, the curtain was raised, and the truth was revealed. the real reason for ``drill, baby, drill,'' surprise, surprise, was to give big oil the chance to maximize their profits on the world market. it is not enough that they have been able to game the tax code for a century with billions of dollars of tax breaks not available to other taxpayers or businesses. it is not enough that they continue to enjoy access to our public lands and waters for oil drilling, even though they are no longer paying into the land and water conservation fund, the longstanding law that expired at the beginning of this month. as a reminder, for the past 50 years, the land and water conservation fund was an agreement, a compact between the american people and big oil. it said that when we let oil and gas companies drill and profit from drilling in federal waters, they have to dedicate a fraction of the profits, just a fraction, to protect our great outdoors for future generations. the deal is that they have to dedicate a fraction of those profits to protecting our great outdoors for future generations so that our grandchildren will be able to hike and hunt and fish in our parks and wildlife refuges. the land and water conservation fund was shamefully allowed to lapse at the beginning of this month, and the majority hasn't scheduled a single vote--or even a hearing--to get it back on the books. no, all of these concessions to the oil and gas industry are not enough for this house. with today's bill, the house majority is saying that american oil and gas companies can drill more, export more, and realize even greater profits, no matter the environmental consequences, no matter the consequences to health and safety. as presently written, the underlying bill, h.r. 702, would permanently ensure that no export restrictions for any reason could be implemented or enforced in the future. that is what this bill says. that is breathtaking in its devotion to the oil and gas industry's agenda. now, my motion to recommit would ensure that the president and federal [[page h6964]] government agencies charged with protecting human health, the environment, and public safety can continue to do their job that constituents rely on them to do. specifically, with this amendment, we will ensure that bedrock health and safety laws, like the safe drinking water act and the hazardous liquid pipeline safety act, that laws like that will not be cast aside in favor of big oil's desire to sell more crude overseas. now, if you think about it, this is a very straightforward motion. i just want to ask my colleagues a question: should crude oil exports trump the safe drinking water act? should big oil profits trump the need for pipeline safety and pipeline inspection? of course not. we need to protect safe drinking water. we need to ensure pipeline safety. so, my colleagues, i urge you to vote ``yes'' on this mtr to improve this bill. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. barton. mr. speaker, i rise in opposition to the motion to recommit. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from texas is recognized for 5 minutes. mr. barton. first of all, i want to thank the minority for giving us a one-page motion to recommit that i can actually read and understand. i have read it. i don't like it. it is not necessary. it is redundant. i oppose it. please vote against it. i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. without objection, the previous question is ordered on the motion to recommit. there was no objection. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion to recommit. the question was taken; and the speaker pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it. recorded vote mr. huffman. mr. speaker, i demand a recorded vote. a recorded vote was ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule xx, this 5-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by 5- minute

Mr. Speaker, today we were talking about jobs and H.R. 702, and I supported the legislation to create jobs for my district and for America, and to provide opportunities to ensure the national security and protect the environment. We also have to realize our seniors that helped build this country. Today I joined in legislation, Seniors Deserve a Raise, to be able to connect these seniors to a cost-of-living increase related to the Consumer Price Index. But there is a gross problem that is coming up, and that is the doubling of the cost of Medicare part B. For 30 percent of beneficiaries in 2016, their cost is projected to increase by 52 percent, from $154 to $159. This increase will be accompanied by an increase in the part B deductible, from $147 to $223. Congress must act to protect the approximately 6 million Medicare beneficiaries who will see a significant increase in their Medicare premiums and deductible. It is very important to realize that my State of Texas would have a $159 million increase. It is my intention to introduce legislation, a sense of Congress, that indicates that Congress must act to protect our seniors. They helped build this Nation. What are we doing to help them? Give them a raise and protect their Medicare. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [House] [Page H6967] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SUPPORTING OUR SENIORS (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)

It is an inclusive Latino community-based, multicultural organization committed to strengthening the emotional values of individuals and the preservation of families.

For example, they offer important healthcare services, job training, education, and leadership development opportunities for disenfranchised youth living in our neighborhoods. I enjoy working with them. I worked with them when I was a prosecutor in Alameda, and our office works with them today. Appropriately named, the board, volunteers, and staff at La Familia truly view the people they serve as family, and every day they make a difference in someone's life.

Their services help build strong families and communities, fight cycles of poverty, and bridge education and health disparities. For example, they offer important healthcare services, job training, education, and leadership development opportunities for disenfranchised youth living in our neighborhoods. I enjoy working with them. I worked with them when I was a prosecutor in Alameda, and our office works with them today. Appropriately named, the board, volunteers, and staff at La Familia truly view the people they serve as family, and every day they make a difference in someone's life. Their CEO, Aaron Ortiz, and board members Gabriel Arteaga, Rene Macias, Dr. Claudia Aguilar, Mary Mele, Eleanor Dwyer, and Yvette Flores are working very hard. I congratulate them on their 40 years and what is to come to help the families in the East Bay. ____________________",package_114_232.csv,1629,1629,1698,"[congressional record volume 161, number 149 (friday, october 9, 2015)] [house] [page h6966] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] la familia's 40th anniversary (mr. swalwell of california asked and was given permission to address the house for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) mr. swalwell of california. mr. speaker, i rise to recognize and congratulate la familia counseling service on its 40th anniversary. la familia is based out of hayward, in my district, and also out of oakland, california, as well as livermore. it is an inclusive latino community-based, multicultural organization committed to strengthening the emotional values of individuals and the preservation of families. their services help build strong families and communities, fight cycles of poverty, and bridge education and health disparities. for example, they offer important healthcare services, job training, education, and leadership development opportunities for disenfranchised youth living in our neighborhoods. i enjoy working with them. i worked with them when i was a prosecutor in alameda, and our office works with them today. appropriately named, the board, volunteers, and staff at la familia truly view the people they serve as family, and every day they make a difference in someone's life. their ceo, aaron ortiz, and board members gabriel arteaga, rene macias, dr. claudia aguilar, mary mele, eleanor dwyer, and yvette flores are working very hard. i congratulate them on their 40 years and what is to come to help the families in the east bay. ____________________",1629

CREC-2015-10-09-pt1-PgH6967-4,CREC-2015-10-09,114,BALANCING THE BUDGET,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6967-H6972] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BALANCING THE BUDGET The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the recognition. I appreciate you staying on the floor with me today. It has been a week of inside-the-beltway activity. I can't find a single Member of Congress on this floor--and I have been talking to a lot of them--who ran for Congress because they thought the most important job we were going to have was picking our House leadership. It is an important responsibility. It is an important job, Mr. Speaker. I can't tell you how difficult it is to lead 435 leaders. It is not a shortage of leaders we have here. Sometimes it is a shortage of good followers we have here. But nobody ran for Congress for that. You ran for Congress because we had serious business that the American people asked us to be about, and most of that business is not inside leadership conversations. It is about the American economy. It is about feeding one's family. It is about having a predictable future for one's children. It is about opportunity. I want to begin, Mr. Speaker, with three of the challenges that are out in front of us. The reason good leadership in this institution is important is because we have serious challenges. When I got here in 2011, we elected John Boehner Speaker of the House because John Boehner said we can do amazing things in divided government. We don't have to sit back and wait until we control all branches of government as Republicans. The Democrats don't have to sit back and wait until they control everything, Mr. Speaker. We can do amazing things together, and that is exactly what he did. {time} 1345 And we did it around finding those things on which Americans agree. I have up here the looming insolvencies for our major social safety net programs, Mr. Speaker. Social Security Disability Insurance reaches insolvency next year, next year. It is not 20 years from now, not 10 years from now. It is next year. If you are an American and you are counting on Social Security Disability Insurance to provide for you and your family because you have paid into it faithfully your entire career--forbid the thought something has happened to you, now you must rely on it--we have a cash flow situation next year leading to insolvency. That is the smallest of our concerns, Mr. Speaker. We go next to Medicare, insolvent in 2030. Medicare. Social Security, insolvent in 2035. Social Security and Medicare, as you know, Mr. Speaker, are funded by payroll taxes. Payroll taxes are that FICA line on our pay stubs. It is the largest tax, at 15.3 percent of every worker's paycheck in this country. It is the largest tax that most American families pay. I want you to think about that. Here we are talking about earning the American people's trust. Here we are talking about delivering for the American people on their priorities. The largest tax that most Americans pay goes to fund two programs that we [[Page H6968]] know with certainty, as we sit here today, aren't going to survive in their current configuration. The cash flow just won't allow it. But, Mr. Speaker, I am not here to preach doom and gloom. I am here to preach opportunity. I am preaching opportunity because I work with 434 other people here who also believe that, if we work together, we can do amazing things for the American people. I have got a chart here, Mr. Speaker. You can't see it from your perch. But it is the projected economic growth rates in this country. Again, I am trying to distinguish what is happening in terms of a leadership discussion here from what is happening in a broader leadership discussion about America. And what I show here is that year after year after year for the past--I have 3 years represented here on the screen, Mr. Speaker, but it goes back 5 years. Every year the Congressional Budget Office--that group of economists that help us to craft the numbers in a bipartisan way--every year the Congressional Budget Office reports that their anticipated economic growth for America is lower in this year than it was the year before. And it was lower last year than the year before that. And it was lower that year than the year before that. When we fail to succeed together, Mr. Speaker, it is not an academic conversation. When we succeed in the wrong way, it is not an oops moment. It has a real impact on economic growth in this country. These may be colors on a chart, Mr. Speaker, but what they represent are jobs for families. What they represent are manufacturers who decided to stay in America or leave America. What they represent are entrepreneurs who either succeeded in their business or who were crushed by regulatory burdens. These decisions we make have consequences, Mr. Speaker. I have an interest rate chart here. You can't tell, but what you would see if you could see it, Mr. Speaker, is that we are borrowing money today at the lowest interest rate in American history. It is virtually free. It is virtually free today because we have the best of all the worst economies on the planet. Folks are interested in buying our debt. Right now there are stories in The Wall Street Journal about the Germans dumping our debt, about the Chinese dumping our debt. But because markets are frightened around the globe, there is more demand than there are folks selling. I put the interest rates up, Mr. Speaker, because I am talking about solving big problems today. We are going to talk about big problems. We are going to talk about solutions that we have come to here in this body. But too often, when we talk about balancing the budget, it sounds like it is a numbers game. The only numbers game balancing the budget is the numbers game 320 million because that is how many Americans live in this country and are counting on us to succeed for them. When we borrow money, we end up paying interest on that money. I am so weary of the political ecochamber, Mr. Speaker, that tells the story of the folks on the left who say, ``I want every program in America to succeed, and, in fact, I want to spend even more on it'' or the folks on the right who say, ``I will never ever raise your taxes. You don't have to pay for those programs that you want.'' Because both sides are wrong. What I have here, Mr. Speaker, is a chart of the interest that we are paying on our national debt today. Now, we will talk about the interest we are going to be paying 10 years from now if we don't solve the problem. But this red line represents the interest we are paying on our national debt today: $229 billion this year. Balancing the budget is not an academic conversation. Balancing the budget is the difference between spending $229 billion on interest on the debt versus other American priorities. You can't see it, Mr. Speaker, but education is represented by this blue line. I want you to see that. The Federal Government spends more money in interest on our national debt. Even though we borrowed that money at the lowest interest rates in American history, teaser rates, we spend more in interest on our national debt than we spend on education for our children. We are trying to pass a transportation bill right now, Mr. Speaker. We are trying to put people back to work in America building roads so that we will have the best infrastructure in the world, so that we will move goods and services to market better than any other nation in the world, so that we can have our people moving from place to place, creating jobs and economic activity better than anyplace else in the world. We spend half. Half of what we spend on interest payments this year we will spend on transportation, Mr. Speaker. We spend the same amount on interest payments in 2015 that we will spend on education and transportation combined. I want you to think about that, Mr. Speaker. We could double the spending on education in this country, as my friends on the left propose to do. We could double spending on transportation in this country, as my friends on the left propose to do, if we would balance the budget and get out of the interest payment business, as my friends on the right propose to do. This is a common goal. This is a shared focus. This is not something that divides us. This is something that unites us. Environment and natural resources: $41 billion is being spent by the Federal Government this year. We spend five times more than that on interest payments. Science, space, and technology, Mr. Speaker: Who is going to have that next manned mission to space? Who is going to be the first to have a human being on Mars? What are we going to learn out beyond the stars? We spend one-tenth the amount of our interest payments on that priority. Energy policy: How many times have we heard the refrain ``an all-of- the-above energy policy. Let's find next-generation energy solutions. Let's focus on wind and solar and fuel cells''? I don't dispute any of that. I dispute the commitment that we have to it when we spend 23 times more on interest payments than we spend on all energy policy combined. When I am talking about balancing the budget, Mr. Speaker, when I am talking about making tough choices, I am not talking about an academic conversation about making the numbers balance. I am talking about a reordering of American priorities, where we would rather spend money on our children, on our roads, on our environment, on exploration, on next-generation energy, than we would paying back debts of the past. We are going to make good on our debts. But we can control whether or not we are paying those debts down or whether we are running those debts up. Interest that we pay on our national debt isn't a number on a ledger. It is a category that pushes out so many other American priorities. That is this year, Mr. Speaker. This chart represents this year. If you fast-forward 10 years, under current law, we will be spending more on our national debt than we spend on national security. I don't mean paying back our debt, Mr. Speaker. I mean we will be spending more in interest payments on our national debt than we will be spending protecting the national security of the United States of America. That is why the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mullen, said the largest threat to America's national security is rising debt, because our debt and the accompanying interest payments are squeezing out so many other American priorities. Mr. Speaker, folks don't understand how the American budget works. I put a pie chart up here that captures that. We are going to get into some pretty serious debates here on the floor of this House in the next couple of months, primarily about something that we call discretionary spending. Discretionary spending I have represented up here, Mr. Speaker, by blue pie slices on the pie chart. Defense and nondefense spending are the two big categories, which means defense and almost everything else you think of as the Federal Government. Those are the decisions--these in blue, Mr. Speaker--that you and I have to make every year. That distinguishes it from these decisions in red. Social Security spending, Medicare spending, Medicaid spending, interest on the national debt, other mandatory [[Page H6969]] programs. These programs in red, Mr. Speaker, as you know, we won't revisit those this year. Yes. The Constitution requires that every dollar appropriated from the Treasury be appropriated from the House. But the House, in 1935, decided that some of these dollars needed to go out the door, and they are still going out the door today. We can't change it without passing a new bill in the House, a new bill in the Senate, and a new bill that the President signs. We spend all of our time in this body, Mr. Speaker, arguing about nibbling around the edges on the blue categories of the chart, which is the small third of the pie. The real challenge in balancing the budget lies in these red slices of the pie, and I am going to tell you why. What I have charted here is a look at revenues in this country as a percent of GDP. So often we measure our success against the size of the economy. What are we spending relative to the size of the economy? Because if our population grows, if the economy grows, of course our tax base will grow. And so, too, in many cases will our expenses grow. So we chart these things against the size of the economy. This red line represents our historic revenues going back to 1965: all of the taxes through the Nixon administration, into the Ford administration, Carter administration, Reagan administration, all the way through to today. In fact, we chart it out into 2045. When you see this line go flat on revenues, Mr. Speaker, it is because we are just predicting they are level as a percent of the economy. But what I have also charted are the spending priorities that were in the red slice of the pie shown earlier, the mandatory spending slices of the pie. This blue line represents Medicaid and other Federal healthcare expenditures, like the President's Affordable Care Act. This green line represents Medicare, created in 1965. It used to be nonexistent. Now it is a very large slice of the pie. Again, it represents some of the largest taxes that the American people pay. This light section here represents Social Security, Mr. Speaker, and this blue line represents net interest. Mr. Speaker, if you could see it out on the end of this chart, what you would see is Medicaid spending is growing quickly, but on a predictable line. Medicare spending is growing quickly, but on a predictable line. Social Security spending is almost flat, Mr. Speaker, even though it is a big part of the pie. What is growing is interest payments. And when the blue line crosses the red line, that is where these four programs--interest on the national debt, Social Security payments, Medicare payments, and Medicaid payments--where those programs alone consume every single penny in any tax paid by any American. This is out about 10 years from now, Mr. Speaker. About 10 years from now every single penny that every single American pays in taxes will be consumed by these four programs. These programs will be insolvent because there is no more money. Every other priority will have been squeezed out of the budget. And ``by every other priority,'' Mr. Speaker, I mean we are cutting transportation to zero, we are putting education to zero, we are cutting national parks to zero, we are cutting national security to zero. {time} 1400 This is not an academic conversation about balancing the budget. It is a national security conversation because we need to fund that priority. It is an education conversation because we need to fund that priority. It is an environment and parks conversation because we need to fund that priority. These mandatory spending programs threaten to consume every single penny of Federal revenue. Just to be clear, Mr. Speaker, in case there is any confusion, some folks say: Well, Rob, why don't you just raise more revenue? Let's just raise taxes on the American people, then we will have enough money to make that happen. Mr. Speaker, what I am showing you in this chart is, no, that won't solve the problem. This green line, I go from 2006 out to 2044 here, Mr. Speaker, and this green line represents historical revenue. When we hit this big economic downturn over the past 5 years, Mr. Speaker, revenues collapsed. It turns out if the American people can't find a job, the American people can't pay any taxes. That is pretty common sense. I say to my friends on the left, Mr. Speaker, if you want more taxes in the tax base, create more jobs. If folks have jobs, they can pay. When we ran out of jobs, we ran out of money, yet we spent even more because American families were hurting in that period of time. Well, I graphed this out to 2044, Mr. Speaker, and what you see is, under current law--this red line represents current law--if we add no new programs, if we don't spend any additional dollars, we just follow the current law, make no new promises to the American people, the spending required by current law more than doubles current revenues. So we are not talking about raising somebody's taxes a percent or two. We are talking about doubling everyone's taxes all across this country in every category. And when we do that, Mr. Speaker, that will solve the problem until about 2030, and then that won't be enough to fund it either. Taxes are not the problem. Our problem is that we are not raising enough money. Our problem is that current law is spending too much money, and we have got to come together to fix it. Well, now I get to the good news part of the presentation, Mr. Speaker. I am talking about bad news and the debt is squeezing out every other funding priority in America. I am talking about bad news that the major social programs of this Nation are fiscally insolvent. I am talking about bad news because there is just no way to tax the American people at a high enough rate to fund those priorities. The good news is we have come together in this body to work on the spending side together. Look at this, Mr. Speaker. It is unbelievable. Folks sometimes ask me back home, Mr. Speaker, they say: Rob, why do you take so many charts down to the House floor? Why are you down there talking about this? Do you know what my answer is? Because no one believes me. No one believes me. If you go home, Mr. Speaker--and I challenge you to do this. Go home and tell your constituents that when the big class of 2010 got here, when Republicans took over the House in 2011 and so we had divided government--again, as John Boehner always says, you can do big things in divided government. When Republicans took over the House, President Obama was leading the White House, we were spending $3.6 trillion as a nation--3.6 trillion. Now, the baby boomers began to retire in this window, so 10,000, Mr. Speaker, 10,000 men and women every day who had been paying Medicare and Social Security taxes their entire lives began applying for the benefits that they had earned through that lifetime of work. So we have Social Security and Medicare spending, two of the biggest categories of Federal spending, growing exponentially because of all these new applicants to the program, all these folks coming to cash in on their benefits. And what happened in divided government? We came together in this body in what is the best vote I have taken in 4\1/2\ years with a voting card, and we passed the Budget Control Act. I didn't get everything I wanted. My Republican colleagues didn't get everything they wanted; my Democratic friends didn't get everything they wanted; and the President didn't get everything he wanted; but we made a step forward for America, and we cut total Federal spending. We changed our priorities, Mr. Speaker. We began to look and see what was essential Federal spending and what was just kind of nice to do? What did we have to do to meet the promises we made to America, and where were those dollars that we weren't getting as much utility out of? So total Federal spending--not funny, Washington, D.C., math with inflation-adjusted dollars--total dollar bills going out the door from the Federal Government dropped from 2011 to 2012. I had never seen it before in my lifetime, Mr. Speaker, never seen it before in my lifetime. But we weren't done, because when you put 435 minds together in here, you really can do some neat things, Mr. Speaker. In divided government where we all have skin in the game, where we are all trying to [[Page H6970]] accomplish a goal, you can do some amazing things. So from 2012 to 2013, still with 10,000 men and women a day applying for new Social Security and Medicare benefits that they had earned, we cut total Federal spending again--again, not funny Washington, D.C., math, but reprioritizing what those goals were the American people sent us here to achieve and trying to achieve those goals, not because it is a mathematical exercise, but because if we don't, interest on our national debt is going to squeeze out all of the other priorities that we share as a nation. Mr. Speaker, 2 years in a row, while the population was growing, while the economy was struggling, and while seniors were retiring at a record pace, we came together and reprioritized Federal spending to unburden the next generation. Mr. Speaker, we couldn't do that alone as Republicans, and we couldn't have done that alone as Democrats. We could only do that working together, and we did, 2 years in a row, first time, Mr. Speaker, in anybody's lifetime on this floor. I have charted it a different way, Mr. Speaker, because we spend so much time beating up on each other as if we are failures. I tell folks back home that Congress has about a 12 percent approval rating, and we seem to use that entire 12 percent approval rating to tell everybody how awful we are: Oh, it is just terrible; folks can't get along; they all hate each other; everybody is on the take; and Washington is a giant cesspool. Please send me back for 2 more years. Where does that come from? What kind of sense does that make. We have had a lot of conscientious people on the floor of the House, Mr. Speaker, who leave their families and who leave their communities to come here on a mission that their constituents sent them to do, and in every category--I have charted three things here, Mr. Speaker. I have charted what we call discretionary spending, that is what most people think of as government: parks, courts, environment, transportation, and national security. All of those things that you think of as government, if you are on the green line in discretionary spending. This red line is the mandatory spending. That is the interest on the national debt: Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Those mandatory programs, dollars go out the door every year. This blue line is total spending across the whole government, Mr. Speaker. What I have shown here--and again, these are not inflation- adjusted dollars; these are actual dollar bills going out the door-- this dotted line in each category represents where the spending was going, where the Congressional Budget Office--again, it is a nonpartisan group of economists here--predicted the Federal Government was going to go when John Boehner took over as Speaker in 2011, before we had divided government, before we were able to come together and do big things. The solid line represents what is actually happening with Federal spending, what is actually happening. What you see, Mr. Speaker, is that even on the mandatory spending programs, we are getting reductions over what was anticipated. Certainly on the discretionary spending programs we are getting reductions over what was anticipated. In total Federal spending, we are getting reductions. Folks think nothing is happening here. They say: Rob, for Pete's sake, you have to go and you have to balance the budget. You have to make these things happen. I can't make everybody agree with me on everything. Put me and two or three other Members together, Mr. Speaker, give us all the powers of government, and we could probably solve this in a week or two. But there are 435 of us, and that is not all of us. That is just here. We have another 100 folks across the way in the Senate. Do you know what they say about the Senate, Mr. Speaker? They say the difference between a Senator and God is that God knows He is not a Senator. You have heard that one, haven't you? The power that is on the other side of the Hill has to be reckoned with, too, not to mention folks down at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. But we all got together, 100 of them, 435 of us, and 1 President at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and we bent the lines on spending. Now, is spending still going up, Mr. Speaker? It is. What you see here is that we have curtailed it inside our current window. It is the outyears where the rise really begins. Why is it rising? Look here. Discretionary spending, these are all of those priorities we talked about earlier, that is going down in kind of a flat line going out over the 10-year horizon. It is mandatory spending that is still going up. Even with the changes we have made, it is still going up. When we talk about what the problem is with spending in this country and we talk about what the challenge is with balancing the budget, it is not that we are spending a little money here or a little money there on education or transportation or the courts or the parks or even national defense. The problem is that you have promised me--I am in my forties, Mr. Speaker. You have promised me Social Security and Medicare benefits that you can't possibly live up to. There is no cash flow model that leaves enough money in the trust funds for me to access it when I retire, and you need to be honest with me and tell me that today while I have another 30 years to prepare for it. They did a survey of young people, Mr. Speaker. More young people in America, more millennials believe that they would see a UFO in their lifetime than see a Social Security check in their lifetime. Now, I have just told you this is the largest tax that most Americans pay, and we have so broken the trust with the American people as a spending body here in government that young people who are paying that giant FICA tax, the largest FICA tax in American history, they don't believe they will ever see a penny from it. We have made these changes together, Mr. Speaker. We can do better. We can make more. But the arguments that the American people are going to hear--and this is critically important. The arguments that the American people are going to hear over the next 4 months are going to be about $1 billion here and $1 billion there when we have a $100 trillion problem. The arguments that folks are going to hear over the next 4 months, Mr. Speaker, are all going to be focused on this sliver down here in the green area. This body is going to become consumed with nibbling around the edges on discretionary spending on which we have already succeeded. We have already begun the process of redefining those priorities. Where we haven't done enough is on mandatory spending. I have got to find a way, Mr. Speaker, we have got to find a way to come together to do the heavy lifting that is mandatory spending. No one is going to go to any senior in America and tell them that we are going to pull the rug out from under them now that they have already retired. Nobody is going to do that. Nobody is proposing that. Nobody is talking about that. And if you are a senior citizen in America, Mr. Speaker, rest assured that the only thing anyone is working on here is making sure the trust funds survive to pay you those benefits that have been promised. When we are talking about making changes, we are talking about making changes to my generation and younger folks to connect the reality, which is we can't afford those promises with the reality that I am still paying those taxes and redefining that relationship, Mr. Speaker, in a way that America can keep the promises. I don't mind delivering bad news to folks. You have to pay for what you want in this country. If you want more benefits, we will have to raise your taxes. If you want fewer benefits, we can cut your taxes. Right now, we are providing more benefits without raising taxes. We won't raise taxes on each other. We will raise taxes on our children and grandchildren instead. We won't cut benefits for each other. We cut benefits for our children and grandchildren instead. There is a better way forward, but we are going to find it together. Again, I put the charts up, Mr. Speaker, because folks won't believe it. These are actual dollars, not inflation-adjusted dollars. This chart represents the dollars that we have control over in this body, the dollars that we have to get together and decide on every year. Again, two-thirds of the budget goes out the door whether this body shows up for work or not. It is on autopilot. [[Page H6971]] The dollars that go out the door because we show up for work we have been reprioritizing, reallocating, and refocusing every single year. The result of that is a more effective and more efficient Federal Government to accomplish the priorities the American people have sent us here to accomplish, and we are borrowing less from our children and our grandchildren. It is a morality issue, Mr. Speaker. These are our Federal deficits. This is the money that we are borrowing from our children and our grandchildren. When George Bush was leaving office, and if he were here on the floor of the House today, Mr. Speaker, he would tell you, it was no source of pride for him as he was leaving office that he ran up the single largest deficit in American history. It was a Republican in the White House, it was Democrats running Capitol Hill, but together, in divided government, they came together and ran up the single largest annual deficit in American history. This one, Mr. Speaker, you can't see it, this little bitty one that is almost too small to read on the chart, this was once the largest deficit in American history. {time} 1415 Then we left divided government. We went to unified government where one party controlled everything, and we went to this deficit for 1 year and this deficit for the next year and this deficit for the next year, deficits, Mr. Speaker, two and three times larger than the deficit that George Bush set as the highest annual deficit in American history. Mr. Speaker, those were dark economic times for the country. Everybody has hindsight that is 20/20. No, I wouldn't have supported that spending had I been here at that time. I wasn't in Congress at that time. But those deficits are a reality. Those dollars have been borrowed. That money is now being repaid with interest every day of the week. I take that back. No, it is not. We don't repay a penny of our debt. I don't know if we have ever had that conversation. We don't repay a penny. Let's be clear. We pay interest on our national debt. We just keep borrowing. When a principal payment comes due, we borrow more money from someone else to pay back the interest and principal that we borrowed from somebody years ago. We don't pay back a penny. We just borrow more and more and more. These represent increasing borrowing amounts. Well, Mr. Speaker, this is the first budget that that class of 2010 got to work on together. This is the second. This is the third. This is the fourth. This is where we are right now. We are making progress together. We are doing this together not as a mathematical exercise, but as a moral imperative not to borrow and mortgage the future of our children and our grandchildren. We are headed in the right direction, but we have to do more. I don't want to look like I am patting us on the back, Mr. Speaker. The challenge is enormous. And, yes, we are grappling with it. But, look, this chart represents historical deficits back again as a percent of GDP. These other charts I showed you were in actual dollars going out the door. We use percent of GDP so we can kind of compare apples to apples because a dollar going out the door in 1942 would have been more money going out the door today. So we do it as a percent of the economy to try to make it be comparable. We go back here to 1965, Mr. Speaker. We borrow, borrow, borrow, borrow, borrow. Throughout all the 1980s we borrowed. Do you remember those conversations in the 1980s, Mr. Speaker, where folks thought Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill and Congress were going to borrow us into oblivion? We thought the 1980s were the dark days of Federal spending because we were running up deficits that were so large. Here those are, Mr. Speaker, these, what looked like high points then, but turned out to be low points by more recent history standards. These are those 1980 deficits. These are the early Clinton deficits. These surpluses are the successes that Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton had together, again, divided government producing results. We went back to unified government here with not-so-good results. We went to divided government. Now we are getting back on track. But if you look at--and I project it another 10 years out, Mr. Speaker. If we do nothing, deficits begin to rise again. Under current law, if we do nothing, deficits begin to rise again. Yes, we have come together on the Budget Control Act and we have done amazing things. We have come together to end what was called the sustainable growth rate. They call it the doc fix. I don't know why they call it that. It was a patient fix. It was this gimmick in law that was undermining healthcare security for all seniors. We came together and we fixed that. We made changes to the Medicare program that both solved a current problem and prevented future problems. Reinvesting more money in the trust fund, putting off those deficits, we can do those things together. But we have got to start now, Mr. Speaker. Again, we are going to talk over the next 4 months about $1 billion here and $1 billion there. I want to talk about $1 trillion here and $1 trillion there. This chart, Mr. Speaker, represents the nature of our challenge. If we want to get back to what I would call Federal debt levels that are historically normal, if it is okay to confess that, yes, we have a chart that says: As America, let's not have debt that is incredibly high. Let's just have debt that is kind of an average high. That is what we are going to define as success, just an average high debt, average dangerous debt. We are going to define that as success. And to get to that point, Mr. Speaker, if we start today, we are going to have to deal with about 1.1 percent of GDP. That is going to be the size of the change. We are going to have to deal with about 1 percent of the size of the entire economy. What is that going to be? A 1 percent increase in taxes? A 1 percent reduction in spending? No. It is much larger than that. GDP is the entire American economy. Federal spending and Federal taxes are just a very small part of that. When we talk about moving the needle on 1 percent of GDP, we are talking about big, big dollars. It is a huge challenge, huge challenge, if we started today. The tale I am telling, Mr. Speaker, is, if we wait 5 years, the challenge gets 30 percent harder. It is a huge challenge today. Some would argue it is an insurmountable challenge today. If we fail to address it today, Mr. Speaker, it will be 30 percent harder just 5 years down the road. Mr. Speaker, wait 10 years down the road and it is almost twice as hard. It is almost twice as hard to conquer 10 years down the road. We don't talk about Social Security going bankrupt in 2035 because we are trying to be alarmists. We talk about it going bankrupt in 2035 because the time to solve that is today. We talk about Medicare going bankrupt in 2030 not to be alarmists, but because the time to solve that is today. These funding challenges that we have are hard today. They are twice as hard tomorrow. We have got to find the courage today to come together and make these changes. Now, that is to keep things as they are. If what you want to do is to make things better, you see, the challenge is even harder. If what you want to do is begin to pay some debt back, the challenges are even larger. I am not setting my sights on the big line, Mr. Speaker. I am trying to focus on the little line because success begets success. When we came together and solved the Budget Control Act, we were then able to come together and solve the Medicare challenge. When we came together and solved the Medicare challenge, we were then able to come together and solve our defense challenge. One time and one time and one time and one time. When you wake up 365 days later, you find out you have really gotten some work done. There are a lot of numbers on this chart, Mr. Speaker, and I will send you a copy of it. But we are talking about a 14 percent revenue increase or a 13 percent spending increase today, today, to begin this process. The size of our challenge today, the challenge that I said was easy, the challenge that I said we could achieve together, the challenge that I said divided government gave us an opportunity to be successful at, that is a 14 percent revenue increase, 14 percent tax hike today, or a 13 percent spending cut today. And then we are going to [[Page H6972]] need to do it again next year and again next year and again the year after that. This is the easy challenge, Mr. Speaker. We have come together to create the largest deficit reduction package in the history of the country. Republicans, Democrats, Congress, the White House, we did it. We have time to do it again. I know there is an election year coming. I know folks want to focus on who is going to win in November. I know folks want Democrats to try to take over Congress or Republicans to try to take over the White House. I know that is the national conversation. But whichever side of that battle you pick, wouldn't your candidate be advantaged if Republicans and Democrats had been successful for the American people on yet another big challenge? There is only one way forward, and it is hard. There is only one way forward, and it is together. Please let us not burn bridges quibbling over $1 billion here and $1 billion there over the next 4 months. One billion dollars is a lot of money, a lot of money. But our problems are trillion-dollar problems, and I want us to join together to solve them because I know that we can. With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6967-H6972] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BALANCING THE BUDGET The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the recognition. I appreciate you staying on the floor with me today. It has been a week of inside-the-beltway activity. I can't find a single Member of Congress on this floor--and I have been talking to a lot of them--who ran for Congress because they thought the most important job we were going to have was picking our House leadership. It is an important responsibility. It is an important job, Mr. Speaker. I can't tell you how difficult it is to lead 435 leaders. It is not a shortage of leaders we have here. Sometimes it is a shortage of good followers we have here. But nobody ran for Congress for that. You ran for Congress because we had serious business that the American people asked us to be about, and most of that business is not inside leadership conversations. It is about the American economy. It is about feeding one's family. It is about having a predictable future for one's children. It is about opportunity. I want to begin, Mr. Speaker, with three of the challenges that are out in front of us. The reason good leadership in this institution is important is because we have serious challenges. When I got here in 2011, we elected John Boehner Speaker of the House because John Boehner said we can do amazing things in divided government. We don't have to sit back and wait until we control all branches of government as Republicans. The Democrats don't have to sit back and wait until they control everything, Mr. Speaker. We can do amazing things together, and that is exactly what he did. {time} 1345 And we did it around finding those things on which Americans agree. I have up here the looming insolvencies for our major social safety net programs, Mr. Speaker. Social Security Disability Insurance reaches insolvency next year, next year. It is not 20 years from now, not 10 years from now. It is next year. If you are an American and you are counting on Social Security Disability Insurance to provide for you and your family because you have paid into it faithfully your entire career--forbid the thought something has happened to you, now you must rely on it--we have a cash flow situation next year leading to insolvency. That is the smallest of our concerns, Mr. Speaker. We go next to Medicare, insolvent in 2030. Medicare. Social Security, insolvent in 2035. Social Security and Medicare, as you know, Mr. Speaker, are funded by payroll taxes. Payroll taxes are that FICA line on our pay stubs. It is the largest tax, at 15.3 percent of every worker's paycheck in this country. It is the largest tax that most American families pay. I want you to think about that. Here we are talking about earning the American people's trust. Here we are talking about delivering for the American people on their priorities. The largest tax that most Americans pay goes to fund two programs that we [[Page H6968]] know with certainty, as we sit here today, aren't going to survive in their current configuration. The cash flow just won't allow it. But, Mr. Speaker, I am not here to preach doom and gloom. I am here to preach opportunity. I am preaching opportunity because I work with 434 other people here who also believe that, if we work together, we can do amazing things for the American people. I have got a chart here, Mr. Speaker. You can't see it from your perch. But it is the projected economic growth rates in this country. Again, I am trying to distinguish what is happening in terms of a leadership discussion here from what is happening in a broader leadership discussion about America. And what I show here is that year after year after year for the past--I have 3 years represented here on the screen, Mr. Speaker, but it goes back 5 years. Every year the Congressional Budget Office--that group of economists that help us to craft the numbers in a bipartisan way--every year the Congressional Budget Office reports that their anticipated economic growth for America is lower in this year than it was the year before. And it was lower last year than the year before that. And it was lower that year than the year before that. When we fail to succeed together, Mr. Speaker, it is not an academic conversation. When we succeed in the wrong way, it is not an oops moment. It has a real impact on economic growth in this country. These may be colors on a chart, Mr. Speaker, but what they represent are jobs for families. What they represent are manufacturers who decided to stay in America or leave America. What they represent are entrepreneurs who either succeeded in their business or who were crushed by regulatory burdens. These decisions we make have consequences, Mr. Speaker. I have an interest rate chart here. You can't tell, but what you would see if you could see it, Mr. Speaker, is that we are borrowing money today at the lowest interest rate in American history. It is virtually free. It is virtually free today because we have the best of all the worst economies on the planet. Folks are interested in buying our debt. Right now there are stories in The Wall Street Journal about the Germans dumping our debt, about the Chinese dumping our debt. But because markets are frightened around the globe, there is more demand than there are folks selling. I put the interest rates up, Mr. Speaker, because I am talking about solving big problems today. We are going to talk about big problems. We are going to talk about solutions that we have come to here in this body. But too often, when we talk about balancing the budget, it sounds like it is a numbers game. The only numbers game balancing the budget is the numbers game 320 million because that is how many Americans live in this country and are counting on us to succeed for them. When we borrow money, we end up paying interest on that money. I am so weary of the political ecochamber, Mr. Speaker, that tells the story of the folks on the left who say, ``I want every program in America to succeed, and, in fact, I want to spend even more on it'' or the folks on the right who say, ``I will never ever raise your taxes. You don't have to pay for those programs that you want.'' Because both sides are wrong. What I have here, Mr. Speaker, is a chart of the interest that we are paying on our national debt today. Now, we will talk about the interest we are going to be paying 10 years from now if we don't solve the problem. But this red line represents the interest we are paying on our national debt today: $229 billion this year. Balancing the budget is not an academic conversation. Balancing the budget is the difference between spending $229 billion on interest on the debt versus other American priorities. You can't see it, Mr. Speaker, but education is represented by this blue line. I want you to see that. The Federal Government spends more money in interest on our national debt. Even though we borrowed that money at the lowest interest rates in American history, teaser rates, we spend more in interest on our national debt than we spend on education for our children. We are trying to pass a transportation bill right now, Mr. Speaker. We are trying to put people back to work in America building roads so that we will have the best infrastructure in the world, so that we will move goods and services to market better than any other nation in the world, so that we can have our people moving from place to place, creating jobs and economic activity better than anyplace else in the world. We spend half. Half of what we spend on interest payments this year we will spend on transportation, Mr. Speaker. We spend the same amount on interest payments in 2015 that we will spend on education and transportation combined. I want you to think about that, Mr. Speaker. We could double the spending on education in this country, as my friends on the left propose to do. We could double spending on transportation in this country, as my friends on the left propose to do, if we would balance the budget and get out of the interest payment business, as my friends on the right propose to do. This is a common goal. This is a shared focus. This is not something that divides us. This is something that unites us. Environment and natural resources: $41 billion is being spent by the Federal Government this year. We spend five times more than that on interest payments. Science, space, and technology, Mr. Speaker: Who is going to have that next manned mission to space? Who is going to be the first to have a human being on Mars? What are we going to learn out beyond the stars? We spend one-tenth the amount of our interest payments on that priority. Energy policy: How many times have we heard the refrain ``an all-of- the-above energy policy. Let's find next-generation energy solutions. Let's focus on wind and solar and fuel cells''? I don't dispute any of that. I dispute the commitment that we have to it when we spend 23 times more on interest payments than we spend on all energy policy combined. When I am talking about balancing the budget, Mr. Speaker, when I am talking about making tough choices, I am not talking about an academic conversation about making the numbers balance. I am talking about a reordering of American priorities, where we would rather spend money on our children, on our roads, on our environment, on exploration, on next-generation energy, than we would paying back debts of the past. We are going to make good on our debts. But we can control whether or not we are paying those debts down or whether we are running those debts up. Interest that we pay on our national debt isn't a number on a ledger. It is a category that pushes out so many other American priorities. That is this year, Mr. Speaker. This chart represents this year. If you fast-forward 10 years, under current law, we will be spending more on our national debt than we spend on national security. I don't mean paying back our debt, Mr. Speaker. I mean we will be spending more in interest payments on our national debt than we will be spending protecting the national security of the United States of America. That is why the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mullen, said the largest threat to America's national security is rising debt, because our debt and the accompanying interest payments are squeezing out so many other American priorities. Mr. Speaker, folks don't understand how the American budget works. I put a pie chart up here that captures that. We are going to get into some pretty serious debates here on the floor of this House in the next couple of months, primarily about something that we call discretionary spending. Discretionary spending I have represented up here, Mr. Speaker, by blue pie slices on the pie chart. Defense and nondefense spending are the two big categories, which means defense and almost everything else you think of as the Federal Government. Those are the decisions--these in blue, Mr. Speaker--that you and I have to make every year. That distinguishes it from these decisions in red. Social Security spending, Medicare spending, Medicaid spending, interest on the national debt, other mandatory [[Page H6969]] programs. These programs in red, Mr. Speaker, as you know, we won't revisit those this year. Yes. The Constitution requires that every dollar appropriated from the Treasury be appropriated from the House. But the House, in 1935, decided that some of these dollars needed to go out the door, and they are still going out the door today. We can't change it without passing a new bill in the House, a new bill in the Senate, and a new bill that the President signs. We spend all of our time in this body, Mr. Speaker, arguing about nibbling around the edges on the blue categories of the chart, which is the small third of the pie. The real challenge in balancing the budget lies in these red slices of the pie, and I am going to tell you why. What I have charted here is a look at revenues in this country as a percent of GDP. So often we measure our success against the size of the economy. What are we spending relative to the size of the economy? Because if our population grows, if the economy grows, of course our tax base will grow. And so, too, in many cases will our expenses grow. So we chart these things against the size of the economy. This red line represents our historic revenues going back to 1965: all of the taxes through the Nixon administration, into the Ford administration, Carter administration, Reagan administration, all the way through to today. In fact, we chart it out into 2045. When you see this line go flat on revenues, Mr. Speaker, it is because we are just predicting they are level as a percent of the economy. But what I have also charted are the spending priorities that were in the red slice of the pie shown earlier, the mandatory spending slices of the pie. This blue line represents Medicaid and other Federal healthcare expenditures, like the President's Affordable Care Act. This green line represents Medicare, created in 1965. It used to be nonexistent. Now it is a very large slice of the pie. Again, it represents some of the largest taxes that the American people pay. This light section here represents Social Security, Mr. Speaker, and this blue line represents net interest. Mr. Speaker, if you could see it out on the end of this chart, what you would see is Medicaid spending is growing quickly, but on a predictable line. Medicare spending is growing quickly, but on a predictable line. Social Security spending is almost flat, Mr. Speaker, even though it is a big part of the pie. What is growing is interest payments. And when the blue line crosses the red line, that is where these four programs--interest on the national debt, Social Security payments, Medicare payments, and Medicaid payments--where those programs alone consume every single penny in any tax paid by any American. This is out about 10 years from now, Mr. Speaker. About 10 years from now every single penny that every single American pays in taxes will be consumed by these four programs. These programs will be insolvent because there is no more money. Every other priority will have been squeezed out of the budget. And ``by every other priority,'' Mr. Speaker, I mean we are cutting transportation to zero, we are putting education to zero, we are cutting national parks to zero, we are cutting national security to zero. {time} 1400 This is not an academic conversation about balancing the budget. It is a national security conversation because we need to fund that priority. It is an education conversation because we need to fund that priority. It is an environment and parks conversation because we need to fund that priority. These mandatory spending programs threaten to consume every single penny of Federal revenue. Just to be clear, Mr. Speaker, in case there is any confusion, some folks say: Well, Rob, why don't you just raise more revenue? Let's just raise taxes on the American people, then we will have enough money to make that happen. Mr. Speaker, what I am showing you in this chart is, no, that won't solve the problem. This green line, I go from 2006 out to 2044 here, Mr. Speaker, and this green line represents historical revenue. When we hit this big economic downturn over the past 5 years, Mr. Speaker, revenues collapsed. It turns out if the American people can't find a job, the American people can't pay any taxes. That is pretty common sense. I say to my friends on the left, Mr. Speaker, if you want more taxes in the tax base, create more jobs. If folks have jobs, they can pay. When we ran out of jobs, we ran out of money, yet we spent even more because American families were hurting in that period of time. Well, I graphed this out to 2044, Mr. Speaker, and what you see is, under current law--this red line represents current law--if we add no new programs, if we don't spend any additional dollars, we just follow the current law, make no new promises to the American people, the spending required by current law more than doubles current revenues. So we are not talking about raising somebody's taxes a percent or two. We are talking about doubling everyone's taxes all across this country in every category. And when we do that, Mr. Speaker, that will solve the problem until about 2030, and then that won't be enough to fund it either. Taxes are not the problem. Our problem is that we are not raising enough money. Our problem is that current law is spending too much money, and we have got to come together to fix it. Well, now I get to the good news part of the presentation, Mr. Speaker. I am talking about bad news and the debt is squeezing out every other funding priority in America. I am talking about bad news that the major social programs of this Nation are fiscally insolvent. I am talking about bad news because there is just no way to tax the American people at a high enough rate to fund those priorities. The good news is we have come together in this body to work on the spending side together. Look at this, Mr. Speaker. It is unbelievable. Folks sometimes ask me back home, Mr. Speaker, they say: Rob, why do you take so many charts down to the House floor? Why are you down there talking about this? Do you know what my answer is? Because no one believes me. No one believes me. If you go home, Mr. Speaker--and I challenge you to do this. Go home and tell your constituents that when the big class of 2010 got here, when Republicans took over the House in 2011 and so we had divided government--again, as John Boehner always says, you can do big things in divided government. When Republicans took over the House, President Obama was leading the White House, we were spending $3.6 trillion as a nation--3.6 trillion. Now, the baby boomers began to retire in this window, so 10,000, Mr. Speaker, 10,000 men and women every day who had been paying Medicare and Social Security taxes their entire lives began applying for the benefits that they had earned through that lifetime of work. So we have Social Security and Medicare spending, two of the biggest categories of Federal spending, growing exponentially because of all these new applicants to the program, all these folks coming to cash in on their benefits. And what happened in divided government? We came together in this body in what is the best vote I have taken in 4\1/2\ years with a voting card, and we passed the Budget Control Act. I didn't get everything I wanted. My Republican colleagues didn't get everything they wanted; my Democratic friends didn't get everything they wanted; and the President didn't get everything he wanted; but we made a step forward for America, and we cut total Federal spending. We changed our priorities, Mr. Speaker. We began to look and see what was essential Federal spending and what was just kind of nice to do? What did we have to do to meet the promises we made to America, and where were those dollars that we weren't getting as much utility out of? So total Federal spending--not funny, Washington, D.C., math with inflation-adjusted dollars--total dollar bills going out the door from the Federal Government dropped from 2011 to 2012. I had never seen it before in my lifetime, Mr. Speaker, never seen it before in my lifetime. But we weren't done, because when you put 435 minds together in here, you really can do some neat things, Mr. Speaker. In divided government where we all have skin in the game, where we are all trying to [[Page H6970]] accomplish a goal, you can do some amazing things. So from 2012 to 2013, still with 10,000 men and women a day applying for new Social Security and Medicare benefits that they had earned, we cut total Federal spending again--again, not funny Washington, D.C., math, but reprioritizing what those goals were the American people sent us here to achieve and trying to achieve those goals, not because it is a mathematical exercise, but because if we don't, interest on our national debt is going to squeeze out all of the other priorities that we share as a nation. Mr. Speaker, 2 years in a row, while the population was growing, while the economy was struggling, and while seniors were retiring at a record pace, we came together and reprioritized Federal spending to unburden the next generation. Mr. Speaker, we couldn't do that alone as Republicans, and we couldn't have done that alone as Democrats. We could only do that working together, and we did, 2 years in a row, first time, Mr. Speaker, in anybody's lifetime on this floor. I have charted it a different way, Mr. Speaker, because we spend so much time beating up on each other as if we are failures. I tell folks back home that Congress has about a 12 percent approval rating, and we seem to use that entire 12 percent approval rating to tell everybody how awful we are: Oh, it is just terrible; folks can't get along; they all hate each other; everybody is on the take; and Washington is a giant cesspool. Please send me back for 2 more years. Where does that come from? What kind of sense does that make. We have had a lot of conscientious people on the floor of the House, Mr. Speaker, who leave their families and who leave their communities to come here on a mission that their constituents sent them to do, and in every category--I have charted three things here, Mr. Speaker. I have charted what we call discretionary spending, that is what most people think of as government: parks, courts, environment, transportation, and national security. All of those things that you think of as government, if you are on the green line in discretionary spending. This red line is the mandatory spending. That is the interest on the national debt: Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Those mandatory programs, dollars go out the door every year. This blue line is total spending across the whole government, Mr. Speaker. What I have shown here--and again, these are not inflation- adjusted dollars; these are actual dollar bills going out the door-- this dotted line in each category represents where the spending was going, where the Congressional Budget Office--again, it is a nonpartisan group of economists here--predicted the Federal Government was going to go when John Boehner took over as Speaker in 2011, before we had divided government, before we were able to come together and do big things. The solid line represents what is actually happening with Federal spending, what is actually happening. What you see, Mr. Speaker, is that even on the mandatory spending programs, we are getting reductions over what was anticipated. Certainly on the discretionary spending programs we are getting reductions over what was anticipated. In total Federal spending, we are getting reductions. Folks think nothing is happening here. They say: Rob, for Pete's sake, you have to go and you have to balance the budget. You have to make these things happen. I can't make everybody agree with me on everything. Put me and two or three other Members together, Mr. Speaker, give us all the powers of government, and we could probably solve this in a week or two. But there are 435 of us, and that is not all of us. That is just here. We have another 100 folks across the way in the Senate. Do you know what they say about the Senate, Mr. Speaker? They say the difference between a Senator and God is that God knows He is not a Senator. You have heard that one, haven't you? The power that is on the other side of the Hill has to be reckoned with, too, not to mention folks down at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. But we all got together, 100 of them, 435 of us, and 1 President at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and we bent the lines on spending. Now, is spending still going up, Mr. Speaker? It is. What you see here is that we have curtailed it inside our current window. It is the outyears where the rise really begins. Why is it rising? Look here. Discretionary spending, these are all of those priorities we talked about earlier, that is going down in kind of a flat line going out over the 10-year horizon. It is mandatory spending that is still going up. Even with the changes we have made, it is still going up. When we talk about what the problem is with spending in this country and we talk about what the challenge is with balancing the budget, it is not that we are spending a little money here or a little money there on education or transportation or the courts or the parks or even national defense. The problem is that you have promised me--I am in my forties, Mr. Speaker. You have promised me Social Security and Medicare benefits that you can't possibly live up to. There is no cash flow model that leaves enough money in the trust funds for me to access it when I retire, and you need to be honest with me and tell me that today while I have another 30 years to prepare for it. They did a survey of young people, Mr. Speaker. More young people in America, more millennials believe that they would see a UFO in their lifetime than see a Social Security check in their lifetime. Now, I have just told you this is the largest tax that most Americans pay, and we have so broken the trust with the American people as a spending body here in government that young people who are paying that giant FICA tax, the largest FICA tax in American history, they don't believe they will ever see a penny from it. We have made these changes together, Mr. Speaker. We can do better. We can make more. But the arguments that the American people are going to hear--and this is critically important. The arguments that the American people are going to hear over the next 4 months are going to be about $1 billion here and $1 billion there when we have a $100 trillion problem. The arguments that folks are going to hear over the next 4 months, Mr. Speaker, are all going to be focused on this sliver down here in the green area. This body is going to become consumed with nibbling around the edges on discretionary spending on which we have already succeeded. We have already begun the process of redefining those priorities. Where we haven't done enough is on mandatory spending. I have got to find a way, Mr. Speaker, we have got to find a way to come together to do the heavy lifting that is mandatory spending. No one is going to go to any senior in America and tell them that we are going to pull the rug out from under them now that they have already retired. Nobody is going to do that. Nobody is proposing that. Nobody is talking about that. And if you are a senior citizen in America, Mr. Speaker, rest assured that the only thing anyone is working on here is making sure the trust funds survive to pay you those benefits that have been promised. When we are talking about making changes, we are talking about making changes to my generation and younger folks to connect the reality, which is we can't afford those promises with the reality that I am still paying those taxes and redefining that relationship, Mr. Speaker, in a way that America can keep the promises. I don't mind delivering bad news to folks. You have to pay for what you want in this country. If you want more benefits, we will have to raise your taxes. If you want fewer benefits, we can cut your taxes. Right now, we are providing more benefits without raising taxes. We won't raise taxes on each other. We will raise taxes on our children and grandchildren instead. We won't cut benefits for each other. We cut benefits for our children and grandchildren instead. There is a better way forward, but we are going to find it together. Again, I put the charts up, Mr. Speaker, because folks won't believe it. These are actual dollars, not inflation-adjusted dollars. This chart represents the dollars that we have control over in this body, the dollars that we have to get together and decide on every year. Again, two-thirds of the budget goes out the door whether this body shows up for work or not. It is on autopilot. [[Page H6971]] The dollars that go out the door because we show up for work we have been reprioritizing, reallocating, and refocusing every single year. The result of that is a more effective and more efficient Federal Government to accomplish the priorities the American people have sent us here to accomplish, and we are borrowing less from our children and our grandchildren. It is a morality issue, Mr. Speaker. These are our Federal deficits. This is the money that we are borrowing from our children and our grandchildren. When George Bush was leaving office, and if he were here on the floor of the House today, Mr. Speaker, he would tell you, it was no source of pride for him as he was leaving office that he ran up the single largest deficit in American history. It was a Republican in the White House, it was Democrats running Capitol Hill, but together, in divided government, they came together and ran up the single largest annual deficit in American history. This one, Mr. Speaker, you can't see it, this little bitty one that is almost too small to read on the chart, this was once the largest deficit in American history. {time} 1415 Then we left divided government. We went to unified government where one party controlled everything, and we went to this deficit for 1 year and this deficit for the next year and this deficit for the next year, deficits, Mr. Speaker, two and three times larger than the deficit that George Bush set as the highest annual deficit in American history. Mr. Speaker, those were dark economic times for the country. Everybody has hindsight that is 20/20. No, I wouldn't have supported that spending had I been here at that time. I wasn't in Congress at that time. But those deficits are a reality. Those dollars have been borrowed. That money is now being repaid with interest every day of the week. I take that back. No, it is not. We don't repay a penny of our debt. I don't know if we have ever had that conversation. We don't repay a penny. Let's be clear. We pay interest on our national debt. We just keep borrowing. When a principal payment comes due, we borrow more money from someone else to pay back the interest and principal that we borrowed from somebody years ago. We don't pay back a penny. We just borrow more and more and more. These represent increasing borrowing amounts. Well, Mr. Speaker, this is the first budget that that class of 2010 got to work on together. This is the second. This is the third. This is the fourth. This is where we are right now. We are making progress together. We are doing this together not as a mathematical exercise, but as a moral imperative not to borrow and mortgage the future of our children and our grandchildren. We are headed in the right direction, but we have to do more. I don't want to look like I am patting us on the back, Mr. Speaker. The challenge is enormous. And, yes, we are grappling with it. But, look, this chart represents historical deficits back again as a percent of GDP. These other charts I showed you were in actual dollars going out the door. We use percent of GDP so we can kind of compare apples to apples because a dollar going out the door in 1942 would have been more money going out the door today. So we do it as a percent of the economy to try to make it be comparable. We go back here to 1965, Mr. Speaker. We borrow, borrow, borrow, borrow, borrow. Throughout all the 1980s we borrowed. Do you remember those conversations in the 1980s, Mr. Speaker, where folks thought Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill and Congress were going to borrow us into oblivion? We thought the 1980s were the dark days of Federal spending because we were running up deficits that were so large. Here those are, Mr. Speaker, these, what looked like high points then, but turned out to be low points by more recent history standards. These are those 1980 deficits. These are the early Clinton deficits. These surpluses are the successes that Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton had together, again, divided government producing results. We went back to unified government here with not-so-good results. We went to divided government. Now we are getting back on track. But if you look at--and I project it another 10 years out, Mr. Speaker. If we do nothing, deficits begin to rise again. Under current law, if we do nothing, deficits begin to rise again. Yes, we have come together on the Budget Control Act and we have done amazing things. We have come together to end what was called the sustainable growth rate. They call it the doc fix. I don't know why they call it that. It was a patient fix. It was this gimmick in law that was undermining healthcare security for all seniors. We came together and we fixed that. We made changes to the Medicare program that both solved a current problem and prevented future problems. Reinvesting more money in the trust fund, putting off those deficits, we can do those things together. But we have got to start now, Mr. Speaker. Again, we are going to talk over the next 4 months about $1 billion here and $1 billion there. I want to talk about $1 trillion here and $1 trillion there. This chart, Mr. Speaker, represents the nature of our challenge. If we want to get back to what I would call Federal debt levels that are historically normal, if it is okay to confess that, yes, we have a chart that says: As America, let's not have debt that is incredibly high. Let's just have debt that is kind of an average high. That is what we are going to define as success, just an average high debt, average dangerous debt. We are going to define that as success. And to get to that point, Mr. Speaker, if we start today, we are going to have to deal with about 1.1 percent of GDP. That is going to be the size of the change. We are going to have to deal with about 1 percent of the size of the entire economy. What is that going to be? A 1 percent increase in taxes? A 1 percent reduction in spending? No. It is much larger than that. GDP is the entire American economy. Federal spending and Federal taxes are just a very small part of that. When we talk about moving the needle on 1 percent of GDP, we are talking about big, big dollars. It is a huge challenge, huge challenge, if we started today. The tale I am telling, Mr. Speaker, is, if we wait 5 years, the challenge gets 30 percent harder. It is a huge challenge today. Some would argue it is an insurmountable challenge today. If we fail to address it today, Mr. Speaker, it will be 30 percent harder just 5 years down the road. Mr. Speaker, wait 10 years down the road and it is almost twice as hard. It is almost twice as hard to conquer 10 years down the road. We don't talk about Social Security going bankrupt in 2035 because we are trying to be alarmists. We talk about it going bankrupt in 2035 because the time to solve that is today. We talk about Medicare going bankrupt in 2030 not to be alarmists, but because the time to solve that is today. These funding challenges that we have are hard today. They are twice as hard tomorrow. We have got to find the courage today to come together and make these changes. Now, that is to keep things as they are. If what you want to do is to make things better, you see, the challenge is even harder. If what you want to do is begin to pay some debt back, the challenges are even larger. I am not setting my sights on the big line, Mr. Speaker. I am trying to focus on the little line because success begets success. When we came together and solved the Budget Control Act, we were then able to come together and solve the Medicare challenge. When we came together and solved the Medicare challenge, we were then able to come together and solve our defense challenge. One time and one time and one time and one time. When you wake up 365 days later, you find out you have really gotten some work done. There are a lot of numbers on this chart, Mr. Speaker, and I will send you a copy of it. But we are talking about a 14 percent revenue increase or a 13 percent spending increase today, today, to begin this process. The size of our challenge today, the challenge that I said was easy, the challenge that I said we could achieve together, the challenge that I said divided government gave us an opportunity to be successful at, that is a 14 percent revenue increase, 14 percent tax hike today, or a 13 percent spending cut today. And then we are going to [[Page H6972]] need to do it again next year and again next year and again the year after that. This is the easy challenge, Mr. Speaker. We have come together to create the largest deficit reduction package in the history of the country. Republicans, Democrats, Congress, the White House, we did it. We have time to do it again. I know there is an election year coming. I know folks want to focus on who is going to win in November. I know folks want Democrats to try to take over Congress or Republicans to try to take over the White House. I know that is the national conversation. But whichever side of that battle you pick, wouldn't your candidate be advantaged if Republicans and Democrats had been successful for the American people on yet another big challenge? There is only one way forward, and it is hard. There is only one way forward, and it is together. Please let us not burn bridges quibbling over $1 billion here and $1 billion there over the next 4 months. One billion dollars is a lot of money, a lot of money. But our problems are trillion-dollar problems, and I want us to join together to solve them because I know that we can. With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [House] [Pages H6967-H6972] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] BALANCING THE BUDGET The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the recognition. I appreciate you staying on the floor with me today. It has been a week of inside-the-beltway activity. I can't find a single Member of Congress on this floor--and I have been talking to a lot of them--who ran for Congress because they thought the most important job we were going to have was picking our House leadership. It is an important responsibility. It is an important job, Mr. Speaker. I can't tell you how difficult it is to lead 435 leaders. It is not a shortage of leaders we have here. Sometimes it is a shortage of good followers we have here. But nobody ran for Congress for that. You ran for Congress because we had serious business that the American people asked us to be about, and most of that business is not inside leadership conversations. It is about the American economy. It is about feeding one's family. It is about having a predictable future for one's children. It is about opportunity. I want to begin, Mr. Speaker, with three of the challenges that are out in front of us. The reason good leadership in this institution is important is because we have serious challenges. When I got here in 2011, we elected John Boehner Speaker of the House because John Boehner said we can do amazing things in divided government. We don't have to sit back and wait until we control all branches of government as Republicans. The Democrats don't have to sit back and wait until they control everything, Mr. Speaker. We can do amazing things together, and that is exactly what he did. {time} 1345 And we did it around finding those things on which Americans agree. I have up here the looming insolvencies for our major social safety net programs, Mr. Speaker. Social Security Disability Insurance reaches insolvency next year, next year. It is not 20 years from now, not 10 years from now. It is next year. If you are an American and you are counting on Social Security Disability Insurance to provide for you and your family because you have paid into it faithfully your entire career--forbid the thought something has happened to you, now you must rely on it--we have a cash flow situation next year leading to insolvency. That is the smallest of our concerns, Mr. Speaker. We go next to Medicare, insolvent in 2030. Medicare. Social Security, insolvent in 2035. Social Security and Medicare, as you know, Mr. Speaker, are funded by payroll taxes. Payroll taxes are that FICA line on our pay stubs. It is the largest tax, at 15.3 percent of every worker's paycheck in this country. It is the largest tax that most American families pay. I want you to think about that. Here we are talking about earning the American people's trust. Here we are talking about delivering for the American people on their priorities. The largest tax that most Americans pay goes to fund two programs that we [[Page H6968]] know with certainty, as we sit here today, aren't going to survive in their current configuration. The cash flow just won't allow it. But, Mr. Speaker, I am not here to preach doom and gloom. I am here to preach opportunity. I am preaching opportunity because I work with 434 other people here who also believe that, if we work together, we can do amazing things for the American people. I have got a chart here, Mr. Speaker. You can't see it from your perch. But it is the projected economic growth rates in this country. Again, I am trying to distinguish what is happening in terms of a leadership discussion here from what is happening in a broader leadership discussion about America. And what I show here is that year after year after year for the past--I have 3 years represented here on the screen, Mr. Speaker, but it goes back 5 years. Every year the Congressional Budget Office--that group of economists that help us to craft the numbers in a bipartisan way--every year the Congressional Budget Office reports that their anticipated economic growth for America is lower in this year than it was the year before. And it was lower last year than the year before that. And it was lower that year than the year before that. When we fail to succeed together, Mr. Speaker, it is not an academic conversation. When we succeed in the wrong way, it is not an oops moment. It has a real impact on economic growth in this country. These may be colors on a chart, Mr. Speaker, but what they represent are jobs for families. What they represent are manufacturers who decided to stay in America or leave America. What they represent are entrepreneurs who either succeeded in their business or who were crushed by regulatory burdens. These decisions we make have consequences, Mr. Speaker. I have an interest rate chart here. You can't tell, but what you would see if you could see it, Mr. Speaker, is that we are borrowing money today at the lowest interest rate in American history. It is virtually free. It is virtually free today because we have the best of all the worst economies on the planet. Folks are interested in buying our debt. Right now there are stories in The Wall Street Journal about the Germans dumping our debt, about the Chinese dumping our debt. But because markets are frightened around the globe, there is more demand than there are folks selling. I put the interest rates up, Mr. Speaker, because I am talking about solving big problems today. We are going to talk about big problems. We are going to talk about solutions that we have come to here in this body. But too often, when we talk about balancing the budget, it sounds like it is a numbers game. The only numbers game balancing the budget is the numbers game 320 million because that is how many Americans live in this country and are counting on us to succeed for them. When we borrow money, we end up paying interest on that money. I am so weary of the political ecochamber, Mr. Speaker, that tells the story of the folks on the left who say, ``I want every program in America to succeed, and, in fact, I want to spend even more on it'' or the folks on the right who say, ``I will never ever raise your taxes. You don't have to pay for those programs that you want.'' Because both sides are wrong. What I have here, Mr. Speaker, is a chart of the interest that we are paying on our national debt today. Now, we will talk about the interest we are going to be paying 10 years from now if we don't solve the problem. But this red line represents the interest we are paying on our national debt today: $229 billion this year. Balancing the budget is not an academic conversation. Balancing the budget is the difference between spending $229 billion on interest on the debt versus other American priorities. You can't see it, Mr. Speaker, but education is represented by this blue line. I want you to see that. The Federal Government spends more money in interest on our national debt. Even though we borrowed that money at the lowest interest rates in American history, teaser rates, we spend more in interest on our national debt than we spend on education for our children. We are trying to pass a transportation bill right now, Mr. Speaker. We are trying to put people back to work in America building roads so that we will have the best infrastructure in the world, so that we will move goods and services to market better than any other nation in the world, so that we can have our people moving from place to place, creating jobs and economic activity better than anyplace else in the world. We spend half. Half of what we spend on interest payments this year we will spend on transportation, Mr. Speaker. We spend the same amount on interest payments in 2015 that we will spend on education and transportation combined. I want you to think about that, Mr. Speaker. We could double the spending on education in this country, as my friends on the left propose to do. We could double spending on transportation in this country, as my friends on the left propose to do, if we would balance the budget and get out of the interest payment business, as my friends on the right propose to do. This is a common goal. This is a shared focus. This is not something that divides us. This is something that unites us. Environment and natural resources: $41 billion is being spent by the Federal Government this year. We spend five times more than that on interest payments. Science, space, and technology, Mr. Speaker: Who is going to have that next manned mission to space? Who is going to be the first to have a human being on Mars? What are we going to learn out beyond the stars? We spend one-tenth the amount of our interest payments on that priority. Energy policy: How many times have we heard the refrain ``an all-of- the-above energy policy. Let's find next-generation energy solutions. Let's focus on wind and solar and fuel cells''? I don't dispute any of that. I dispute the commitment that we have to it when we spend 23 times more on interest payments than we spend on all energy policy combined. When I am talking about balancing the budget, Mr. Speaker, when I am talking about making tough choices, I am not talking about an academic conversation about making the numbers balance. I am talking about a reordering of American priorities, where we would rather spend money on our children, on our roads, on our environment, on exploration, on next-generation energy, than we would paying back debts of the past. We are going to make good on our debts. But we can control whether or not we are paying those debts down or whether we are running those debts up. Interest that we pay on our national debt isn't a number on a ledger. It is a category that pushes out so many other American priorities. That is this year, Mr. Speaker. This chart represents this year. If you fast-forward 10 years, under current law, we will be spending more on our national debt than we spend on national security. I don't mean paying back our debt, Mr. Speaker. I mean we will be spending more in interest payments on our national debt than we will be spending protecting the national security of the United States of America. That is why the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mullen, said the largest threat to America's national security is rising debt, because our debt and the accompanying interest payments are squeezing out so many other American priorities. Mr. Speaker, folks don't understand how the American budget works. I put a pie chart up here that captures that. We are going to get into some pretty serious debates here on the floor of this House in the next couple of months, primarily about something that we call discretionary spending. Discretionary spending I have represented up here, Mr. Speaker, by blue pie slices on the pie chart. Defense and nondefense spending are the two big categories, which means defense and almost everything else you think of as the Federal Government. Those are the decisions--these in blue, Mr. Speaker--that you and I have to make every year. That distinguishes it from these decisions in red. Social Security spending, Medicare spending, Medicaid spending, interest on the national debt, other mandatory [[Page H6969]] programs. These programs in red, Mr. Speaker, as you know, we won't revisit those this year. Yes. The Constitution requires that every dollar appropriated from the Treasury be appropriated from the House. But the House, in 1935, decided that some of these dollars needed to go out the door, and they are still going out the door today. We can't change it without passing a new bill in the House, a new bill in the Senate, and a new bill that the President signs. We spend all of our time in this body, Mr. Speaker, arguing about nibbling around the edges on the blue categories of the chart, which is the small third of the pie. The real challenge in balancing the budget lies in these red slices of the pie, and I am going to tell you why. What I have charted here is a look at revenues in this country as a percent of GDP. So often we measure our success against the size of the economy. What are we spending relative to the size of the economy? Because if our population grows, if the economy grows, of course our tax base will grow. And so, too, in many cases will our expenses grow. So we chart these things against the size of the economy. This red line represents our historic revenues going back to 1965: all of the taxes through the Nixon administration, into the Ford administration, Carter administration, Reagan administration, all the way through to today. In fact, we chart it out into 2045. When you see this line go flat on revenues, Mr. Speaker, it is because we are just predicting they are level as a percent of the economy. But what I have also charted are the spending priorities that were in the red slice of the pie shown earlier, the mandatory spending slices of the pie. This blue line represents Medicaid and other Federal healthcare expenditures, like the President's Affordable Care Act. This green line represents Medicare, created in 1965. It used to be nonexistent. Now it is a very large slice of the pie. Again, it represents some of the largest taxes that the American people pay. This light section here represents Social Security, Mr. Speaker, and this blue line represents net interest. Mr. Speaker, if you could see it out on the end of this chart, what you would see is Medicaid spending is growing quickly, but on a predictable line. Medicare spending is growing quickly, but on a predictable line. Social Security spending is almost flat, Mr. Speaker, even though it is a big part of the pie. What is growing is interest payments. And when the blue line crosses the red line, that is where these four programs--interest on the national debt, Social Security payments, Medicare payments, and Medicaid payments--where those programs alone consume every single penny in any tax paid by any American. This is out about 10 years from now, Mr. Speaker. About 10 years from now every single penny that every single American pays in taxes will be consumed by these four programs. These programs will be insolvent because there is no more money. Every other priority will have been squeezed out of the budget. And ``by every other priority,'' Mr. Speaker, I mean we are cutting transportation to zero, we are putting education to zero, we are cutting national parks to zero, we are cutting national security to zero. {time} 1400 This is not an academic conversation about balancing the budget. It is a national security conversation because we need to fund that priority. It is an education conversation because we need to fund that priority. It is an environment and parks conversation because we need to fund that priority. These mandatory spending programs threaten to consume every single penny of Federal revenue. Just to be clear, Mr. Speaker, in case there is any confusion, some folks say: Well, Rob, why don't you just raise more revenue? Let's just raise taxes on the American people, then we will have enough money to make that happen. Mr. Speaker, what I am showing you in this chart is, no, that won't solve the problem. This green line, I go from 2006 out to 2044 here, Mr. Speaker, and this green line represents historical revenue. When we hit this big economic downturn over the past 5 years, Mr. Speaker, revenues collapsed. It turns out if the American people can't find a job, the American people can't pay any taxes. That is pretty common sense. I say to my friends on the left, Mr. Speaker, if you want more taxes in the tax base, create more jobs. If folks have jobs, they can pay. When we ran out of jobs, we ran out of money, yet we spent even more because American families were hurting in that period of time. Well, I graphed this out to 2044, Mr. Speaker, and what you see is, under current law--this red line represents current law--if we add no new programs, if we don't spend any additional dollars, we just follow the current law, make no new promises to the American people, the spending required by current law more than doubles current revenues. So we are not talking about raising somebody's taxes a percent or two. We are talking about doubling everyone's taxes all across this country in every category. And when we do that, Mr. Speaker, that will solve the problem until about 2030, and then that won't be enough to fund it either. Taxes are not the problem. Our problem is that we are not raising enough money. Our problem is that current law is spending too much money, and we have got to come together to fix it. Well, now I get to the good news part of the presentation, Mr. Speaker. I am talking about bad news and the debt is squeezing out every other funding priority in America. I am talking about bad news that the major social programs of this Nation are fiscally insolvent. I am talking about bad news because there is just no way to tax the American people at a high enough rate to fund those priorities. The good news is we have come together in this body to work on the spending side together. Look at this, Mr. Speaker. It is unbelievable. Folks sometimes ask me back home, Mr. Speaker, they say: Rob, why do you take so many charts down to the House floor? Why are you down there talking about this? Do you know what my answer is? Because no one believes me. No one believes me. If you go home, Mr. Speaker--and I challenge you to do this. Go home and tell your constituents that when the big class of 2010 got here, when Republicans took over the House in 2011 and so we had divided government--again, as John Boehner always says, you can do big things in divided government. When Republicans took over the House, President Obama was leading the White House, we were spending $3.6 trillion as a nation--3.6 trillion. Now, the baby boomers began to retire in this window, so 10,000, Mr. Speaker, 10,000 men and women every day who had been paying Medicare and Social Security taxes their entire lives began applying for the benefits that they had earned through that lifetime of work. So we have Social Security and Medicare spending, two of the biggest categories of Federal spending, growing exponentially because of all these new applicants to the program, all these folks coming to cash in on their benefits. And what happened in divided government? We came together in this body in what is the best vote I have taken in 4\1/2\ years with a voting card, and we passed the Budget Control Act. I didn't get everything I wanted. My Republican colleagues didn't get everything they wanted; my Democratic friends didn't get everything they wanted; and the President didn't get everything he wanted; but we made a step forward for America, and we cut total Federal spending. We changed our priorities, Mr. Speaker. We began to look and see what was essential Federal spending and what was just kind of nice to do? What did we have to do to meet the promises we made to America, and where were those dollars that we weren't getting as much utility out of? So total Federal spending--not funny, Washington, D.C., math with inflation-adjusted dollars--total dollar bills going out the door from the Federal Government dropped from 2011 to 2012. I had never seen it before in my lifetime, Mr. Speaker, never seen it before in my lifetime. But we weren't done, because when you put 435 minds together in here, you really can do some neat things, Mr. Speaker. In divided government where we all have skin in the game, where we are all trying to [[Page H6970]] accomplish a goal, you can do some amazing things. So from 2012 to 2013, still with 10,000 men and women a day applying for new Social Security and Medicare benefits that they had earned, we cut total Federal spending again--again, not funny Washington, D.C., math, but reprioritizing what those goals were the American people sent us here to achieve and trying to achieve those goals, not because it is a mathematical exercise, but because if we don't, interest on our national debt is going to squeeze out all of the other priorities that we share as a nation. Mr. Speaker, 2 years in a row, while the population was growing, while the economy was struggling, and while seniors were retiring at a record pace, we came together and reprioritized Federal spending to unburden the next generation. Mr. Speaker, we couldn't do that alone as Republicans, and we couldn't have done that alone as Democrats. We could only do that working together, and we did, 2 years in a row, first time, Mr. Speaker, in anybody's lifetime on this floor. I have charted it a different way, Mr. Speaker, because we spend so much time beating up on each other as if we are failures. I tell folks back home that Congress has about a 12 percent approval rating, and we seem to use that entire 12 percent approval rating to tell everybody how awful we are: Oh, it is just terrible; folks can't get along; they all hate each other; everybody is on the take; and Washington is a giant cesspool. Please send me back for 2 more years. Where does that come from? What kind of sense does that make. We have had a lot of conscientious people on the floor of the House, Mr. Speaker, who leave their families and who leave their communities to come here on a mission that their constituents sent them to do, and in every category--I have charted three things here, Mr. Speaker. I have charted what we call discretionary spending, that is what most people think of as government: parks, courts, environment, transportation, and national security. All of those things that you think of as government, if you are on the green line in discretionary spending. This red line is the mandatory spending. That is the interest on the national debt: Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Those mandatory programs, dollars go out the door every year. This blue line is total spending across the whole government, Mr. Speaker. What I have shown here--and again, these are not inflation- adjusted dollars; these are actual dollar bills going out the door-- this dotted line in each category represents where the spending was going, where the Congressional Budget Office--again, it is a nonpartisan group of economists here--predicted the Federal Government was going to go when John Boehner took over as Speaker in 2011, before we had divided government, before we were able to come together and do big things. The solid line represents what is actually happening with Federal spending, what is actually happening. What you see, Mr. Speaker, is that even on the mandatory spending programs, we are getting reductions over what was anticipated. Certainly on the discretionary spending programs we are getting reductions over what was anticipated. In total Federal spending, we are getting reductions. Folks think nothing is happening here. They say: Rob, for Pete's sake, you have to go and you have to balance the budget. You have to make these things happen. I can't make everybody agree with me on everything. Put me and two or three other Members together, Mr. Speaker, give us all the powers of government, and we could probably solve this in a week or two. But there are 435 of us, and that is not all of us. That is just here. We have another 100 folks across the way in the Senate. Do you know what they say about the Senate, Mr. Speaker? They say the difference between a Senator and God is that God knows He is not a Senator. You have heard that one, haven't you? The power that is on the other side of the Hill has to be reckoned with, too, not to mention folks down at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. But we all got together, 100 of them, 435 of us, and 1 President at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and we bent the lines on spending. Now, is spending still going up, Mr. Speaker? It is. What you see here is that we have curtailed it inside our current window. It is the outyears where the rise really begins. Why is it rising? Look here. Discretionary spending, these are all of those priorities we talked about earlier, that is going down in kind of a flat line going out over the 10-year horizon. It is mandatory spending that is still going up. Even with the changes we have made, it is still going up. When we talk about what the problem is with spending in this country and we talk about what the challenge is with balancing the budget, it is not that we are spending a little money here or a little money there on education or transportation or the courts or the parks or even national defense. The problem is that you have promised me--I am in my forties, Mr. Speaker. You have promised me Social Security and Medicare benefits that you can't possibly live up to. There is no cash flow model that leaves enough money in the trust funds for me to access it when I retire, and you need to be honest with me and tell me that today while I have another 30 years to prepare for it. They did a survey of young people, Mr. Speaker. More young people in America, more millennials believe that they would see a UFO in their lifetime than see a Social Security check in their lifetime. Now, I have just told you this is the largest tax that most Americans pay, and we have so broken the trust with the American people as a spending body here in government that young people who are paying that giant FICA tax, the largest FICA tax in American history, they don't believe they will ever see a penny from it. We have made these changes together, Mr. Speaker. We can do better. We can make more. But the arguments that the American people are going to hear--and this is critically important. The arguments that the American people are going to hear over the next 4 months are going to be about $1 billion here and $1 billion there when we have a $100 trillion problem. The arguments that folks are going to hear over the next 4 months, Mr. Speaker, are all going to be focused on this sliver down here in the green area. This body is going to become consumed with nibbling around the edges on discretionary spending on which we have already succeeded. We have already begun the process of redefining those priorities. Where we haven't done enough is on mandatory spending. I have got to find a way, Mr. Speaker, we have got to find a way to come together to do the heavy lifting that is mandatory spending. No one is going to go to any senior in America and tell them that we are going to pull the rug out from under them now that they have already retired. Nobody is going to do that. Nobody is proposing that. Nobody is talking about that. And if you are a senior citizen in America, Mr. Speaker, rest assured that the only thing anyone is working on here is making sure the trust funds survive to pay you those benefits that have been promised. When we are talking about making changes, we are talking about making changes to my generation and younger folks to connect the reality, which is we can't afford those promises with the reality that I am still paying those taxes and redefining that relationship, Mr. Speaker, in a way that America can keep the promises. I don't mind delivering bad news to folks. You have to pay for what you want in this country. If you want more benefits, we will have to raise your taxes. If you want fewer benefits, we can cut your taxes. Right now, we are providing more benefits without raising taxes. We won't raise taxes on each other. We will raise taxes on our children and grandchildren instead. We won't cut benefits for each other. We cut benefits for our children and grandchildren instead. There is a better way forward, but we are going to find it together. Again, I put the charts up, Mr. Speaker, because folks won't believe it. These are actual dollars, not inflation-adjusted dollars. This chart represents the dollars that we have control over in this body, the dollars that we have to get together and decide on every year. Again, two-thirds of the budget goes out the door whether this body shows up for work or not. It is on autopilot. [[Page H6971]] The dollars that go out the door because we show up for work we have been reprioritizing, reallocating, and refocusing every single year. The result of that is a more effective and more efficient Federal Government to accomplish the priorities the American people have sent us here to accomplish, and we are borrowing less from our children and our grandchildren. It is a morality issue, Mr. Speaker. These are our Federal deficits. This is the money that we are borrowing from our children and our grandchildren. When George Bush was leaving office, and if he were here on the floor of the House today, Mr. Speaker, he would tell you, it was no source of pride for him as he was leaving office that he ran up the single largest deficit in American history. It was a Republican in the White House, it was Democrats running Capitol Hill, but together, in divided government, they came together and ran up the single largest annual deficit in American history. This one, Mr. Speaker, you can't see it, this little bitty one that is almost too small to read on the chart, this was once the largest deficit in American history. {time} 1415 Then we left divided government. We went to unified government where one party controlled everything, and we went to this deficit for 1 year and this deficit for the next year and this deficit for the next year, deficits, Mr. Speaker, two and three times larger than the deficit that George Bush set as the highest annual deficit in American history. Mr. Speaker, those were dark economic times for the country. Everybody has hindsight that is 20/20. No, I wouldn't have supported that spending had I been here at that time. I wasn't in Congress at that time. But those deficits are a reality. Those dollars have been borrowed. That money is now being repaid with interest every day of the week. I take that back. No, it is not. We don't repay a penny of our debt. I don't know if we have ever had that conversation. We don't repay a penny. Let's be clear. We pay interest on our national debt. We just keep borrowing. When a principal payment comes due, we borrow more money from someone else to pay back the interest and principal that we borrowed from somebody years ago. We don't pay back a penny. We just borrow more and more and more. These represent increasing borrowing amounts. Well, Mr. Speaker, this is the first budget that that class of 2010 got to work on together. This is the second. This is the third. This is the fourth. This is where we are right now. We are making progress together. We are doing this together not as a mathematical exercise, but as a moral imperative not to borrow and mortgage the future of our children and our grandchildren. We are headed in the right direction, but we have to do more. I don't want to look like I am patting us on the back, Mr. Speaker. The challenge is enormous. And, yes, we are grappling with it. But, look, this chart represents historical deficits back again as a percent of GDP. These other charts I showed you were in actual dollars going out the door. We use percent of GDP so we can kind of compare apples to apples because a dollar going out the door in 1942 would have been more money going out the door today. So we do it as a percent of the economy to try to make it be comparable. We go back here to 1965, Mr. Speaker. We borrow, borrow, borrow, borrow, borrow. Throughout all the 1980s we borrowed. Do you remember those conversations in the 1980s, Mr. Speaker, where folks thought Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill and Congress were going to borrow us into oblivion? We thought the 1980s were the dark days of Federal spending because we were running up deficits that were so large. Here those are, Mr. Speaker, these, what looked like high points then, but turned out to be low points by more recent history standards. These are those 1980 deficits. These are the early Clinton deficits. These surpluses are the successes that Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton had together, again, divided government producing results. We went back to unified government here with not-so-good results. We went to divided government. Now we are getting back on track. But if you look at--and I project it another 10 years out, Mr. Speaker. If we do nothing, deficits begin to rise again. Under current law, if we do nothing, deficits begin to rise again. Yes, we have come together on the Budget Control Act and we have done amazing things. We have come together to end what was called the sustainable growth rate. They call it the doc fix. I don't know why they call it that. It was a patient fix. It was this gimmick in law that was undermining healthcare security for all seniors. We came together and we fixed that. We made changes to the Medicare program that both solved a current problem and prevented future problems. Reinvesting more money in the trust fund, putting off those deficits, we can do those things together. But we have got to start now, Mr. Speaker. Again, we are going to talk over the next 4 months about $1 billion here and $1 billion there. I want to talk about $1 trillion here and $1 trillion there. This chart, Mr. Speaker, represents the nature of our challenge. If we want to get back to what I would call Federal debt levels that are historically normal, if it is okay to confess that, yes, we have a chart that says: As America, let's not have debt that is incredibly high. Let's just have debt that is kind of an average high. That is what we are going to define as success, just an average high debt, average dangerous debt. We are going to define that as success. And to get to that point, Mr. Speaker, if we start today, we are going to have to deal with about 1.1 percent of GDP. That is going to be the size of the change. We are going to have to deal with about 1 percent of the size of the entire economy. What is that going to be? A 1 percent increase in taxes? A 1 percent reduction in spending? No. It is much larger than that. GDP is the entire American economy. Federal spending and Federal taxes are just a very small part of that. When we talk about moving the needle on 1 percent of GDP, we are talking about big, big dollars. It is a huge challenge, huge challenge, if we started today. The tale I am telling, Mr. Speaker, is, if we wait 5 years, the challenge gets 30 percent harder. It is a huge challenge today. Some would argue it is an insurmountable challenge today. If we fail to address it today, Mr. Speaker, it will be 30 percent harder just 5 years down the road. Mr. Speaker, wait 10 years down the road and it is almost twice as hard. It is almost twice as hard to conquer 10 years down the road. We don't talk about Social Security going bankrupt in 2035 because we are trying to be alarmists. We talk about it going bankrupt in 2035 because the time to solve that is today. We talk about Medicare going bankrupt in 2030 not to be alarmists, but because the time to solve that is today. These funding challenges that we have are hard today. They are twice as hard tomorrow. We have got to find the courage today to come together and make these changes. Now, that is to keep things as they are. If what you want to do is to make things better, you see, the challenge is even harder. If what you want to do is begin to pay some debt back, the challenges are even larger. I am not setting my sights on the big line, Mr. Speaker. I am trying to focus on the little line because success begets success. When we came together and solved the Budget Control Act, we were then able to come together and solve the Medicare challenge. When we came together and solved the Medicare challenge, we were then able to come together and solve our defense challenge. One time and one time and one time and one time. When you wake up 365 days later, you find out you have really gotten some work done. There are a lot of numbers on this chart, Mr. Speaker, and I will send you a copy of it. But we are talking about a 14 percent revenue increase or a 13 percent spending increase today, today, to begin this process. The size of our challenge today, the challenge that I said was easy, the challenge that I said we could achieve together, the challenge that I said divided government gave us an opportunity to be successful at, that is a 14 percent revenue increase, 14 percent tax hike today, or a 13 percent spending cut today. And then we are going to [[Page H6972]] need to do it again next year and again next year and again the year after that. This is the easy challenge, Mr. Speaker. We have come together to create the largest deficit reduction package in the history of the country. Republicans, Democrats, Congress, the White House, we did it. We have time to do it again. I know there is an election year coming. I know folks want to focus on who is going to win in November. I know folks want Democrats to try to take over Congress or Republicans to try to take over the White House. I know that is the national conversation. But whichever side of that battle you pick, wouldn't your candidate be advantaged if Republicans and Democrats had been successful for the American people on yet another big challenge? There is only one way forward, and it is hard. There is only one way forward, and it is together. Please let us not burn bridges quibbling over $1 billion here and $1 billion there over the next 4 months. One billion dollars is a lot of money, a lot of money. But our problems are trillion-dollar problems, and I want us to join together to solve them because I know that we can. With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",package_114_232.csv,37958,37958,38027,"[congressional record volume 161, number 149 (friday, october 9, 2015)] [house] [pages h6967-h6972] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] balancing the budget the speaker pro tempore. under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the gentleman from georgia (mr. woodall) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader. mr. woodall. mr. speaker, i appreciate the recognition. i appreciate you staying on the floor with me today. it has been a week of inside-the-beltway activity. i can't find a single member of congress on this floor--and i have been talking to a lot of them--who ran for congress because they thought the most important job we were going to have was picking our house leadership. it is an important responsibility. it is an important job, mr. speaker. i can't tell you how difficult it is to lead 435 leaders. it is not a shortage of leaders we have here. sometimes it is a shortage of good followers we have here. but nobody ran for congress for that. you ran for congress because we had serious business that the american people asked us to be about, and most of that business is not inside leadership conversations. it is about the american economy. it is about feeding one's family. it is about having a predictable future for one's children. it is about opportunity. i want to begin, mr. speaker, with three of the challenges that are out in front of us. the reason good leadership in this institution is important is because we have serious challenges. when i got here in 2011, we elected john boehner speaker of the house because john boehner said we can do amazing things in divided government. we don't have to sit back and wait until we control all branches of government as republicans. the democrats don't have to sit back and wait until they control everything, mr. speaker. we can do amazing things together, and that is exactly what he did. {time} 1345 and we did it around finding those things on which americans agree. i have up here the looming insolvencies for our major social safety net programs, mr. speaker. social security disability insurance reaches insolvency next year, next year. it is not 20 years from now, not 10 years from now. it is next year. if you are an american and you are counting on social security disability insurance to provide for you and your family because you have paid into it faithfully your entire career--forbid the thought something has happened to you, now you must rely on it--we have a cash flow situation next year leading to insolvency. that is the smallest of our concerns, mr. speaker. we go next to medicare, insolvent in 2030. medicare. social security, insolvent in 2035. social security and medicare, as you know, mr. speaker, are funded by payroll taxes. payroll taxes are that fica line on our pay stubs. it is the largest tax, at 15.3 percent of every worker's paycheck in this country. it is the largest tax that most american families pay. i want you to think about that. here we are talking about earning the american people's trust. here we are talking about delivering for the american people on their priorities. the largest tax that most americans pay goes to fund two programs that we [[page h6968]] know with certainty, as we sit here today, aren't going to survive in their current configuration. the cash flow just won't allow it. but, mr. speaker, i am not here to preach doom and gloom. i am here to preach opportunity. i am preaching opportunity because i work with 434 other people here who also believe that, if we work together, we can do amazing things for the american people. i have got a chart here, mr. speaker. you can't see it from your perch. but it is the projected economic growth rates in this country. again, i am trying to distinguish what is happening in terms of a leadership discussion here from what is happening in a broader leadership discussion about america. and what i show here is that year after year after year for the past--i have 3 years represented here on the screen, mr. speaker, but it goes back 5 years. every year the congressional budget office--that group of economists that help us to craft the numbers in a bipartisan way--every year the congressional budget office reports that their anticipated economic growth for america is lower in this year than it was the year before. and it was lower last year than the year before that. and it was lower that year than the year before that. when we fail to succeed together, mr. speaker, it is not an academic conversation. when we succeed in the wrong way, it is not an oops moment. it has a real impact on economic growth in this country. these may be colors on a chart, mr. speaker, but what they represent are jobs for families. what they represent are manufacturers who decided to stay in america or leave america. what they represent are entrepreneurs who either succeeded in their business or who were crushed by regulatory burdens. these decisions we make have consequences, mr. speaker. i have an interest rate chart here. you can't tell, but what you would see if you could see it, mr. speaker, is that we are borrowing money today at the lowest interest rate in american history. it is virtually free. it is virtually free today because we have the best of all the worst economies on the planet. folks are interested in buying our debt. right now there are stories in the wall street journal about the germans dumping our debt, about the chinese dumping our debt. but because markets are frightened around the globe, there is more demand than there are folks selling. i put the interest rates up, mr. speaker, because i am talking about solving big problems today. we are going to talk about big problems. we are going to talk about solutions that we have come to here in this body. but too often, when we talk about balancing the budget, it sounds like it is a numbers game. the only numbers game balancing the budget is the numbers game 320 million because that is how many americans live in this country and are counting on us to succeed for them. when we borrow money, we end up paying interest on that money. i am so weary of the political ecochamber, mr. speaker, that tells the story of the folks on the left who say, ``i want every program in america to succeed, and, in fact, i want to spend even more on it'' or the folks on the right who say, ``i will never ever raise your taxes. you don't have to pay for those programs that you want.'' because both sides are wrong. what i have here, mr. speaker, is a chart of the interest that we are paying on our national debt today. now, we will talk about the interest we are going to be paying 10 years from now if we don't solve the problem. but this red line represents the interest we are paying on our national debt today: $229 billion this year. balancing the budget is not an academic conversation. balancing the budget is the difference between spending $229 billion on interest on the debt versus other american priorities. you can't see it, mr. speaker, but education is represented by this blue line. i want you to see that. the federal government spends more money in interest on our national debt. even though we borrowed that money at the lowest interest rates in american history, teaser rates, we spend more in interest on our national debt than we spend on education for our children. we are trying to pass a transportation bill right now, mr. speaker. we are trying to put people back to work in america building roads so that we will have the best infrastructure in the world, so that we will move goods and services to market better than any other nation in the world, so that we can have our people moving from place to place, creating jobs and economic activity better than anyplace else in the world. we spend half. half of what we spend on interest payments this year we will spend on transportation, mr. speaker. we spend the same amount on interest payments in 2015 that we will spend on education and transportation combined. i want you to think about that, mr. speaker. we could double the spending on education in this country, as my friends on the left propose to do. we could double spending on transportation in this country, as my friends on the left propose to do, if we would balance the budget and get out of the interest payment business, as my friends on the right propose to do. this is a common goal. this is a shared focus. this is not something that divides us. this is something that unites us. environment and natural resources: $41 billion is being spent by the federal government this year. we spend five times more than that on interest payments. science, space, and technology, mr. speaker: who is going to have that next manned mission to space? who is going to be the first to have a human being on mars? what are we going to learn out beyond the stars? we spend one-tenth the amount of our interest payments on that priority. energy policy: how many times have we heard the refrain ``an all-of- the-above energy policy. let's find next-generation energy solutions. let's focus on wind and solar and fuel cells''? i don't dispute any of that. i dispute the commitment that we have to it when we spend 23 times more on interest payments than we spend on all energy policy combined. when i am talking about balancing the budget, mr. speaker, when i am talking about making tough choices, i am not talking about an academic conversation about making the numbers balance. i am talking about a reordering of american priorities, where we would rather spend money on our children, on our roads, on our environment, on exploration, on next-generation energy, than we would paying back debts of the past. we are going to make good on our debts. but we can control whether or not we are paying those debts down or whether we are running those debts up. interest that we pay on our national debt isn't a number on a ledger. it is a category that pushes out so many other american priorities. that is this year, mr. speaker. this chart represents this year. if you fast-forward 10 years, under current law, we will be spending more on our national debt than we spend on national security. i don't mean paying back our debt, mr. speaker. i mean we will be spending more in interest payments on our national debt than we will be spending protecting the national security of the united states of america. that is why the former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, admiral mullen, said the largest threat to america's national security is rising debt, because our debt and the accompanying interest payments are squeezing out so many other american priorities. mr. speaker, folks don't understand how the american budget works. i put a pie chart up here that captures that. we are going to get into some pretty serious debates here on the floor of this house in the next couple of months, primarily about something that we call discretionary spending. discretionary spending i have represented up here, mr. speaker, by blue pie slices on the pie chart. defense and nondefense spending are the two big categories, which means defense and almost everything else you think of as the federal government. those are the decisions--these in blue, mr. speaker--that you and i have to make every year. that distinguishes it from these decisions in red. social security spending, medicare spending, medicaid spending, interest on the national debt, other mandatory [[page h6969]] programs. these programs in red, mr. speaker, as you know, we won't revisit those this year. yes. the constitution requires that every dollar appropriated from the treasury be appropriated from the house. but the house, in 1935, decided that some of these dollars needed to go out the door, and they are still going out the door today. we can't change it without passing a new bill in the house, a new bill in the senate, and a new bill that the president signs. we spend all of our time in this body, mr. speaker, arguing about nibbling around the edges on the blue categories of the chart, which is the small third of the pie. the real challenge in balancing the budget lies in these red slices of the pie, and i am going to tell you why. what i have charted here is a look at revenues in this country as a percent of gdp. so often we measure our success against the size of the economy. what are we spending relative to the size of the economy? because if our population grows, if the economy grows, of course our tax base will grow. and so, too, in many cases will our expenses grow. so we chart these things against the size of the economy. this red line represents our historic revenues going back to 1965: all of the taxes through the nixon administration, into the ford administration, carter administration, reagan administration, all the way through to today. in fact, we chart it out into 2045. when you see this line go flat on revenues, mr. speaker, it is because we are just predicting they are level as a percent of the economy. but what i have also charted are the spending priorities that were in the red slice of the pie shown earlier, the mandatory spending slices of the pie. this blue line represents medicaid and other federal healthcare expenditures, like the president's affordable care act. this green line represents medicare, created in 1965. it used to be nonexistent. now it is a very large slice of the pie. again, it represents some of the largest taxes that the american people pay. this light section here represents social security, mr. speaker, and this blue line represents net interest. mr. speaker, if you could see it out on the end of this chart, what you would see is medicaid spending is growing quickly, but on a predictable line. medicare spending is growing quickly, but on a predictable line. social security spending is almost flat, mr. speaker, even though it is a big part of the pie. what is growing is interest payments. and when the blue line crosses the red line, that is where these four programs--interest on the national debt, social security payments, medicare payments, and medicaid payments--where those programs alone consume every single penny in any tax paid by any american. this is out about 10 years from now, mr. speaker. about 10 years from now every single penny that every single american pays in taxes will be consumed by these four programs. these programs will be insolvent because there is no more money. every other priority will have been squeezed out of the budget. and ``by every other priority,'' mr. speaker, i mean we are cutting transportation to zero, we are putting education to zero, we are cutting national parks to zero, we are cutting national security to zero. {time} 1400 this is not an academic conversation about balancing the budget. it is a national security conversation because we need to fund that priority. it is an education conversation because we need to fund that priority. it is an environment and parks conversation because we need to fund that priority. these mandatory spending programs threaten to consume every single penny of federal revenue. just to be clear, mr. speaker, in case there is any confusion, some folks say: well, rob, why don't you just raise more revenue? let's just raise taxes on the american people, then we will have enough money to make that happen. mr. speaker, what i am showing you in this chart is, no, that won't solve the problem. this green line, i go from 2006 out to 2044 here, mr. speaker, and this green line represents historical revenue. when we hit this big economic downturn over the past 5 years, mr. speaker, revenues collapsed. it turns out if the american people can't find a job, the american people can't pay any taxes. that is pretty common sense. i say to my friends on the left, mr. speaker, if you want more taxes in the tax base, create more jobs. if folks have jobs, they can pay. when we ran out of jobs, we ran out of money, yet we spent even more because american families were hurting in that period of time. well, i graphed this out to 2044, mr. speaker, and what you see is, under current law--this red line represents current law--if we add no new programs, if we don't spend any additional dollars, we just follow the current law, make no new promises to the american people, the spending required by current law more than doubles current revenues. so we are not talking about raising somebody's taxes a percent or two. we are talking about doubling everyone's taxes all across this country in every category. and when we do that, mr. speaker, that will solve the problem until about 2030, and then that won't be enough to fund it either. taxes are not the problem. our problem is that we are not raising enough money. our problem is that current law is spending too much money, and we have got to come together to fix it. well, now i get to the good news part of the presentation, mr. speaker. i am talking about bad news and the debt is squeezing out every other funding priority in america. i am talking about bad news that the major social programs of this nation are fiscally insolvent. i am talking about bad news because there is just no way to tax the american people at a high enough rate to fund those priorities. the good news is we have come together in this body to work on the spending side together. look at this, mr. speaker. it is unbelievable. folks sometimes ask me back home, mr. speaker, they say: rob, why do you take so many charts down to the house floor? why are you down there talking about this? do you know what my answer is? because no one believes me. no one believes me. if you go home, mr. speaker--and i challenge you to do this. go home and tell your constituents that when the big class of 2010 got here, when republicans took over the house in 2011 and so we had divided government--again, as john boehner always says, you can do big things in divided government. when republicans took over the house, president obama was leading the white house, we were spending $3.6 trillion as a nation--3.6 trillion. now, the baby boomers began to retire in this window, so 10,000, mr. speaker, 10,000 men and women every day who had been paying medicare and social security taxes their entire lives began applying for the benefits that they had earned through that lifetime of work. so we have social security and medicare spending, two of the biggest categories of federal spending, growing exponentially because of all these new applicants to the program, all these folks coming to cash in on their benefits. and what happened in divided government? we came together in this body in what is the best vote i have taken in 4\1/2\ years with a voting card, and we passed the budget control act. i didn't get everything i wanted. my republican colleagues didn't get everything they wanted; my democratic friends didn't get everything they wanted; and the president didn't get everything he wanted; but we made a step forward for america, and we cut total federal spending. we changed our priorities, mr. speaker. we began to look and see what was essential federal spending and what was just kind of nice to do? what did we have to do to meet the promises we made to america, and where were those dollars that we weren't getting as much utility out of? so total federal spending--not funny, washington, d.c., math with inflation-adjusted dollars--total dollar bills going out the door from the federal government dropped from 2011 to 2012. i had never seen it before in my lifetime, mr. speaker, never seen it before in my lifetime. but we weren't done, because when you put 435 minds together in here, you really can do some neat things, mr. speaker. in divided government where we all have skin in the game, where we are all trying to [[page h6970]] accomplish a goal, you can do some amazing things. so from 2012 to 2013, still with 10,000 men and women a day applying for new social security and medicare benefits that they had earned, we cut total federal spending again--again, not funny washington, d.c., math, but reprioritizing what those goals were the american people sent us here to achieve and trying to achieve those goals, not because it is a mathematical exercise, but because if we don't, interest on our national debt is going to squeeze out all of the other priorities that we share as a nation. mr. speaker, 2 years in a row, while the population was growing, while the economy was struggling, and while seniors were retiring at a record pace, we came together and reprioritized federal spending to unburden the next generation. mr. speaker, we couldn't do that alone as republicans, and we couldn't have done that alone as democrats. we could only do that working together, and we did, 2 years in a row, first time, mr. speaker, in anybody's lifetime on this floor. i have charted it a different way, mr. speaker, because we spend so much time beating up on each other as if we are failures. i tell folks back home that congress has about a 12 percent approval rating, and we seem to use that entire 12 percent approval rating to tell everybody how awful we are: oh, it is just terrible; folks can't get along; they all hate each other; everybody is on the take; and washington is a giant cesspool. please send me back for 2 more years. where does that come from? what kind of sense does that make. we have had a lot of conscientious people on the floor of the house, mr. speaker, who leave their families and who leave their communities to come here on a mission that their constituents sent them to do, and in every category--i have charted three things here, mr. speaker. i have charted what we call discretionary spending, that is what most people think of as government: parks, courts, environment, transportation, and national security. all of those things that you think of as government, if you are on the green line in discretionary spending. this red line is the mandatory spending. that is the interest on the national debt: medicare, medicaid, and social security. those mandatory programs, dollars go out the door every year. this blue line is total spending across the whole government, mr. speaker. what i have shown here--and again, these are not inflation- adjusted dollars; these are actual dollar bills going out the door-- this dotted line in each category represents where the spending was going, where the congressional budget office--again, it is a nonpartisan group of economists here--predicted the federal government was going to go when john boehner took over as speaker in 2011, before we had divided government, before we were able to come together and do big things. the solid line represents what is actually happening with federal spending, what is actually happening. what you see, mr. speaker, is that even on the mandatory spending programs, we are getting reductions over what was anticipated. certainly on the discretionary spending programs we are getting reductions over what was anticipated. in total federal spending, we are getting reductions. folks think nothing is happening here. they say: rob, for pete's sake, you have to go and you have to balance the budget. you have to make these things happen. i can't make everybody agree with me on everything. put me and two or three other members together, mr. speaker, give us all the powers of government, and we could probably solve this in a week or two. but there are 435 of us, and that is not all of us. that is just here. we have another 100 folks across the way in the senate. do you know what they say about the senate, mr. speaker? they say the difference between a senator and god is that god knows he is not a senator. you have heard that one, haven't you? the power that is on the other side of the hill has to be reckoned with, too, not to mention folks down at 1600 pennsylvania avenue. but we all got together, 100 of them, 435 of us, and 1 president at 1600 pennsylvania avenue, and we bent the lines on spending. now, is spending still going up, mr. speaker? it is. what you see here is that we have curtailed it inside our current window. it is the outyears where the rise really begins. why is it rising? look here. discretionary spending, these are all of those priorities we talked about earlier, that is going down in kind of a flat line going out over the 10-year horizon. it is mandatory spending that is still going up. even with the changes we have made, it is still going up. when we talk about what the problem is with spending in this country and we talk about what the challenge is with balancing the budget, it is not that we are spending a little money here or a little money there on education or transportation or the courts or the parks or even national defense. the problem is that you have promised me--i am in my forties, mr. speaker. you have promised me social security and medicare benefits that you can't possibly live up to. there is no cash flow model that leaves enough money in the trust funds for me to access it when i retire, and you need to be honest with me and tell me that today while i have another 30 years to prepare for it. they did a survey of young people, mr. speaker. more young people in america, more millennials believe that they would see a ufo in their lifetime than see a social security check in their lifetime. now, i have just told you this is the largest tax that most americans pay, and we have so broken the trust with the american people as a spending body here in government that young people who are paying that giant fica tax, the largest fica tax in american history, they don't believe they will ever see a penny from it. we have made these changes together, mr. speaker. we can do better. we can make more. but the arguments that the american people are going to hear--and this is critically important. the arguments that the american people are going to hear over the next 4 months are going to be about $1 billion here and $1 billion there when we have a $100 trillion problem. the arguments that folks are going to hear over the next 4 months, mr. speaker, are all going to be focused on this sliver down here in the green area. this body is going to become consumed with nibbling around the edges on discretionary spending on which we have already succeeded. we have already begun the process of redefining those priorities. where we haven't done enough is on mandatory spending. i have got to find a way, mr. speaker, we have got to find a way to come together to do the heavy lifting that is mandatory spending. no one is going to go to any senior in america and tell them that we are going to pull the rug out from under them now that they have already retired. nobody is going to do that. nobody is proposing that. nobody is talking about that. and if you are a senior citizen in america, mr. speaker, rest assured that the only thing anyone is working on here is making sure the trust funds survive to pay you those benefits that have been promised. when we are talking about making changes, we are talking about making changes to my generation and younger folks to connect the reality, which is we can't afford those promises with the reality that i am still paying those taxes and redefining that relationship, mr. speaker, in a way that america can keep the promises. i don't mind delivering bad news to folks. you have to pay for what you want in this country. if you want more benefits, we will have to raise your taxes. if you want fewer benefits, we can cut your taxes. right now, we are providing more benefits without raising taxes. we won't raise taxes on each other. we will raise taxes on our children and grandchildren instead. we won't cut benefits for each other. we cut benefits for our children and grandchildren instead. there is a better way forward, but we are going to find it together. again, i put the charts up, mr. speaker, because folks won't believe it. these are actual dollars, not inflation-adjusted dollars. this chart represents the dollars that we have control over in this body, the dollars that we have to get together and decide on every year. again, two-thirds of the budget goes out the door whether this body shows up for work or not. it is on autopilot. [[page h6971]] the dollars that go out the door because we show up for work we have been reprioritizing, reallocating, and refocusing every single year. the result of that is a more effective and more efficient federal government to accomplish the priorities the american people have sent us here to accomplish, and we are borrowing less from our children and our grandchildren. it is a morality issue, mr. speaker. these are our federal deficits. this is the money that we are borrowing from our children and our grandchildren. when george bush was leaving office, and if he were here on the floor of the house today, mr. speaker, he would tell you, it was no source of pride for him as he was leaving office that he ran up the single largest deficit in american history. it was a republican in the white house, it was democrats running capitol hill, but together, in divided government, they came together and ran up the single largest annual deficit in american history. this one, mr. speaker, you can't see it, this little bitty one that is almost too small to read on the chart, this was once the largest deficit in american history. {time} 1415 then we left divided government. we went to unified government where one party controlled everything, and we went to this deficit for 1 year and this deficit for the next year and this deficit for the next year, deficits, mr. speaker, two and three times larger than the deficit that george bush set as the highest annual deficit in american history. mr. speaker, those were dark economic times for the country. everybody has hindsight that is 20/20. no, i wouldn't have supported that spending had i been here at that time. i wasn't in congress at that time. but those deficits are a reality. those dollars have been borrowed. that money is now being repaid with interest every day of the week. i take that back. no, it is not. we don't repay a penny of our debt. i don't know if we have ever had that conversation. we don't repay a penny. let's be clear. we pay interest on our national debt. we just keep borrowing. when a principal payment comes due, we borrow more money from someone else to pay back the interest and principal that we borrowed from somebody years ago. we don't pay back a penny. we just borrow more and more and more. these represent increasing borrowing amounts. well, mr. speaker, this is the first budget that that class of 2010 got to work on together. this is the second. this is the third. this is the fourth. this is where we are right now. we are making progress together. we are doing this together not as a mathematical exercise, but as a moral imperative not to borrow and mortgage the future of our children and our grandchildren. we are headed in the right direction, but we have to do more. i don't want to look like i am patting us on the back, mr. speaker. the challenge is enormous. and, yes, we are grappling with it. but, look, this chart represents historical deficits back again as a percent of gdp. these other charts i showed you were in actual dollars going out the door. we use percent of gdp so we can kind of compare apples to apples because a dollar going out the door in 1942 would have been more money going out the door today. so we do it as a percent of the economy to try to make it be comparable. we go back here to 1965, mr. speaker. we borrow, borrow, borrow, borrow, borrow. throughout all the 1980s we borrowed. do you remember those conversations in the 1980s, mr. speaker, where folks thought ronald reagan and tip o'neill and congress were going to borrow us into oblivion? we thought the 1980s were the dark days of federal spending because we were running up deficits that were so large. here those are, mr. speaker, these, what looked like high points then, but turned out to be low points by more recent history standards. these are those 1980 deficits. these are the early clinton deficits. these surpluses are the successes that newt gingrich and bill clinton had together, again, divided government producing results. we went back to unified government here with not-so-good results. we went to divided government. now we are getting back on track. but if you look at--and i project it another 10 years out, mr. speaker. if we do nothing, deficits begin to rise again. under current law, if we do nothing, deficits begin to rise again. yes, we have come together on the budget control act and we have done amazing things. we have come together to end what was called the sustainable growth rate. they call it the doc fix. i don't know why they call it that. it was a patient fix. it was this gimmick in law that was undermining healthcare security for all seniors. we came together and we fixed that. we made changes to the medicare program that both solved a current problem and prevented future problems. reinvesting more money in the trust fund, putting off those deficits, we can do those things together. but we have got to start now, mr. speaker. again, we are going to talk over the next 4 months about $1 billion here and $1 billion there. i want to talk about $1 trillion here and $1 trillion there. this chart, mr. speaker, represents the nature of our challenge. if we want to get back to what i would call federal debt levels that are historically normal, if it is okay to confess that, yes, we have a chart that says: as america, let's not have debt that is incredibly high. let's just have debt that is kind of an average high. that is what we are going to define as success, just an average high debt, average dangerous debt. we are going to define that as success. and to get to that point, mr. speaker, if we start today, we are going to have to deal with about 1.1 percent of gdp. that is going to be the size of the change. we are going to have to deal with about 1 percent of the size of the entire economy. what is that going to be? a 1 percent increase in taxes? a 1 percent reduction in spending? no. it is much larger than that. gdp is the entire american economy. federal spending and federal taxes are just a very small part of that. when we talk about moving the needle on 1 percent of gdp, we are talking about big, big dollars. it is a huge challenge, huge challenge, if we started today. the tale i am telling, mr. speaker, is, if we wait 5 years, the challenge gets 30 percent harder. it is a huge challenge today. some would argue it is an insurmountable challenge today. if we fail to address it today, mr. speaker, it will be 30 percent harder just 5 years down the road. mr. speaker, wait 10 years down the road and it is almost twice as hard. it is almost twice as hard to conquer 10 years down the road. we don't talk about social security going bankrupt in 2035 because we are trying to be alarmists. we talk about it going bankrupt in 2035 because the time to solve that is today. we talk about medicare going bankrupt in 2030 not to be alarmists, but because the time to solve that is today. these funding challenges that we have are hard today. they are twice as hard tomorrow. we have got to find the courage today to come together and make these changes. now, that is to keep things as they are. if what you want to do is to make things better, you see, the challenge is even harder. if what you want to do is begin to pay some debt back, the challenges are even larger. i am not setting my sights on the big line, mr. speaker. i am trying to focus on the little line because success begets success. when we came together and solved the budget control act, we were then able to come together and solve the medicare challenge. when we came together and solved the medicare challenge, we were then able to come together and solve our defense challenge. one time and one time and one time and one time. when you wake up 365 days later, you find out you have really gotten some work done. there are a lot of numbers on this chart, mr. speaker, and i will send you a copy of it. but we are talking about a 14 percent revenue increase or a 13 percent spending increase today, today, to begin this process. the size of our challenge today, the challenge that i said was easy, the challenge that i said we could achieve together, the challenge that i said divided government gave us an opportunity to be successful at, that is a 14 percent revenue increase, 14 percent tax hike today, or a 13 percent spending cut today. and then we are going to [[page h6972]] need to do it again next year and again next year and again the year after that. this is the easy challenge, mr. speaker. we have come together to create the largest deficit reduction package in the history of the country. republicans, democrats, congress, the white house, we did it. we have time to do it again. i know there is an election year coming. i know folks want to focus on who is going to win in november. i know folks want democrats to try to take over congress or republicans to try to take over the white house. i know that is the national conversation. but whichever side of that battle you pick, wouldn't your candidate be advantaged if republicans and democrats had been successful for the american people on yet another big challenge? there is only one way forward, and it is hard. there is only one way forward, and it is together. please let us not burn bridges quibbling over $1 billion here and $1 billion there over the next 4 months. one billion dollars is a lot of money, a lot of money. but our problems are trillion-dollar problems, and i want us to join together to solve them because i know that we can. with that, mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ____________________",37958

SUZANNE BONAMICI of oregon in the house of representatives Wednesday, October 7, 2015 Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I rise in reluctant opposition to H.R. 3192, the Homebuyers Assistance Act. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act required the newly created Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to consolidate and streamline the disclosures that a lender is required to make to a homebuyer under the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA). The CFPB has crafted a rule that will ultimately make it easier for borrowers to understand the terms of a mortgage and provide them with additional protections at each step of the process. But mortgages are complicated instruments, and the procedures for home loans have been established for a long time. There is no question that the new rules are complex and will ultimately result in some unintended violations during implementation. The CFPB has extended the timeline for compliance once, and I agree that it is reasonable to extend that compliance period again, as this bill does, until February of 2016. I also agree that lenders who inadvertently fail to comply because these rules are new and unfamiliar should not be subject to public enforcement actions during the implementation period. And indeed CFPB has given its assurance that it will grant very wide latitude to lenders during this period. If that were all this bill did, I could support it. But in the bill is a troubling section that I cannot support even though I agree with the rest of its provisions. Unfortunately this bill suspends until next February the private right of action that allows aggrieved borrowers to recover damages when lenders violate the law in bad faith. This means that consumers who borrow during that period of time have absolutely no recourse whatsoever, even if the lender has engaged in blatant violations of the law. That isn't right, and it isn't fair for our constituents who are buying homes in the next four months to have to face that risk. Although I agree that lenders acting in good faith who inadvertently violate the new rules should be given a reprieve over the next few months, I cannot endorse letting all violators off the hook for any action they take that harms borrowers. I hope we can continue to work to improve this bill, and I hope that we will soon consider a better version on the House floor to provide relief to lenders without also harming borrowers. I encourage my colleagues to oppose the bill in its current form. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1457] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HOMEBUYERS ASSISTANCE ACT ______ speech of HON.

And indeed CFPB has given its assurance that it will grant very wide latitude to lenders during this period. If that were all this bill did, I could support it. But in the bill is a troubling section that I cannot support even though I agree with the rest of its provisions. Unfortunately this bill suspends until next February the private right of action that allows aggrieved borrowers to recover damages when lenders violate the law in bad faith. This means that consumers who borrow during that period of time have absolutely no recourse whatsoever, even if the lender has engaged in blatant violations of the law. That isn't right, and it isn't fair for our constituents who are buying homes in the next four months to have to face that risk. Although I agree that lenders acting in good faith who inadvertently violate the new rules should be given a reprieve over the next few months, I cannot endorse letting all violators off the hook for any action they take that harms borrowers. I hope we can continue to work to improve this bill, and I hope that we will soon consider a better version on the House floor to provide relief to lenders without also harming borrowers. I encourage my colleagues to oppose the bill in its current form. ____________________",package_114_232.csv,2827,2827,2896,"[congressional record volume 161, number 149 (friday, october 9, 2015)] [extensions of remarks] [page e1457] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] homebuyers assistance act ______ speech of hon. suzanne bonamici of oregon in the house of representatives wednesday, october 7, 2015 ms. bonamici. madam speaker, i rise in reluctant opposition to h.r. 3192, the homebuyers assistance act. the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act required the newly created consumer financial protection bureau (cfpb) to consolidate and streamline the disclosures that a lender is required to make to a homebuyer under the truth in lending act (tila) and the real estate settlement procedures act (respa). the cfpb has crafted a rule that will ultimately make it easier for borrowers to understand the terms of a mortgage and provide them with additional protections at each step of the process. but mortgages are complicated instruments, and the procedures for home loans have been established for a long time. there is no question that the new rules are complex and will ultimately result in some unintended violations during implementation. the cfpb has extended the timeline for compliance once, and i agree that it is reasonable to extend that compliance period again, as this bill does, until february of 2016. i also agree that lenders who inadvertently fail to comply because these rules are new and unfamiliar should not be subject to public enforcement actions during the implementation period. and indeed cfpb has given its assurance that it will grant very wide latitude to lenders during this period. if that were all this bill did, i could support it. but in the bill is a troubling section that i cannot support even though i agree with the rest of its provisions. unfortunately this bill suspends until next february the private right of action that allows aggrieved borrowers to recover damages when lenders violate the law in bad faith. this means that consumers who borrow during that period of time have absolutely no recourse whatsoever, even if the lender has engaged in blatant violations of the law. that isn't right, and it isn't fair for our constituents who are buying homes in the next four months to have to face that risk. although i agree that lenders acting in good faith who inadvertently violate the new rules should be given a reprieve over the next few months, i cannot endorse letting all violators off the hook for any action they take that harms borrowers. i hope we can continue to work to improve this bill, and i hope that we will soon consider a better version on the house floor to provide relief to lenders without also harming borrowers. i encourage my colleagues to oppose the bill in its current form. ____________________",2827

A Marin resident for over 20 years, Ms. Hubsmith will be remembered as a local and national advocate for safe pedestrian and biking routes for all. Ms. Hubsmith grew up in New Jersey. Upon graduation from Lehigh University, she established a vibrant life in Marin County. Though always committed to sustainability and bio-diversity, after suffering a tragic accident nearly 15 years ago, Ms. Hubsmith turned her focus towards safe alternative modes of transportation. Ms. Hubsmith was a vigorous advocate for alternate modes of transportation, co-creating the national and award winning The Safe Routes to School National Program, in addition to founding the Marin County Bicycle Coalition. Among her many accomplishments across the nation and in Marin County, Ms. Hubsmith played a significant role in the creation of SMART, a commuter train linking Marin and Sonoma County, and bike and pedestrian pathway. Ms. Hubsmith's advocacy on the local, state, and federal level has ensured generations of America's children will have a safe walkable or bikeable route to school. Her legacy will benefit many individuals and communities for years to come.

ANDER CRENSHAW of florida in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize Mr. Richard Geswell, for his tireless efforts and dedication to patients with inflammatory bowel disease. After 10 years with the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America, Mr. Geswell is retiring as President and Chief Executive Officer. The Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America is one of the best- run, well-funded disease organizations in the country. Since its founding in 1967, CCFA has awarded more than 1,300 IBD grants totaling approximately $164 million of funding invested in research related to Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The bonds forged by CCFA between donors, researchers, and doctors have put us closer than ever to finding a cure. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, collectively known as inflammatory bowel disease, are chronic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. IBD is one of the five most prevalent gastrointestinal disease burdens in the United States. This chronic condition is without a medical cure and commonly requires a lifetime of care. In order to bring more awareness to this disease, Mr. Geswell and I worked together to establish the Congressional Crohn's and Colitis Caucus, a caucus that has grown steadily for three consecutive congresses and boasts 57 bipartisan members. The caucus works to promote awareness of IBD, the need for expanded research at the National Institutes of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the importance of accessible insurance and disability coverage for this vulnerable patient population. I commend Mr. Geswell for his remarkable vision and drive to improve the lives of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Mr. Geswell spent nearly 10 years with CCFA and during his tenure he significantly expanded the CCFA medical research portfolio as well as services to support and educate patients managing IBD. I believe it is no coincidence that the last 10 years have seen innovative new medicines hit the market for IBD. He was also instrumental in his work in the procurement of federal dollars from the Centers for Disease Control for a critical epidemiology study of Crohn's and Colitis, work that has yielded an important view into the origins of the disease. Mr. Geswell retires with nearly 40 years of experience with non- profits seeking to find cures and improve the lives of patients. I applaud and commend Mr. Geswell for his service to the nation and for his accomplishments for the IBD community. I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating Mr. Geswell for his tremendous leadership and exemplary efforts as President and CEO of CCFA, and wish him success in his future endeavors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1457] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING RICK GESWELL UPON HIS RETIREMENT AFTER 10 YEARS OF WORK WITH THE CROHN'S AND COLITIS FOUNDATION OF AMERICA ______ HON.

CUDAHY ______ HON. RON KIND of wisconsin in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Judge Richard D. Cudahy. A Wisconsin native and member of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, Judge Cudahy passed away on September 22, 2015. [[Page E1458]] Judge Cudahy was born in Milwaukee in 1926 and spent his childhood in Cudahy, Wisconsin. He attended college at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, earning his degree in 1948. He served in the military until 1951 before attending Yale Law School, where he earned his Juris Doctor degree in 1955. In 1956, Judge Cudahy went to work for the U.S. State Department Office of Legal Adviser in Washington, DC, and then moved into private practice in Chicago in 1957. After serving as the head of his family's meat packing company, he ran for Attorney General of Wisconsin. He served as the Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairman from 1967 to 1968. In 1979, under the recommendation of Senators William Proxmire and Gaylord Nelson, President Jimmy Carter appointed Judge Cudahy to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. During Judge Cudahy's long legal career he was also a professor at many prominent law schools, including DePaul University College of Law, George Washington University Law School, Marquette University School of Law, and University of Wisconsin Law School. Judge Cudahy was well known for his writings on environmental law and public energy law, two issues about which he was extremely passionate. From being the head of a large meat packing company that provided many jobs to the citizens of Wisconsin, to teaching future lawyers at Wisconsin and Marquette, to being a highly respected judge that presided over many cases involving citizens of Wisconsin, Judge Cudahy was a model Wisconsinite.

The NCHC represents 800 colleges and universities and is composed of 325,000 students dedicated to achieving educational excellence in diverse subject curriculum areas in order to achieve professional career goals. In my district, the New Jersey Institute of Technology's Albert Dorman Honors College challenges its brightest and most motivated students by intellectually stimulating them with a well-balanced education that includes special activities, lectures, and colloquium series that feature prestigious speakers. The program accomplishes its overarching missions of fostering leadership skills and ensuring academic excellence through rigorous learner-centered education by providing undergraduate research opportunities, innovative learning seminars, community service engagement, and study abroad programs. Students prepare for competition for highly desirable jobs in the modern economy by participating in technology based education and internship programs that provide professional work experiences and opportunities to network with real-world business leaders. The College also offers accelerated pre-law, pre-med, and entrepreneurial programs that enable students to quickly move on to graduate or professional schools by allowing them to earn their undergraduate degrees in just three years. Indeed, Albert Dorman graduates leave the New Jersey Institute of Technology well prepared to find jobs in prominent corporations or to pursue graduate education in our nation's best academic institutions. The National Collegiate Honors Program, after decades of growth and experience, continues to dedicate itself to promoting educational excellence within our nation's colleges and universities while preparing students for successful professional careers.

SAM GRAVES of missouri in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Jim Johnston of Grain Valley, MO. This October, Jim will be completing his eighth term and fourth decade as the President of the Owner- Operator Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA), an organization that formed to give owner-operators and drivers a voice where they previously had none. Jim is widely considered to be a national leader on all issues affecting small business trucking professionals and professional truck drivers. It is hard to believe that OOIDA began in an office trailer chained to a light pole at a truck stop in Grain Valley. Under Jim's leadership, it is now the largest organization of small business trucking professionals and professional truck drivers in the country, with more than 155,000 members nationwide. OOIDA has members in every state across every Congressional district. There is no question that Jim and his organization strive daily to represent the best interests of truck drivers around the country. In fact, Jim leads a 22 member Board of Directors that has more than 800 years of truck driving experience collectively, and a staff of 320 OOIDA employees, many of whom were truck drivers themselves. Needless to say, Jim is an invaluable resource on trucking and transportation issues to those fortunate enough to work with him. Representing the interests of truck drivers has been Jim's life's work, and I can confidently say there is no one more dedicated to the cause. Throughout his career, he has worked with legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government, law enforcement agencies and other trucking and transportation organizations, all while serving on numerous commissions and advisory boards. His mission is simple: fight for the rights of all professional truck drivers. While some of his colleagues might say that he is a fierce adversary, I think most would agree that the integrity and professionalism with which he conducts himself has endeared Jim to all of his colleagues and competitors. Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to work with Jim and his team at OOIDA. I would ask all of my colleagues to join me in commending Mr. Jim Johnston for his lifelong dedication to the members of OOIDA and the trucking industry, and we wish him the best in his future endeavors. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1459] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING JIM JOHNSTON ______ HON.

CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH of new jersey in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, since 1987, the Lord's Resistance Army, or LRA, has killed, raped, kidnapped, enslaved or robbed thousands of people in the Great Lakes region of Africa and beyond. In October 2011, the Obama administration deployed about 100 military advisers to help Ugandan and other military forces in the region to seek out and capture or kill the members of a terrorist force that has now dwindled from thousands of fighters in the late 1990s and early 2000s to fewer than 200 today, but remains a very real danger to people in the east and central regions of Africa. A hearing I held last week looked at why the effort to end the LRA is so critical for the international community and how the U.S. counter-LRA program has worked thus far. Last week's hearing was held even in the absence of the Department of Defense or the State Department (whose relevant officials are unavailable for a few weeks) because it will serve as acknowledgement of the importance of countering the LRA prior to the administration's decision on whether to continue the program. The decision on renewing the American deployment will come in the next few weeks. We trust the administration will decide to continue this worthy effort. We hope to cover U.S. counter-LRA policy with administration witnesses in a future hearing on Africa's Great Lakes region. One can use a number of metaphors to describe the LRA today. It is like a wounded animal, less capable but still very dangerous. It is like a vulture, feeding off the existing misery it finds in countries otherwise troubled by conflict. The LRA is like a fire that is tamped down but not extinguished and can re-ignite at any time. However, the danger posed by the LRA is not metaphorical; it is very real to those who still live in fear in eastern and central Africa. The LRA is a vivid example of how ethnic strife can provide a cover for wanton viciousness. In the name of protecting the rights of northern Uganda's Acholi tribe, LRA founder Joseph Kony has brought only wretchedness to his people and their neighbors, as well as to people living in surrounding countries. Efforts to come to a negotiated settlement have all come to naught because Kony apparently has no coherent demands. His terrorist group seems to want nothing more than chaos and destruction. The international community has been much too quick to abandon humanitarian activities, largely because the number of victims has been reduced significantly. In confirmation hearing testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee last year, General David Rodriguez referred to the counter-LRA effort as ``a good success story,'' citing the group's decline and American determination to support African efforts to finish off the LRA. Unfortunately, this is where the metaphors about the group must be kept in mind. Whenever the LRA has had a setback due to international efforts to eliminate it, the group's retaliation has been ruthless. Ongoing conflict in [[Page E1459]] Central African Republic, South Sudan and eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo has provided a welcoming environment in which the LRA can hide and resume its deadly activities with less fear of regional government action against it. When we take our eyes off the LRA, they have enhanced maneuverability and opportunity to regroup. Thanks to the #Kony2012 campaign by the advocacy group Invisible Children, the LRA became notorious worldwide and garnered international support, especially among the young, on behalf of a robust counter-LRA effort. Yet the staying power of social media is fleeting. There are always new causes, also legitimate, to draw attention away. Remember #BringBackOurGirls on behalf of the Chibok schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram? Our caring has to extend to the victims of LRA and other such groups, which not only include those whom they attack, but also those whom they cruelly use in their destructive campaigns. We had one such victim with us, who described the ongoing desolation the LRA brings to so many young lives. We also had witnesses familiar with the LRA and its terrorist activities who described the ongoing threat this group poses, however diminished their ranks may be. Countering terrorist groups cannot depend on Twitter campaigns. The United States and other members of the international community must retain our resolve to capture or remove the leaders of the LRA and any terrorist group that threaten the lives and well-being of innocent people worldwide. Whether such groups pose a direct, confirmable threat to the homeland or not, by terrorizing those whom we help, they oppose U.S. interests and must be dealt with. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1458-E1459] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RIDDING CENTRAL AFRICA OF JOSEPH KONY: CONTINUING U.S. SUPPORT ______ HON.

CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH of new jersey in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, since 1987, the Lord's Resistance Army, or LRA, has killed, raped, kidnapped, enslaved or robbed thousands of people in the Great Lakes region of Africa and beyond. In October 2011, the Obama administration deployed about 100 military advisers to help Ugandan and other military forces in the region to seek out and capture or kill the members of a terrorist force that has now dwindled from thousands of fighters in the late 1990s and early 2000s to fewer than 200 today, but remains a very real danger to people in the east and central regions of Africa. A hearing I held last week looked at why the effort to end the LRA is so critical for the international community and how the U.S. counter-LRA program has worked thus far. Last week's hearing was held even in the absence of the Department of Defense or the State Department (whose relevant officials are unavailable for a few weeks) because it will serve as acknowledgement of the importance of countering the LRA prior to the administration's decision on whether to continue the program. The decision on renewing the American deployment will come in the next few weeks. We trust the administration will decide to continue this worthy effort. We hope to cover U.S. counter-LRA policy with administration witnesses in a future hearing on Africa's Great Lakes region. One can use a number of metaphors to describe the LRA today. It is like a wounded animal, less capable but still very dangerous. It is like a vulture, feeding off the existing misery it finds in countries otherwise troubled by conflict. The LRA is like a fire that is tamped down but not extinguished and can re-ignite at any time. However, the danger posed by the LRA is not metaphorical; it is very real to those who still live in fear in eastern and central Africa. The LRA is a vivid example of how ethnic strife can provide a cover for wanton viciousness. In the name of protecting the rights of northern Uganda's Acholi tribe, LRA founder Joseph Kony has brought only wretchedness to his people and their neighbors, as well as to people living in surrounding countries. Efforts to come to a negotiated settlement have all come to naught because Kony apparently has no coherent demands. His terrorist group seems to want nothing more than chaos and destruction. The international community has been much too quick to abandon humanitarian activities, largely because the number of victims has been reduced significantly. In confirmation hearing testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee last year, General David Rodriguez referred to the counter-LRA effort as ``a good success story,'' citing the group's decline and American determination to support African efforts to finish off the LRA.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the crew of the El Faro, the 790-foot container ship that recently perished in the Atlantic during Hurricane Joaquin. We cannot know the heartache that their families and friends are facing in the midst of the unanswered questions surrounding this maritime disaster. In their time of need, we send them strong prayers of support to help ease their pain. The 33 crew members aboard the vessel, 18 from Florida, 12 from my hometown of Jacksonville, 10 others from cities and towns across America, and five Polish nationals, all faced the toughest of odds from a Category 4 hurricane. These brave men and women include: Jacksonville residents Roosevelt Clark, Brookie Davis, Frank Hamm, Carey Hatch, Jack Jackson, Jackie Jones, Jr., Lonnie Jordan, Roan Lightfoot, James Porter, Theodore Quammie, Lashawn Rivera and Anthony Thomas. Florida residents Louis Champa of Palm Coast, Keith Griffin of Fort Myers, Joe Hargrove of Orange Park, Howard Schoenly of Cape Coral, German Solar- Cortes of Orlando and Mariette Wright of St. Augustine were also aboard. Sylvester Crawford Jr. of Lawrenceville, Georgia; Michael Davidson of Windham, Maine; Michael Holland of North Wilton, Maine; Mitchell Kuflik of Brooklyn, New York; Jeffrey Mathias of Kingston, Massachusetts; Dylan Meklin of Rockland, Maine; Richard Pusatere of Virginia Beach, Virginia; Danielle Randolph of Rockland, Massachusetts; Jeremie Riehm of Camden, Delaware; and Steven Shultz of Roan Mountain, Tennessee are also mourned as are Piotr Krause, Marcin Nita, Jan Podgorski, Andrzej Truszkowski and Rafal Zdobych of Poland. As we learn more about their lives we see the experience and professionalism they brought to their careers, their love of family and the hope they had for the future. May those closest to them take comfort from this diverse collection of stories. We also take time to recognize the United States Coast Guard, United States Navy, United States Air Force and other maritime assets who combined forces in the search for the stricken ship and its members. They are to be commended for their full commitment and dedication to that mission. As we move ahead, investigations are underway by the National Transportation Safety Board and the Coast Guard to determine what happened and how to prevent another such disaster from happening in the future. I have no doubt that those answers will come. In the meantime, America's maritime community is a tight one and will rally around those who need it the most right now--the loved ones of the El Faro crew. We stand with them, ready to meet their needs in whatever way we can, today and in all of the tomorrows. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1459] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE CREW OF EL FARO ______ HON.

JEFF MILLER of florida in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Coach Mickey Lindsey on the occasion of his retirement from Pace High School, located in Northwest Florida. For nearly four decades, Coach Lindsey has dedicated his life to serving his students and local communities throughout the Gulf Coast and Southeastern United States, and I am pleased to honor his outstanding achievements. Born and raised in Alabama, Coach Lindsey graduated high school from Grove Hill Academy in Grove Hill and received his Bachelor of Science and Masters in Physical Education degree from the University of West Alabama in 1976 and Valdosta State College in 1984, respectively. At the collegiate level, Coach Lindsey was a member of the Livingston University Football team from 1972 to 1975, where he was part of a Division II semi-final run, and his love of the game and athletics would continue to play an integral role in his successful coaching career. Coach Lindsey began his coaching career as assistant football coach and head track coach at Choctawhatchee High School in Fort Walton Beach, Florida in 1977. After stops at various other schools--including Dodge County High School, Central High School, Escambia High School, and Century High School--Coach Lindsey became the Head Football Coach at Pace High School, where he has remained for the last 25 years. His numerous awards and accolades include four-time Pensacola News Journal Football Coach of the Year, two-time WEAR-TV Football Coach of the Year, and two-time State Weightlifting Coach of the Year. Under his leadership, Coach Lindsey's teams have captured four state weightlifting titles, 10 district football championships, four undefeated football seasons, and three regional football championships. Over the course of his career, Coach Lindsey has compiled a career record [[Page E1460]] of 205-91, and, perhaps most importantly, his leadership on and off the field has impacted the lives of countless students in Northwest Florida. His inspiration and dedication to improving the lives of those around him, however, is not limited to the playing field, track, or in the weight room, but rather extends far beyond into the larger Northwest Florida community. Coach Lindsey has sponsored the Fellowship of Christian Athletes for 30 years and serves as a deacon at Olive Baptist Church in Pensacola, Florida. Additionally, in 1993, Coach Lindsey initiated the Patriot Pal program, a mentoring program that continues to exist today and pairs football players with elementary school students. As evidenced by his tremendous success, Coach Lindsey has much to be proud of and can look back on a well accomplished career. His strong leadership and passion for coaching may have led him to achieve what many coaches can only hope to throughout their coaching careers, and though his accomplishments are many, Coach Lindsey's greatest accomplishment is his children and grandchildren. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to congratulate Coach Mickey Lindsey on his well-earned retirement after 39 years of dedicated service to public education and thank him for his commitment to service and inspiration to the Northwest Florida community. My wife Vicki and I wish him; his wife, Gayle; daughter Jessica and son-in-law Matt, son Jay and daughter-in-law Carrie, as well as his grandchildren Jayden and Avery all the best for continued success. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1459-E1460] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RECOGNIZING THE DEDICATED SERVICE OF COACH MICKEY LINDSEY ON THE OCCASION OF HIS RETIREMENT FROM PACE HIGH SCHOOL, FLORIDA ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Bentworth High School for receiving the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program recognition. Since 1982, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program has celebrated schools that have either made significant improvements or achieved an outstanding level of school-wide performance. This year, only 335 schools in the United States were honored with this distinction, including the 9th District's Bentworth High School. In order to achieve this distinction, schools must earn test scores that illustrate advanced or strongly improving academic achievement. Supporting a hard working student population of about 400, fewer than 50 dedicated teachers and personnel have worked together to increase overall academic achievement at Bentworth. Using strategies to help identify economically disadvantaged students and embracing its relatively small size, Bentworth High School and its surrounding community have provided students with a uniquely personalized educational experience. Furthermore, this involved approach has enabled Bentworth High to provide its students with a challenging curriculum, specialized support services, and valuable extracurricular programs. Today it is my privilege to congratulate Bentworth High School for its National Blue Ribbon Schools recognition. I'm also proud to highlight the dedicated effort of all those who helped earn this award as it illustrates the spirit of the 9th Congressional District of Pennsylvania. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1460] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING BENTWORTH HIGH SCHOOL FOR RECEIVING THE NATIONAL BLUE RIBBON SCHOOLS PROGRAM RECOGNITION ______ HON.

CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH of new jersey in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week I convened a hearing on the topic of food security and nutrition programs in Africa. I am the sponsor of the Global Food Security Act of 2015, a bill which in its prior iteration passed the House of Representatives. The Global Food Security Act, H.R. 1567, will help provide a long-term strategy to combat global hunger by authorizing the existing national food security initiative coordinated by USAID commonly known as Feed the Future. It is a bill with broad bipartisan support, including the original co- sponsorship of my friend and colleague Karen Bass as well as Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce and Ranking Member Eliot Engel. Investing in global food security is a policy that is both penny wise and pound wise. This program strengthens nutrition, especially for children during that critical first 1000-day window, from conception to the child's second birthday. Indeed, there is perhaps no wiser investment that we could make in the human person than to concentrate on ensuring that sufficient nutrition and health assistance is given during the first one thousand days of life: A thousand days that begins with conception, continues throughout pregnancy, includes the milestone of birth and then finishes at roughly the second birthday of the child. Children who do not receive adequate nutrition in utero are more likely to experience lifelong cognitive and physical deficiencies, such as stunting. UNICEF estimates that one in four children worldwide is stunted due to lack of adequate nutrition. By addressing nutrition during the first 1000 days of life, we help lay the groundwork that the next 25,000 days--or whatever the number is that our Creator has allotted--are filled with good health. As the three witnesses at the hearing attested, enhancing food security is also transformational in the lives of millions of small- holder farmers throughout the world, particularly women. Feed the Future teaches small-scale farmers techniques to increase agricultural yield, thereby helping nations achieve food security, something that is in the national security interest of the United States as well. It is also economical in the long run, and should lead to a reduction in the need for emergency food aid. The approach we have taken in the Global Food Security Act is fiscally disciplined, authorizing an amount for 2016 which is less than what we appropriated for food security programs in 2014. USAID is nevertheless able to do more with less by leveraging our aid with that of other countries, the private sector, NGOs and, especially faith-based organizations, whose great work on the ground in so many different countries impacts so many lives, and who were ably represented at the hearing by Carolyn Woo of Catholic Relief Services. By statutorily authorizing this existing program, which had its roots in the Bush administration and was formalized by President Obama, we are also increasing our oversight by requiring the administration to report to Congress. Political will is absolutely essential to enacting a global food security policy that will continue. Such interventions in the lives of so many people in Africa, particularly in the first 1000 days of life, are not only cost-effective but morally imperative. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1460] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION PROGRAMS IN AFRICA ______ HON.

DIANA DeGETTE of colorado in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the 50th anniversary of the University of Colorado's Nurse Practitioner program. In 1965, CU College of Nursing professor Loretta Ford and CU School of Medicine professor Henry Silver came together to create the nation's first nurse practitioner training program.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to and honor the life and legacy of Mr. Joseph Young who made his heavenly transition on Wednesday, September 23, 2015. A native of Chicago, Illinois, Joseph was the fifth of eight children born to the union of the late Willie Frank Young and Margaret Elizabeth Lindly. Joseph relocated to New Orleans in 1965, where he would meet his future wife Perry, while she was matriculating at Dillard University. Upon returning to Chicago, Joseph answered the call to serve his country in the United States Army, where he would serve a tour of duty in the Republic of Vietnam before being discharged with the rank of Sergeant in 1970. Joseph and Perry were united in holy matrimony on July 18, 1970 and to this union, one son, Damon Avery, was born and their second son, Jimmy Myu, was adopted. Mr. Speaker, throughout his life, Mr. Young served in positions of leadership. Whether serving as President of the Foster Park Community Council, organizing two separate little league baseball teams, or serving in a political capacity as Field Director for former Congressman Harold Washington's mayoral campaign in 1983 and Illinois State Director for the 1992 Clinton Campaign, Mr. Young set so many examples of leadership and courage. A feat that was recognized in his becoming the first African American Illinois State Director for the Democratic National Committee. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Young will surely be missed. I join his devoted and loving wife, Perry; two sons, Damon Avery and Jimmy Myu (Nikkie); daughter, Lavitia (Rev. Larry) Arnold, brother, Supt. James Young (Betty Jean), sisters, Rev. Rhoda Barnes and Judy Young, sister-in-law Gert; grandchildren; nephews, nieces and many friends and colleagues in mourning his passing. I am honored to pay tribute to this dedicated community and political leader. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1461] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF MR.

TED POE of texas in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Houston Dynamos have brought a new energy to Houston. The soccer team has drawn fans from across the country and given Houstonians another reason to embrace the color orange--besides the Houston Astros. Houston's Major League soccer team will celebrate its 10 year anniversary this month on October 18th at BBVA Compass Stadium against the Seattle Sounders. During this game the team will honor its past and present players and they will recognize our local veterans. Included in the team's recognition is one particular veteran who has given so much of his energy and all of his heart to helping our local veterans transition back home: John ``Spike'' Garcia. Spike will call in the flyover and be honored by the Dynamos during halftime If there is any area veteran that embodies the best of our nation, state and community it is Spike Garcia. Spike began his military career with the U.S. Army in 1983 and later served for 27 years with the Texas Air National Guard, retiring at the rank of Senior Master Sergeant. He volunteered for two combat tours to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Each day, after performing his military duties, he volunteered at the Air Force Theater Hospital in Balad. He previously served as the Airfield Manager for the 147th Reconnaissance Wing Joint Reserve Base at Ellington, and for his service, he has received numerous honors, including the 332nd Expeditionary Fighter Squadron Commander's Award and an Air Force One support presentation by President George W. Bush. Not only is Spike an honorable defender of liberty and freedom, he has a heart for supporting others, which is why the Dynamos' recognition of him is even more fitting. He is a dedicated father of two who spends his free time helping out his fellow man. He is a member of the Lone Star Veterans Association, the Armed Forces Appreciation Committee for the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, the Houston Military Affairs Committee and he serves on my Service Academy Nomination Board for the Second Congressional District--just to name a few. The Houston Dynamos have selected a very deserving member of our community to be recognized. As Spike humbly put it, they could have selected anyone and they chose him. Spike has helped out the Dynamos' program since the beginning, and they consider him family. The name dynamo describes someone of great energy, a tenacious individual who never gives up. I can't think of anyone who exemplifies this more than Spike Garcia. And that's just the way it is. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1461] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HOUSTON DYNAMOS HONOR SENIOR MASTER SERGEANT JOHN ``SPIKE'' GARCIA ______ HON.

The National Collegiate Honors Council represents 800 colleges and universities and is composed of 325,000 students dedicated to achieving educational excellence in diverse subject curriculum areas in order to achieve professional career goals. In my district, the Sally McDonnell Barksdale Honors College in the University of Mississippi has given thousands of our most [[Page E1462]] gifted students the chance to expand their learning experience far beyond the traditional classroom setting. The Honors College admits about 400 freshmen with an average 3.95 high school GPA every fall and currently has a total of 1,250 students who challenge themselves at the highest level so that they can fulfill their potential. Once enrolled in the Honors College, these exceptional students enjoy the benefits of priority registration that ensures access to optimal class schedules, fellowship and study abroad programs that provide valuable work experiences and enrich global perspectives, and specialized staff that offer counseling on career goals, academic courses, and scholarship opportunities. Students engage in active learning both inside and outside of the classroom by taking more challenging courses and participating in community action events. By providing all of these exciting learning opportunities to thousands of bright young students through decades of dedicated hard work, the Sally McDonnell Barksdale Honors College has become a cornerstone of the University of Mississippi, ensuring its standing as one of the great American public Universities. The National Collegiate Honors Council, after decades of growth and experience, continues to dedicate itself to promoting educational excellence within our nation's colleges and universities while preparing students for successful professional careers.

Shortly after launching his teaching career, Art began coaching baseball, followed by football and basketball. His skills as a coach quickly gained notice in Vernon, and soon spread both across Connecticut and the nation. Scholastic sports in Vernon have a rich tradition, with numerous state titles and a passionate fan base. At the state level, Art was recognized as the Connecticut High School Baseball Coaches Association's ``Coach of the Year'' in 2006, and nationally, received the ``Take Pride in America'' award for his work in starting Pee Wee Sports with the Vernon Junior Women's Club. And in 2003, Art won the American Baseball Coaches Association's Regional Coach-of-the- Year Award.

He has coached 758 baseball games, winning 433, including 11 conference championships. In his over 41 years at Rockville High School, Art has coached more games than any other individual in the school's history. Under his leadership, his students also reached three state championship games, and captured the 2000 Class ``L'' title. A tireless teacher, coach, and mentor to Connecticut students, Art has demonstrated a passion for helping youth through sports that is unmatched. Without exaggeration, Art touched the lives of thousands of youngsters, transforming their lives as a positive role model.

RODNEY P. FRELINGHUYSEN of new jersey in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Bloomfield Friends of the Library, located in Bloomfield Township, Essex County, New Jersey, as they celebrate their 80th Anniversary. In 1902, the first library in Bloomfield was founded by a man named James Newbegin Jarvie. A wealthy business man, he founded the Jarvie Memorial Library in memory of his parents. At this time, the library was located in the Westminster Presbyterian Church. It remained here until 1923, when he sold the library, complete with its collections and equipment, to the Township of Bloomfield for $60,000. Over the course of the next four years, the library moved to several different places, until finally the Board of Trustees purchased land at 90 Broad Street for $23,000, where it remains to this day. As the years passed, the library's collections grew, and as the collections grew so did the need for more space. In 1963, the library began planning and fundraising, and soon started construction. On September 5, 1967, the library finally reopened. The main floor of the original building was now refurbished as the Children's Library. The adult library had moved into the new addition, and the lower levels were now to be used as a meeting room and for the staff area. In 1969, the meeting room was redesigned into a theater, which is still used today for musicals, films, lectures and even children's programs. Presently, the Bloomfield Public Library offers a wide array of services for children, teens, and adults. Here, one can research the Township's history, look up the High School's summer reading program, or look up Driving Permit Practice Tests. The Library also provides accommodations for the physically and visually impaired and for those with reading disabilities, among its many other services. Behind the scenes, keeping all of this running over the last 80 years, has been the Bloomfield Friends of the Library. As a matter of fact, in 1935, the Bloomfield Friends of the Library was the first in a public library in the East to be established, and they are the oldest Friends of the Library east of the Mississippi. The Library's public relation's director, Helen Scherff Taylor, presented the idea as she thought it would inspire more library services to the community. She was right, and the idea spread to the Bloomfield Chapter of the American Association of University Women and to the Women's Club of Bloomfield who decided to sponsor the Friends of the Library. Less than a year later, the organization had their first meeting. Today, the Bloomfield Friends of the Library continually works to assist the library to provide and improve its facilities and services to the residents of Bloomfield. Some of their recent accomplishments include donations for the purchase of books for both the Adult and Children's Libraries, donations for the Audiovisual Department for the purchase of tapes and DVDs, and donations for equipment such as computers, appliances, and copiers. It is also thanks to these donations that the library is open on Sundays. It is through the tireless work of the Bloomfield Friends of the Library that the Township of Bloomfield and its residents continue to enjoy the Bloomfield Public Library. Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Bloomfield Friends of the Public Library as they celebrate their 80th Anniversary. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1463] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING THE 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BLOOMFIELD FRIENDS OF THE LIBRARY ______ HON.

DAVID G. VALADAO of california in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Wasco Union High School District in honor of its centennial. In 1915, people from the Cleveland, Maple, Poplar, Wildwood, and Semitropic, and Wasco Elementary School Districts voted to form the Wasco Union High School District in their community. Wasco High School operated out of a rented auditorium-like building known as Wasco Hall and enrolled twenty-eight students during its first year. In December 2015, the district purchased a fifteen acre school site at Trogdon's Corner. Construction began at this site in August 1916 and was completed in March 1917. Since the construction of the ``Main Building'' several new buildings have been added to the campus and the student body has grown tremendously. Wasco Union High School District is now one of the largest high school districts in Kern County and covers approximately seven hundred and fifty square miles. The curriculum is heavily focused on vocational and agricultural skills and boasts a one hundred and ten acre school farm where students can take classes in welding, agriculture mechanics, plant science, and animal care. Over the past century, the Wasco Union High School District has helped Central Valley children reach their full potential and become active and prosperous members of their communities. The city of Wasco and Kern County as a whole are fortunate to have such a committed and successful academic institution at their disposal.

PAUL L. MODRICH AS A RECIPIENT OF THE 2015 NOBEL PRIZE IN CHEMISTRY ______ HON. G.K. BUTTERFIELD of north carolina in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and congratulate Dr. Paul L. Modrich, James B. Duke Professor of Biochemistry at Duke University, on winning the 2015 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. As a young man growing up in a small town in northern New Mexico, Dr. Modrich was instilled with a curiosity and love of the natural world. When he was a junior in high school, Dr. Modrich's father who taught high school biology, sparked his curiosity in science by suggesting that he learn more about DNA. Dr. Modrich went on to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where he received his undergraduate degree in 1968. It was at MIT while working in a lab that studied the genetics of viruses that infect bacteria, that he became interested in molecular genetics. After MIT, Dr. Modrich matriculated at Stanford University where he obtained a Ph.D. in 1973. Since then, Dr. Modrich has spent his career studying how organisms prevent the occurrence of mutations in their genetic material. This research has led to discovering crucial insights into how a living cell functions, about the molecular causes of several hereditary diseases, and about mechanisms behind cancer development. This research has also contributed to better understanding exactly how DNA is damaged and has led to advancements in cancer treatments. The 114-year-old Nobel award, regarded as the most prestigious prize for chemistry research, is given to recipients whose discoveries have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind. In his current post as a Professor of Biochemistry and Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, Dr. Modrich continues a life of service through research that has improved the lives of individuals. Dr. Modrich believes in and is a testament to the importance of curiosity-based research. He has demonstrated time and again that basic research leads to unanticipated results which have value for saving and improving the quality of lives. Mr. Speaker, Dr. Modrich has spent his career on the forefront of groundbreaking research that will surely continue to benefit health outcomes for all people. I am so pleased that he is being recognized for his truly amazing work. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Dr. Paul L. Modrich for winning the 2015 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1463] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE SELECTION OF DR.

DEBBIE DINGELL of michigan in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the City of Flat Rock, Michigan on its 50th anniversary of incorporation. The City of Flat Rock embodies so much of what makes Michigan and the 12th Congressional District great; it is a privilege to represent the city and its people. Flat Rock began as a Wyandot Native American settlement, and later was designated as a reservation for the Wyandot, functioning in that way until 1830. In 1818, Solomon Sibley purchased 330 acres of land in the area, and in 1824 the Vreeland family purchased nearly 800 acres, including the 330 acres belonging to Mr. Sibley. The land was plotted as the villages of Vreelandt and Smooth Rock. In 1838, the village of Flat Rock was platted and recorded by the Gibraltar and Flat Rock Land Company, who purchased a large portion of the land. At that time, the company was attempting to build a canal to connect Lake Erie with Lake Michigan. While that effort did not succeed, it was a larger indication of the fact that many people from the east coast, and especially New York state, were traveling to the fertile farmlands in what is now Southeast Michigan. The area was officially incorporated as a village in 1923 and later as a city in 1965, the occasion which we celebrate today. In the 20th century, the village and city of Flat Rock has enjoyed tremendous growth through thoughtful and capable leadership, including the work of the current Mayor, City Council, and staff. The City's booming growth in the past ten years has significantly increased property values and population, a trend that is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Henry Ford recognized the special nature of Flat Rock and established the Ford Motor Company Lamp Factory on the banks of the Huron River in 1925. This relationship with Ford Motor Company has been a successful one, and today, Flat Rock is the proud home of the Flat Rock Assembly Plant which produces the iconic Ford Mustang and the Ford Fusion. The City of Flat Rock has captured the best aspects of industry and production, while at the same time, maintaining a unique identity with a small town feel. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing the 50th anniversary of the City of Flat Rock and to wish the city many more years of success. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1464] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CITY OF FLAT ROCK ______ HON.

CHRIS VAN HOLLEN of maryland in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the International Day of the Girl and to advocate for robust funding for programs that benefit the education of refugee children in general and refugee girls in particular. Today, there are more forcibly displaced people roaming the earth than at any other time since World War II. 60 million men, women and children currently qualify as refugees. One in every two is under the age of 18 and about 50% of them are girls. While the U.S. is a generous supporter of global aid programs, less than 10% of that aid goes to education and less than 2% goes to educate children trapped in emergencies. Many refugee children have no schools nearby to attend and in those cases where education is an option, refugee children face significant challenges such as overcrowding, language barriers and the lack of learning materials. As a consequence, many refugee children around the world do not receive the quality education they need to survive as adults. Access to education is especially vital for young girls who are six times more likely to marry as children if access to secondary education is unavailable to them. Those who fall between the cracks often become victims of human trafficking and child labor. The average refugee is displaced from their home for 17 years. Without an adequate education, refugee children can become economically handicapped for life. They grow up without the skills to earn a living or support a family. According to the Girl Up organization, every additional year of secondary education completed by refugees results in a 10% increase in earnings. Every bit of the support we provide can help break the cycle of poverty that threatens the majority of refugees. That is why I rise on this International Day of the Girl to commend groups like Girl Up and organizations like UNICEF and UNHCR for all they do to support refugees and especially for their support of childhood education. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1464] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REGARDING INTERNATIONAL DAY OF THE GIRL ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to extend my personal congratulations to my former college professor, Dr. Delores Stephens of Morehouse College, upon her receipt of the Vulcan Materials Company's Teaching Excellence Award for the 2015-2016 academic year. Professor Stephens has served Morehouse College faithfully as a Professor of English since 1964. Presaging her future success in academia, Professor Stephens graduated as valedictorian from Spelman College, where she earned a B.A. in English. She went on to earn an M.A. in English and American Literature from Atlanta University, and a Ph.D. in English at the prestigious Emory University. In fact, her academic accomplishments are not limited to the United States. She has also received a certificate of completion from the University of London and a Testamur from the University of Exeter. Prior to teaching at Morehouse, she was a member of the faculty at the Atlanta School of Business, as well as Norfolk State University and Dillard University. Professor Stephens arrived at Morehouse College in 1964, and has since played an integral role throughout the campus. She served as chair of the English department for seven years, and was elected to the Executive Committee of the Association of Departments of English. Professor Stephens also served as an associate editor of the Journal of Negro History for many years. Professor Stephens' dedication to students extends beyond the classroom. She is a charter member of Sigma Tau Delta International English Honor Society, organized at Morehouse in 1976. She has been recognized by the national office as the Upsilon Nu Chapter's sponsor for twenty years. In addition, Professor Stephens has served as a reader for the Educational Testing Services (ETS) for AP examinations and for testing and validation of the SAT Writing Examination. Her advice and tutelage is highly sought after, and she assists by mentoring numerous current and former students. On a personal note, I was fortunate enough to be a student of Professor Stephens' and also to serve as a student assistant in her office during my freshman and sophomore years at Morehouse. I greatly benefited from her wise counsel and sage advice, which I carried with me through law school and my career, as well as throughout my time in the state legislature and now, in the United States Congress. Mr. Speaker, today I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating and honoring an outstanding educator and dear mentor, Professor Delores Stephens. I firmly believe that Professor Stephens helped lead me on the path that has brought me to where I am today, and she has charitably provided the same level of astute guidance to many who have come before and after me. We should all aspire to build such a prolific and inspirational legacy as Professor Delores Stephens. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1465] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF PROFESSOR DELORES STEPHENS ______ HON.

G.K. BUTTERFIELD of north carolina in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the cable industry's decades-long commitment to enhancing diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Last week, cable operators, program networks, and business career development experts gathered in New York City for ``Diversity Week'' to discuss ways to increase the representation of women, people of color, and other underrepresented groups at all levels of their organizations. At this annual meeting, leaders in the industry measure the industry's progress, share effective diversity strategies and best practices, honor the industry's diversity heroes, and raise substantial financial support for industry diversity initiatives like the National Association for Multi-Ethnicity in Communications and Women in Cable Telecommunications. A recent industry workforce diversity survey revealed that 39 percent of full-time cable employees are people of color, which is higher than the national average. The same survey found that thirty two percent of women are industry executives compared to just 20 percent in other industries. These promising results, among other encouraging metrics, demonstrate the cable industry's commitment to greater diversity. The cable industry fully understands that diversity spurs innovation. It is committed to promoting an inclusive culture that will lend itself to fully engaged and more productive workplaces across the country. Indeed, infusing diversity and inclusion into various layers of the industry will best reflect the customers and communities it serves. Mr. Speaker, the steps taken by this industry to promote and boost the contributions of women and multi-ethnic professionals are earnest and effective. These efforts not only outline a moral infrastructure for the manner in which companies should conduct business, but reaffirm the industry's commitment to producing meaningful and lasting change in employment diversity. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1465] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE CABLE INDUSTRY'S COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY ______ HON.

DEBBIE DINGELL of michigan in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Lana and Henry Pollack for receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Michigan League of Conservation Voters. The Pollacks both have long, distinguished careers in public service and environmental advocacy. If you live in Michigan and care about conservation or environmental protection you have likely crossed paths with the Pollacks because they are both tireless workers and experts in the field. Michigan and the nation owe both Lana and Henry a tremendous debt of gratitude for all of their efforts and accomplishments over the years. A founding member of the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, Lana Pollack has a distinguished record of public service and is one of the most consistent and powerful environmental advocates in the country. First elected to the Michigan State Senate in 1983 where she served for 11 years, Lana quickly made her mark on environmental policy in the state by authoring the landmark ``Polluter Pays'' statute that required polluters to pay the cleanup costs of their contamination. This ultimately saved Michigan taxpayers over $100 million while improving our environment at the same time. Her legacy as an environmental champion continued as president of the Michigan Environmental Council where she served from 1996-2008. In 2010, President Obama appointed her as the U.S. Chair of the International Joint Commission, where she continues to work to protect the Great Lakes in partnership with Canadian officials. Henry Pollack is one of our nation's preeminent experts on climate change, a field that he has studied for a majority of his life. He is currently a professor of geophysics at the University of Michigan where he has served for over 40 years. Henry's contributions to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were numerous and he was one of the scientific leaders of the group. The capstone of his career was when the IPCC was awarded the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize along with Vice President Al Gore for their incredible work. Henry's work on climate change research and policy continues as an adviser to Vice President Gore's Climate Project. What stands out the most to me about Lana and Henry is their unique appreciation of the urgent need to protect our natural resources that is paired with unmatched expertise in the field. This rare combination of talent has made Michigan a better place to live, work and raise a family. There is no couple more deserving of this tremendous honor than Lana and Henry Pollack. You continue to inspire all of us with your unparalleled work, and we know there are still more chapters to be written in your already incredible story. Congratulations once again for receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Michigan League of Conservation Voters--a fitting tribute to a lifetime of service. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1465] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE SERVICE OF LANA AND HENRY POLLACK ______ HON.

JOE COURTNEY of connecticut in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to thank an outstanding public servant from the State of Connecticut on the occasion of her retirement. Sharon Palmer has served for the past three years as Commissioner of the Department of Labor and as a lifelong advocate for our state's workers. During her time as Commissioner, Sharon has left a lasting mark on the state's economy by improving workforce training programs, strengthening jobs initiatives and working relentlessly to remove fraud from state programs. Sharon has simultaneously worked to advance opportunity for Connecticut's workers, to preserve the state's valuable resources, and to advocate for federal grants that have allowed innovation to flourish in our home state. Sharon's involvement with workforce issues dates far before her time as Commissioner. She worked as the former Vice President of the Connecticut AFL-CIO, and president of the state chapter of the American Federation of Teachers, serving as an ally and liaison for workers. Her previous experience as an educator instilled in her a deep understanding of the connection between education, opportunity, and a workforce prepared to power a growing economy. Sharon never shies from speaking her mind or sticking up for policies that Connecticut workers need and deserve. If you are at odds with Sharon, you can expect a firm, but fair discussion. She would never back down when the well-being of Connecticut families is at stake. Sharon hails from Waterford, CT, in the southeastern part of the state. Somehow she always found time to participate at the local level of town government and was an active member of the Democratic Town Committee. Sharon was and is a staunch supporter of mine who helped me win a victory to Congress in 2006 in a hard fought race that was decided by the smallest of margins--83 votes. Sharon also was a devoted wife to her departed husband George and the mother of four children, Kerry, Cory, Greg, and Chris. Although her advice, hard work, and experience will surely be missed by the State of Connecticut, I ask my colleagues to please join in wishing my friend Sharon Palmer a restful and enjoyable retirement. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1466] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING SHARON PALMER ______ HON.

CREC-2015-10-09-pt1-PgE1467-3,CREC-2015-10-09,114,175TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BERKLEY SCHOOL DISTRICT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1467] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 175TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BERKLEY SCHOOL DISTRICT ______ HON. SANDER M. LEVIN of michigan in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the Berkley School District as it celebrates its 175th anniversary this year. The Berkley School District serves the cities of Berkley, Huntington Woods and the northern portion of Oak Park, all of which I have had the privilege of representing during my tenure in the House of Representatives. The Berkley School District had its beginnings in 1840, only 3 years after Michigan attained statehood, in the Blackmon School, a one-room schoolhouse that was part of the Royal Oak Township School District #7. Berkley, like our nation, has changed dramatically in the last 175 years. What began as a one room school house in the area of Catalpa and Coolidge (Blackmon School) is now a comprehensive PreK-12 district including nine buildings and a commitment to personal excellence for all students. This commitment is evident in the achievement of Berkley School District students, whose high school graduation rate is 98%, with nearly 100% of graduates continuing their education at colleges and universities. It is no surprise that Berkley School District students are so well- prepared for future success, as nearly 60% of its teachers have Masters degrees or higher, its high school students are offered more Advanced Placement courses than any other traditional high school campus in Oakland County, and the district is home to Norup Academy, the only K-8 International Baccalaureate program in the country which is housed on a single campus. Just a few weeks ago, Pattengill Elementary School was recognized by the U.S. Department of Education as a National Blue Ribbon School for 2015, which helps to illustrate the district's commitment to excellence for the earliest learners as well as those preparing to graduate from high school. As important as strong academics are to student success, the Berkley School District has helped students excel in music, the arts, and other extracurricular activities. Its orchestra, marching band and concert band have won numerous state honors, as has its a cappella, bell tone and concert choirs. Its students have had their artwork shown at national, state and local competitions. And students in the Berkley School District's co-curricular programs, including marketing, communications, literacy and poetry, and robotics have won honors at the state, local, and national levels. The Berkley School District has long benefitted from strong community support, which I know firsthand. My beloved late wife Vicki and I raised our children in Berkley, and all four of them attended the Berkley Schools. Indeed, it is fair to say that the roots of my career in public service were planted in our involvement in the district. Vicki joined the Berkley Council for Better Schools in 1959, an organization committed to maintaining excellence in the schools. We hosted Council meetings in our house and made many lifelong friends through our involvement. This community involvement, which has been so meaningful to me personally, continues today. Parents frequently volunteer for school activities, voters support millages to improve students' learning environment and to upgrade technology, and residents contribute to the Berkley Education Foundation, which supports classroom needs as well as the arts programs. In its 175th year, the district's success is rooted in support from the community; it is shepherded by the committed leadership of the Berkley School Board, Superintendent Dennis McDavid and his administrative team; and most importantly it has as its cornerstone the teachers and other education professionals who every day demonstrate their commitment to helping children achieve their fullest potential. As the Berkley School District celebrates this significant milestone, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the students, staff, alumni and the entire community as they celebrate their rich history and continue their success. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1467] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] 175TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BERKLEY SCHOOL DISTRICT ______ HON.

CREC-2015-10-09-pt1-PgE1468,CREC-2015-10-09,114,INTRODUCING A RESOLUTION RECOMMENDING THE DESIGNATION OF A PRESIDENTIAL SPECIAL ENVOY TO THE BALKANS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1468] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTRODUCING A RESOLUTION RECOMMENDING THE DESIGNATION OF A PRESIDENTIAL SPECIAL ENVOY TO THE BALKANS ______ HON. JANICE HAHN of california in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, today, I am reintroducing a resolution to recommend the designation of a Presidential Special Envoy for the Balkans. In November of 1995 the United States government spearheaded a series of peace talks in Dayton, Ohio, that ended more than three years of warfare and ethnic cleansing that plagued much of the Balkans region. Ultimately, from those talks stemmed the Dayton Peace Accords, which essentially established the new-nation state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, as time has evolved since Dayton, the U.S. has made uneven attempts to continue this important dialogue and revisit the many weaknesses in the original Dayton Agreement. As many have said over the years, the Dayton Accords solved the war of the 1990s but did not fully resolve the Constitutional and governmental needs for this new nation state. The time has come to lend our services in aid to this important region and help Bosnia thaw her ``frozen conflict,'' as it has been referred regarding the present situation. This new nation must continue to move forward toward full integration into our important western alliances. Bosnia and Herzegovina must further develop active and free capital markets in order to help secure governmental structures that fully protect the economic, political, and religious rights for her three recognized constituent peoples--the Croat Bosnians, the Bosniak Muslims, and the Serb Bosnians. Croat Bosnians have had over the years trouble consistently electing a truly representative Croatian to the tri-partite Presidency in Sarajevo. In addition, many Croats in Bosnia still do not have full ownership of their pre-war properties and are unable to return to their homesteads. A country is respected for how it treats its smallest constituencies, and in reality the future success of the Croats in Bosnia is the glue that will hold Bosnia and Herzegovina together in the future. While the U.S. has urged the Bosnian government to initiate needed revisions themselves, we have witnessed this relatively new nation state, which maintains great political and economic potential, actually fall back into occasional violent patterns as witnessed in February 2014. As the Representative of the 44th district of California, an area steeped in Balkans culture with a very active Croatian American community, I have heard firsthand the concerns arising from growing general instability and the economic and political difficulties experienced by the Croatian Bosnians, the smallest of the three Dayton recognized constituent peoples of Bosnia. As I have stated before, this region is integral to the future success of our interdependent international community and a Europe that is whole and prosperous. We have an obligation to support the democratic and free market progress that has been hard won over the last two decades in the Balkans. The United States and Europe cannot be distracted by other regions dominating the news. My Resolution will establish a much needed independent Special Envoy for the Secretary of State.

This report will recommend additional and alternative methods for assisting Bosnia and Herzegovina in developing a fully functional and stable system of government--a system that her people so adamantly desire and fully deserve. Therefore, I call upon this 114th Congress to designate a special Presidential Envoy to evaluate the successes and shortcomings of the Dayton Peace Accords, and to provide tangible policy recommendations so that we may assist this region to fully establish the security and prosperity that its citizens demand for themselves.

JANICE HAHN of california in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Ms. HAHN. Mr. Speaker, today, I am reintroducing a resolution to recommend the designation of a Presidential Special Envoy for the Balkans. In November of 1995 the United States government spearheaded a series of peace talks in Dayton, Ohio, that ended more than three years of warfare and ethnic cleansing that plagued much of the Balkans region. Ultimately, from those talks stemmed the Dayton Peace Accords, which essentially established the new-nation state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, as time has evolved since Dayton, the U.S. has made uneven attempts to continue this important dialogue and revisit the many weaknesses in the original Dayton Agreement. As many have said over the years, the Dayton Accords solved the war of the 1990s but did not fully resolve the Constitutional and governmental needs for this new nation state. The time has come to lend our services in aid to this important region and help Bosnia thaw her ``frozen conflict,'' as it has been referred regarding the present situation. This new nation must continue to move forward toward full integration into our important western alliances. Bosnia and Herzegovina must further develop active and free capital markets in order to help secure governmental structures that fully protect the economic, political, and religious rights for her three recognized constituent peoples--the Croat Bosnians, the Bosniak Muslims, and the Serb Bosnians. Croat Bosnians have had over the years trouble consistently electing a truly representative Croatian to the tri-partite Presidency in Sarajevo. In addition, many Croats in Bosnia still do not have full ownership of their pre-war properties and are unable to return to their homesteads. A country is respected for how it treats its smallest constituencies, and in reality the future success of the Croats in Bosnia is the glue that will hold Bosnia and Herzegovina together in the future. While the U.S. has urged the Bosnian government to initiate needed revisions themselves, we have witnessed this relatively new nation state, which maintains great political and economic potential, actually fall back into occasional violent patterns as witnessed in February 2014. As the Representative of the 44th district of California, an area steeped in Balkans culture with a very active Croatian American community, I have heard firsthand the concerns arising from growing general instability and the economic and political difficulties experienced by the Croatian Bosnians, the smallest of the three Dayton recognized constituent peoples of Bosnia. As I have stated before, this region is integral to the future success of our interdependent international community and a Europe that is whole and prosperous. We have an obligation to support the democratic and free market progress that has been hard won over the last two decades in the Balkans. The United States and Europe cannot be distracted by other regions dominating the news. My Resolution will establish a much needed independent Special Envoy for the Secretary of State. This Envoy shall fully investigate the current state of affairs and provide a comprehensive report to the Congress and the Administration. This report will recommend additional and alternative methods for assisting Bosnia and Herzegovina in developing a fully functional and stable system of government--a system that her people so adamantly desire and fully deserve.

RICHARD E. NEAL of massachusetts in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to recognize the First Church of Christ in Longmeadow, Massachusetts as they kick off a yearlong celebration for their 300th anniversary. The establishment of this Congregational church was pivotal in the founding of the town of Longmeadow in 1783 and the great community that flourishes to this day. The origins of the First Church of Christ come from the Pilgrims and Puritans of the Massachusetts Bay Colony fleeing England to escape religious persecution. After the settlement of Springfield, Massachusetts was founded in the 1630s on the banks of the Connecticut River, a group of families came together and created the neighborhood of ``longmeddowe,'' as it was called at the time. At the time, the only church they could go to was First Church in Springfield, miles away from their homes. There were also a series of attacks on the settlers by local Native American tribes. Due to the hazardous journey, the families of Longmeadow decided in 1713 that they should have the right to build their own church in the safety of their neighborhood. During that period, the Massachusetts General Court needed to grant approval to form a parish. After Longmeadow's fourth appeal to the Massachusetts' colonial General Court, they were granted permission to create their own congregation. Since the church was the center of not only religious life, but also political life, Longmeadow was set on the path to become their own town. The first meeting house was completed in March of 1716, where the town's Green is located today. Meetings and services were held there despite the walls taking 13 years to be plastered and without a stove or heating for 50 years. These meetings were a chance for people to have a voice in their community and [[Page E1468]] local politics, a form of direct democracy that would be the cornerstone of American independence from the monarchy in Great Britain. Even today, Longmeadow elects selectmen, just as they did when the community was founded. The founders and parishioners of the First Church of Christ left a fine blueprint on how democracy at its most fundamental roots, can have a lasting effect on a community and on a nation. Mr. Speaker, The First Church of Christ still has much to offer to its parishioners and is still the cornerstone of Longmeadow even after the original meeting house has long been replaced. As they continue to celebrate their 300th anniversary year, I wish them all the best in their endeavors to preserve their rich history and community involvement that has been the legacy of the First Church of Christ. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1467-E1468] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE FIRST CHURCH OF CHRIST IN LONGMEADOW, MASSACHUSETTS ______ HON.

JOHN CONYERS, JR. of michigan in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, sadly, I note the passing of our former colleague, Don Edwards, on October 1. While Don retired from his seat representing his district in Northern California in 1994, he left a lasting legacy after his 32-year career in the House. Taking office in 1963, Don came to Congress at a time when our country was in dire need of men of conscience and the courage to lead on issues concerning civil rights, civil liberties, and the proper limits of government power. Don answered the call, quickly registering his support for landmark legislation such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. As a Member of the Judiciary Committee, he became the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights, a position he used for decades to protect the fundamental rights of all Americans. He fought particularly hard, in reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act, to preserve the Section 5 preclearance requirements for states that had a legacy of voting rights abuses. He realized how critical this law is to the foundational aspirations of America, and said, ``If you can't vote, you are not a real citizen.'' Another area where Don focused his energies concerned the uncovering and elimination of abusive government surveillance. Having been an FBI agent for a brief period prior to his military service in World War II, Don brought to Congress an understanding of the need for government to enforce the laws while not violating the civil liberties of those it is designed to serve. His work on the Judiciary Committee included actions to reign in government surveillance, and he was also instrumental in shutting down the House Un-American Activities Committee, whose sad legacy continues to caution Congress not to abuse its considerable powers. In matters of foreign affairs and the use of U.S. military power, he showed wise judgment in opposing the Vietnam War and also opposed the use of military force in other instances, such as the war in the Persian Gulf in 1991. I knew Don Edwards as a principled man who never stopped believing that the government's coercive powers should be subject to the highest levels of scrutiny, and that we should never forget that our government exists through the consent of the governed, with the purpose of preserving and not eroding our rights. We are grateful for his service to Congress and this country. He will be missed, but we will continue the work he devoted himself to in the Judiciary Committee and in Congress.

As a Member of the Judiciary Committee, he became the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights, a position he used for decades to protect the fundamental rights of all Americans. He fought particularly hard, in reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act, to preserve the Section 5 preclearance requirements for states that had a legacy of voting rights abuses. He realized how critical this law is to the foundational aspirations of America, and said, ``If you can't vote, you are not a real citizen.'' Another area where Don focused his energies concerned the uncovering and elimination of abusive government surveillance. Having been an FBI agent for a brief period prior to his military service in World War II, Don brought to Congress an understanding of the need for government to enforce the laws while not violating the civil liberties of those it is designed to serve. His work on the Judiciary Committee included actions to reign in government surveillance, and he was also instrumental in shutting down the House Un-American Activities Committee, whose sad legacy continues to caution Congress not to abuse its considerable powers. In matters of foreign affairs and the use of U.S. military power, he showed wise judgment in opposing the Vietnam War and also opposed the use of military force in other instances, such as the war in the Persian Gulf in 1991. I knew Don Edwards as a principled man who never stopped believing that the government's coercive powers should be subject to the highest levels of scrutiny, and that we should never forget that our government exists through the consent of the governed, with the purpose of preserving and not eroding our rights. We are grateful for his service to Congress and this country. He will be missed, but we will continue the work he devoted himself to in the Judiciary Committee and in Congress.

JIM COSTA of california in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the life of Megan Elizabeth Barron, who recently passed away on September 10, 2015, at the age of 24. Megan was an extraordinary person, and she will always be remembered as a young woman who lived her life with purpose and great dedication to her family, community, and strangers via her writing and advocacy for dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. Megan passed away surrounded by her loving family at the University of Miami Hospital. She was born on January 26, 1991, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Richard E. Barron and Elizabeth Ward. Megan was born with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, an extremely severe skin condition that led her to write about her life experiences and further inspire others. She was an extremely talented young woman who was admired by many and always asserted her right for respect. Regardless of the obstacles Megan encountered she remained positive and was a scholar who focused on her studies. Megan graduated salutatorian of Coral Springs High School in 2009. She went on to graduate from Trinity College of Arts and Sciences at Duke University in 2013. While at Duke, Megan was inducted into Phi Alpha Theta history honor society and she founded the Duke Disability Alliance. Among her many accomplishments Megan was a National Merit Commended Scholar, a National Advanced Placement Scholar of Distinction and a Florida International University book award winner. She received the Miami Herald Silver Knight Award in general scholarship and the annual Spirit Award from the Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa Research Association (DebRA) of America. Megan also interned with the White House, Senator Bill Nelson of Florida's legislative office and the Library of Congress. During her last two years Megan served as the Social Media Coordinator for the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD). Megan was a model of comportment in the face of daunting adversity. Despite her illness, she never seemed to let it get in her way. She enjoyed history, food, flowers, travel, poetry, writing, the Pittsburgh Steelers, ballet, sailing, French culture, politics, and the arts. Megan is survived by her father Richard E. Barron, mother Elizabeth Ward, stepfather James Patrick Ward, and brother Jason R. Barron. The poem below titled The Butterfly Child written by Megan back in 2003 perfectly depicts her inspiring persona and the way in which she served as a role model and inspiration to those that she met. A fragile little butterfly Whose been cursed but doesn't know why Who sees the world through different eyes And soars with the wings for the butterflies For the precious little butterfly Is different and she knows That crying doesn't ever help But sometimes her struggling shows To be a butterfly in such a world Where people are so vain She tries to keep her chin up She knows she can't complain. Although her physical differences Make life become a fight She has been blessed in different ways And sheds the world with light. Though people are judgmental To the precious butterfly Her mind is one in a million Her mind is her tool to fly The curse has been put on the butterfly Yes, she knows it's true But she won't let it stop her From soaring to the sky The Miraculous little butterfly Puts up a mighty fight But that won't stand in this Butterflies way From spreading her inspiring light Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in saying farewell to a young woman who embodied passion and inspiration, Ms. Megan Elizabeth Barron. Her genuine character and loving commitment to life will be greatly missed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1469] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE OF MEGAN ELIZABETH BARRON ______ HON.

BETTY McCOLLUM of minnesota in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of Twin Cities Public Television's efforts through the American Graduate initiative to provide Minnesota's African American youth with a platform to share their educational journeys, challenges, and success stories with our community. American Graduate is a multi-year public media initiative through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting that aids local communities across America in finding solutions to the high school dropout crisis that plagues our nation. I am proud that in Minnesota, Twin Cities Public Television's contribution to this national effort has been to explore not only the state's achievement gap in our African American community, but also the belief gap that fuels it There is often a significant division in belief between what children and families of traditionally marginalized groups believe they can accomplish and what others in positions of power believe these youth are capable of. TPT's effort is aimed at exposing these barriers to success and providing youth with an opportunity to share their stories. TPT's American Graduate supported programming is called ``Believe in Black Youth,'' which includes segments on ``Almanac'', TPT's weekly public affairs program, online spots and much more. The cornerstone of TPT's efforts is a thirty minute documentary titled ``Black Brilliance'' which chronicles the journeys of five African American high school students to graduation and their dreams for the future. It is through stories like those told in ``Black Brilliance'' that TPT seeks to help change the narrative of a belief system about Minnesota's marginalized African American youth from one of inadequacy and disadvantage to one of value and worth. Every student in America deserves the opportunity to receive a quality education, and ensuring that all of our nation's children have the best chance for success in life is the most important job we have as leaders, teachers, parents, and Americans. I am truly pleased to see Twin Cities Public Television address these critical issues and advancing the voices of those in our community who have found it so difficult to have their voices heard. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1469] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SUPPORTING TWIN CITIES PUBLIC TELEVISION'S ``BELIEVE IN BLACK YOUTH'' PROGRAMMING ______ HON.

SUSAN W. BROOKS of indiana in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Albert Chen on the occasion of his retirement. For 30 years Albert has served as Telamon Corporation's leader. He and his wife, Margaret, founded Telamon Corporation in 1985 and since then have turned it into a multi- million dollar company that employs hundreds of people and provides opportunities for people to do meaningful work. The Hoosier community is forever grateful for Albert's dedication to making Indiana a better place. Albert, a Taiwan native, has been an innovator and successful business leader in Indiana for decades. After receiving his degree from National Cheng-Chi University in Taiwan, Albert came to America to pursue a career in business. He received his master's degree in Mathematical Sciences from Portland State University and started his business career with GTE on the west coast. He later relocated to Indiana to fill the role of Manager of the Midwest region for GTE. Albert and Margaret decided to lay roots and build their business in Carmel, Indiana. Albert is the founder, Chairman of the Board, President, and CEO of Telamon Corporation, a company based in Carmel, Indiana. Telamon, a company whose mission is to simplify business for their clients, specializes in simplified solutions for telecommunication networks, business process outsourcing, energy management, industrial assembly, and telehealth services. Since its founding in 1985, Telamon has developed into one of the largest private companies in Indiana and is consistently ranked as one of the 500 fastest growing companies in the United States.

ROSA L. DeLAURO of connecticut in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, it is with my heartfelt congratulations that I rise today to recognize the Jeffrey Modell Foundation on the dedication of its newest Diagnostic and Research Center here in Washington, DC. Home to diagnostic and clinical care as well as an additional research facility, this new center will undoubtedly be a beacon of hope for families with children suffering from Primary Immunodeficiency both here in the metro-Washington area and across the country. In 1986, Vicki and Fred Modell lost their only son, Jeffrey, to Primary Immunodeficiency, a genetic disorder that leaves the body unable to fight off infections. Not long after their son passed away, the Modell's created the Jeffrey Modell Foundation--not to commemorate Jeffrey's death, but rather to celebrate his life by giving life to others who suffer from the same illness. Today, the Foundation is a global organization devoted to early and precise diagnosis, meaningful treatments, and research toward a cure. A thriving force in the field, it achieves its aims through basic and clinical research, physician education, patient support, advocacy, public awareness, and newborn screenings. The Jeffrey Modell Centers Network now includes 600 expert physicians and 250 research, diagnostic, and referral centers. It has a presence in 206 cities, in 80 countries, on six continents. On Tuesday, September 29th, Vicki and Fred came to Washington, DC to celebrate the dedication of the newest Jeffrey Modell Diagnostic and Research Center for Primary Immunodeficiency at Children's National Medical Center. This world-class facility will help sick children and their parents deal with the trauma of serious illness. Under the leadership of Dr. Michael Keller, this new Center will be a national center of excellence in patient diagnosis, clinical care, and research. This great step forward for children suffering from serious illness throughout the Washington region came about because of the dedication, commitment and support shown by Vicki and Fred Modell and the Jeffrey Modell Foundation. I could not be more proud to congratulate and thank both the Jeffrey Modell Foundation and Children's National Hospital for all that they do to save so many precious lives.

KENNY MARCHANT of texas in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the birthday of a hardworking and enduring woman, my aunt, Emily Lucille Jones. Emily was born on October 16, 1925 in Cooper, Texas, to Alfred and Cordie Jones. Emily was born the third of eight children, all whom were active at a young age in day to day operations of the family farm. This taught Emily the importance of hard work and earning a living early on. After graduating from Gober High School in 1943 she moved to Bonham, Texas, to work for the county clerk's office. While there, she started attending the First Baptist Church. Becoming involved in the church led her to meet Dan Carver, the man she would eventually marry in 1947 and with whom she would move to Lubbock, Texas. As Dan attended Texas Tech University, Emily was employed by Southwestern Bell Telephone. After Dan earned his degree they had three beautiful children, Jeffrey, Judy, and Mary. In 1967 Emily received her Associates degree in elementary education from Trinidad Jr. State College and went on to earn her Bachelor of Science in elementary education in 1972 from Texas Tech University. Working with children was always a great passion of hers and she has always been a strong role model. Emily was always an active teacher in various church organizations including Sunday school, Girls Auxiliary, and Bible School, to name a few. She worked as a teacher as well as managed finances for various companies. Even in her retirement Emily remains active in several senior groups within the church. Travel was her leisurely passion, as Emily has travelled extensively throughout Europe and the United States. She is an avid quilter and enjoys crossword puzzles, cooking, working in her yard, and spending quality family time with her only grandson, Andrew. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to celebrate the birthday of such a fulfilled and jubilant person, my aunt, Emily Lucille Jones. I ask all of my distinguished colleagues to join me in celebrating her ninety years. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1470] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CELEBRATING THE 90TH BIRTHDAY OF EMILY LUCILLE JONES ______ HON.

SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. of georgia in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and pleasure to extend my sincerest congratulations to the congregation of my church home, Mount Zion Baptist Church in Albany, Georgia, as we celebrate a remarkable 150 years. A celebration in honor of this very significant anniversary will be held on Sunday, October 11, 2015 at the church. This celebration will also serve as an opportunity to honor Pastor Daniel Simmons for his 24 years of faithful leadership to the church. Tracing its roots back to the Civil War era, the church was founded in 1865, the same year that the Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery was passed by Congress and ratified by the States. In the beginning years, the members of the church met at Jerry Walter's Blacksmith Shop at the corner of Highland Avenue and Jackson Street. The church had purchased land and was constructing a new building at Washington Street and Highland Avenue but the structure was destroyed by a storm before it was completed. The church next purchased land at Whitney Avenue and Jefferson Street. A Yankee colonel donated a house that was brought to Albany from nearby Leesburg. The house served as the first church structure at that site until years later when it was torn down and a church of brick was built. This brick structure is known as the Old Mount Zion building. Mr. Speaker, this ardent community of believers, whose ancestors had finally been freed from the bonds of slavery, were subjected to continuous oppression and injustice, ultimately resulting in the Civil Rights Movement. They attempted to register to vote, they rallied, they marched, and they were thrown in jail. The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. came to Albany to mobilize the African-American community and was himself incarcerated. Yet, the spirit of the congregation of Mount Zion was not broken, and their faith in God grew stronger than ever before as they prevailed. Many of the rallies during the Albany phase of the Civil Rights Movement were held at Mount Zion and to commemorate those struggles, the church donated the building to the Albany Civil Rights Museum which is currently housed there. In 1972, the church moved to a new location at 1905 Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue. In 1994, Mount Zion again faced adversity when floods inundated the church with eight feet of water. The congregation took the old adage, ``come Hell or high water,'' to heart and continued to worship at the local Jewish Temple B'nail Israel until the church building was reconstructed a little over a year later. In its 150 years, Mount Zion has seen only nine pastors but each has left a lasting mark on the church. The founding pastor, Rev. R.R. Watson faithfully served the church during its first 15 years of existence until he was called to his heavenly reward. In 1944, Rev. Dr. E. James Grant began leading the flock. During his 47 years of service, the church grew and flourished tremendously. In 1991, Pastor Daniel Simmons took leadership of Mount Zion and this year, he celebrates 24 years of service to Mount Zion. A charismatic evangelical innovator, Pastor Simmons' spiritual zeal is both infectious and highly contagious. Under his leadership, Mount Zion expanded its ministry services, increased its membership tremendously to the point where a second worship service was added, and moved into its new state-of-the-art facility on 109 acres of land at 901 South Westover Boulevard in 2010. With a congregation of over 3,000 members and 54 ministries, including both radio and television ministries, Mount Zion is truly ``reaching the world for Christ through evangelism, discipleship, fellowship, and missions.'' On a personal note, I am proud that Mount Zion is my church home and that I am an ordained Deacon and Trustee. My wife, Vivian, and I have been blessed by Pastor Simmons' wise counsel and sage advice. Over the 19 years I have been a member of the church, I have known some of the most kind, loving, and generous Christians who truly have a heart for Jesus. To God be the glory, for He is doing amazing things through Mount Zion. Mr. Speaker, today I ask my colleagues to join me and my wife, Vivian, in honoring and commending Mount Zion Baptist Church in Albany, Georgia for its enduring commitment, despite adversity, to each other and to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. May Mount Zion continue to inspire the community in courage, in dedication, and in faith for many more years to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1471] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF MOUNT ZION BAPTIST CHURCH'S 150TH ANNIVERSARY ______ HON.

A celebration in honor of this very significant anniversary will be held on Sunday, October 11, 2015 at the church. This celebration will also serve as an opportunity to honor Pastor Daniel Simmons for his 24 years of faithful leadership to the church. Tracing its roots back to the Civil War era, the church was founded in 1865, the same year that the Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery was passed by Congress and ratified by the States. In the beginning years, the members of the church met at Jerry Walter's Blacksmith Shop at the corner of Highland Avenue and Jackson Street. The church had purchased land and was constructing a new building at Washington Street and Highland Avenue but the structure was destroyed by a storm before it was completed. The church next purchased land at Whitney Avenue and Jefferson Street. A Yankee colonel donated a house that was brought to Albany from nearby Leesburg. The house served as the first church structure at that site until years later when it was torn down and a church of brick was built. This brick structure is known as the Old Mount Zion building. Mr. Speaker, this ardent community of believers, whose ancestors had finally been freed from the bonds of slavery, were subjected to continuous oppression and injustice, ultimately resulting in the Civil Rights Movement. They attempted to register to vote, they rallied, they marched, and they were thrown in jail. The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. came to Albany to mobilize the African-American community and was himself incarcerated. Yet, the spirit of the congregation of Mount Zion was not broken, and their faith in God grew stronger than ever before as they prevailed. Many of the rallies during the Albany phase of the Civil Rights Movement were held at Mount Zion and to commemorate those struggles, the church donated the building to the Albany Civil Rights Museum which is currently housed there. In 1972, the church moved to a new location at 1905 Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue. In 1994, Mount Zion again faced adversity when floods inundated the church with eight feet of water. The congregation took the old adage, ``come Hell or high water,'' to heart and continued to worship at the local Jewish Temple B'nail Israel until the church building was reconstructed a little over a year later. In its 150 years, Mount Zion has seen only nine pastors but each has left a lasting mark on the church. The founding pastor, Rev. R.R. Watson faithfully served the church during its first 15 years of existence until he was called to his heavenly reward. In 1944, Rev. Dr. E. James Grant began leading the flock. During his 47 years of service, the church grew and flourished tremendously. In 1991, Pastor Daniel Simmons took leadership of Mount Zion and this year, he celebrates 24 years of service to Mount Zion. A charismatic evangelical innovator, Pastor Simmons' spiritual zeal is both infectious and highly contagious. Under his leadership, Mount Zion expanded its ministry services, increased its membership tremendously to the point where a second worship service was added, and moved into its new state-of-the-art facility on 109 acres of land at 901 South Westover Boulevard in 2010. With a congregation of over 3,000 members and 54 ministries, including both radio and television ministries, Mount Zion is truly ``reaching the world for Christ through evangelism, discipleship, fellowship, and missions.'' On a personal note, I am proud that Mount Zion is my church home and that I am an ordained Deacon and Trustee. My wife, Vivian, and I have been blessed by Pastor Simmons' wise counsel and sage advice. Over the 19 years I have been a member of the church, I have known some of the most kind, loving, and generous Christians who truly have a heart for Jesus. To God be the glory, for He is doing amazing things through Mount Zion. Mr. Speaker, today I ask my colleagues to join me and my wife, Vivian, in honoring and commending Mount Zion Baptist Church in Albany, Georgia for its enduring commitment, despite adversity, to each other and to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. May Mount Zion continue to inspire the community in courage, in dedication, and in faith for many more years to come. ____________________",package_114_232.csv,4847,4847,4916,"[congressional record

SHANK,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1471-E1472] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING DR. CHARLES V. SHANK ______ HON. BARBARA LEE of california in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life of Dr. Charles V. Shank. Known by many for his seminal development of ultrafast lasers and his visionary leadership as Director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory from 1989 through 2004, Dr. Shank made the Advanced Light Source a world-leading center for soft X-ray science. As a recipient of the U.S. Department of Energy's Enrico Fermi Award on October 20, 2015--presented to outstanding scientists for distinguished achievement--we honor Dr. Shank's life work and lasting legacy. Graduating summa cum laude in 1965 from UC Berkeley, Dr. Shank went on to receive an M.S. and PhD in Electrical Engineering. These early academic achievements were the catalyst for a distinguished twenty year career at AT&T Bell Laboratories, where Dr. Shank made his mark as a pioneer in femtosecond laser spectroscopy and the study of ultrafast events. In 1989, following his meteoric rise at AT&T, Dr. Shank was appointed Director of Berkeley Lab. Here, Dr. Shank would more than double the annual budget and grow the Lab's workforce to nearly 4,000 personnel. Under his watch the stage was set to attract the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) and the creation of the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) to settle at Berkeley. Not long after, he championed the Supernova Cosmology Project, which led to the Nobel [[Page E1472]] Prize-winning discovery of ``dark energy'', a phenomenon partly responsible for the expansion of the universe. These extraordinary advancements brought further discoveries, including the top quark and neutrino mass, the Time Projection Chamber for the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, the front-end system for the Spallation Neutron Source, and the reclamation of valuable land occupied by the long-defunct Bevatron. Today, California's 13th Congressional District salutes the life and work of an outstanding individual and pioneer, Dr. Charles V. Shank. His contributions have truly impacted the Berkeley community, the field of energy and applied science, as well as the lives of his family, friends, and patrons. I join all of Dr. Shank's loved ones in celebrating his incredible accomplishments and offer my highest gratitude for the distinction he has brought upon the 13th Congressional District. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1471-E1472] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING DR.

MAXINE WATERS of california in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I submit a letter to Dr. Joanne Liu, International President of Doctors Without Borders, extending my deepest sympathies to the victims of the U.S. airstrike in Kunduz that killed 22 patients and staff within a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders. Congress of the United States, House of Representatives, Washington, DC, October 6, 2015. Dr. Joanne Liu, International President, Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres. Dear Dr. Liu: It is with an extremely heavy heart that I extend my deepest sympathies to the victims of the U.S. airstrike in Kunduz that killed 22 patients and staff within a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders. Doctors who volunteer their skills in some of the most dangerous regions of the world make sacrifices as brave and selfless as the sacrifices made by our U.S. service members when they are sent into harm's way. My heart goes out to all who were affected by this tragic incident. I have always admired the work of Doctors Without Borders. The organization led the international response to last year's deadly Ebola outbreak in West Africa, and it continues to treat patients in numerous isolated and dangerous parts of the world, including areas of violent conflict like Afghanistan. The courage and compassion of Doctors Without Borders' staff and volunteers are beyond compare. With this tragedy, we are once again reminded of the very real costs of war and recall our collective responsibility to promote international peace and security and protect civilians. It is my sincere hope that there will be a thorough and impartial investigation of the incident and that we work hard to ensure that such an incident never happens again. Once again, my thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this tragedy and I pray that their families may find peace and comfort in the memories of their loved ones and the sympathies of the international community. Sincerely, Maxine Waters, Member of Congress. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1472] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EXPRESSION OF SYMPATHIES TO THE INTERNATIONAL PRESIDENT OF DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS ______ HON.

BILLY LONG of missouri in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Mr. LONG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Warden Linda Sanders, head of Springfield Missouri's U.S. Medical Center for Federal Prisoners (USMCFP), on her recent national recognition by the Federal Bureau of Prisons' (BOP) Agency for Excellence in Prison Management. This distinguished honor highlights outstanding wardens for overall management of staff, inmates, and efficient operations. In earning this award, Warden Sanders was evaluated on the impact of her innovative ideas on the institutional programs she oversees, her steadfast efforts to improve the USMCFP, and extraordinary leadership as the head of her team. Additionally, this honor is a testament to Warden Sanders' impressive career in our justice system. In 1987, she got her start as a correctional officer in a low-security facility in Sandstone, Minnesota. After proving her exemplary work ethic, she was eventually named Warden of Lompoc U.S. Penitentiary in California, where she was the first female warden and first African American warden. Ultimately, after vying for the opportunity to lead the USMCFP, she was assigned as the medical center's warden in 2012. Overseeing the USMCFP, Warden Sanders is responsible for upholding a renowned institution with a rich American history dating back to the Great Depression. At that time, Springfield residents gave 620 acres to the federal government for the construction of a hospital complex, of which the first buildings were completed in 1933. Since, the center has cared for the physical and mental ailments of federal prisoners from across the nation. The prison even hosted a handful of prisoners with infamous names in American justice lore, like John Gotti, Robert Stroud (the Birdman of Alcatraz), and Larry Flynt--just to name a few. Mr. Speaker, Warden Linda Sanders deserves this body's utmost respect for her dedication to our justice system, and I extend her my deepest appreciation for her impressive leadership. Her efforts have not only made Springfield a better community, but have made me ever-prouder to serve the people of Missouri's seventh Congressional District. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1472] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRATULATING WARDEN LINDA SANDERS ON HER RECOGNITION BY THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS' AGENCY FOR EXCELLENCE IN PRISON MANAGEMENT ______ HON.

ELIOT L. ENGEL of new york in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend a warm welcome to the President of the Republic of Korea, Park Geun-hye, who will visit Washington, D.C. for the second time as President next week, on October 13, 2015. President Park Geun-hye has a long and distinguished career in government prior to her election as President and she has proven a most capable leader for the Korean people. The alliance between the United States and Korea is founded, first and foremost, on our shared values of democracy and our belief in the rule of law. The U.S.-Korea alliance is a critical aspect of the security architecture in the Asia-Pacific region and continues to grow and expand. Our partnership is critical in defending against the threat of an increasingly belligerent and unpredictable North Korean regime. North Korea continues to threaten stability on the Peninsula through its rogue nuclear program and dangerous conventional and cyber capabilities. The Republic of Korea, however, has been our close friend and ally in this most sensitive and serious endeavor, and we should strive to take our security partnership to new levels in the coming years. Korea and the United States have also cooperated closely in the development of our civilian nuclear programs for more than 50 years, and over the last several years our countries have been negotiating a new Nuclear Cooperation Agreement to upgrade and replace the previous accord. Today, the Korea 123 Agreement is under review in the U.S. Congress. I look forward to its passage and our continued work in this important area. A robust economic relationship between the U.S. and Korea remains an important aspect of our cooperation. The Republic of Korea is the United States' sixth largest trading partner, and during President Park's tenure, we saw the entry-into-force of the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement. The U.S.-Korea alliance and the multifaceted ties between our two peoples will surely grow deeper as we continue to work together on myriad issues of common concern. I once again welcome President Park to Washington with my best wishes for a successful visit. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1473] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WELCOMING SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT PARK GEUN-HYE AND RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE U.S.-KOREA ALLIANCE ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the National Collegiate Honors Council for their 50th anniversary this year. The National Collegiate Honors Council represents 800 colleges and universities and is composed of 325,000 students dedicated to achieving educational excellence in diverse subject curriculum areas in order to achieve professional career goals. In my district, the National Collegiate Honors Council includes the University of Pittsburgh, Duquesne University, Robert Morris University, and Point Park University. For instance, Point Park's Honors Program welcomes students from all disciplines who desire an enriched college experience. The program builds a community of scholars who have opportunities in three important areas; academics, community services, and leadership. Students participate in a learning process that encourages engagement, creativity, and imagination through honors sections of courses that include additional assignments and a rigorous curriculum. At the end of their degree programs, undergraduate honors students must submit thesis papers and special honors projects capping off their academic careers. Many of these gifted young people participate in Pittsburgh-oriented community projects and the annual Storytelling and Human Rights Symposium, providing their city with invaluable public service. The program also encourages membership in the Honors Student Organization, one of the most active clubs on campus, where members can hold prestigious leadership positions. Honors students also benefit from special housing opportunities, on-campus job opportunities, and enriching study abroad programs that include destinations like London and Rome. Point Park University deserves our recognition for giving its most motivated and gifted students the opportunity to fulfill their potential. The National Collegiate Honors Program, after decades of growth and experience, continues to dedicate itself to promoting educational excellence within our nation's colleges and universities while preparing students for successful professional careers. I invite my colleagues to join me in commending the program's outstanding contributions to our nation's educational and professional communities honoring its 50th anniversary. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1472] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL COLLEGIATE HONORS COUNCIL ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate William [[Page E1473]] Lybarger of Boy Scout Troop 17 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, for achieving the rank of Eagle Scout. The Eagle Scout rank is the highest advancement rank in scouting. Only about five percent of Boy Scouts earn the Eagle Scout Award. The award is a performance-based achievement with high standards that have been well-maintained for more than a century. To earn the Eagle Scout rank, a Boy Scout is obligated to pass specific tests that are organized by requirements and merit badges, as well as complete an Eagle Project to benefit the community. For his project, William chose to undertake a major mulching project at Jones Park in Cedar Rapids. He led a large group of volunteers from his community by laying mulch around the entire park, protecting the trees from damage, and beautifying the park in the process. The work ethic William has shown in his Eagle Project and every other project leading up to his Eagle Scout rank speaks volumes of his commitment to serving a cause greater than himself and assisting his community. Mr. Speaker, the example set by this young man and his supportive family demonstrates the rewards of hard work, dedication and perseverance. I know that all of my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives will join me in congratulating him on reaching the rank of Eagle Scout and wishing him nothing but continued success in his future education and career. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1472-E1473] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO EAGLE SCOUT WILLIAM LYBARGER ______ HON.

DEBBIE DINGELL of michigan in the house of representatives Friday, October 9, 2015 Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 200th Border Survey Anniversary of Pittsfield Township, Michigan. This day commemorates the survey which established the borders of this significant municipality. Pittsfield Township is a vibrant community with a rich history. The area now known as Pittsfield Township was a common crossroads for Native Americans to travel across the country for more than 10,000 years. The land was surveyed on a cold day in 1815 by Alexander Holmes. His work continues to mark the municipality's border with Lodi, Scio, and Ann Arbor Townships. In 1824, Geo. W. Noyes made the purchase of federal land for the township. Originally established as the ``Township of Pitt'' by the Sixth Legislative Council in 1834, it was named in honor of British statesmen William Pitt the Elder who was a passionate advocate for American interests in Parliament prior to the War of Independence. Settlers of European and African heritage settled this area, cleared the land, erected the first school house in Washtenaw County, and created the foundation of this community. Although the present territory of this township might be unrecognizable to figures of the past, it continues to grow because of engaged citizens and steady leadership. Pittsfield has strategically built a municipality which successfully balances economic growth, recreational activities, agricultural viability, and preserving green spaces. This township has grown into the third largest municipality in Washtenaw County because of policies that encourage talented residents to foster economic growth. Residents of their community are proud of it and continually make meaningful contributions to their community and the surrounding area. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today to celebrate Pittsfield Township's 200th Border Survey Anniversary. Its history is an important piece of Michigan's heritage and the anniversary provides an occasion to celebrate and remember it. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 149 (Friday, October 9, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1473] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE 200TH BORDER SURVEY ANNIVERSARY OF PITTSFIELD TOWNSHIP, MICHIGAN ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, on behalf of myself, Representative Bob Goodlatte, and Representative Rob Wittman, I submit these remarks to commemorate the life of Staff Sergeant Jonathan Lewis of Warrenton, Virginia, who passed away September 2, 2015 at age 31. On the evening of September 2, 2015 at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, a terrible tragedy occurred during training for the Fleet Anti- Terrorism Security Team. Several Marines were injured, and Staff Sergeant Jonathan Lewis, a 31-year-old Fauquier native based at Yorktown Naval Weapons Station, was killed. According to Colonel Jeffrey Kenney, the officer in charge of the Expeditionary Operations Training Group, training for the Fleet Anti-Terrorism Security Teams requires ``the highest-caliber Marine, with the dedication and courage to take on the challenge.'' This, according to Colonel Kenney, was the exact makeup of Sergeant Jonathan Lewis. Sergeant Lewis' uncle, Keith Lewis would like his nephew to be remembered as, ``foremost a Marine and just one heck of a human being.'' Our thoughts and prayers are with the Lewis family and the Marines with whom he served. Staff Sergeant Lewis selflessly sacrificed so much to preserve our freedoms and our American way of life. It is because of soldiers like him that we may continue to live in the freest nation on Earth. We will remember his tremendous sacrifice and remain forever grateful.
