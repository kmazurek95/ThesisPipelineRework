The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Palazzo) for 5 minutes. Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the courage, sacrifice, and service of members of the Greatest Generation from my district: Navy veteran Art Albert from Hattiesburg and Mr. John Rounsaville of Jones County, Mississippi. Art Albert Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Albert truly exemplifies dedicated, selfless service in having fought in World War II, the Korean war, and the Vietnam war. I first met Mr. Albert during the Mississippi Gulf Coast Honor Flight, which brings World War II veterans to Washington to see their memorial. Last month I had the opportunity to speak with Mr. Albert at the Victory over Japan Day anniversary ceremony in Hawaii. Here I learned that Art was serving as a machinist mate aboard the USS Missouri on September 2, 1945, where he witnessed the Japanese formally surrender to the United States, ending World War II. Although he would disagree, like so many of his contemporaries who focus not on their service, but on the greatness of our Nation as a whole, Art is a true American hero. Through his service and his quiet work of building our great Nation at home, he has brought honor to himself, the State of Mississippi, and the United States of America. I am honored to have him as a constituent and to have the opportunity to know him both as a person and as an enduring example of the values that have made America great. John Rounsaville Mr. PALAZZO. Last month another of my constituents, John Rounsaville, celebrated his 90th birthday. Beginning in October of 1943, Mr. Rounsaville served for 28 months in the Pacific Theater of operations. He served aboard an LCI Gunboat that was assigned to the Pacific Theater and participated in numerous campaigns, earning his unit an impressive six battle stars for World War II service, including the Navy Unit Commendation Award. Although it has been over 70 years since his time in the Pacific, Mr. Rounsaville remembers his entire tour and speaks of it often. Like the American flag that has been proudly planted in his front yard for decades, I take great pride in representing World War II veterans like Mr. Rounsaville, who belong to a generation whose sacrifices preserved our freedom and liberated the world from tyranny and oppression. I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking John Rounsaville and Art Albert for their courage and bravery and their service to this great Nation; and I wish to extend my heartfelt gratitude to both of these great Americans, their families, and to congratulate them on their dedicated service to the United States of America. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015)] [House] [Page H7177] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MEMBERS OF THE GREATEST GENERATION The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2 of rule XV, I call up motion No. 2, to discharge the Committee on Rules from the further consideration of House Resolution 450, providing for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 597) to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the United States, and for other purposes. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Did the gentleman sign the petition? Mr. FINCHER. Yes. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Tennessee calls up a motion to discharge the Committee on Rules from further consideration of House Resolution 450, which the Clerk will report by title. Point of Order Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, point of order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his point of order. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to rule XV, section 2(d)(1), I make a point of order that this motion is not timely brought. The rule specifically says that, ``On the second and fourth Mondays of a month,'' which is what we are today, ``immediately after the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag, a motion to discharge that has been brought on the calendar for at least seven legislative days shall be privileged if called up by a Member whose signature appears thereon.'' We had the pledge and the prayer earlier today. We also then had intervening activity in the House, and this motion is no longer timely. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point of order? Mr. MULVANEY. I would point out, Mr. Speaker, that we took up 1- minute speeches; we received a message from the Senate; and you, yourself, approved the Journal. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point of order? Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I think my friend from South Carolina, the gentleman, is out of order. This is regular order. We are moving on as procedure. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, while you are continuing, I would like you to consider one thing. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman may proceed. Mr. MULVANEY. The rule is very explicit. The rule does not say that we may not take--the rule says that we must proceed immediately. I recognize the fact that on occasion 1-minute speeches are not considered business of the House, that receiving messages from the Senate are not considered business of the House, and, on occasion, a Journal is not considered business of the House even though, from time to time, we do vote on it. The rule does not say that we cannot do other business. The rule says we can't do anything, that we must proceed immediately after the Pledge of Allegiance, and that if the motion is brought at any other time it is untimely. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does any other Member wish to be heard on this point of order? If not, the Chair will rule. The rule does not say that the motion to discharge must be--it just says that it can be--brought up immediately. Today's proceedings are consistent with previous occasions where the Chair has entertained 1-minute speeches on discharge days, and those speeches proceeded by unanimous consent. On those grounds, the point of order is overruled. Parliamentary Inquiries Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. MULVANEY. Does the language of section 2(d)(1) not specifically say ``shall be privileged if called up''? It is not ``may.'' It is ``shall . . . if. . . . '' The SPEAKER pro tempore. The rule is not so limited. The motion would be in order if it were to be brought up then, and it is also in order to be brought up now. Mr. MULVANEY. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. [[Page H7179]] Mr. MULVANEY. If 2(d)(1) says that it shall be in order if brought up at this particular time but the Chair is ruling that it may be in order at other times, what rule is the Chair relying on for that determination? The SPEAKER pro tempore. There is nothing in the rule that requires the motion to discharge to be brought up immediately following the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. MULVANEY. Further point, Mr. Speaker. The only way that it is privileged is that if it was brought up immediately after the pledge. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair is also following prior practice of the House in entertaining the motion. Mr. MULVANEY. I'm sorry, and Mr. Speaker, when you were giving your decision before, I was reading the rule. Would you please restate the basis for your decision. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has entertained 1-minute speeches on previous discharge days. Those speeches proceeded by unanimous consent. On those grounds, the point of order was overruled. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, you did not address, then, my issue on receiving a message from the Senate or approving the Journal. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has entertained numerous parliamentary inquiries on a matter on which the Chair has already ruled. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. MULVANEY. Would the decision have been different if we had not made 1-minute speeches? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair cannot respond to a hypothetical question. The Clerk will report the title of the resolution. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fincher) will be recognized for 10 minutes and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) will be recognized for 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Even though discharge petitions have rarely been invoked in modern history, they nevertheless embody democracy and its fundamental principle of majority rules, a principle that the gentleman has already talked about earlier. This discharge process offers the only means by which a majority of House Members can secure a vote on a measure that is opposed by the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction and House leadership. What makes the gentleman's remarks a few minutes ago particularly ironic is the fact that the discharge rule evolved from a precursor rule adopted in 1910 as part of the Cannon revolt. The Cannon revolt was a revolt against Speaker Joseph Cannon. It was a remarkable event in the history of this House and is relevant today in more ways than one. Speaker Cannon was, at the time, the longest-serving Republican Speaker in the history of the House, serving as Speaker from 1903 to 1911. Referred to as ``Uncle Joe,'' Speaker Cannon ruled with an iron fist. Historians have not painted him as a great legislator. No. Historians have painted him as a great obstructionist. He blocked legislation, including child labor laws and the right for women to vote. What was his reasoning for blocking this progressive legislation? ``I am tired of listening to all this babble for reform,'' he said. Several times, Republicans tried unsuccessfully to curb Speaker Cannon's broad powers, which included his chairmanship of the Rules Committee and his power to dole out committee assignments, among other powers. But that changed in March of 1910 when 42 Republicans joined with the Democrats introducing a resolution containing a rules package that would strip Speaker Cannon of his many powers. Speaker Cannon tried to filibuster this revolt, speaking from the chair for 26 straight hours while allies tried to round up additional allies who were out celebrating St. Patrick's Day, but it didn't work. Speaker Cannon finally ruled the resolution out of order, but the House overruled the Chair, thereby adopting far-reaching reforms, including the precursor of today's discharge rule. I ask my colleagues to join me in returning power to rank-and-file Members by voting on the motion to discharge and supporting American jobs. With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. First, Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize the gentleman from Tennessee and the passion that he brings to this debate. He has long been a champion of the Export-Import Bank. We have had a respectful disagreement over the substance of the issue, but at this moment I don't care to spend much time on the substance of the issue because we are debating a discharge petition. Mr. Speaker, it was an interesting history lesson that my colleague and friend introduced the House to, and I have no reason to doubt that it is an accurate history lesson. I will note for the Record that apparently somehow Mr. Cannon managed to get a building named after him. But the point I would make is this: whether the gentleman from Tennessee and others have disagreed with process at the Financial Services Committee--I know that they do--but the question before us, Mr. Speaker, is why punish the entirety of the House? Those who are bringing forth this discharge petition had the opportunity to allow Members on both sides of the aisle to offer amendments. People who were not on the Financial Services Committee could have had the opportunity to offer amendments, but not under this particular discharge petition. So, Mr. Speaker, the real complaint I have here is, regardless of what complaints or beefs they may have against me personally or against the process of the Financial Services Committee, why punish the entirety of the House? We hear so much about regular order and about empowering rank-and- file Members. Well, then, why aren't rank-and-file Members, then, empowered to offer amendments? We were told that it was simply to discharge a single piece of legislation. Then why not, at this point, let the House work its will? Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, that doesn't appear to happen. I perfectly understand that one man's economic development is another man's corporate welfare, and I think that debate will happen tomorrow. But here, right now, simply because there is a rule to have a discharge petition that would disqualify any Member from offering an amendment doesn't mean we should necessarily avail ourselves of it. The Constitution allows us to create debt. It doesn't mean it is a good thing for us to do that as we face yet another debt ceiling vote in front of us. So, Mr. Speaker, I would simply hope that Members would vote down this discharge petition, and if they believe strongly in it, then bring back another one, but at least allow Members on the floor to offer amendments. Republicans, Democrats, and people from all committees should be able to offer the amendments if that was the purpose of the discharge petition. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer). Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I will say to my friend from Texas, there were 3 years to do exactly that. It wasn't done. I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for yielding, and I thank him for his courage and Mr. Lucas' courage for working within the rules to bring this matter to the floor. It is an important matter. {time} 1845 Since July, businesses and workers across the country have been asking Congress to reopen the Export-Import Bank so that they could compete on a level playing field in overseas markets. This is about jobs and a competitive America. Opening the Export-Import Bank, Mr. Speaker, is about creating and keeping jobs here in America. A motion on the floor tonight will demonstrate that a majority of this House supports taking action to pass a multiyear extension of the Bank's charter authority. We will have a [[Page H7180]] chance to show the American people that Congress can work together, Democrats and Republicans, to get something done that helps businesses and workers compete and create jobs. Mr. HECK of Washington. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. HOYER. I yield to the gentleman from Washington. Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ask my friends and colleagues to support Mr. Fincher of Tennessee on his motion in his effort to subject this issue to regular order. This is regular order. This is the only regular order that we are going to be given to have a chance to take up this job-creating legislation. I know this for a fact. It is not speculation. On February 12, they offered an amendment to the views and estimates on the budget that said, in part, the committee will work to consider reauthorization of the Bank through regular order that lets all sides be heard, and the leadership of the committee said, ``Vote `no.' '' There was never an intention to subject this issue to regular order. Now is our chance to do that. Support the gentlemen from Tennessee and Oklahoma and vote ``yes'' on this. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank Mr. Fincher, I thank Mr. Lucas, I thank Ms. Waters, I thank Ms. Moore, and I thank Denny Heck. Vote for this motion to put a bill on the floor that the majority supports. That is democracy. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), chairman of the Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that, and I appreciate the leadership of my chair on this issue. It seems to me, Mr. Speaker, we have two issues that we are dealing with today: First is the issue, itself, of the Export-Import Bank and the entitlement mentality that has grown up here in the United States. It is sad to me that some believe that this is the only, or the best, way for the U.S. to compete on the world stage when, in fact, we know it is not. We are at a competitive disadvantage, not because we may or may not have an Export-Import Bank, but because of our regulatory environment, because of our tax environment, and because of all of the other barriers that have been thrown up by this Congress, including health care and a number of other things that have made our companies less competitive. The other issue is the way that we are dealing with this issue as it is coming to the floor and how it has reached the House floor today. Mr. Speaker, I would like to know which committee chair of another committee would approve of having the process be short-circuited out of their committee. Would it be the Energy and Commerce Committee? the Ways and Means Committee? Because I can tell you I have not been real happy, as a small business owner on some of the lack of progress that we have made on that. Maybe it would be the Ag Committee. Why did it take so long for things to reach the floor? How about any other committee that we are all dealing with? The simple fact is that my subcommittee, Monetary Policy and Trade, where this jurisdiction lies, had three joint hearings with the Oversight Committee on this particular issue. There was a sunset that was put in. It was intentionally put in so that there would be a review. The review happened, and the determination of my subcommittee and this committee was that it did not warrant further action. So, again, as we are looking at this tool that has been infrequently used, it doesn't restore regular order, as has been claimed. No. In fact, it upends the balance of power in the House. It skirts the committee process and gives the minority the control over the House floor. A discharge petition was brought to the House floor under the guise of job creation. In reality, it serves to revive and retrench a dependency mentality. Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kinzinger), who has done great work on this supportive piece of legislation. Mr. KINZINGER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for his hard work. I would remind the previous speaker that this is actually a Republican-led discharge petition for Ex-Im Bank. We could have avoided this. None of us celebrate being here right now as Republicans. But the time to deal with the issue of Ex-Im Bank was on the committee. Unfortunately, this could have gone through the committee, this could have been voted on in committee, and it could have come to the floor in what people would consider a more regular order way than this. However, that didn't have the opportunity. Mr. Speaker, my district is the 16th District of Illinois, and I will tell you what, they are not worried about discharge petitions and things when people talk about regular order and internal politics and what is going on here. What they care about is the fact that it is a heavy manufacturing district, and they want to be able to go to work tomorrow. They are worried because people live with the threat of pink slips, and many people actually get pink slips. Unfortunately, in July, the charter for Ex-Im Bank expired, which put a lot of the manufacturing suppliers of the aerospace industry at a disadvantage in my district compared with those that supply to Airbus and other companies around the world. Pride in our exports and pride in our manufacturing is something that we should have pride in, and we should fight beyond what it means for a party label or beyond what it means for floor politics. Mr. Speaker, the opponents of reauthorization live in a world where the politics of purity trumps the realism of today and of the economics. Here is the reality: in my district, thousands of jobs, millions of dollars of exports, and many, many people rely on this to be reauthorized. Mr. Speaker, I know this is not easy, as Republicans, to do this, but it is the right thing to do. So I stand and I ask my colleagues on the Republican and the Democrat side of the aisle to put partisanship aside, to do the right thing, and to discharge this resolution. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), a valued member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman. I hope you are all listening to some of the use of the language. I appreciated the history lesson. But has it been lost on you, the irony part of this discussion that, hey, we are going to do a discharge petition, which is part of the rules, because we don't feel we are having a voice. Oh, by the way, we are going to draft a rule--draft a rule--that you can't offer amendments, that you can't have a discussion. For those of us who have worked on this issue for years, who have sat through dozens of hearings in multiple years, who actually have things we believe that make it better, the brilliance here is lock it down. So you are going to complain that you are not being treated fairly, and then the answer to not being treated fairly is, let's write a rule that no one gets a voice, that it is purely up or down. Is that lost on anyone here? The reality of it is the vast majority of the trade from this country has access to surety bonds and trade credit. It is a fraction of a fraction of a fraction that actually asks for a taxpayer subsidy, a taxpayer guarantee. If you wanted to solve this problem tomorrow, you could recharter the Ex-Im Bank so that it continues to exist but get the taxpayers off the hook and let them do just as now Fannie and Freddie are trying to do where they buy their reinsurance in the market. There are solutions here, if I was allowed to offer an amendment. But you have all chosen to write a rule that keeps those of us who have worked on this issue for years from being able to have that discussion. Is that irony lost on anyone here? You know there is a better way to do this than extending this type of crony capitalism and leaving our taxpayers on the hook for hours and hours of hearings we have had where you have heard the bad acts that are going on in this agency--the fraud, the mis-accounting. Why are we going to let that move forward? Because if you have read the [[Page H7181]] reforms that are in here, you would understand they already should be doing these. It is an outrage they are not. Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters). Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, Members, I would like to thank the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fincher) for yielding and for his leadership in initiating this very successful discharge petition in order to finally make possible the opportunity to vote to renew the charter of the Export-Import Bank. For almost 2 years now, as ranking member of the Financial Services Committee, I have been working very hard with Leader Pelosi, Whip Hoyer, and my colleagues Gwen Moore and Denny Heck. We have all been working hard to secure long-term reauthorization of the Bank. And today, after many months of obstruction by a vocal minority of this body, which led to a shutdown of the Ex-Im Bank, this House will finally get the opportunity to vote to do just that. Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker, this discharge petition is not a rejection of regular order. Although rarely used, the discharge petition exists under House rules for the very purpose of ensuring that the will of a determined majority may ultimately prevail over an obstructionist minority, and that is exactly what is happening today. Republicans and Democrats have come together to support the reauthorization of a proven job creator. We have come together to end the unilateral disarmament that has harmed our exporters, their domestic suppliers, and the many American workers across this country whose jobs are supported by the Bank. We have come together to show that compromise is possible if you are willing to work it. So, again, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for his work. I urge the Members to vote in favor of the motion. We have come together as Members of Congress to do the work of the people. Let's get on with the business of doing it. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney), another valuable member of the House Financial Services Committee. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas. I want to pick up on where my friend from Arizona left off regarding the comments about my good friend and colleague from Washington regarding regular order. It is not regular order. If we have regular order, we have amendments. I have an amendment that would protect small business. I don't get a chance to do that. We would under regular order. But let's not forget, there is not just one committee that is getting rolled here. Rules Committee is getting rolled. And if this was to follow regular order and go to rules, every single one of you would be able to offer amendments in that committee. They would probably get shot down, as mine have since I have been here, but at least you could offer them. Furthermore, if it went to Rules Committee, you could have debate; you could participate and debate on the issues. What is getting ready to happen here in a few minutes is Mr. Fincher will control 1 hour of debate, he will speak for 5, and then yield back, denying every single one of you in this Chamber the opportunity to speak for at least half an hour each side on this particular issue. This is not regular order, Mr. Speaker. This is shoving something down the American people's throats. Let's have regular order. Let's have the amendments. I have got some ones you might actually enjoy. Let's have the debate. But let's not kid ourselves into thinking this is regular order because it is not. Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I have one remaining speaker. How much time do I have remaining? I want to reserve the right to close. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Tennessee has 2 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 2 minutes remaining. Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. A lot of discussion, passionate discussion about jobs tonight. But I would point out to my Democratic colleagues on the other side of the aisle, where was this passion when ObamaCare was passed? The Congressional Budget Office says that it is going to cost this economy 2.5 million fewer jobs. Where was this passion when H.R. 30 came to the floor that would repeal this 30-hour definition of full-time employee? According to one study, 2.6 million Americans making under $30,000 are at risk of having their hours cut due to the ObamaCare 30-hour rule. Where was the passion on the other side of the aisle when H.R. 351, the LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act, came? That is estimated to put up to 45,000 unemployed Americans back to work on liquid natural gas export projects. Where was the passion when S. 1 came, the Keystone XL pipeline? The State Department's environmental impact statement said: ``During construction, proposed project spending would support approximately 42,100 jobs.'' But we didn't hear much from our friends on the other side of the aisle when this was going on. {time} 1900 But, again, I think, too often, my friends on the other side of the aisle are always happy to subsidize what they can regulate and control. I would say to my friends on my side of the aisle that I respect your opinion, and I hope you respect mine; but I think there is a better way to promote exports. I think there is a better way to promote jobs. It has everything to do with regulatory reform. It has to do with the REINS Act. It has everything to do with fundamental tax reform, which, according to the National Association of Manufacturers, is half of our competitive disadvantage. It has everything to do with litigation reform. We have greater remedial costs than do our green energy European competitors. There is a better way, and there is a more fair way to come to this floor. As for whatever you think of the process of the Financial Services Committee, if this is going to come to the floor, every Member ought to be allowed to have an amendment, and we should reject this discharge petition. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield my remaining 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas). Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker and colleagues, why are we here tonight? Why are we compelled to engage in this process? The circumstances, perhaps, might be a little bit like 1910. Do you remember 1910? A dictatorial Speaker who was so totally in control and who so totally refused to accept input from the membership made himself chairman of the Rules Committee, too. He stymied the legislative process. He brought it to a stop. What did our predecessors do 100-plus years ago? They finally rose up together and threw him out, and they created a process by which no dictatorial chairman, no dictatorial Speaker would ever be able to fully thwart the will of this body. It is amazing. That is what we are here for. It is to continue one century later the responsible actions that they put into place. Now, some of my friends have asked, ``Why don't we have thousands of amendments?'' Think about 1910--a dictatorial Speaker, a dictatorial committee chairman. Under no circumstances was Uncle Joe going to allow any input. So, when they created this process, they had to make sure that the bill could come to the floor for consideration in a way that would not allow it to be manipulated by that same dictatorial attitude. We are operating under the present version of that rule. If we had wanted unlimited amendments, we should have spent an unlimited amount of time in the committee of jurisdiction, working on those amendments, but that opportunity never availed itself. Had that opportunity availed itself, we wouldn't be here; but we are here. We have a bill that reflects, I believe--and that a majority of us in this House believes--what is in the best interest of America's workers and America's [[Page H7182]] businesspeople in our competitive spirit. I simply say to you that to talk about the things we should be doing tonight that should have been done a month ago or a year ago seems most inappropriate. So, my friends, in a moment, let's honor the people who were on this floor in 1910. Let's say, ``Joe, you can't have your way then or now.'' Let's pass the discharge; let's pass the rule; and let's get on with the bill debate. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time has expired. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fincher) to discharge the Committee on Rules from the further consideration of House Resolution 450. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 246, nays 177, not voting 11, as follows: [Roll No. 569] YEAS--246 Adams Aderholt Aguilar Amodei Ashford Barletta Bass Beatty Becerra Bera Beyer Bishop (GA) Blumenauer Bonamici Bost Boustany Boyle, Brendan F.

The Clerk will report the resolution. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: H. Res. 450 Resolved, That immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 597) to reauthorize the Export- Import Bank of the United States, and for other purposes. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. An amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of H.R. 3611, as introduced, shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial Services or their respective designees; and (2) one motion to recommit with or without instructions. Sec. 2. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 597. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Tennessee is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of conversation here tonight about what we are doing and how this happened and what we are going to do next. Mr. Speaker, the reason why we are here tonight, I didn't sign up to come to Washington from Frog Jump, the place I live, to do discharge petitions. The reason I did come to Washington was to work for my district and try to make sure that hardworking men and women all over this country and my district have jobs. Mr. Speaker, that is what the Export-Import Bank does. It helps create thousands of jobs, specifically, 200,000 jobs each year. Now, let me be clear because there has been a lot of misconception or misperception, whatever you want to say, about what this costs the taxpayer. Mr. Speaker, this is at no cost to the U.S. taxpayer. In fact, the Export-Import Bank returned $675 million to the U.S. Treasury in fiscal year 2014. In 2013, it returned more than $1 billion, Mr. Speaker. This is not a minority procedure, this is not a Democrat procedure that is happening tonight. This is a Republican-led position. This is a Republican reform bill that we are doing. [[Page H7183]] {time} 1930 More reforms than have been done in probably 50 years. I haven't looked specifically, but I think President Reagan did a lot, and other Presidents have done them. But this is about jobs, Mr. Speaker. Think about this. We go home to our districts every weekend, and we talk to constituents every weekend. Think about constituents that come up to us and say: Congressman, have you balanced the budget? We say: No, we are working on it, but we haven't done it yet. I don't want to offend any of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I am probably going to, but I don't mean it. Our constituents say: Well, Congressman, have you repealed ObamaCare? I say: Well, no, not yet, but we are working on it. Then they look at us and they say: Tell me, Congressman, you have done away with the only thing that we know of that helps create thousands of jobs all over this country and possibly would help create the job that they had because of some ideology or some conservative group that is scoring a Member of Congress, and now I don't have a job, and I am on unemployment. Mr. Speaker, our constituents and hardworking Americans deserve better. They deserve better than Members of Congress playing political games because of scorecards. I serve under one of the most principled chairmen, probably the most principled chairman in Congress, and I agree with him on 99.9 percent of everything that we do in our committee. We just happen to disagree on this one issue. My chairman is passionate and principled, and I never would doubt that. Mr. Speaker, I won't take much more time. If America is going to get out of the hole we are in as a country, then Congress must start working together. Mr. Speaker, we should applaud. We should be happy on the day--and I don't want to offend the gentlewoman from California who spoke earlier, but we should be happy on the day when Democrats want to join Republicans on legislation that helps move the country forward. They are clapping, that is awesome. We are trying to do what we think is best, and the Export-Import Bank doesn't cost the taxpayers a dime. It helps create thousands of jobs all over this country and makes sure we don't lose thousands of jobs to 60 other countries that have these credit agencies. Mr. Speaker, I don't know what else to say. This is regular order, this closed rule. I am going to close in 10 seconds, but this is all about regular order. We could have had amendments. We could have had a thousand amendments in our committee, but we chose to go this route. We didn't choose it. Some of us chose to go this route. We are dealing with this today. Our constituents deserve better, and we have to do better. With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying bill. I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. parliamentary inquiries Mr. HENSARLING. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, the resolution before the House is H. Res. 450 which, as I understand it, would establish the rule for debate on this Ex-Im reauthorization bill, that it does not make in order any amendments. The closed rule means that in addition to not having any debate on the rule--since all time has now been yielded back, with no other Member having a chance to speak--Members have been denied their chance to participate in that part of the process. My parliamentary inquiry is whether there is any way, at this juncture, for Members to amend the resolution, H. Res. 450, to give Members an opportunity to offer amendments to the underlying Ex-Im reauthorization bill? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair was about to put the question on ordering the previous question. If the motion for the previous question was rejected, there would be a potential for further debate on, or amendment to, House Resolution 450. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, further parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. HENSARLING. So, if the previous question is defeated, then a Member who is opposed to the previous question would be afforded the opportunity to offer an amendment to H. Res. 450 that would strike the text of the closed, no amendments rule and replace it with the text of a rule that provided for consideration of the underlying Ex-Im reauthorization bill through an open process, with time for debate, where any Member--either Republican or Democrat--could offer germane amendments to the bill. Is that correct, Mr. Speaker? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair cannot respond to specific hypotheticals, but if the motion for the previous question were rejected, there would be potential for further debate on, or amendment to, House Resolution 450. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, further parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. HENSARLING. If the previous question is defeated, may I or any Member who votes against the previous question claim time to offer such an amendment to create an open rules process for consideration of the underlying Ex-Im reauthorization bill where Members on both sides of the aisle can offer amendments to the bill? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair cannot judge that at this time. Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the Speaker. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. MULVANEY. A few minutes ago, in reference to a question raised by the gentleman from Texas, you indicated that the amendments would be in order if the motion for the previous question failed. My question is: Are motions to amend in order before the motion for the previous question comes to the floor? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The previous question has preferential standing. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk. I would like to have it heard now. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The previous question has already been moved. Mr. MULVANEY. No, it hasn't. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair is about to put the question on ordering the previous question on the resolution. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry. Who moved the previous question? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Tennessee. Mr. MULVANEY. Was that seconded? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The previous question does not require a second. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk. I would simply like to ask what rule the Chair is relying on in denying me the ability to bring that amendment now. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Clause 4 of rule XVI. The question is on ordering the previous question on the resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015)] [House] [Pages H7178-H7183] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 597, REFORM EXPORTS AND EXPAND THE AMERICAN ECONOMY ACT Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2 of rule XV, I call up motion No. 2, to discharge the Committee on Rules from the further consideration of House Resolution 450, providing for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 597) to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the United States, and for other purposes. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Did the gentleman sign the petition? Mr. FINCHER. Yes. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Tennessee calls up a motion to discharge the Committee on Rules from further consideration of House Resolution 450, which the Clerk will report by title. Point of Order Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, point of order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his point of order. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to rule XV, section 2(d)(1), I make a point of order that this motion is not timely brought. The rule specifically says that, ``On the second and fourth Mondays of a month,'' which is what we are today, ``immediately after the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag, a motion to discharge that has been brought on the calendar for at least seven legislative days shall be privileged if called up by a Member whose signature appears thereon.'' We had the pledge and the prayer earlier today. We also then had intervening activity in the House, and this motion is no longer timely. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point of order? Mr. MULVANEY. I would point out, Mr. Speaker, that we took up 1- minute speeches; we received a message from the Senate; and you, yourself, approved the Journal. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point of order? Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I think my friend from South Carolina, the gentleman, is out of order. This is regular order. We are moving on as procedure. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, while you are continuing, I would like you to consider one thing. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman may proceed. Mr. MULVANEY. The rule is very explicit. The rule does not say that we may not take--the rule says that we must proceed immediately. I recognize the fact that on occasion 1-minute speeches are not considered business of the House, that receiving messages from the Senate are not considered business of the House, and, on occasion, a Journal is not considered business of the House even though, from time to time, we do vote on it. The rule does not say that we cannot do other business. The rule says we can't do anything, that we must proceed immediately after the Pledge of Allegiance, and that if the motion is brought at any other time it is untimely. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does any other Member wish to be heard on this point of order? If not, the Chair will rule. The rule does not say that the motion to discharge must be--it just says that it can be--brought up immediately. Today's proceedings are consistent with previous occasions where the Chair has entertained 1-minute speeches on discharge days, and those speeches proceeded by unanimous consent. On those grounds, the point of order is overruled. Parliamentary Inquiries Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. MULVANEY. Does the language of section 2(d)(1) not specifically say ``shall be privileged if called up''? It is not ``may.'' It is ``shall . . . if. . . . '' The SPEAKER pro tempore. The rule is not so limited. The motion would be in order if it were to be brought up then, and it is also in order to be brought up now. Mr. MULVANEY. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. [[Page H7179]] Mr. MULVANEY. If 2(d)(1) says that it shall be in order if brought up at this particular time but the Chair is ruling that it may be in order at other times, what rule is the Chair relying on for that determination? The SPEAKER pro tempore. There is nothing in the rule that requires the motion to discharge to be brought up immediately following the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. MULVANEY. Further point, Mr. Speaker. The only way that it is privileged is that if it was brought up immediately after the pledge. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair is also following prior practice of the House in entertaining the motion. Mr. MULVANEY. I'm sorry, and Mr. Speaker, when you were giving your decision before, I was reading the rule. Would you please restate the basis for your decision. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has entertained 1-minute speeches on previous discharge days. Those speeches proceeded by unanimous consent. On those grounds, the point of order was overruled. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, you did not address, then, my issue on receiving a message from the Senate or approving the Journal. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has entertained numerous parliamentary inquiries on a matter on which the Chair has already ruled. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. MULVANEY. Would the decision have been different if we had not made 1-minute speeches? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair cannot respond to a hypothetical question. The Clerk will report the title of the resolution. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fincher) will be recognized for 10 minutes and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) will be recognized for 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Even though discharge petitions have rarely been invoked in modern history, they nevertheless embody democracy and its fundamental principle of majority rules, a principle that the gentleman has already talked about earlier. This discharge process offers the only means by which a majority of House Members can secure a vote on a measure that is opposed by the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction and House leadership. What makes the gentleman's remarks a few minutes ago particularly ironic is the fact that the discharge rule evolved from a precursor rule adopted in 1910 as part of the Cannon revolt. The Cannon revolt was a revolt against Speaker Joseph Cannon. It was a remarkable event in the history of this House and is relevant today in more ways than one. Speaker Cannon was, at the time, the longest-serving Republican Speaker in the history of the House, serving as Speaker from 1903 to 1911. Referred to as ``Uncle Joe,'' Speaker Cannon ruled with an iron fist. Historians have not painted him as a great legislator. No. Historians have painted him as a great obstructionist. He blocked legislation, including child labor laws and the right for women to vote. What was his reasoning for blocking this progressive legislation? ``I am tired of listening to all this babble for reform,'' he said. Several times, Republicans tried unsuccessfully to curb Speaker Cannon's broad powers, which included his chairmanship of the Rules Committee and his power to dole out committee assignments, among other powers. But that changed in March of 1910 when 42 Republicans joined with the Democrats introducing a resolution containing a rules package that would strip Speaker Cannon of his many powers. Speaker Cannon tried to filibuster this revolt, speaking from the chair for 26 straight hours while allies tried to round up additional allies who were out celebrating St. Patrick's Day, but it didn't work. Speaker Cannon finally ruled the resolution out of order, but the House overruled the Chair, thereby adopting far-reaching reforms, including the precursor of today's discharge rule. I ask my colleagues to join me in returning power to rank-and-file Members by voting on the motion to discharge and supporting American jobs. With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. First, Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize the gentleman from Tennessee and the passion that he brings to this debate. He has long been a champion of the Export-Import Bank. We have had a respectful disagreement over the substance of the issue, but at this moment I don't care to spend much time on the substance of the issue because we are debating a discharge petition. Mr. Speaker, it was an interesting history lesson that my colleague and friend introduced the House to, and I have no reason to doubt that it is an accurate history lesson. I will note for the Record that apparently somehow Mr. Cannon managed to get a building named after him. But the point I would make is this: whether the gentleman from Tennessee and others have disagreed with process at the Financial Services Committee--I know that they do--but the question before us, Mr. Speaker, is why punish the entirety of the House? Those who are bringing forth this discharge petition had the opportunity to allow Members on both sides of the aisle to offer amendments. People who were not on the Financial Services Committee could have had the opportunity to offer amendments, but not under this particular discharge petition. So, Mr. Speaker, the real complaint I have here is, regardless of what complaints or beefs they may have against me personally or against the process of the Financial Services Committee, why punish the entirety of the House? We hear so much about regular order and about empowering rank-and- file Members. Well, then, why aren't rank-and-file Members, then, empowered to offer amendments? We were told that it was simply to discharge a single piece of legislation. Then why not, at this point, let the House work its will? Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, that doesn't appear to happen. I perfectly understand that one man's economic development is another man's corporate welfare, and I think that debate will happen tomorrow. But here, right now, simply because there is a rule to have a discharge petition that would disqualify any Member from offering an amendment doesn't mean we should necessarily avail ourselves of it. The Constitution allows us to create debt. It doesn't mean it is a good thing for us to do that as we face yet another debt ceiling vote in front of us. So, Mr. Speaker, I would simply hope that Members would vote down this discharge petition, and if they believe strongly in it, then bring back another one, but at least allow Members on the floor to offer amendments. Republicans, Democrats, and people from all committees should be able to offer the amendments if that was the purpose of the discharge petition. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer). Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I will say to my friend from Texas, there were 3 years to do exactly that. It wasn't done. I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for yielding, and I thank him for his courage and Mr. Lucas' courage for working within the rules to bring this matter to the floor. It is an important matter. {time} 1845 Since July, businesses and workers across the country have been asking Congress to reopen the Export-Import Bank so that they could compete on a level playing field in overseas markets. This is about jobs and a competitive America. Opening the Export-Import Bank, Mr. Speaker, is about creating and keeping jobs here in America. A motion on the floor tonight will demonstrate that a majority of this House supports taking action to pass a multiyear extension of the Bank's charter authority. We will have a [[Page H7180]] chance to show the American people that Congress can work together, Democrats and Republicans, to get something done that helps businesses and workers compete and create jobs. Mr. HECK of Washington. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. HOYER. I yield to the gentleman from Washington. Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ask my friends and colleagues to support Mr. Fincher of Tennessee on his motion in his effort to subject this issue to regular order. This is regular order. This is the only regular order that we are going to be given to have a chance to take up this job-creating legislation. I know this for a fact. It is not speculation. On February 12, they offered an amendment to the views and estimates on the budget that said, in part, the committee will work to consider reauthorization of the Bank through regular order that lets all sides be heard, and the leadership of the committee said, ``Vote `no.' '' There was never an intention to subject this issue to regular order. Now is our chance to do that. Support the gentlemen from Tennessee and Oklahoma and vote ``yes'' on this. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank Mr. Fincher, I thank Mr. Lucas, I thank Ms. Waters, I thank Ms. Moore, and I thank Denny Heck. Vote for this motion to put a bill on the floor that the majority supports. That is democracy. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), chairman of the Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that, and I appreciate the leadership of my chair on this issue. It seems to me, Mr. Speaker, we have two issues that we are dealing with today: First is the issue, itself, of the Export-Import Bank and the entitlement mentality that has grown up here in the United States. It is sad to me that some believe that this is the only, or the best, way for the U.S. to compete on the world stage when, in fact, we know it is not. We are at a competitive disadvantage, not because we may or may not have an Export-Import Bank, but because of our regulatory environment, because of our tax environment, and because of all of the other barriers that have been thrown up by this Congress, including health care and a number of other things that have made our companies less competitive. The other issue is the way that we are dealing with this issue as it is coming to the floor and how it has reached the House floor today. Mr. Speaker, I would like to know which committee chair of another committee would approve of having the process be short-circuited out of their committee. Would it be the Energy and Commerce Committee? the Ways and Means Committee? Because I can tell you I have not been real happy, as a small business owner on some of the lack of progress that we have made on that. Maybe it would be the Ag Committee. Why did it take so long for things to reach the floor? How about any other committee that we are all dealing with? The simple fact is that my subcommittee, Monetary Policy and Trade, where this jurisdiction lies, had three joint hearings with the Oversight Committee on this particular issue. There was a sunset that was put in. It was intentionally put in so that there would be a review. The review happened, and the determination of my subcommittee and this committee was that it did not warrant further action. So, again, as we are looking at this tool that has been infrequently used, it doesn't restore regular order, as has been claimed. No. In fact, it upends the balance of power in the House. It skirts the committee process and gives the minority the control over the House floor. A discharge petition was brought to the House floor under the guise of job creation. In reality, it serves to revive and retrench a dependency mentality. Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kinzinger), who has done great work on this supportive piece of legislation. Mr. KINZINGER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for his hard work. I would remind the previous speaker that this is actually a Republican-led discharge petition for Ex-Im Bank. We could have avoided this. None of us celebrate being here right now as Republicans. But the time to deal with the issue of Ex-Im Bank was on the committee. Unfortunately, this could have gone through the committee, this could have been voted on in committee, and it could have come to the floor in what people would consider a more regular order way than this. However, that didn't have the opportunity. Mr. Speaker, my district is the 16th District of Illinois, and I will tell you what, they are not worried about discharge petitions and things when people talk about regular order and internal politics and what is going on here. What they care about is the fact that it is a heavy manufacturing district, and they want to be able to go to work tomorrow. They are worried because people live with the threat of pink slips, and many people actually get pink slips. Unfortunately, in July, the charter for Ex-Im Bank expired, which put a lot of the manufacturing suppliers of the aerospace industry at a disadvantage in my district compared with those that supply to Airbus and other companies around the world. Pride in our exports and pride in our manufacturing is something that we should have pride in, and we should fight beyond what it means for a party label or beyond what it means for floor politics. Mr. Speaker, the opponents of reauthorization live in a world where the politics of purity trumps the realism of today and of the economics. Here is the reality: in my district, thousands of jobs, millions of dollars of exports, and many, many people rely on this to be reauthorized. Mr. Speaker, I know this is not easy, as Republicans, to do this, but it is the right thing to do. So I stand and I ask my colleagues on the Republican and the Democrat side of the aisle to put partisanship aside, to do the right thing, and to discharge this resolution. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), a valued member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman. I hope you are all listening to some of the use of the language. I appreciated the history lesson. But has it been lost on you, the irony part of this discussion that, hey, we are going to do a discharge petition, which is part of the rules, because we don't feel we are having a voice. Oh, by the way, we are going to draft a rule--draft a rule--that you can't offer amendments, that you can't have a discussion. For those of us who have worked on this issue for years, who have sat through dozens of hearings in multiple years, who actually have things we believe that make it better, the brilliance here is lock it down. So you are going to complain that you are not being treated fairly, and then the answer to not being treated fairly is, let's write a rule that no one gets a voice, that it is purely up or down. Is that lost on anyone here? The reality of it is the vast majority of the trade from this country has access to surety bonds and trade credit. It is a fraction of a fraction of a fraction that actually asks for a taxpayer subsidy, a taxpayer guarantee. If you wanted to solve this problem tomorrow, you could recharter the Ex-Im Bank so that it continues to exist but get the taxpayers off the hook and let them do just as now Fannie and Freddie are trying to do where they buy their reinsurance in the market. There are solutions here, if I was allowed to offer an amendment. But you have all chosen to write a rule that keeps those of us who have worked on this issue for years from being able to have that discussion. Is that irony lost on anyone here? You know there is a better way to do this than extending this type of crony capitalism and leaving our taxpayers on the hook for hours and hours of hearings we have had where you have heard the bad acts that are going on in this agency--the fraud, the mis-accounting. Why are we going to let that move forward? Because if you have read the [[Page H7181]] reforms that are in here, you would understand they already should be doing these. It is an outrage they are not. Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters). Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, Members, I would like to thank the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fincher) for yielding and for his leadership in initiating this very successful discharge petition in order to finally make possible the opportunity to vote to renew the charter of the Export-Import Bank. For almost 2 years now, as ranking member of the Financial Services Committee, I have been working very hard with Leader Pelosi, Whip Hoyer, and my colleagues Gwen Moore and Denny Heck. We have all been working hard to secure long-term reauthorization of the Bank. And today, after many months of obstruction by a vocal minority of this body, which led to a shutdown of the Ex-Im Bank, this House will finally get the opportunity to vote to do just that. Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker, this discharge petition is not a rejection of regular order. Although rarely used, the discharge petition exists under House rules for the very purpose of ensuring that the will of a determined majority may ultimately prevail over an obstructionist minority, and that is exactly what is happening today. Republicans and Democrats have come together to support the reauthorization of a proven job creator. We have come together to end the unilateral disarmament that has harmed our exporters, their domestic suppliers, and the many American workers across this country whose jobs are supported by the Bank. We have come together to show that compromise is possible if you are willing to work it. So, again, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for his work. I urge the Members to vote in favor of the motion. We have come together as Members of Congress to do the work of the people. Let's get on with the business of doing it. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney), another valuable member of the House Financial Services Committee. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas. I want to pick up on where my friend from Arizona left off regarding the comments about my good friend and colleague from Washington regarding regular order. It is not regular order. If we have regular order, we have amendments. I have an amendment that would protect small business. I don't get a chance to do that. We would under regular order. But let's not forget, there is not just one committee that is getting rolled here. Rules Committee is getting rolled. And if this was to follow regular order and go to rules, every single one of you would be able to offer amendments in that committee. They would probably get shot down, as mine have since I have been here, but at least you could offer them. Furthermore, if it went to Rules Committee, you could have debate; you could participate and debate on the issues. What is getting ready to happen here in a few minutes is Mr. Fincher will control 1 hour of debate, he will speak for 5, and then yield back, denying every single one of you in this Chamber the opportunity to speak for at least half an hour each side on this particular issue. This is not regular order, Mr. Speaker. This is shoving something down the American people's throats. Let's have regular order. Let's have the amendments. I have got some ones you might actually enjoy. Let's have the debate. But let's not kid ourselves into thinking this is regular order because it is not. Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I have one remaining speaker. How much time do I have remaining? I want to reserve the right to close. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Tennessee has 2 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 2 minutes remaining. Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. A lot of discussion, passionate discussion about jobs tonight. But I would point out to my Democratic colleagues on the other side of the aisle, where was this passion when ObamaCare was passed? The Congressional Budget Office says that it is going to cost this economy 2.5 million fewer jobs. Where was this passion when H.R. 30 came to the floor that would repeal this 30-hour definition of full-time employee? According to one study, 2.6 million Americans making under $30,000 are at risk of having their hours cut due to the ObamaCare 30-hour rule. Where was the passion on the other side of the aisle when H.R. 351, the LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act, came? That is estimated to put up to 45,000 unemployed Americans back to work on liquid natural gas export projects. Where was the passion when S. 1 came, the Keystone XL pipeline? The State Department's environmental impact statement said: ``During construction, proposed project spending would support approximately 42,100 jobs.'' But we didn't hear much from our friends on the other side of the aisle when this was going on. {time} 1900 But, again, I think, too often, my friends on the other side of the aisle are always happy to subsidize what they can regulate and control. I would say to my friends on my side of the aisle that I respect your opinion, and I hope you respect mine; but I think there is a better way to promote exports. I think there is a better way to promote jobs. It has everything to do with regulatory reform. It has to do with the REINS Act. It has everything to do with fundamental tax reform, which, according to the National Association of Manufacturers, is half of our competitive disadvantage. It has everything to do with litigation reform. We have greater remedial costs than do our green energy European competitors. There is a better way, and there is a more fair way to come to this floor. As for whatever you think of the process of the Financial Services Committee, if this is going to come to the floor, every Member ought to be allowed to have an amendment, and we should reject this discharge petition. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield my remaining 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas). Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker and colleagues, why are we here tonight? Why are we compelled to engage in this process? The circumstances, perhaps, might be a little bit like 1910. Do you remember 1910? A dictatorial Speaker who was so totally in control and who so totally refused to accept input from the membership made himself chairman of the Rules Committee, too. He stymied the legislative process. He brought it to a stop. What did our predecessors do 100-plus years ago? They finally rose up together and threw him out, and they created a process by which no dictatorial chairman, no dictatorial Speaker would ever be able to fully thwart the will of this body. It is amazing. That is what we are here for. It is to continue one century later the responsible actions that they put into place. Now, some of my friends have asked, ``Why don't we have thousands of amendments?'' Think about 1910--a dictatorial Speaker, a dictatorial committee chairman. Under no circumstances was Uncle Joe going to allow any input. So, when they created this process, they had to make sure that the bill could come to the floor for consideration in a way that would not allow it to be manipulated by that same dictatorial attitude. We are operating under the present version of that rule. If we had wanted unlimited amendments, we should have spent an unlimited amount of time in the committee of jurisdiction, working on those amendments, but that opportunity never availed itself. Had that opportunity availed itself, we wouldn't be here; but we are here. We have a bill that reflects, I believe--and that a majority of us in this House believes--what is in the best interest of America's workers and America's [[Page H7182]] businesspeople in our competitive spirit. I simply say to you that to talk about the things we should be doing tonight that should have been done a month ago or a year ago seems most inappropriate. So, my friends, in a moment, let's honor the people who were on this floor in 1910. Let's say, ``Joe, you can't have your way then or now.'' Let's pass the discharge; let's pass the rule; and let's get on with the bill debate. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time has expired. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fincher) to discharge the Committee on Rules from the further consideration of House Resolution 450. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 246, nays 177, not voting 11, as follows: [Roll No. 569] YEAS--246 Adams Aderholt Aguilar Amodei Ashford Barletta Bass Beatty Becerra Bera Beyer Bishop (GA) Blumenauer Bonamici Bost Boustany Boyle, Brendan F.

The Clerk will report the resolution. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: H. Res. 450 Resolved, That immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 597) to reauthorize the Export- Import Bank of the United States, and for other purposes. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. An amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of H.R. 3611, as introduced, shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial Services or their respective designees; and (2) one motion to recommit with or without instructions. Sec. 2. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 597. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Tennessee is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of conversation here tonight about what we are doing and how this happened and what we are going to do next. Mr. Speaker, the reason why we are here tonight, I didn't sign up to come to Washington from Frog Jump, the place I live, to do discharge petitions. The reason I did come to Washington was to work for my district and try to make sure that hardworking men and women all over this country and my district have jobs. Mr. Speaker, that is what the Export-Import Bank does. It helps create thousands of jobs, specifically, 200,000 jobs each year. Now, let me be clear because there has been a lot of misconception or misperception, whatever you want to say, about what this costs the taxpayer. Mr. Speaker, this is at no cost to the U.S. taxpayer. In fact, the Export-Import Bank returned $675 million to the U.S. Treasury in fiscal year 2014. In 2013, it returned more than $1 billion, Mr. Speaker. This is not a minority procedure, this is not a Democrat procedure that is happening tonight. This is a Republican-led position. This is a Republican reform bill that we are doing. [[Page H7183]] {time} 1930 More reforms than have been done in probably 50 years. I haven't looked specifically, but I think President Reagan did a lot, and other Presidents have done them. But this is about jobs, Mr. Speaker. Think about this. We go home to our districts every weekend, and we talk to constituents every weekend. Think about constituents that come up to us and say: Congressman, have you balanced the budget? We say: No, we are working on it, but we haven't done it yet. I don't want to offend any of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I am probably going to, but I don't mean it. Our constituents say: Well, Congressman, have you repealed ObamaCare? I say: Well, no, not yet, but we are working on it. Then they look at us and they say: Tell me, Congressman, you have done away with the only thing that we know of that helps create thousands of jobs all over this country and possibly would help create the job that they had because of some ideology or some conservative group that is scoring a Member of Congress, and now I don't have a job, and I am on unemployment. Mr. Speaker, our constituents and hardworking Americans deserve better. They deserve better than Members of Congress playing political games because of scorecards. I serve under one of the most principled chairmen, probably the most principled chairman in Congress, and I agree with him on 99.9 percent of everything that we do in our committee. We just happen to disagree on this one issue. My chairman is passionate and principled, and I never would doubt that. Mr. Speaker, I won't take much more time. If America is going to get out of the hole we are in as a country, then Congress must start working together. Mr. Speaker, we should applaud. We should be happy on the day--and I don't want to offend the gentlewoman from California who spoke earlier, but we should be happy on the day when Democrats want to join Republicans on legislation that helps move the country forward. They are clapping, that is awesome. We are trying to do what we think is best, and the Export-Import Bank doesn't cost the taxpayers a dime. It helps create thousands of jobs all over this country and makes sure we don't lose thousands of jobs to 60 other countries that have these credit agencies. Mr. Speaker, I don't know what else to say. This is regular order, this closed rule. I am going to close in 10 seconds, but this is all about regular order. We could have had amendments. We could have had a thousand amendments in our committee, but we chose to go this route. We didn't choose it. Some of us chose to go this route. We are dealing with this today. Our constituents deserve better, and we have to do better. With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying bill. I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. parliamentary inquiries Mr. HENSARLING. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, the resolution before the House is H. Res. 450 which, as I understand it, would establish the rule for debate on this Ex-Im reauthorization bill, that it does not make in order any amendments. The closed rule means that in addition to not having any debate on the rule--since all time has now been yielded back, with no other Member having a chance to speak--Members have been denied their chance to participate in that part of the process. My parliamentary inquiry is whether there is any way, at this juncture, for Members to amend the resolution, H. Res. 450, to give Members an opportunity to offer amendments to the underlying Ex-Im reauthorization bill? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair was about to put the question on ordering the previous question. If the motion for the previous question was rejected, there would be a potential for further debate on, or amendment to, House Resolution 450. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, further parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. HENSARLING. So, if the previous question is defeated, then a Member who is opposed to the previous question would be afforded the opportunity to offer an amendment to H. Res. 450 that would strike the text of the closed, no amendments rule and replace it with the text of a rule that provided for consideration of the underlying Ex-Im reauthorization bill through an open process, with time for debate, where any Member--either Republican or Democrat--could offer germane amendments to the bill. Is that correct, Mr. Speaker? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair cannot respond to specific hypotheticals, but if the motion for the previous question were rejected, there would be potential for further debate on, or amendment to, House Resolution 450. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, further parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. HENSARLING. If the previous question is defeated, may I or any Member who votes against the previous question claim time to offer such an amendment to create an open rules process for consideration of the underlying Ex-Im reauthorization bill where Members on both sides of the aisle can offer amendments to the bill? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair cannot judge that at this time. Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the Speaker. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. MULVANEY. A few minutes ago, in reference to a question raised by the gentleman from Texas, you indicated that the amendments would be in order if the motion for the previous question failed. My question is: Are motions to amend in order before the motion for the previous question comes to the floor? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The previous question has preferential standing. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk. I would like to have it heard now. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The previous question has already been moved. Mr. MULVANEY. No, it hasn't. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair is about to put the question on ordering the previous question on the resolution. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry. Who moved the previous question? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Tennessee. Mr. MULVANEY. Was that seconded? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The previous question does not require a second. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk. I would simply like to ask what rule the Chair is relying on in denying me the ability to bring that amendment now. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Clause 4 of rule XVI. The question is on ordering the previous question on the resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015)] [House] [Pages H7178-H7183] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 597, REFORM EXPORTS AND EXPAND THE AMERICAN ECONOMY ACT Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2 of rule XV, I call up motion No. 2, to discharge the Committee on Rules from the further consideration of House Resolution 450, providing for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 597) to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the United States, and for other purposes. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Did the gentleman sign the petition? Mr. FINCHER. Yes. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Tennessee calls up a motion to discharge the Committee on Rules from further consideration of House Resolution 450, which the Clerk will report by title. Point of Order Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, point of order. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his point of order. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to rule XV, section 2(d)(1), I make a point of order that this motion is not timely brought. The rule specifically says that, ``On the second and fourth Mondays of a month,'' which is what we are today, ``immediately after the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag, a motion to discharge that has been brought on the calendar for at least seven legislative days shall be privileged if called up by a Member whose signature appears thereon.'' We had the pledge and the prayer earlier today. We also then had intervening activity in the House, and this motion is no longer timely. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point of order? Mr. MULVANEY. I would point out, Mr. Speaker, that we took up 1- minute speeches; we received a message from the Senate; and you, yourself, approved the Journal. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point of order? Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I think my friend from South Carolina, the gentleman, is out of order. This is regular order. We are moving on as procedure. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, while you are continuing, I would like you to consider one thing. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman may proceed. Mr. MULVANEY. The rule is very explicit. The rule does not say that we may not take--the rule says that we must proceed immediately. I recognize the fact that on occasion 1-minute speeches are not considered business of the House, that receiving messages from the Senate are not considered business of the House, and, on occasion, a Journal is not considered business of the House even though, from time to time, we do vote on it. The rule does not say that we cannot do other business. The rule says we can't do anything, that we must proceed immediately after the Pledge of Allegiance, and that if the motion is brought at any other time it is untimely. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does any other Member wish to be heard on this point of order? If not, the Chair will rule. The rule does not say that the motion to discharge must be--it just says that it can be--brought up immediately. Today's proceedings are consistent with previous occasions where the Chair has entertained 1-minute speeches on discharge days, and those speeches proceeded by unanimous consent. On those grounds, the point of order is overruled. Parliamentary Inquiries Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. MULVANEY. Does the language of section 2(d)(1) not specifically say ``shall be privileged if called up''? It is not ``may.'' It is ``shall . . . if. . . . '' The SPEAKER pro tempore. The rule is not so limited. The motion would be in order if it were to be brought up then, and it is also in order to be brought up now. Mr. MULVANEY. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. [[Page H7179]] Mr. MULVANEY. If 2(d)(1) says that it shall be in order if brought up at this particular time but the Chair is ruling that it may be in order at other times, what rule is the Chair relying on for that determination? The SPEAKER pro tempore. There is nothing in the rule that requires the motion to discharge to be brought up immediately following the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. MULVANEY. Further point, Mr. Speaker. The only way that it is privileged is that if it was brought up immediately after the pledge. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair is also following prior practice of the House in entertaining the motion. Mr. MULVANEY. I'm sorry, and Mr. Speaker, when you were giving your decision before, I was reading the rule. Would you please restate the basis for your decision. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has entertained 1-minute speeches on previous discharge days. Those speeches proceeded by unanimous consent. On those grounds, the point of order was overruled. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, you did not address, then, my issue on receiving a message from the Senate or approving the Journal. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has entertained numerous parliamentary inquiries on a matter on which the Chair has already ruled. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. MULVANEY. Would the decision have been different if we had not made 1-minute speeches? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair cannot respond to a hypothetical question. The Clerk will report the title of the resolution. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fincher) will be recognized for 10 minutes and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) will be recognized for 10 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee. Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Even though discharge petitions have rarely been invoked in modern history, they nevertheless embody democracy and its fundamental principle of majority rules, a principle that the gentleman has already talked about earlier. This discharge process offers the only means by which a majority of House Members can secure a vote on a measure that is opposed by the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction and House leadership. What makes the gentleman's remarks a few minutes ago particularly ironic is the fact that the discharge rule evolved from a precursor rule adopted in 1910 as part of the Cannon revolt. The Cannon revolt was a revolt against Speaker Joseph Cannon. It was a remarkable event in the history of this House and is relevant today in more ways than one. Speaker Cannon was, at the time, the longest-serving Republican Speaker in the history of the House, serving as Speaker from 1903 to 1911. Referred to as ``Uncle Joe,'' Speaker Cannon ruled with an iron fist. Historians have not painted him as a great legislator. No. Historians have painted him as a great obstructionist. He blocked legislation, including child labor laws and the right for women to vote. What was his reasoning for blocking this progressive legislation? ``I am tired of listening to all this babble for reform,'' he said. Several times, Republicans tried unsuccessfully to curb Speaker Cannon's broad powers, which included his chairmanship of the Rules Committee and his power to dole out committee assignments, among other powers. But that changed in March of 1910 when 42 Republicans joined with the Democrats introducing a resolution containing a rules package that would strip Speaker Cannon of his many powers. Speaker Cannon tried to filibuster this revolt, speaking from the chair for 26 straight hours while allies tried to round up additional allies who were out celebrating St. Patrick's Day, but it didn't work. Speaker Cannon finally ruled the resolution out of order, but the House overruled the Chair, thereby adopting far-reaching reforms, including the precursor of today's discharge rule. I ask my colleagues to join me in returning power to rank-and-file Members by voting on the motion to discharge and supporting American jobs. With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. First, Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize the gentleman from Tennessee and the passion that he brings to this debate. He has long been a champion of the Export-Import Bank. We have had a respectful disagreement over the substance of the issue, but at this moment I don't care to spend much time on the substance of the issue because we are debating a discharge petition. Mr. Speaker, it was an interesting history lesson that my colleague and friend introduced the House to, and I have no reason to doubt that it is an accurate history lesson. I will note for the Record that apparently somehow Mr. Cannon managed to get a building named after him. But the point I would make is this: whether the gentleman from Tennessee and others have disagreed with process at the Financial Services Committee--I know that they do--but the question before us, Mr. Speaker, is why punish the entirety of the House? Those who are bringing forth this discharge petition had the opportunity to allow Members on both sides of the aisle to offer amendments. People who were not on the Financial Services Committee could have had the opportunity to offer amendments, but not under this particular discharge petition. So, Mr. Speaker, the real complaint I have here is, regardless of what complaints or beefs they may have against me personally or against the process of the Financial Services Committee, why punish the entirety of the House? We hear so much about regular order and about empowering rank-and- file Members. Well, then, why aren't rank-and-file Members, then, empowered to offer amendments? We were told that it was simply to discharge a single piece of legislation. Then why not, at this point, let the House work its will? Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, that doesn't appear to happen. I perfectly understand that one man's economic development is another man's corporate welfare, and I think that debate will happen tomorrow. But here, right now, simply because there is a rule to have a discharge petition that would disqualify any Member from offering an amendment doesn't mean we should necessarily avail ourselves of it. The Constitution allows us to create debt. It doesn't mean it is a good thing for us to do that as we face yet another debt ceiling vote in front of us. So, Mr. Speaker, I would simply hope that Members would vote down this discharge petition, and if they believe strongly in it, then bring back another one, but at least allow Members on the floor to offer amendments. Republicans, Democrats, and people from all committees should be able to offer the amendments if that was the purpose of the discharge petition. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer). Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I will say to my friend from Texas, there were 3 years to do exactly that. It wasn't done. I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for yielding, and I thank him for his courage and Mr. Lucas' courage for working within the rules to bring this matter to the floor. It is an important matter. {time} 1845 Since July, businesses and workers across the country have been asking Congress to reopen the Export-Import Bank so that they could compete on a level playing field in overseas markets. This is about jobs and a competitive America. Opening the Export-Import Bank, Mr. Speaker, is about creating and keeping jobs here in America. A motion on the floor tonight will demonstrate that a majority of this House supports taking action to pass a multiyear extension of the Bank's charter authority. We will have a [[Page H7180]] chance to show the American people that Congress can work together, Democrats and Republicans, to get something done that helps businesses and workers compete and create jobs. Mr. HECK of Washington. Will the gentleman yield? Mr. HOYER. I yield to the gentleman from Washington. Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ask my friends and colleagues to support Mr. Fincher of Tennessee on his motion in his effort to subject this issue to regular order. This is regular order. This is the only regular order that we are going to be given to have a chance to take up this job-creating legislation. I know this for a fact. It is not speculation. On February 12, they offered an amendment to the views and estimates on the budget that said, in part, the committee will work to consider reauthorization of the Bank through regular order that lets all sides be heard, and the leadership of the committee said, ``Vote `no.' '' There was never an intention to subject this issue to regular order. Now is our chance to do that. Support the gentlemen from Tennessee and Oklahoma and vote ``yes'' on this. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank Mr. Fincher, I thank Mr. Lucas, I thank Ms. Waters, I thank Ms. Moore, and I thank Denny Heck. Vote for this motion to put a bill on the floor that the majority supports. That is democracy. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), chairman of the Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee. Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that, and I appreciate the leadership of my chair on this issue. It seems to me, Mr. Speaker, we have two issues that we are dealing with today: First is the issue, itself, of the Export-Import Bank and the entitlement mentality that has grown up here in the United States. It is sad to me that some believe that this is the only, or the best, way for the U.S. to compete on the world stage when, in fact, we know it is not. We are at a competitive disadvantage, not because we may or may not have an Export-Import Bank, but because of our regulatory environment, because of our tax environment, and because of all of the other barriers that have been thrown up by this Congress, including health care and a number of other things that have made our companies less competitive. The other issue is the way that we are dealing with this issue as it is coming to the floor and how it has reached the House floor today. Mr. Speaker, I would like to know which committee chair of another committee would approve of having the process be short-circuited out of their committee. Would it be the Energy and Commerce Committee? the Ways and Means Committee? Because I can tell you I have not been real happy, as a small business owner on some of the lack of progress that we have made on that. Maybe it would be the Ag Committee. Why did it take so long for things to reach the floor? How about any other committee that we are all dealing with? The simple fact is that my subcommittee, Monetary Policy and Trade, where this jurisdiction lies, had three joint hearings with the Oversight Committee on this particular issue. There was a sunset that was put in. It was intentionally put in so that there would be a review. The review happened, and the determination of my subcommittee and this committee was that it did not warrant further action. So, again, as we are looking at this tool that has been infrequently used, it doesn't restore regular order, as has been claimed. No. In fact, it upends the balance of power in the House. It skirts the committee process and gives the minority the control over the House floor. A discharge petition was brought to the House floor under the guise of job creation. In reality, it serves to revive and retrench a dependency mentality. Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kinzinger), who has done great work on this supportive piece of legislation. Mr. KINZINGER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for his hard work. I would remind the previous speaker that this is actually a Republican-led discharge petition for Ex-Im Bank. We could have avoided this. None of us celebrate being here right now as Republicans. But the time to deal with the issue of Ex-Im Bank was on the committee. Unfortunately, this could have gone through the committee, this could have been voted on in committee, and it could have come to the floor in what people would consider a more regular order way than this. However, that didn't have the opportunity. Mr. Speaker, my district is the 16th District of Illinois, and I will tell you what, they are not worried about discharge petitions and things when people talk about regular order and internal politics and what is going on here. What they care about is the fact that it is a heavy manufacturing district, and they want to be able to go to work tomorrow. They are worried because people live with the threat of pink slips, and many people actually get pink slips. Unfortunately, in July, the charter for Ex-Im Bank expired, which put a lot of the manufacturing suppliers of the aerospace industry at a disadvantage in my district compared with those that supply to Airbus and other companies around the world. Pride in our exports and pride in our manufacturing is something that we should have pride in, and we should fight beyond what it means for a party label or beyond what it means for floor politics. Mr. Speaker, the opponents of reauthorization live in a world where the politics of purity trumps the realism of today and of the economics. Here is the reality: in my district, thousands of jobs, millions of dollars of exports, and many, many people rely on this to be reauthorized. Mr. Speaker, I know this is not easy, as Republicans, to do this, but it is the right thing to do. So I stand and I ask my colleagues on the Republican and the Democrat side of the aisle to put partisanship aside, to do the right thing, and to discharge this resolution. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), a valued member of the Financial Services Committee. Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman. I hope you are all listening to some of the use of the language. I appreciated the history lesson. But has it been lost on you, the irony part of this discussion that, hey, we are going to do a discharge petition, which is part of the rules, because we don't feel we are having a voice. Oh, by the way, we are going to draft a rule--draft a rule--that you can't offer amendments, that you can't have a discussion. For those of us who have worked on this issue for years, who have sat through dozens of hearings in multiple years, who actually have things we believe that make it better, the brilliance here is lock it down. So you are going to complain that you are not being treated fairly, and then the answer to not being treated fairly is, let's write a rule that no one gets a voice, that it is purely up or down. Is that lost on anyone here? The reality of it is the vast majority of the trade from this country has access to surety bonds and trade credit. It is a fraction of a fraction of a fraction that actually asks for a taxpayer subsidy, a taxpayer guarantee. If you wanted to solve this problem tomorrow, you could recharter the Ex-Im Bank so that it continues to exist but get the taxpayers off the hook and let them do just as now Fannie and Freddie are trying to do where they buy their reinsurance in the market. There are solutions here, if I was allowed to offer an amendment. But you have all chosen to write a rule that keeps those of us who have worked on this issue for years from being able to have that discussion. Is that irony lost on anyone here? You know there is a better way to do this than extending this type of crony capitalism and leaving our taxpayers on the hook for hours and hours of hearings we have had where you have heard the bad acts that are going on in this agency--the fraud, the mis-accounting. Why are we going to let that move forward? Because if you have read the [[Page H7181]] reforms that are in here, you would understand they already should be doing these. It is an outrage they are not. Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters). Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, Members, I would like to thank the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fincher) for yielding and for his leadership in initiating this very successful discharge petition in order to finally make possible the opportunity to vote to renew the charter of the Export-Import Bank. For almost 2 years now, as ranking member of the Financial Services Committee, I have been working very hard with Leader Pelosi, Whip Hoyer, and my colleagues Gwen Moore and Denny Heck. We have all been working hard to secure long-term reauthorization of the Bank. And today, after many months of obstruction by a vocal minority of this body, which led to a shutdown of the Ex-Im Bank, this House will finally get the opportunity to vote to do just that. Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker, this discharge petition is not a rejection of regular order. Although rarely used, the discharge petition exists under House rules for the very purpose of ensuring that the will of a determined majority may ultimately prevail over an obstructionist minority, and that is exactly what is happening today. Republicans and Democrats have come together to support the reauthorization of a proven job creator. We have come together to end the unilateral disarmament that has harmed our exporters, their domestic suppliers, and the many American workers across this country whose jobs are supported by the Bank. We have come together to show that compromise is possible if you are willing to work it. So, again, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for his work. I urge the Members to vote in favor of the motion. We have come together as Members of Congress to do the work of the people. Let's get on with the business of doing it. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney), another valuable member of the House Financial Services Committee. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas. I want to pick up on where my friend from Arizona left off regarding the comments about my good friend and colleague from Washington regarding regular order. It is not regular order. If we have regular order, we have amendments. I have an amendment that would protect small business. I don't get a chance to do that. We would under regular order. But let's not forget, there is not just one committee that is getting rolled here. Rules Committee is getting rolled. And if this was to follow regular order and go to rules, every single one of you would be able to offer amendments in that committee. They would probably get shot down, as mine have since I have been here, but at least you could offer them. Furthermore, if it went to Rules Committee, you could have debate; you could participate and debate on the issues. What is getting ready to happen here in a few minutes is Mr. Fincher will control 1 hour of debate, he will speak for 5, and then yield back, denying every single one of you in this Chamber the opportunity to speak for at least half an hour each side on this particular issue. This is not regular order, Mr. Speaker. This is shoving something down the American people's throats. Let's have regular order. Let's have the amendments. I have got some ones you might actually enjoy. Let's have the debate. But let's not kid ourselves into thinking this is regular order because it is not. Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I have one remaining speaker. How much time do I have remaining? I want to reserve the right to close. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Tennessee has 2 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 2 minutes remaining. Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. A lot of discussion, passionate discussion about jobs tonight. But I would point out to my Democratic colleagues on the other side of the aisle, where was this passion when ObamaCare was passed? The Congressional Budget Office says that it is going to cost this economy 2.5 million fewer jobs. Where was this passion when H.R. 30 came to the floor that would repeal this 30-hour definition of full-time employee? According to one study, 2.6 million Americans making under $30,000 are at risk of having their hours cut due to the ObamaCare 30-hour rule. Where was the passion on the other side of the aisle when H.R. 351, the LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act, came? That is estimated to put up to 45,000 unemployed Americans back to work on liquid natural gas export projects. Where was the passion when S. 1 came, the Keystone XL pipeline? The State Department's environmental impact statement said: ``During construction, proposed project spending would support approximately 42,100 jobs.'' But we didn't hear much from our friends on the other side of the aisle when this was going on. {time} 1900 But, again, I think, too often, my friends on the other side of the aisle are always happy to subsidize what they can regulate and control. I would say to my friends on my side of the aisle that I respect your opinion, and I hope you respect mine; but I think there is a better way to promote exports. I think there is a better way to promote jobs. It has everything to do with regulatory reform. It has to do with the REINS Act. It has everything to do with fundamental tax reform, which, according to the National Association of Manufacturers, is half of our competitive disadvantage. It has everything to do with litigation reform. We have greater remedial costs than do our green energy European competitors. There is a better way, and there is a more fair way to come to this floor. As for whatever you think of the process of the Financial Services Committee, if this is going to come to the floor, every Member ought to be allowed to have an amendment, and we should reject this discharge petition. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield my remaining 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas). Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker and colleagues, why are we here tonight? Why are we compelled to engage in this process? The circumstances, perhaps, might be a little bit like 1910. Do you remember 1910? A dictatorial Speaker who was so totally in control and who so totally refused to accept input from the membership made himself chairman of the Rules Committee, too. He stymied the legislative process. He brought it to a stop. What did our predecessors do 100-plus years ago? They finally rose up together and threw him out, and they created a process by which no dictatorial chairman, no dictatorial Speaker would ever be able to fully thwart the will of this body. It is amazing. That is what we are here for. It is to continue one century later the responsible actions that they put into place. Now, some of my friends have asked, ``Why don't we have thousands of amendments?'' Think about 1910--a dictatorial Speaker, a dictatorial committee chairman. Under no circumstances was Uncle Joe going to allow any input. So, when they created this process, they had to make sure that the bill could come to the floor for consideration in a way that would not allow it to be manipulated by that same dictatorial attitude. We are operating under the present version of that rule. If we had wanted unlimited amendments, we should have spent an unlimited amount of time in the committee of jurisdiction, working on those amendments, but that opportunity never availed itself. Had that opportunity availed itself, we wouldn't be here; but we are here. We have a bill that reflects, I believe--and that a majority of us in this House believes--what is in the best interest of America's workers and America's [[Page H7182]] businesspeople in our competitive spirit. I simply say to you that to talk about the things we should be doing tonight that should have been done a month ago or a year ago seems most inappropriate. So, my friends, in a moment, let's honor the people who were on this floor in 1910. Let's say, ``Joe, you can't have your way then or now.'' Let's pass the discharge; let's pass the rule; and let's get on with the bill debate. The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time has expired. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fincher) to discharge the Committee on Rules from the further consideration of House Resolution 450. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 246, nays 177, not voting 11, as follows: [Roll No. 569] YEAS--246 Adams Aderholt Aguilar Amodei Ashford Barletta Bass Beatty Becerra Bera Beyer Bishop (GA) Blumenauer Bonamici Bost Boustany Boyle, Brendan F.

The Clerk will report the resolution. The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: H. Res. 450 Resolved, That immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 597) to reauthorize the Export- Import Bank of the United States, and for other purposes. All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. An amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of H.R. 3611, as introduced, shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial Services or their respective designees; and (2) one motion to recommit with or without instructions. Sec. 2. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of H.R. 597. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Tennessee is recognized for 1 hour. Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of conversation here tonight about what we are doing and how this happened and what we are going to do next. Mr. Speaker, the reason why we are here tonight, I didn't sign up to come to Washington from Frog Jump, the place I live, to do discharge petitions. The reason I did come to Washington was to work for my district and try to make sure that hardworking men and women all over this country and my district have jobs. Mr. Speaker, that is what the Export-Import Bank does. It helps create thousands of jobs, specifically, 200,000 jobs each year. Now, let me be clear because there has been a lot of misconception or misperception, whatever you want to say, about what this costs the taxpayer. Mr. Speaker, this is at no cost to the U.S. taxpayer. In fact, the Export-Import Bank returned $675 million to the U.S. Treasury in fiscal year 2014. In 2013, it returned more than $1 billion, Mr. Speaker. This is not a minority procedure, this is not a Democrat procedure that is happening tonight. This is a Republican-led position. This is a Republican reform bill that we are doing. [[Page H7183]] {time} 1930 More reforms than have been done in probably 50 years. I haven't looked specifically, but I think President Reagan did a lot, and other Presidents have done them. But this is about jobs, Mr. Speaker. Think about this. We go home to our districts every weekend, and we talk to constituents every weekend. Think about constituents that come up to us and say: Congressman, have you balanced the budget? We say: No, we are working on it, but we haven't done it yet. I don't want to offend any of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I am probably going to, but I don't mean it. Our constituents say: Well, Congressman, have you repealed ObamaCare? I say: Well, no, not yet, but we are working on it. Then they look at us and they say: Tell me, Congressman, you have done away with the only thing that we know of that helps create thousands of jobs all over this country and possibly would help create the job that they had because of some ideology or some conservative group that is scoring a Member of Congress, and now I don't have a job, and I am on unemployment. Mr. Speaker, our constituents and hardworking Americans deserve better. They deserve better than Members of Congress playing political games because of scorecards. I serve under one of the most principled chairmen, probably the most principled chairman in Congress, and I agree with him on 99.9 percent of everything that we do in our committee. We just happen to disagree on this one issue. My chairman is passionate and principled, and I never would doubt that. Mr. Speaker, I won't take much more time. If America is going to get out of the hole we are in as a country, then Congress must start working together. Mr. Speaker, we should applaud. We should be happy on the day--and I don't want to offend the gentlewoman from California who spoke earlier, but we should be happy on the day when Democrats want to join Republicans on legislation that helps move the country forward. They are clapping, that is awesome. We are trying to do what we think is best, and the Export-Import Bank doesn't cost the taxpayers a dime. It helps create thousands of jobs all over this country and makes sure we don't lose thousands of jobs to 60 other countries that have these credit agencies. Mr. Speaker, I don't know what else to say. This is regular order, this closed rule. I am going to close in 10 seconds, but this is all about regular order. We could have had amendments. We could have had a thousand amendments in our committee, but we chose to go this route. We didn't choose it. Some of us chose to go this route. We are dealing with this today. Our constituents deserve better, and we have to do better. With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying bill. I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution. parliamentary inquiries Mr. HENSARLING. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, the resolution before the House is H. Res. 450 which, as I understand it, would establish the rule for debate on this Ex-Im reauthorization bill, that it does not make in order any amendments. The closed rule means that in addition to not having any debate on the rule--since all time has now been yielded back, with no other Member having a chance to speak--Members have been denied their chance to participate in that part of the process. My parliamentary inquiry is whether there is any way, at this juncture, for Members to amend the resolution, H. Res. 450, to give Members an opportunity to offer amendments to the underlying Ex-Im reauthorization bill? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair was about to put the question on ordering the previous question. If the motion for the previous question was rejected, there would be a potential for further debate on, or amendment to, House Resolution 450. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, further parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. HENSARLING. So, if the previous question is defeated, then a Member who is opposed to the previous question would be afforded the opportunity to offer an amendment to H. Res. 450 that would strike the text of the closed, no amendments rule and replace it with the text of a rule that provided for consideration of the underlying Ex-Im reauthorization bill through an open process, with time for debate, where any Member--either Republican or Democrat--could offer germane amendments to the bill. Is that correct, Mr. Speaker? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair cannot respond to specific hypotheticals, but if the motion for the previous question were rejected, there would be potential for further debate on, or amendment to, House Resolution 450. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, further parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. HENSARLING. If the previous question is defeated, may I or any Member who votes against the previous question claim time to offer such an amendment to create an open rules process for consideration of the underlying Ex-Im reauthorization bill where Members on both sides of the aisle can offer amendments to the bill? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair cannot judge that at this time. Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the Speaker. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. MULVANEY. A few minutes ago, in reference to a question raised by the gentleman from Texas, you indicated that the amendments would be in order if the motion for the previous question failed. My question is: Are motions to amend in order before the motion for the previous question comes to the floor? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The previous question has preferential standing. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk. I would like to have it heard now. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The previous question has already been moved. Mr. MULVANEY. No, it hasn't. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair is about to put the question on ordering the previous question on the resolution. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry. Who moved the previous question? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Tennessee. Mr. MULVANEY. Was that seconded? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The previous question does not require a second. Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk. I would simply like to ask what rule the Chair is relying on in denying me the ability to bring that amendment now. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Clause 4 of rule XVI. The question is on ordering the previous question on the resolution. The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. ____________________",package_114_50.csv,42848,42848,42918,"[congressional record volume 161, number 157 (monday, october 26, 2015)] [house] [pages h7178-h7183] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] providing for consideration of h.r. 597, reform exports and expand the american economy act mr. fincher. mr. speaker, pursuant to clause 2 of rule xv, i call up motion no. 2, to discharge the committee on rules from the further consideration of house resolution 450, providing for the consideration of the bill (h.r. 597) to reauthorize the export-import bank of the united states, and for other purposes. the speaker pro tempore. did the gentleman sign the petition? mr. fincher. yes. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from tennessee calls up a motion to discharge the committee on rules from further consideration of house resolution 450, which the clerk will report by title. point of order mr. mulvaney. mr. speaker, point of order. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman will state his point of order. mr. mulvaney. mr. speaker, pursuant to rule xv, section 2(d)(1), i make a point of order that this motion is not timely brought. the rule specifically says that, ``on the second and fourth mondays of a month,'' which is what we are today, ``immediately after the pledge of allegiance to the flag, a motion to discharge that has been brought on the calendar for at least seven legislative days shall be privileged if called up by a member whose signature appears thereon.'' we had the pledge and the prayer earlier today. we also then had intervening activity in the house, and this motion is no longer timely. the speaker pro tempore. does any other member wish to be heard on the point of order? mr. mulvaney. i would point out, mr. speaker, that we took up 1- minute speeches; we received a message from the senate; and you, yourself, approved the journal. the speaker pro tempore. does any other member wish to be heard on the point of order? mr. fincher. mr. speaker, i think my friend from south carolina, the gentleman, is out of order. this is regular order. we are moving on as procedure. mr. mulvaney. mr. speaker, while you are continuing, i would like you to consider one thing. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman may proceed. mr. mulvaney. the rule is very explicit. the rule does not say that we may not take--the rule says that we must proceed immediately. i recognize the fact that on occasion 1-minute speeches are not considered business of the house, that receiving messages from the senate are not considered business of the house, and, on occasion, a journal is not considered business of the house even though, from time to time, we do vote on it. the rule does not say that we cannot do other business. the rule says we can't do anything, that we must proceed immediately after the pledge of allegiance, and that if the motion is brought at any other time it is untimely. the speaker pro tempore. does any other member wish to be heard on this point of order? if not, the chair will rule. the rule does not say that the motion to discharge must be--it just says that it can be--brought up immediately. today's proceedings are consistent with previous occasions where the chair has entertained 1-minute speeches on discharge days, and those speeches proceeded by unanimous consent. on those grounds, the point of order is overruled. parliamentary inquiries mr. mulvaney. mr. speaker, parliamentary inquiry. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. mr. mulvaney. does the language of section 2(d)(1) not specifically say ``shall be privileged if called up''? it is not ``may.'' it is ``shall . . . if. . . . '' the speaker pro tempore. the rule is not so limited. the motion would be in order if it were to be brought up then, and it is also in order to be brought up now. mr. mulvaney. parliamentary inquiry, mr. speaker. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. [[page h7179]] mr. mulvaney. if 2(d)(1) says that it shall be in order if brought up at this particular time but the chair is ruling that it may be in order at other times, what rule is the chair relying on for that determination? the speaker pro tempore. there is nothing in the rule that requires the motion to discharge to be brought up immediately following the pledge of allegiance. mr. mulvaney. further point, mr. speaker. the only way that it is privileged is that if it was brought up immediately after the pledge. the speaker pro tempore. the chair is also following prior practice of the house in entertaining the motion. mr. mulvaney. i'm sorry, and mr. speaker, when you were giving your decision before, i was reading the rule. would you please restate the basis for your decision. the speaker pro tempore. the chair has entertained 1-minute speeches on previous discharge days. those speeches proceeded by unanimous consent. on those grounds, the point of order was overruled. mr. mulvaney. mr. speaker, you did not address, then, my issue on receiving a message from the senate or approving the journal. the speaker pro tempore. the chair has entertained numerous parliamentary inquiries on a matter on which the chair has already ruled. mr. mulvaney. mr. speaker, parliamentary inquiry. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. mr. mulvaney. would the decision have been different if we had not made 1-minute speeches? the speaker pro tempore. the chair cannot respond to a hypothetical question. the clerk will report the title of the resolution. the clerk read the title of the resolution. the speaker pro tempore. under the rule, the gentleman from tennessee (mr. fincher) will be recognized for 10 minutes and the gentleman from texas (mr. hensarling) will be recognized for 10 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from tennessee. mr. fincher. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. even though discharge petitions have rarely been invoked in modern history, they nevertheless embody democracy and its fundamental principle of majority rules, a principle that the gentleman has already talked about earlier. this discharge process offers the only means by which a majority of house members can secure a vote on a measure that is opposed by the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction and house leadership. what makes the gentleman's remarks a few minutes ago particularly ironic is the fact that the discharge rule evolved from a precursor rule adopted in 1910 as part of the cannon revolt. the cannon revolt was a revolt against speaker joseph cannon. it was a remarkable event in the history of this house and is relevant today in more ways than one. speaker cannon was, at the time, the longest-serving republican speaker in the history of the house, serving as speaker from 1903 to 1911. referred to as ``uncle joe,'' speaker cannon ruled with an iron fist. historians have not painted him as a great legislator. no. historians have painted him as a great obstructionist. he blocked legislation, including child labor laws and the right for women to vote. what was his reasoning for blocking this progressive legislation? ``i am tired of listening to all this babble for reform,'' he said. several times, republicans tried unsuccessfully to curb speaker cannon's broad powers, which included his chairmanship of the rules committee and his power to dole out committee assignments, among other powers. but that changed in march of 1910 when 42 republicans joined with the democrats introducing a resolution containing a rules package that would strip speaker cannon of his many powers. speaker cannon tried to filibuster this revolt, speaking from the chair for 26 straight hours while allies tried to round up additional allies who were out celebrating st. patrick's day, but it didn't work. speaker cannon finally ruled the resolution out of order, but the house overruled the chair, thereby adopting far-reaching reforms, including the precursor of today's discharge rule. i ask my colleagues to join me in returning power to rank-and-file members by voting on the motion to discharge and supporting american jobs. with that, mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. hensarling. mr. speaker, i yield myself as much time as i may consume. first, mr. speaker, i want to recognize the gentleman from tennessee and the passion that he brings to this debate. he has long been a champion of the export-import bank. we have had a respectful disagreement over the substance of the issue, but at this moment i don't care to spend much time on the substance of the issue because we are debating a discharge petition. mr. speaker, it was an interesting history lesson that my colleague and friend introduced the house to, and i have no reason to doubt that it is an accurate history lesson. i will note for the record that apparently somehow mr. cannon managed to get a building named after him. but the point i would make is this: whether the gentleman from tennessee and others have disagreed with process at the financial services committee--i know that they do--but the question before us, mr. speaker, is why punish the entirety of the house? those who are bringing forth this discharge petition had the opportunity to allow members on both sides of the aisle to offer amendments. people who were not on the financial services committee could have had the opportunity to offer amendments, but not under this particular discharge petition. so, mr. speaker, the real complaint i have here is, regardless of what complaints or beefs they may have against me personally or against the process of the financial services committee, why punish the entirety of the house? we hear so much about regular order and about empowering rank-and- file members. well, then, why aren't rank-and-file members, then, empowered to offer amendments? we were told that it was simply to discharge a single piece of legislation. then why not, at this point, let the house work its will? unfortunately, mr. speaker, that doesn't appear to happen. i perfectly understand that one man's economic development is another man's corporate welfare, and i think that debate will happen tomorrow. but here, right now, simply because there is a rule to have a discharge petition that would disqualify any member from offering an amendment doesn't mean we should necessarily avail ourselves of it. the constitution allows us to create debt. it doesn't mean it is a good thing for us to do that as we face yet another debt ceiling vote in front of us. so, mr. speaker, i would simply hope that members would vote down this discharge petition, and if they believe strongly in it, then bring back another one, but at least allow members on the floor to offer amendments. republicans, democrats, and people from all committees should be able to offer the amendments if that was the purpose of the discharge petition. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. fincher. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from maryland (mr. hoyer). mr. hoyer. mr. speaker, i thank my friend for yielding. mr. speaker, i will say to my friend from texas, there were 3 years to do exactly that. it wasn't done. i thank the gentleman from tennessee for yielding, and i thank him for his courage and mr. lucas' courage for working within the rules to bring this matter to the floor. it is an important matter. {time} 1845 since july, businesses and workers across the country have been asking congress to reopen the export-import bank so that they could compete on a level playing field in overseas markets. this is about jobs and a competitive america. opening the export-import bank, mr. speaker, is about creating and keeping jobs here in america. a motion on the floor tonight will demonstrate that a majority of this house supports taking action to pass a multiyear extension of the bank's charter authority. we will have a [[page h7180]] chance to show the american people that congress can work together, democrats and republicans, to get something done that helps businesses and workers compete and create jobs. mr. heck of washington. will the gentleman yield? mr. hoyer. i yield to the gentleman from washington. mr. heck of washington. mr. speaker, i rise to ask my friends and colleagues to support mr. fincher of tennessee on his motion in his effort to subject this issue to regular order. this is regular order. this is the only regular order that we are going to be given to have a chance to take up this job-creating legislation. i know this for a fact. it is not speculation. on february 12, they offered an amendment to the views and estimates on the budget that said, in part, the committee will work to consider reauthorization of the bank through regular order that lets all sides be heard, and the leadership of the committee said, ``vote `no.' '' there was never an intention to subject this issue to regular order. now is our chance to do that. support the gentlemen from tennessee and oklahoma and vote ``yes'' on this. mr. hoyer. mr. speaker, reclaiming my time, i thank mr. fincher, i thank mr. lucas, i thank ms. waters, i thank ms. moore, and i thank denny heck. vote for this motion to put a bill on the floor that the majority supports. that is democracy. mr. hensarling. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from michigan (mr. huizenga), chairman of the monetary policy and trade subcommittee. mr. huizenga of michigan. mr. speaker, i appreciate that, and i appreciate the leadership of my chair on this issue. it seems to me, mr. speaker, we have two issues that we are dealing with today: first is the issue, itself, of the export-import bank and the entitlement mentality that has grown up here in the united states. it is sad to me that some believe that this is the only, or the best, way for the u.s. to compete on the world stage when, in fact, we know it is not. we are at a competitive disadvantage, not because we may or may not have an export-import bank, but because of our regulatory environment, because of our tax environment, and because of all of the other barriers that have been thrown up by this congress, including health care and a number of other things that have made our companies less competitive. the other issue is the way that we are dealing with this issue as it is coming to the floor and how it has reached the house floor today. mr. speaker, i would like to know which committee chair of another committee would approve of having the process be short-circuited out of their committee. would it be the energy and commerce committee? the ways and means committee? because i can tell you i have not been real happy, as a small business owner on some of the lack of progress that we have made on that. maybe it would be the ag committee. why did it take so long for things to reach the floor? how about any other committee that we are all dealing with? the simple fact is that my subcommittee, monetary policy and trade, where this jurisdiction lies, had three joint hearings with the oversight committee on this particular issue. there was a sunset that was put in. it was intentionally put in so that there would be a review. the review happened, and the determination of my subcommittee and this committee was that it did not warrant further action. so, again, as we are looking at this tool that has been infrequently used, it doesn't restore regular order, as has been claimed. no. in fact, it upends the balance of power in the house. it skirts the committee process and gives the minority the control over the house floor. a discharge petition was brought to the house floor under the guise of job creation. in reality, it serves to revive and retrench a dependency mentality. mr. fincher. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from illinois (mr. kinzinger), who has done great work on this supportive piece of legislation. mr. kinzinger of illinois. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman from tennessee for his hard work. i would remind the previous speaker that this is actually a republican-led discharge petition for ex-im bank. we could have avoided this. none of us celebrate being here right now as republicans. but the time to deal with the issue of ex-im bank was on the committee. unfortunately, this could have gone through the committee, this could have been voted on in committee, and it could have come to the floor in what people would consider a more regular order way than this. however, that didn't have the opportunity. mr. speaker, my district is the 16th district of illinois, and i will tell you what, they are not worried about discharge petitions and things when people talk about regular order and internal politics and what is going on here. what they care about is the fact that it is a heavy manufacturing district, and they want to be able to go to work tomorrow. they are worried because people live with the threat of pink slips, and many people actually get pink slips. unfortunately, in july, the charter for ex-im bank expired, which put a lot of the manufacturing suppliers of the aerospace industry at a disadvantage in my district compared with those that supply to airbus and other companies around the world. pride in our exports and pride in our manufacturing is something that we should have pride in, and we should fight beyond what it means for a party label or beyond what it means for floor politics. mr. speaker, the opponents of reauthorization live in a world where the politics of purity trumps the realism of today and of the economics. here is the reality: in my district, thousands of jobs, millions of dollars of exports, and many, many people rely on this to be reauthorized. mr. speaker, i know this is not easy, as republicans, to do this, but it is the right thing to do. so i stand and i ask my colleagues on the republican and the democrat side of the aisle to put partisanship aside, to do the right thing, and to discharge this resolution. mr. hensarling. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from arizona (mr. schweikert), a valued member of the financial services committee. mr. schweikert. mr. speaker, i thank the chairman. i hope you are all listening to some of the use of the language. i appreciated the history lesson. but has it been lost on you, the irony part of this discussion that, hey, we are going to do a discharge petition, which is part of the rules, because we don't feel we are having a voice. oh, by the way, we are going to draft a rule--draft a rule--that you can't offer amendments, that you can't have a discussion. for those of us who have worked on this issue for years, who have sat through dozens of hearings in multiple years, who actually have things we believe that make it better, the brilliance here is lock it down. so you are going to complain that you are not being treated fairly, and then the answer to not being treated fairly is, let's write a rule that no one gets a voice, that it is purely up or down. is that lost on anyone here? the reality of it is the vast majority of the trade from this country has access to surety bonds and trade credit. it is a fraction of a fraction of a fraction that actually asks for a taxpayer subsidy, a taxpayer guarantee. if you wanted to solve this problem tomorrow, you could recharter the ex-im bank so that it continues to exist but get the taxpayers off the hook and let them do just as now fannie and freddie are trying to do where they buy their reinsurance in the market. there are solutions here, if i was allowed to offer an amendment. but you have all chosen to write a rule that keeps those of us who have worked on this issue for years from being able to have that discussion. is that irony lost on anyone here? you know there is a better way to do this than extending this type of crony capitalism and leaving our taxpayers on the hook for hours and hours of hearings we have had where you have heard the bad acts that are going on in this agency--the fraud, the mis-accounting. why are we going to let that move forward? because if you have read the [[page h7181]] reforms that are in here, you would understand they already should be doing these. it is an outrage they are not. mr. fincher. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from california (ms. maxine waters). ms. maxine waters of california. mr. speaker, members, i would like to thank the gentleman from tennessee (mr. fincher) for yielding and for his leadership in initiating this very successful discharge petition in order to finally make possible the opportunity to vote to renew the charter of the export-import bank. for almost 2 years now, as ranking member of the financial services committee, i have been working very hard with leader pelosi, whip hoyer, and my colleagues gwen moore and denny heck. we have all been working hard to secure long-term reauthorization of the bank. and today, after many months of obstruction by a vocal minority of this body, which led to a shutdown of the ex-im bank, this house will finally get the opportunity to vote to do just that. let me be clear, mr. speaker, this discharge petition is not a rejection of regular order. although rarely used, the discharge petition exists under house rules for the very purpose of ensuring that the will of a determined majority may ultimately prevail over an obstructionist minority, and that is exactly what is happening today. republicans and democrats have come together to support the reauthorization of a proven job creator. we have come together to end the unilateral disarmament that has harmed our exporters, their domestic suppliers, and the many american workers across this country whose jobs are supported by the bank. we have come together to show that compromise is possible if you are willing to work it. so, again, i thank the gentleman from tennessee for his work. i urge the members to vote in favor of the motion. we have come together as members of congress to do the work of the people. let's get on with the business of doing it. mr. hensarling. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from south carolina (mr. mulvaney), another valuable member of the house financial services committee. mr. mulvaney. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman from texas. i want to pick up on where my friend from arizona left off regarding the comments about my good friend and colleague from washington regarding regular order. it is not regular order. if we have regular order, we have amendments. i have an amendment that would protect small business. i don't get a chance to do that. we would under regular order. but let's not forget, there is not just one committee that is getting rolled here. rules committee is getting rolled. and if this was to follow regular order and go to rules, every single one of you would be able to offer amendments in that committee. they would probably get shot down, as mine have since i have been here, but at least you could offer them. furthermore, if it went to rules committee, you could have debate; you could participate and debate on the issues. what is getting ready to happen here in a few minutes is mr. fincher will control 1 hour of debate, he will speak for 5, and then yield back, denying every single one of you in this chamber the opportunity to speak for at least half an hour each side on this particular issue. this is not regular order, mr. speaker. this is shoving something down the american people's throats. let's have regular order. let's have the amendments. i have got some ones you might actually enjoy. let's have the debate. but let's not kid ourselves into thinking this is regular order because it is not. mr. fincher. mr. speaker, i have one remaining speaker. how much time do i have remaining? i want to reserve the right to close. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from tennessee has 2 minutes remaining. the gentleman from texas has 2 minutes remaining. mr. fincher. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. hensarling. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. a lot of discussion, passionate discussion about jobs tonight. but i would point out to my democratic colleagues on the other side of the aisle, where was this passion when obamacare was passed? the congressional budget office says that it is going to cost this economy 2.5 million fewer jobs. where was this passion when h.r. 30 came to the floor that would repeal this 30-hour definition of full-time employee? according to one study, 2.6 million americans making under $30,000 are at risk of having their hours cut due to the obamacare 30-hour rule. where was the passion on the other side of the aisle when h.r. 351, the lng permitting certainty and transparency act, came? that is estimated to put up to 45,000 unemployed americans back to work on liquid natural gas export projects. where was the passion when s. 1 came, the keystone xl pipeline? the state department's environmental impact statement said: ``during construction, proposed project spending would support approximately 42,100 jobs.'' but we didn't hear much from our friends on the other side of the aisle when this was going on. {time} 1900 but, again, i think, too often, my friends on the other side of the aisle are always happy to subsidize what they can regulate and control. i would say to my friends on my side of the aisle that i respect your opinion, and i hope you respect mine; but i think there is a better way to promote exports. i think there is a better way to promote jobs. it has everything to do with regulatory reform. it has to do with the reins act. it has everything to do with fundamental tax reform, which, according to the national association of manufacturers, is half of our competitive disadvantage. it has everything to do with litigation reform. we have greater remedial costs than do our green energy european competitors. there is a better way, and there is a more fair way to come to this floor. as for whatever you think of the process of the financial services committee, if this is going to come to the floor, every member ought to be allowed to have an amendment, and we should reject this discharge petition. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. fincher. mr. speaker, i yield my remaining 2 minutes to the gentleman from oklahoma (mr. lucas). mr. lucas. mr. speaker and colleagues, why are we here tonight? why are we compelled to engage in this process? the circumstances, perhaps, might be a little bit like 1910. do you remember 1910? a dictatorial speaker who was so totally in control and who so totally refused to accept input from the membership made himself chairman of the rules committee, too. he stymied the legislative process. he brought it to a stop. what did our predecessors do 100-plus years ago? they finally rose up together and threw him out, and they created a process by which no dictatorial chairman, no dictatorial speaker would ever be able to fully thwart the will of this body. it is amazing. that is what we are here for. it is to continue one century later the responsible actions that they put into place. now, some of my friends have asked, ``why don't we have thousands of amendments?'' think about 1910--a dictatorial speaker, a dictatorial committee chairman. under no circumstances was uncle joe going to allow any input. so, when they created this process, they had to make sure that the bill could come to the floor for consideration in a way that would not allow it to be manipulated by that same dictatorial attitude. we are operating under the present version of that rule. if we had wanted unlimited amendments, we should have spent an unlimited amount of time in the committee of jurisdiction, working on those amendments, but that opportunity never availed itself. had that opportunity availed itself, we wouldn't be here; but we are here. we have a bill that reflects, i believe--and that a majority of us in this house believes--what is in the best interest of america's workers and america's [[page h7182]] businesspeople in our competitive spirit. i simply say to you that to talk about the things we should be doing tonight that should have been done a month ago or a year ago seems most inappropriate. so, my friends, in a moment, let's honor the people who were on this floor in 1910. let's say, ``joe, you can't have your way then or now.'' let's pass the discharge; let's pass the rule; and let's get on with the bill debate. the speaker pro tempore. all time has expired. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from tennessee (mr. fincher) to discharge the committee on rules from the further consideration of house resolution 450. the question was taken; and the speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. mr. hensarling. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the vote was taken by electronic device, and there

the speaker pro tempore. the clerk will report the resolution. the clerk read the resolution, as follows: h. res. 450 resolved, that immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the house shall proceed to the consideration in the house of the bill (h.r. 597) to reauthorize the export- import bank of the united states, and for other purposes. all points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of h.r. 3611, as introduced, shall be considered as adopted. the bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. all points of order against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. the previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the committee on financial services or their respective designees; and (2) one motion to recommit with or without instructions. sec. 2. clause 1(c) of rule xix shall not apply to the consideration of h.r. 597. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from tennessee is recognized for 1 hour. mr. fincher. mr. speaker, i yield myself as much time as i may consume. mr. speaker, there has been a lot of conversation here tonight about what we are doing and how this happened and what we are going to do next. mr. speaker, the reason why we are here tonight, i didn't sign up to come to washington from frog jump, the place i live, to do discharge petitions. the reason i did come to washington was to work for my district and try to make sure that hardworking men and women all over this country and my district have jobs. mr. speaker, that is what the export-import bank does. it helps create thousands of jobs, specifically, 200,000 jobs each year. now, let me be clear because there has been a lot of misconception or misperception, whatever you want to say, about what this costs the taxpayer. mr. speaker, this is at no cost to the u.s. taxpayer. in fact, the export-import bank returned $675 million to the u.s. treasury in fiscal year 2014. in 2013, it returned more than $1 billion, mr. speaker. this is not a minority procedure, this is not a democrat procedure that is happening tonight. this is a republican-led position. this is a republican reform bill that we are doing. [[page h7183]] {time} 1930 more reforms than have been done in probably 50 years. i haven't looked specifically, but i think president reagan did a lot, and other presidents have done them. but this is about jobs, mr. speaker. think about this. we go home to our districts every weekend, and we talk to constituents every weekend. think about constituents that come up to us and say: congressman, have you balanced the budget? we say: no, we are working on it, but we haven't done it yet. i don't want to offend any of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. i am probably going to, but i don't mean it. our constituents say: well, congressman, have you repealed obamacare? i say: well, no, not yet, but we are working on it. then they look at us and they say: tell me, congressman, you have done away with the only thing that we know of that helps create thousands of jobs all over this country and possibly would help create the job that they had because of some ideology or some conservative group that is scoring a member of congress, and now i don't have a job, and i am on unemployment. mr. speaker, our constituents and hardworking americans deserve better. they deserve better than members of congress playing political games because of scorecards. i serve under one of the most principled chairmen, probably the most principled chairman in congress, and i agree with him on 99.9 percent of everything that we do in our committee. we just happen to disagree on this one issue. my chairman is passionate and principled, and i never would doubt that. mr. speaker, i won't take much more time. if america is going to get out of the hole we are in as a country, then congress must start working together. mr. speaker, we should applaud. we should be happy on the day--and i don't want to offend the gentlewoman from california who spoke earlier, but we should be happy on the day when democrats want to join republicans on legislation that helps move the country forward. they are clapping, that is awesome. we are trying to do what we think is best, and the export-import bank doesn't cost the taxpayers a dime. it helps create thousands of jobs all over this country and makes sure we don't lose thousands of jobs to 60 other countries that have these credit agencies. mr. speaker, i don't know what else to say. this is regular order, this closed rule. i am going to close in 10 seconds, but this is all about regular order. we could have had amendments. we could have had a thousand amendments in our committee, but we chose to go this route. we didn't choose it. some of us chose to go this route. we are dealing with this today. our constituents deserve better, and we have to do better. with that, mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying bill. i yield back the balance of my time, and i move the previous question on the resolution. parliamentary inquiries mr. hensarling. parliamentary inquiry, mr. speaker. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from texas will state his parliamentary inquiry. mr. hensarling. mr. speaker, the resolution before the house is h. res. 450 which, as i understand it, would establish the rule for debate on this ex-im reauthorization bill, that it does not make in order any amendments. the closed rule means that in addition to not having any debate on the rule--since all time has now been yielded back, with no other member having a chance to speak--members have been denied their chance to participate in that part of the process. my parliamentary inquiry is whether there is any way, at this juncture, for members to amend the resolution, h. res. 450, to give members an opportunity to offer amendments to the underlying ex-im reauthorization bill? the speaker pro tempore. the chair was about to put the question on ordering the previous question. if the motion for the previous question was rejected, there would be a potential for further debate on, or amendment to, house resolution 450. mr. hensarling. mr. speaker, further parliamentary inquiry. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. mr. hensarling. so, if the previous question is defeated, then a member who is opposed to the previous question would be afforded the opportunity to offer an amendment to h. res. 450 that would strike the text of the closed, no amendments rule and replace it with the text of a rule that provided for consideration of the underlying ex-im reauthorization bill through an open process, with time for debate, where any member--either republican or democrat--could offer germane amendments to the bill. is that correct, mr. speaker? the speaker pro tempore. the chair cannot respond to specific hypotheticals, but if the motion for the previous question were rejected, there would be potential for further debate on, or amendment to, house resolution 450. mr. hensarling. mr. speaker, further parliamentary inquiry. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. mr. hensarling. if the previous question is defeated, may i or any member who votes against the previous question claim time to offer such an amendment to create an open rules process for consideration of the underlying ex-im reauthorization bill where members on both sides of the aisle can offer amendments to the bill? the speaker pro tempore. the chair cannot judge that at this time. mr. hensarling. i thank the speaker. mr. mulvaney. mr. speaker, parliamentary inquiry. the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. mr. mulvaney. a few minutes ago, in reference to a question raised by the gentleman from texas, you indicated that the amendments would be in order if the motion for the previous question failed. my question is: are motions to amend in order before the motion for the previous question comes to the floor? the speaker pro tempore. the previous question has preferential standing. mr. mulvaney. mr. speaker, i have an amendment at the desk. i would like to have it heard now. the speaker pro tempore. the previous question has already been moved. mr. mulvaney. no, it hasn't. the speaker pro tempore. the chair is about to put the question on ordering the previous question on the resolution. mr. mulvaney. mr. speaker, parliamentary inquiry. who moved the previous question? the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from tennessee. mr. mulvaney. was that seconded? the speaker pro tempore. the previous question does not require a second. mr. mulvaney. mr. speaker, i have an amendment at the desk. i would simply like to ask what rule the chair is relying on in denying me the ability to bring that amendment now. the speaker pro tempore. clause 4 of rule xvi. the question is on ordering the previous question on the resolution. the question was taken; and the speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it. mr. hensarling. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this question will be postponed. ____________________",42848

CREC-2015-10-26-pt1-PgH7184-2,CREC-2015-10-26,114,RESEARCH EXCELLENCE AND ADVANCEMENTS FOR DYSLEXIA ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015)] [House] [Pages H7184-H7187] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1945 RESEARCH EXCELLENCE AND ADVANCEMENTS FOR DYSLEXIA ACT Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3033) to require the President's annual budget request to Congress each year to include a line item for the Research in Disabilities Education program of the National Science Foundation and to require the National Science Foundation to conduct research on dyslexia, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 3033 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Research Excellence and Advancements for Dyslexia Act'' or the ``READ Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) As many as one out of six, or 8,500,000, American school children may have dyslexia. (2) Since 1975, dyslexia has been included in the list of qualifying learning disabilities under the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. SEC. 3. RESEARCH IN DISABILITIES EDUCATION. (a) Program.--Nothing in this Act alters the National Science Foundation's Research in Disabilities Education program for fundamental and implementation research about learners (of all ages) with disabilities, including dyslexia, in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The National Science Foundation shall continue to encourage efforts to understand and address disability-based differences in STEM education and workforce participation, including differences for dyslexic learners. (b) Line Item.--The Director of the National Science Foundation shall include the amount requested for the Research in Disabilities Education program in the Foundation's annual congressional budget justification. SEC. 4. DYSLEXIA. (a) In General.--The National Science Foundation shall support multi-directorate, merit-reviewed, and competitively awarded research on the science of dyslexia, including research on the early identification of children and students with dyslexia, professional development for teachers and administrators of students with dyslexia, curricula and educational tools needed for children with dyslexia, and implementation and scaling of successful models of dyslexia intervention. Research supported under this subsection shall be conducted with the goal of practical application. (b) Funding.--The National Science Foundation shall devote at least $5,000,000 annually to research described in subsection (a), subject to the availability of appropriations, to come from amounts made available for the Research and Related Activities account or the Education and Human Resources Directorate. No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated under this section. This Act shall be carried out using funds otherwise appropriated by law after the date of enactment of this Act. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. General Leave Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3033, the Research Excellence and Advancements for Dyslexia Act, or READ Act, will help millions of Americans who struggle with dyslexia. It is fitting that the House considers this bill today, as October is Dyslexia Awareness Month. Dyslexia affects an estimated 8.5 million school children and 1 in 6 Americans in some form. It causes these individuals to have difficulties with reading, though they often have normal or above- average intelligence. Despite the prevalence of dyslexia, many Americans remain undiagnosed, untreated, and silently struggle at school or work. Too many children undiagnosed with dyslexia have difficulties in the classroom and sometimes drop out of school and face uncertain futures. The READ Act requires the National Science Foundation's budget to include a specific line item for the Research in Disabilities Education program. The bill requires the NSF to invest at least $5 million annually for merit-reviewed, competitively-awarded dyslexia research projects. The bill uses funds already appropriated for the NSF and does not authorize any additional spending for these priority projects. NSF research supported by the READ Act is focused on practical applications, which include the following: Early identification of children and students with dyslexia, professional development for teachers and administrators of students with dyslexia, curricula and educational tools needed for children with dyslexia, and implementation and scaling of successful models of dyslexia intervention. The House Science, Space and Technology Committee held a hearing last year on the science of dyslexia. Experts testified how research in the area of neuroscience has led to practical ways to better diagnose and deal with dyslexia but that more research is necessary. At a second committee hearing held just a few weeks ago, we heard from experts who work directly with dyslexic students and their teachers. They know firsthand about the obstacles these children, parents, and educators face, and they stress the importance of research in developing practical tools. If you can't read, it is hard to achieve. If we change the way we approach dyslexia, we can turn this disability into an opportunity for a brighter and more productive future for millions of Americans. I am a co-chair of the bipartisan Dyslexia Caucus, along with Congresswoman Julia Brownley, which is comprised of more than 100 Members of Congress. I have met hundreds of children and their parents in my congressional district in Texas and others across the U.S. who are affected by dyslexia, and they have shared their personal stories with me. One child I met recently was Eddie, a middle school student from Baltimore. He, along with his family, has been on a long journey to receive a proper diagnosis and find a supportive learning environment. After our meeting, his mother wrote me a letter explaining: ``In only 1 year, Eddie has gone from repeatedly missing recess because he would not `try harder,' a boy who would stare at his homework in defeat before he has even tried an assignment, to a boy now daring to dream of a career in the sciences.'' Eddie is very fortunate to have a mother who advocated for his proper education. He is now not only able to learn, but also to excel. His mother comments: ``He is a voracious reader and wants to join the Jet Propulsion Lab or work with NASA.'' I also have had the pleasure of meeting an Austin, Texas, resident Robbi Cooper and her son, Ben. They shared many stories with me about the hardships they have faced in their attempts to ensure Ben receives the best education possible. Ben has even taken his abilities one step further by becoming an advocate and has traveled to D.C. numerous times to lobby Congress so others can learn from his experiences. The bipartisan READ Act, which unanimously passed the Science Committee 2 weeks ago, will help ensure that all children like Eddie and Ben have the means to succeed. Nothing could be more important to them. I also want to acknowledge two young friends who are on the floor with me today, Leighton and Gipson, who have an interest in this bill too. The READ Act is a significant step in the right direction to help those with dyslexia. [[Page H7185]] Thanks go to my Dyslexia Caucus co-chair, Representative Julia Brownley, and the other cosponsors of the READ Act, such as Congressman Don Beyer, who is handling the other side of this debate tonight, for their interest and support. And I urge my other colleagues to better the lives of millions of children and adults with dyslexia. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3033, the Research Excellence and Advancements for Dyslexia Act, or the READ Act. Passing this bill is the perfect way to honor October, National Dyslexia Awareness Month. As my friend, the chairman, has said, dyslexia is a learning disorder characterized by difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words. Unfortunately, many children are not diagnosed or are diagnosed later in life, leaving them with little access to helpful interventions and technologies. Too often our educators do not have the proper training to identify students with learning disabilities, including dyslexia. This bill would fund research on the early identification of individuals with dyslexia and professional development for teachers and school administrators. There is a lack of research on curricula development and educational tools for students with dyslexia, and I am happy to report that this bill would fund that research into that as well. Finally, as we heard from our expert witnesses during the committee hearings on this topic, there is a significant gap in getting the research from the laboratories into the hands of teachers and administrators. To address this gap, we need more research on understanding which experimental innovations will be successful in the classrooms and research on how best to scale those successful interventions. Having an intervention work in the laboratory is not enough. The intervention needs to work in classroom settings, which are very heterogeneous environments. Mr. Speaker, I have a first cousin who was raised just across the river in Fairfax County. He was a most clever child because he managed to make it all the way to eighth grade before they realized that he didn't know how to read. He has had a good career, but I wonder what kind of professor or Supreme Court Justice or even rocket scientist he would have made with early intervention. Mr. Speaker, my oldest child had a passel of learning disabilities but also had and has a very high IQ. At the school he attended to address these disabilities, the walls were adorned with photos of Albert Einstein, Winston Churchill, and Thomas Edison. These remarkable men remind us of the promise of every child, that a learning disability like dyslexia need not hold a child back from an extraordinary life and an extraordinary education. This is why we need the READ Act: to help realize the promise of every child with dyslexia. On this remarkable bipartisan night, I want to thank my Texas friends, Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Johnson, for working across the aisle together to make improvements to this bill during the committee process. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank Mr. Beyer for his generous comments. It has been nice working together with him on this particular bill. I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock), who happens to be the chair of the Research and Technology Subcommittee of the full Science Committee. Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3033, the Research Excellence and Advancements for Dyslexia Act, also known as the READ Act. Coming from a family of educators and as the daughter of a librarian, I truly understand the effects a reading disability can have on children. Reading opens up such a wide world for children and for all of us, and no one should be cut off from that beautiful world that reading opens up to us. When dyslexia goes undiagnosed, it can result in struggles in the classroom and continue through into their careers as adults. Despite knowledge of the condition since the 19th century, many Americans remain undiagnosed and untreated. Given what we know today and we know the advancements we can make with research and technology, we need to make sure we are not letting that stand. In July, I joined a bipartisan group of my colleagues to cosponsor the READ Act. The bill requires the President's annual budget request to Congress to include a line item for the Research in Disabilities Education program of the National Science Foundation. It also requires the National Science Foundation to devote at least $5 million annually to dyslexia research, which would focus on best practices for early identification of children and students with dyslexia, professional development about dyslexia for teachers and administrators, and then programs development and evidence-based educational tools for children and all of those who are dealing with this. I would like to thank Chairman Smith, the committee staff, the ranking members, and everyone who supported this important bipartisan legislation. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Brownley). Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the Congressional Dyslexia Caucus, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan bill, the READ Act, which will ensure, finally, that science drives informed public policy. I want to thank Chairman Smith for his passionate leadership on this issue. Today is a day, I think, that we can all celebrate, and I want to thank him very, very much for all of his efforts. The READ Act will increase National Science Foundation research on dyslexia, including best practices on early identification and professional development for teachers and school administrators. It will also support research on the most effective teaching practices and curriculum models for students with dyslexia. The research this bill supports can make a difference, a big, big difference, in the lives of millions of American children. Learning disabilities like dyslexia and attention-related disorders affect as many as one in five children in our country. It was my daughter Hannah's struggle with dyslexia, that led me, quite frankly, to public service. Out of real frustration, I ran for my local school board because, as a parent, it was clear to me that our schools were unprepared to meet my daughter's needs and to meet the needs of students with dyslexia, and teachers had never been properly trained to identify this learning disability. After 12 years on the school board, I was elected to my State legislature. And as chair of the California Assembly on Education, I also worked to improve education for students with learning disabilities. Now, as a Member of Congress, I want to do my part at the Federal level. Across the country, many States are stepping up to this challenge. They have passed new laws to update their education codes, get assistive technology into more classrooms, and to boost teacher training. Advancements in cognitive science can teach us much more about how the brain develops and, therefore, how children learn. In closing, I want to share with everyone that my daughter is now 30 years old. She speaks three languages, and she is saving the world one life at a time in Africa. So she finally got the services she needs and is being very successful in life and following her own dreams. I also want to thank, again, the gentleman from Texas, who is my co- chair on the Dyslexia Caucus, as well as all the members of the Science Committee for their bipartisan support for the READ Act. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this very important piece of legislation. {time} 2000 Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from [[Page H7186]] Ohio (Mr. Johnson), who is a distinguished member of the Science Committee. Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. I thank the chairman. I am grateful for all the work that the Dyslexia Caucus has done to advance this very, very important piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3033, the Research Excellence and Advancements for Dyslexia, or the READ Act. This important legislation would require that the President's annual budget to Congress specifically fund the Research in Disabilities Education program at the National Science Foundation. It would also require NSF to devote at least $5 million annually to dyslexia research. You are probably going to hear multiple Members come up tonight and talk about personal stories, about how this hits so very close to home for some of us. I have a 13-year-old granddaughter in Texas, Marin Mangiaracinia. I have watched over the years as she and her mother and her dad have struggled to help try to identify the problems that she has with learning, teachers that were unprepared to diagnose, to identify the symptoms of dyslexia. Even then, once she was diagnosed and identified, having those tools and support applied consistently from one school to another or from one teacher to another is still problematic. Today Marin is a member of the National Honor Society because of the help that has been provided to her. But she still struggles. She has created a Web site on her own to draw attention to this important problem, and she is working hard to improve herself personally. I can't say enough about how proud I am of her and the many others that are afflicted with this condition. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support H.R. 3033. Mr. BEYER. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), who is a member of the Science Committee. Mr. WESTERMAN. I thank the chairman for his leadership on this issue. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in support of the READ Act. I rise as the husband of a special education teacher and not just any special education teacher, one that has a real passion for helping children with reading disabilities and one that has seen firsthand the successes that happen when research-based interventions are used with children with dyslexia. Dyslexia is the most common learning disability. It affects more than 90 percent of all individuals identified as learning disabled. It is estimated to affect one out of six U.S. schoolchildren. This learning disability causes difficulty with reading comprehension, math, and a variety of other subject areas. Students with dyslexia should receive research-based instruction so they have the best opportunity to learn and succeed in the 21st century. That is why I cosponsored the READ Act of 2015, a bill that requires the National Science Foundation to fund dyslexia research. NSF-supported research will strengthen practical interventions, including early identification of dyslexia, development of curricula, and other tools to help dyslexics. It will help identify scalable models for implementing dyslexia programs in schools. The READ Act does not increase Federal spending. It authorizes multidirectorate, merit-reviewed, and competitively awarded dyslexia projects using funds appropriated for the NSF Research and Related Activities Account and the education and human resources directorate. This bill is good for students, it is good for educators, and it is good for America. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Palazzo), who is a member of the Appropriations Committee but, more importantly, is a former member of the Science Committee. Mr. PALAZZO. I thank the gentleman from Texas, the entire Dyslexia Caucus, and also the comments from many of my colleagues tonight. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the READ Act. Dyslexia is one of the most common learning disabilities in the United States, affecting an estimated 8.5 million schoolchildren and one in six Americans in some form. Despite these statistics, millions of children go undiagnosed and millions more do not receive proper educational assistance. The READ Act addresses this problem by requiring the National Science Foundation to fund research that promotes greater awareness of how to identify students with dyslexia and how to tailor a curriculum to better fit their needs. The READ Act also aims to put more resources in the hands of parents, teachers, and students. As an original cosponsor of this bill, a member of the bipartisan Congressional Dyslexia Caucus, and as a parent who has seen firsthand the challenges facing today's dyslexic students, I firmly believe that research focused on practical applications is needed to not only help understand dyslexia, but also to afford students an education that enables them to succeed in the classroom and reach their full potential. The READ Act provides an opportunity for a brighter and more productive future for millions of Americans. For these reasons, I fully support the READ Act and encourage my colleagues to do the same. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Bucshon), who is a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and a former member of the Science Committee. Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3033, the Research Excellence and Advancements for Dyslexia Act, the READ Act. Dyslexia is a personal issue for my family. My daughter struggled to learn to read. She dreaded reading aloud in class and worrying about what her classmates thought affected her self-esteem. My wife and I had her tutored, and we had some testing. With hard work, our daughter was able to catch up and surpass her classmates. But it wasn't until high school that she was diagnosed with dyslexia. This is an important piece of legislation that dedicates specific funds to dyslexia research, including early detection. This bill will help more children get a proper diagnosis. I sometimes wonder, had my wife and I not been engaged in this process, what might have become of my daughter's academic career and what about all the other students out there who may be misdiagnosed. So I encourage my colleagues to support the READ Act. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close if the gentleman from Virginia has no more speakers. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Members on both sides of the aisle who have cosponsored the READ Act and spoken in favor of the bill. Today we can shine a light on dyslexia and help millions of Americans have a brighter and more prosperous future. I can think of no better way to honor Dyslexia Awareness Month than to pass the READ Act, a bill that will help students and individuals with dyslexia and the parents and teachers who support them in very practical ways. Jay Leno, Walt Disney, Steve Jobs, and Carol Greider, the 2009 Nobel Prize winner in medicine, among others, are some of the most recognized and brilliant creators and innovators who have struggled with dyslexia but have not let it limit them. We need to enable those with dyslexia to achieve their maximum potential. The READ Act will help accomplish this. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3033, the Research Excellence and Advancements for Dyslexia Act H.R. 3033 would require the National Science Foundation to have a line item for the Research in Disabilities Education program and to fund at least $5 million dollars a year on dyslexia research. This would include research on the early identification of individuals with dyslexia, professional development for [[Page H7187]] teachers and school administrators, curricula development and educational tools, and implementation and scaling of successful models of dyslexia intervention. I have known several people who have dyslexia. Although dyslexia is a lifelong condition, if someone gets proper diagnosis and instruction, they can succeed in school and go on to have successful careers. The National Science Foundation currently supports fundamental research across a number of scientific fields that provide a foundation for dyslexia research. Also, the National Science Foundation is a leader in educational research and funds learning science directly and indirectly related to dyslexia. A significant amount of the National Science Foundation research relevant to dyslexia is funded out of the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences Directorate and the Education and Human Resources Directorate--two important National Science Foundation Directorates that fund high-priority research. Research funded by the Biological Sciences Directorate also contributes to foundational knowledge about the neuroscience behind dyslexia. I was pleased that when this bill was considered by the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, we worked in a bipartisan manner and made several improvements to the bill, including incorporating some of the suggestions that expert witnesses had given us during Committee hearings. I want to thank my fellow Texan, Chairman Smith for working across the aisle on this bill. I support the bill and urge my colleagues to support it. Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my support for H.R. 3033, the Research Excellence and Advancements for Dyslexia (READ) Act. I would like to emphasize the importance of supporting the academic development of the 8.5 million American school children struggling with dyslexia. Before they are diagnosed, children with dyslexia often struggle in school. Early detection of dyslexia can save students and parents the frustration that occurs as a result of the student's unexpected decline in academic performance. I am fighting for increased funding of the National Science Foundation's Research in Disabilities Education to support these children and their families. Research is crucial to ensure that dyslexic children have the opportunity to reach their full potential. That is why it is vitally important to expand funding for research in all of our schools and communities. In my District, I have spoken with many parents concerned about the lack of programs designed to assist with the diagnosis and development of dyslexic children. By passing this legislation, we will continue our legacy of supporting children and families. The READ Act would require that the President's annual budget request to Congress includes a line item for the Research in Disabilities Education program of the National Science Foundation and requires the National Science Foundation to conduct research on dyslexia. In addition, the National Science Foundation would encourage efforts to understand and address disability-based differences in STEM education and workforce participation, including dyslexic learners. I am grateful that our chamber has taken this important step to ensure that dyslexic children and their families receive the support they need. I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for supporting children's education and further dedicating ourselves to serving our hard-working American families and their children. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3033, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015)] [House] [Pages H7184-H7187] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1945 RESEARCH EXCELLENCE AND ADVANCEMENTS FOR DYSLEXIA ACT Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3033) to require the President's annual budget request to Congress each year to include a line item for the Research in Disabilities Education program of the National Science Foundation and to require the National Science Foundation to conduct research on dyslexia, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 3033 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Research Excellence and Advancements for Dyslexia Act'' or the ``READ Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) As many as one out of six, or 8,500,000, American school children may have dyslexia. (2) Since 1975, dyslexia has been included in the list of qualifying learning disabilities under the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. SEC. 3. RESEARCH IN DISABILITIES EDUCATION. (a) Program.--Nothing in this Act alters the National Science Foundation's Research in Disabilities Education program for fundamental and implementation research about learners (of all ages) with disabilities, including dyslexia, in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The National Science Foundation shall continue to encourage efforts to understand and address disability-based differences in STEM education and workforce participation, including differences for dyslexic learners. (b) Line Item.--The Director of the National Science Foundation shall include the amount requested for the Research in Disabilities Education program in the Foundation's annual congressional budget justification. SEC. 4. DYSLEXIA. (a) In General.--The National Science Foundation shall support multi-directorate, merit-reviewed, and competitively awarded research on the science of dyslexia, including research on the early identification of children and students with dyslexia, professional development for teachers and administrators of students with dyslexia, curricula and educational tools needed for children with dyslexia, and implementation and scaling of successful models of dyslexia intervention. Research supported under this subsection shall be conducted with the goal of practical application. (b) Funding.--The National Science Foundation shall devote at least $5,000,000 annually to research described in subsection (a), subject to the availability of appropriations, to come from amounts made available for the Research and Related Activities account or the Education and Human Resources Directorate. No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated under this section. This Act shall be carried out using funds otherwise appropriated by law after the date of enactment of this Act. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. General Leave Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3033, the Research Excellence and Advancements for Dyslexia Act, or READ Act, will help millions of Americans who struggle with dyslexia. It is fitting that the House considers this bill today, as October is Dyslexia Awareness Month. Dyslexia affects an estimated 8.5 million school children and 1 in 6 Americans in some form. It causes these individuals to have difficulties with reading, though they often have normal or above- average intelligence. Despite the prevalence of dyslexia, many Americans remain undiagnosed, untreated, and silently struggle at school or work. Too many children undiagnosed with dyslexia have difficulties in the classroom and sometimes drop out of school and face uncertain futures. The READ Act requires the National Science Foundation's budget to include a specific line item for the Research in Disabilities Education program. The bill requires the NSF to invest at least $5 million annually for merit-reviewed, competitively-awarded dyslexia research projects. The bill uses funds already appropriated for the NSF and does not authorize any additional spending for these priority projects. NSF research supported by the READ Act is focused on practical applications, which include the following: Early identification of children and students with dyslexia, professional development for teachers and administrators of students with dyslexia, curricula and educational tools needed for children with dyslexia, and implementation and scaling of successful models of dyslexia intervention. The House Science, Space and Technology Committee held a hearing last year on the science of dyslexia. Experts testified how research in the area of neuroscience has led to practical ways to better diagnose and deal with dyslexia but that more research is necessary. At a second committee hearing held just a few weeks ago, we heard from experts who work directly with dyslexic students and their teachers. They know firsthand about the obstacles these children, parents, and educators face, and they stress the importance of research in developing practical tools. If you can't read, it is hard to achieve. If we change the way we approach dyslexia, we can turn this disability into an opportunity for a brighter and more productive future for millions of Americans. I am a co-chair of the bipartisan Dyslexia Caucus, along with Congresswoman Julia Brownley, which is comprised of more than 100 Members of Congress. I have met hundreds of children and their parents in my congressional district in Texas and others across the U.S. who are affected by dyslexia, and they have shared their personal stories with me. One child I met recently was Eddie, a middle school student from Baltimore. He, along with his family, has been on a long journey to receive a proper diagnosis and find a supportive learning environment. After our meeting, his mother wrote me a letter explaining: ``In only 1 year, Eddie has gone from repeatedly missing recess because he would not `try harder,' a boy who would stare at his homework in defeat before he has even tried an assignment, to a boy now daring to dream of a career in the sciences.'' Eddie is very fortunate to have a mother who advocated for his proper education. He is now not only able to learn, but also to excel. His mother comments: ``He is a voracious reader and wants to join the Jet Propulsion Lab or work with NASA.'' I also have had the pleasure of meeting an Austin, Texas, resident Robbi Cooper and her son, Ben. They shared many stories with me about the hardships they have faced in their attempts to ensure Ben receives the best education possible. Ben has even taken his abilities one step further by becoming an advocate and has traveled to D.C. numerous times to lobby Congress so others can learn from his experiences. The bipartisan READ Act, which unanimously passed the Science Committee 2 weeks ago, will help ensure that all children like Eddie and Ben have the means to succeed. Nothing could be more important to them. I also want to acknowledge two young friends who are on the floor with me today, Leighton and Gipson, who have an interest in this bill too.

I can't say enough about how proud I am of her and the many others that are afflicted with this condition. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support H.R. 3033. Mr. BEYER. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), who is a member of the Science Committee. Mr. WESTERMAN. I thank the chairman for his leadership on this issue. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in support of the READ Act. I rise as the husband of a special education teacher and not just any special education teacher, one that has a real passion for helping children with reading disabilities and one that has seen firsthand the successes that happen when research-based interventions are used with children with dyslexia. Dyslexia is the most common learning disability. It affects more than 90 percent of all individuals identified as learning disabled. It is estimated to affect one out of six U.S. schoolchildren. This learning disability causes difficulty with reading comprehension, math, and a variety of other subject areas. Students with dyslexia should receive research-based instruction so they have the best opportunity to learn and succeed in the 21st century. That is why I cosponsored the READ Act of 2015, a bill that requires the National Science Foundation to fund dyslexia research. NSF-supported research will strengthen practical interventions, including early identification of dyslexia, development of curricula, and other tools to help dyslexics. It will help identify scalable models for implementing dyslexia programs in schools. The READ Act does not increase Federal spending. It authorizes multidirectorate, merit-reviewed, and competitively awarded dyslexia projects using funds appropriated for the NSF Research and Related Activities Account and the education and human resources directorate. This bill is good for students, it is good for educators, and it is good for America. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Palazzo), who is a member of the Appropriations Committee but, more importantly, is a former member of the Science Committee. Mr. PALAZZO. I thank the gentleman from Texas, the entire Dyslexia Caucus, and also the comments from many of my colleagues tonight. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the READ Act. Dyslexia is one of the most common learning disabilities in the United States, affecting an estimated 8.5 million schoolchildren and one in six Americans in some form. Despite these statistics, millions of children go undiagnosed and millions more do not receive proper educational assistance. The READ Act addresses this problem by requiring the National Science Foundation to fund research that promotes greater awareness of how to identify students with dyslexia and how to tailor a curriculum to better fit their needs. The READ Act also aims to put more resources in the hands of parents, teachers, and students. As an original cosponsor of this bill, a member of the bipartisan Congressional Dyslexia Caucus, and as a parent who has seen firsthand the challenges facing today's dyslexic students, I firmly believe that research focused on practical applications is needed to not only help understand dyslexia, but also to afford students an education that enables them to succeed in the classroom and reach their full potential. The READ Act provides an opportunity for a brighter and more productive future for millions of Americans. For these reasons, I fully support the READ Act and encourage my colleagues to do the same. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Bucshon), who is a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and a former member of the Science Committee. Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3033, the Research Excellence and Advancements for Dyslexia Act, the READ Act. Dyslexia is a personal issue for my family. My daughter struggled to learn to read. She dreaded reading aloud in class and worrying about what her classmates thought affected her self-esteem. My wife and I had her tutored, and we had some testing. With hard work, our daughter was able to catch up and surpass her classmates. But it wasn't until high school that she was diagnosed with dyslexia. This is an important piece of legislation that dedicates specific funds to dyslexia research, including early detection. This bill will help more children get a proper diagnosis. I sometimes wonder, had my wife and I not been engaged in this process, what might have become of my daughter's academic career and what about all the other students out there who may be misdiagnosed. So I encourage my colleagues to support the READ Act. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close if the gentleman from Virginia has no more speakers. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Members on both sides of the aisle who have cosponsored the READ Act and spoken in favor of the bill. Today we can shine a light on dyslexia and help millions of Americans have a brighter and more prosperous future. I can think of no better way to honor Dyslexia Awareness Month than to pass the READ Act, a bill that will help students and individuals with dyslexia and the parents and teachers who support them in very practical ways. Jay Leno, Walt Disney, Steve Jobs, and Carol Greider, the 2009 Nobel Prize winner in medicine, among others, are some of the most recognized and brilliant creators and innovators who have struggled with dyslexia but have not let it limit them. We need to enable those with dyslexia to achieve their maximum potential. The READ Act will help accomplish this. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3033, the Research Excellence and Advancements for Dyslexia Act H.R. 3033 would require the National Science Foundation to have a line item for the Research in Disabilities Education program and to fund at least $5 million dollars a year on dyslexia research. This would include research on the early identification of individuals with dyslexia, professional development for [[Page H7187]] teachers and school administrators, curricula development and educational tools, and implementation and scaling of successful models of dyslexia intervention. I have known several people who have dyslexia. Although dyslexia is a lifelong condition, if someone gets proper diagnosis and instruction, they can succeed in school and go on to have successful careers. The National Science Foundation currently supports fundamental research across a number of scientific fields that provide a foundation for dyslexia research. Also, the National Science Foundation is a leader in educational research and funds learning science directly and indirectly related to dyslexia. A significant amount of the National Science Foundation research relevant to dyslexia is funded out of the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences Directorate and the Education and Human Resources Directorate--two important National Science Foundation Directorates that fund high-priority research. Research funded by the Biological Sciences Directorate also contributes to foundational knowledge about the neuroscience behind dyslexia. I was pleased that when this bill was considered by the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, we worked in a bipartisan manner and made several improvements to the bill, including incorporating some of the suggestions that expert witnesses had given us during Committee hearings. I want to thank my fellow Texan, Chairman Smith for working across the aisle on this bill. I support the bill and urge my colleagues to support it. Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my support for H.R. 3033, the Research Excellence and Advancements for Dyslexia (READ) Act. I would like to emphasize the importance of supporting the academic development of the 8.5 million American school children struggling with dyslexia. Before they are diagnosed, children with dyslexia often struggle in school. Early detection of dyslexia can save students and parents the frustration that occurs as a result of the student's unexpected decline in academic performance. I am fighting for increased funding of the National Science Foundation's Research in Disabilities Education to support these children and their families. Research is crucial to ensure that dyslexic children have the opportunity to reach their full potential. That is why it is vitally important to expand funding for research in all of our schools and communities. In my District, I have spoken with many parents concerned about the lack of programs designed to assist with the diagnosis and development of dyslexic children. By passing this legislation, we will continue our legacy of supporting children and families. The READ Act would require that the President's annual budget request to Congress includes a line item for the Research in Disabilities Education program of the National Science Foundation and requires the National Science Foundation to conduct research on dyslexia. In addition, the National Science Foundation would encourage efforts to understand and address disability-based differences in STEM education and workforce participation, including dyslexic learners. I am grateful that our chamber has taken this important step to ensure that dyslexic children and their families receive the support they need. I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for supporting children's education and further dedicating ourselves to serving our hard-working American families and their children. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3033, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015)] [House] [Pages H7184-H7187] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1945 RESEARCH EXCELLENCE AND ADVANCEMENTS FOR DYSLEXIA ACT Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3033) to require the President's annual budget request to Congress each year to include a line item for the Research in Disabilities Education program of the National Science Foundation and to require the National Science Foundation to conduct research on dyslexia, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 3033 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Research Excellence and Advancements for Dyslexia Act'' or the ``READ Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds the following: (1) As many as one out of six, or 8,500,000, American school children may have dyslexia. (2) Since 1975, dyslexia has been included in the list of qualifying learning disabilities under the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. SEC. 3. RESEARCH IN DISABILITIES EDUCATION. (a) Program.--Nothing in this Act alters the National Science Foundation's Research in Disabilities Education program for fundamental and implementation research about learners (of all ages) with disabilities, including dyslexia, in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The National Science Foundation shall continue to encourage efforts to understand and address disability-based differences in STEM education and workforce participation, including differences for dyslexic learners. (b) Line Item.--The Director of the National Science Foundation shall include the amount requested for the Research in Disabilities Education program in the Foundation's annual congressional budget justification. SEC. 4. DYSLEXIA. (a) In General.--The National Science Foundation shall support multi-directorate, merit-reviewed, and competitively awarded research on the science of dyslexia, including research on the early identification of children and students with dyslexia, professional development for teachers and administrators of students with dyslexia, curricula and educational tools needed for children with dyslexia, and implementation and scaling of successful models of dyslexia intervention. Research supported under this subsection shall be conducted with the goal of practical application. (b) Funding.--The National Science Foundation shall devote at least $5,000,000 annually to research described in subsection (a), subject to the availability of appropriations, to come from amounts made available for the Research and Related Activities account or the Education and Human Resources Directorate. No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated under this section. This Act shall be carried out using funds otherwise appropriated by law after the date of enactment of this Act. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas. General Leave Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3033, the Research Excellence and Advancements for Dyslexia Act, or READ Act, will help millions of Americans who struggle with dyslexia. It is fitting that the House considers this bill today, as October is Dyslexia Awareness Month. Dyslexia affects an estimated 8.5 million school children and 1 in 6 Americans in some form. It causes these individuals to have difficulties with reading, though they often have normal or above- average intelligence. Despite the prevalence of dyslexia, many Americans remain undiagnosed, untreated, and silently struggle at school or work. Too many children undiagnosed with dyslexia have difficulties in the classroom and sometimes drop out of school and face uncertain futures. The READ Act requires the National Science Foundation's budget to include a specific line item for the Research in Disabilities Education program. The bill requires the NSF to invest at least $5 million annually for merit-reviewed, competitively-awarded dyslexia research projects. The bill uses funds already appropriated for the NSF and does not authorize any additional spending for these priority projects. NSF research supported by the READ Act is focused on practical applications, which include the following: Early identification of children and students with dyslexia, professional development for teachers and administrators of students with dyslexia, curricula and educational tools needed for children with dyslexia, and implementation and scaling of successful models of dyslexia intervention. The House Science, Space and Technology Committee held a hearing last year on the science of dyslexia. Experts testified how research in the area of neuroscience has led to practical ways to better diagnose and deal with dyslexia but that more research is necessary. At a second committee hearing held just a few weeks ago, we heard from experts who work directly with dyslexic students and their teachers. They know firsthand about the obstacles these children, parents, and educators face, and they stress the importance of research in developing practical tools. If you can't read, it is hard to achieve. If we change the way we approach dyslexia, we can turn this disability into an opportunity for a brighter and more productive future for millions of Americans. I am a co-chair of the bipartisan Dyslexia Caucus, along with Congresswoman Julia Brownley, which is comprised of more than 100 Members of Congress. I have met hundreds of children and their parents in my congressional district in Texas and others across the U.S. who are affected by dyslexia, and they have shared their personal stories with me. One child I met recently was Eddie, a middle school student from Baltimore. He, along with his family, has been on a long journey to receive a proper diagnosis and find a supportive learning environment. After our meeting, his mother wrote me a letter explaining: ``In only 1 year, Eddie has gone from repeatedly missing recess because he would not `try harder,' a boy who would stare at his homework in defeat before he has even tried an assignment, to a boy now daring to dream of a career in the sciences.'' Eddie is very fortunate to have a mother who advocated for his proper education. He is now not only able to learn, but also to excel. His mother comments: ``He is a voracious reader and wants to join the Jet Propulsion Lab or work with NASA.'' I also have had the pleasure of meeting an Austin, Texas, resident Robbi Cooper and her son, Ben. They shared many stories with me about the hardships they have faced in their attempts to ensure Ben receives the best education possible. Ben has even taken his abilities one step further by becoming an advocate and has traveled to D.C. numerous times to lobby Congress so others can learn from his experiences. The bipartisan READ Act, which unanimously passed the Science Committee 2 weeks ago, will help ensure that all children like Eddie and Ben have the means to succeed. Nothing could be more important to them. I also want to acknowledge two young friends who are on the floor with me today, Leighton and Gipson, who have an interest in this bill too. The READ Act is a significant step in the right direction to help those with dyslexia. [[Page H7185]] Thanks go to my Dyslexia Caucus co-chair, Representative Julia Brownley, and the other cosponsors of the READ Act, such as Congressman Don Beyer, who is handling the other side of this debate tonight, for their interest and support. And I urge my other colleagues to better the lives of millions of children and adults with dyslexia. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3033, the Research Excellence and Advancements for Dyslexia Act, or the READ Act. Passing this bill is the perfect way to honor October, National Dyslexia Awareness Month. As my friend, the chairman, has said, dyslexia is a learning disorder characterized by difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words. Unfortunately, many children are not diagnosed or are diagnosed later in life, leaving them with little access to helpful interventions and technologies. Too often our educators do not have the proper training to identify students with learning disabilities, including dyslexia. This bill would fund research on the early identification of individuals with dyslexia and professional development for teachers and school administrators. There is a lack of research on curricula development and educational tools for students with dyslexia, and I am happy to report that this bill would fund that research into that as well. Finally, as we heard from our expert witnesses during the committee hearings on this topic, there is a significant gap in getting the research from the laboratories into the hands of teachers and administrators. To address this gap, we need more research on understanding which experimental innovations will be successful in the classrooms and research on how best to scale those successful interventions. Having an intervention work in the laboratory is not enough. The intervention needs to work in classroom settings, which are very heterogeneous environments. Mr. Speaker, I have a first cousin who was raised just across the river in Fairfax County. He was a most clever child because he managed to make it all the way to eighth grade before they realized that he didn't know how to read. He has had a good career, but I wonder what kind of professor or Supreme Court Justice or even rocket scientist he would have made with early intervention. Mr. Speaker, my oldest child had a passel of learning disabilities but also had and has a very high IQ. At the school he attended to address these disabilities, the walls were adorned with photos of Albert Einstein, Winston Churchill, and Thomas Edison. These remarkable men remind us of the promise of every child, that a learning disability like dyslexia need not hold a child back from an extraordinary life and an extraordinary education. This is why we need the READ Act: to help realize the promise of every child with dyslexia. On this remarkable bipartisan night, I want to thank my Texas friends, Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Johnson, for working across the aisle together to make improvements to this bill during the committee process. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank Mr. Beyer for his generous comments. It has been nice working together with him on this particular bill. I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock), who happens to be the chair of the Research and Technology Subcommittee of the full Science Committee. Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the chairman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3033, the Research Excellence and Advancements for Dyslexia Act, also known as the READ Act. Coming from a family of educators and as the daughter of a librarian, I truly understand the effects a reading disability can have on children. Reading opens up such a wide world for children and for all of us, and no one should be cut off from that beautiful world that reading opens up to us. When dyslexia goes undiagnosed, it can result in struggles in the classroom and continue through into their careers as adults. Despite knowledge of the condition since the 19th century, many Americans remain undiagnosed and untreated. Given what we know today and we know the advancements we can make with research and technology, we need to make sure we are not letting that stand. In July, I joined a bipartisan group of my colleagues to cosponsor the READ Act. The bill requires the President's annual budget request to Congress to include a line item for the Research in Disabilities Education program of the National Science Foundation. It also requires the National Science Foundation to devote at least $5 million annually to dyslexia research, which would focus on best practices for early identification of children and students with dyslexia, professional development about dyslexia for teachers and administrators, and then programs development and evidence-based educational tools for children and all of those who are dealing with this. I would like to thank Chairman Smith, the committee staff, the ranking members, and everyone who supported this important bipartisan legislation. Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Brownley). Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the Congressional Dyslexia Caucus, I rise in strong support of this bipartisan bill, the READ Act, which will ensure, finally, that science drives informed public policy. I want to thank Chairman Smith for his passionate leadership on this issue. Today is a day, I think, that we can all celebrate, and I want to thank him very, very much for all of his efforts. The READ Act will increase National Science Foundation research on dyslexia, including best practices on early identification and professional development for teachers and school administrators. It will also support research on the most effective teaching practices and curriculum models for students with dyslexia. The research this bill supports can make a difference, a big, big difference, in the lives of millions of American children. Learning disabilities like dyslexia and attention-related disorders affect as many as one in five children in our country. It was my daughter Hannah's struggle with dyslexia, that led me, quite frankly, to public service. Out of real frustration, I ran for my local school board because, as a parent, it was clear to me that our schools were unprepared to meet my daughter's needs and to meet the needs of students with dyslexia, and teachers had never been properly trained to identify this learning disability. After 12 years on the school board, I was elected to my State legislature. And as chair of the California Assembly on Education, I also worked to improve education for students with learning disabilities. Now, as a Member of Congress, I want to do my part at the Federal level. Across the country, many States are stepping up to this challenge. They have passed new laws to update their education codes, get assistive technology into more classrooms, and to boost teacher training. Advancements in cognitive science can teach us much more about how the brain develops and, therefore, how children learn. In closing, I want to share with everyone that my daughter is now 30 years old. She speaks three languages, and she is saving the world one life at a time in Africa. So she finally got the services she needs and is being very successful in life and following her own dreams. I also want to thank, again, the gentleman from Texas, who is my co- chair on the Dyslexia Caucus, as well as all the members of the Science Committee for their bipartisan support for the READ Act. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this very important piece of legislation. {time} 2000 Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from [[Page H7186]] Ohio (Mr. Johnson), who is a distinguished member of the Science Committee. Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. I thank the chairman. I am grateful for all the work that the Dyslexia Caucus has done to advance this very, very important piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3033, the Research Excellence and Advancements for Dyslexia, or the READ Act. This important legislation would require that the President's annual budget to Congress specifically fund the Research in Disabilities Education program at the National Science Foundation. It would also require NSF to devote at least $5 million annually to dyslexia research. You are probably going to hear multiple Members come up tonight and talk about personal stories, about how this hits so very close to home for some of us. I have a 13-year-old granddaughter in Texas, Marin Mangiaracinia. I have watched over the years as she and her mother and her dad have struggled to help try to identify the problems that she has with learning, teachers that were unprepared to diagnose, to identify the symptoms of dyslexia. Even then, once she was diagnosed and identified, having those tools and support applied consistently from one school to another or from one teacher to another is still problematic. Today Marin is a member of the National Honor Society because of the help that has been provided to her. But she still struggles. She has created a Web site on her own to draw attention to this important problem, and she is working hard to improve herself personally. I can't say enough about how proud I am of her and the many others that are afflicted with this condition. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support H.R. 3033. Mr. BEYER. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), who is a member of the Science Committee.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3033, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_50.csv,28037,28037,28107,"[congressional record volume 161, number 157 (monday, october 26, 2015)] [house] [pages h7184-h7187] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1945 research excellence and advancements for dyslexia act mr. smith of texas. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 3033) to require the president's annual budget request to congress each year to include a line item for the research in disabilities education program of the national science foundation and to require the national science foundation to conduct research on dyslexia, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 3033 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``research excellence and advancements for dyslexia act'' or the ``read act''. sec. 2. findings. the congress finds the following: (1) as many as one out of six, or 8,500,000, american school children may have dyslexia. (2) since 1975, dyslexia has been included in the list of qualifying learning disabilities under the education for all handicapped children act of 1975 and the individuals with disabilities education act. sec. 3. research in disabilities education. (a) program.--nothing in this act alters the national science foundation's research in disabilities education program for fundamental and implementation research about learners (of all ages) with disabilities, including dyslexia, in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (stem). the national science foundation shall continue to encourage efforts to understand and address disability-based differences in stem education and workforce participation, including differences for dyslexic learners. (b) line item.--the director of the national science foundation shall include the amount requested for the research in disabilities education program in the foundation's annual congressional budget justification. sec. 4. dyslexia.

there was no objection. mr. smith of texas. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, h.r. 3033, the research excellence and advancements for dyslexia act, or read act, will help millions of americans who struggle with dyslexia. it is fitting that the house considers this bill today, as october is dyslexia awareness month. dyslexia affects an estimated 8.5 million school children and 1 in 6 americans in some form. it causes these individuals to have difficulties with reading, though they often have normal or above- average intelligence. despite the prevalence of dyslexia, many americans remain undiagnosed, untreated, and silently struggle at school or work. too many children undiagnosed with dyslexia have difficulties in the classroom and sometimes drop out of school and face uncertain futures. the read act requires the national science foundation's budget to include a specific line item for the research in disabilities education program. the bill requires the nsf to invest at least $5 million annually for merit-reviewed, competitively-awarded dyslexia research projects. the bill uses funds already appropriated for the nsf and does not authorize any additional spending for these priority projects. nsf research supported by the read act is focused on practical applications, which include the following: early identification of children and students with dyslexia, professional development for teachers and administrators of students with dyslexia, curricula and educational tools needed for children with dyslexia, and implementation and scaling of successful models of dyslexia intervention. the house science, space and technology committee held a hearing last year on the science of dyslexia. experts testified how research in the area of neuroscience has led to practical ways to better diagnose and deal with dyslexia but that more research is necessary. at a second committee hearing held just a few weeks ago, we heard from experts who work directly with dyslexic students and their teachers. they know firsthand about the obstacles these children, parents, and educators face, and they stress the importance of research in developing practical tools. if you can't read, it is hard to achieve. if we change the way we approach dyslexia, we can turn this disability into an opportunity for a brighter and more productive future for millions of americans. i am a co-chair of the bipartisan dyslexia caucus, along with congresswoman julia brownley, which is comprised of more than 100 members of congress. i have met hundreds of children and their parents in my congressional district in texas and others across the u.s. who are affected by dyslexia, and they have shared their personal stories with me. one child i met recently was eddie, a middle school student from baltimore. he, along with his family, has been on a long journey to receive a proper diagnosis and find a supportive learning environment. after our meeting, his mother wrote me a letter explaining: ``in only 1 year, eddie has gone from repeatedly missing recess because he would not `try harder,' a boy who would stare at his homework in defeat before he has even tried an assignment, to a boy now daring to dream of a career in the sciences.'' eddie is very fortunate to have a mother who advocated for his proper education. he is now not only able to learn, but also to excel. his mother comments: ``he is a voracious reader and wants to join the jet propulsion lab or work with nasa.'' i also have had the pleasure of meeting an austin, texas, resident robbi cooper and her son, ben. they shared many stories with me about the hardships they have faced in their attempts to ensure ben receives the best education possible. ben has even taken his abilities one step further by becoming an advocate and has traveled to d.c. numerous times to lobby congress so others can learn from his experiences. the bipartisan read act, which unanimously passed the science committee 2 weeks ago, will help ensure that all children like eddie and ben have the means to succeed. nothing could be more important to them. i also want to acknowledge two young friends who are on the floor with me today, leighton and gipson, who have an interest in this bill too. the read act is a significant step in the right direction to help those with dyslexia. [[page h7185]] thanks go to my dyslexia caucus co-chair, representative julia brownley, and the other cosponsors of the read act, such as congressman don beyer, who is handling the other side of this debate tonight, for their interest and support. and i urge my other colleagues to better the lives of millions of children and adults with dyslexia. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. beyer. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 3033, the research excellence and advancements for dyslexia act, or the read act. passing this bill is the perfect way to honor october, national dyslexia awareness month. as my friend, the chairman, has said, dyslexia is a learning disorder characterized by difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words. unfortunately, many children are not diagnosed or are diagnosed later in life, leaving them with little access to helpful interventions and technologies. too often our educators do not have the proper training to identify students with learning disabilities, including dyslexia. this bill would fund research on the early identification of individuals with dyslexia and professional development for teachers and school administrators. there is a lack of research on curricula development and educational tools for students with dyslexia, and i am happy to report that this bill would fund that research into that as well. finally, as we heard from our expert witnesses during the committee hearings on this topic, there is a significant gap in getting the research from the laboratories into the hands of teachers and administrators. to address this gap, we need more research on understanding which experimental innovations will be successful in the classrooms and research on how best to scale those successful interventions. having an intervention work in the laboratory is not enough. the intervention needs to work in classroom settings, which are very heterogeneous environments. mr. speaker, i have a first cousin who was raised just across the river in fairfax county. he was a most clever child because he managed to make it all the way to eighth grade before they realized that he didn't know how to read. he has had a good career, but i wonder what kind of professor or supreme court justice or even rocket scientist he would have made with early intervention. mr. speaker, my oldest child had a passel of learning disabilities but also had and has a very high iq. at the school he attended to address these disabilities, the walls were adorned with photos of albert einstein, winston churchill, and thomas edison. these remarkable men remind us of the promise of every child, that a learning disability like dyslexia need not hold a child back from an extraordinary life and an extraordinary education. this is why we need the read act: to help realize the promise of every child with dyslexia. on this remarkable bipartisan night, i want to thank my texas friends, chairman smith and ranking member johnson, for working across the aisle together to make improvements to this bill during the committee process. i am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill, and i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. smith of texas. mr. speaker, first of all, i would like to thank mr. beyer for his generous comments. it has been nice working together with him on this particular bill. i yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from virginia (mrs. comstock), who happens to be the chair of the research and technology subcommittee of the full science committee. mrs. comstock. i thank the chairman for yielding. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h.r. 3033, the research excellence and advancements for dyslexia act, also known as the read act. coming from a family of educators and as the daughter of a librarian, i truly understand the effects a reading disability can have on children. reading opens up such a wide world for children and for all of us, and no one should be cut off from that beautiful world that reading opens up to us. when dyslexia goes undiagnosed, it can result in struggles in the classroom and continue through into their careers as adults. despite knowledge of the condition since the 19th century, many americans remain undiagnosed and untreated. given what we know today and we know the advancements we can make with research and technology, we need to make sure we are not letting that stand. in july, i joined a bipartisan group of my colleagues to cosponsor the read act. the bill requires the president's annual budget request to congress to include a line item for the research in disabilities education program of the national science foundation. it also requires the national science foundation to devote at least $5 million annually to dyslexia research, which would focus on best practices for early identification of children and students with dyslexia, professional development about dyslexia for teachers and administrators, and then programs development and evidence-based educational tools for children and all of those who are dealing with this. i would like to thank chairman smith, the committee staff, the ranking members, and everyone who supported this important bipartisan legislation. mr. beyer. mr. speaker, i yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from california (ms. brownley). ms. brownley of california. mr. speaker, as co-chair of the congressional dyslexia caucus, i rise in strong support of this bipartisan bill, the read act, which will ensure, finally, that science drives informed public policy. i want to thank chairman smith for his passionate leadership on this issue. today is a day, i think, that we can all celebrate, and i want to thank him very, very much for all of his efforts. the read act will increase national science foundation research on dyslexia, including best practices on early identification and professional development for teachers and school administrators. it will also support research on the most effective teaching practices and curriculum models for students with dyslexia. the research this bill supports can make a difference, a big, big difference, in the lives of millions of american children. learning disabilities like dyslexia and attention-related disorders affect as many as one in five children in our country. it was my daughter hannah's struggle with dyslexia, that led me, quite frankly, to public service. out of real frustration, i ran for my local school board because, as a parent, it was clear to me that our schools were unprepared to meet my daughter's needs and to meet the needs of students with dyslexia, and teachers had never been properly trained to identify this learning disability. after 12 years on the school board, i was elected to my state legislature. and as chair of the california assembly on education, i also worked to improve education for students with learning disabilities. now, as a member of congress, i want to do my part at the federal level. across the country, many states are stepping up to this challenge. they have passed new laws to update their education codes, get assistive technology into more classrooms, and to boost teacher training. advancements in cognitive science can teach us much more about how the brain develops and, therefore, how children learn. in closing, i want to share with everyone that my daughter is now 30 years old. she speaks three languages, and she is saving the world one life at a time in africa. so she finally got the services she needs and is being very successful in life and following her own dreams. i also want to thank, again, the gentleman from texas, who is my co- chair on the dyslexia caucus, as well as all the members of the science committee for their bipartisan support for the read act. i urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this very important piece of legislation. {time} 2000 mr. smith of texas. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from [[page h7186]] ohio (mr. johnson), who is a distinguished member of the science committee. mr. johnson of ohio. i thank the chairman. i am grateful for all the work that the dyslexia caucus has done to advance this very, very important piece of legislation. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 3033, the research excellence and advancements for dyslexia, or the read act. this important legislation would require that the president's annual budget to congress specifically fund the research in disabilities education program at the national science foundation. it would also require nsf to devote at least $5 million annually to dyslexia research. you are probably going to hear multiple members come up tonight and talk about personal stories, about how this hits so very close to home for some of us. i have a 13-year-old granddaughter in texas, marin mangiaracinia. i have watched over the years as she and her mother and her dad have struggled to help try to identify the problems that she has with learning, teachers that were unprepared to diagnose, to identify the symptoms of dyslexia. even then, once she was diagnosed and identified, having those tools and support applied consistently from one school to another or from one teacher to another is still problematic. today marin is a member of the national honor society because of the help that has been provided to her. but she still struggles. she has created a web site on her own to draw attention to this important problem, and she is working hard to improve herself personally. i can't say enough about how proud i am of her and the many others that are afflicted with this condition. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support h.r. 3033. mr. beyer. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. smith of texas. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from arkansas (mr. westerman), who is a member of the science committee. mr. westerman. i thank the chairman for his leadership on this issue. mr. speaker, i rise tonight in support of the read act. i rise as the husband of a special education teacher and not just any special education teacher, one that has a real passion for helping children with reading disabilities and one that has seen firsthand the successes that happen when research-based interventions are used with children with dyslexia. dyslexia is the most common learning disability. it affects more than 90 percent of all individuals identified as learning disabled. it is estimated to affect one out of six u.s. schoolchildren. this learning disability causes difficulty with reading comprehension, math, and a variety of other subject areas. students with dyslexia should receive research-based instruction so they have the best opportunity to learn and succeed in the 21st century. that is why i cosponsored the read act of 2015, a bill that requires the national science foundation to fund dyslexia research. nsf-supported research will strengthen practical interventions, including early identification of dyslexia, development of curricula, and other tools to help dyslexics. it will help identify scalable models for implementing dyslexia programs in schools. the read act does not increase federal spending. it authorizes multidirectorate, merit-reviewed, and competitively awarded dyslexia projects using funds appropriated for the nsf research and related activities account and the education and human resources directorate. this bill is good for students, it is good for educators, and it is good for america. mr. beyer. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. smith of texas. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from mississippi (mr. palazzo), who is a member of the appropriations committee but, more importantly, is a former member of the science committee. mr. palazzo. i thank the gentleman from texas, the entire dyslexia caucus, and also the comments from many of my colleagues tonight. mr. speaker, i rise in support of the read act. dyslexia is one of the most common learning disabilities in the united states, affecting an estimated 8.5 million schoolchildren and one in six americans in some form. despite these statistics, millions of children go undiagnosed and millions more do not receive proper educational assistance. the read act addresses this problem by requiring the national science foundation to fund research that promotes greater awareness of how to identify students with dyslexia and how to tailor a curriculum to better fit their needs. the read act also aims to put more resources in the hands of parents, teachers, and students. as an original cosponsor of this bill, a member of the bipartisan congressional dyslexia caucus, and as a parent who has seen firsthand the challenges facing today's dyslexic students, i firmly believe that research focused on practical applications is needed to not only help understand dyslexia, but also to afford students an education that enables them to succeed in the classroom and reach their full potential. the read act provides an opportunity for a brighter and more productive future for millions of americans. for these reasons, i fully support the read act and encourage my colleagues to do the same. mr. beyer. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. smith of texas. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from indiana (mr. bucshon), who is a member of the energy and commerce committee and a former member of the science committee. mr. bucshon. mr. speaker, i rise today in support of h.r. 3033, the research excellence and advancements for dyslexia act, the read act. dyslexia is a personal issue for my family. my daughter struggled to learn to read. she dreaded reading aloud in class and worrying about what her classmates thought affected her self-esteem. my wife and i had her tutored, and we had some testing. with hard work, our daughter was able to catch up and surpass her classmates. but it wasn't until high school that she was diagnosed with dyslexia. this is an important piece of legislation that dedicates specific funds to dyslexia research, including early detection. this bill will help more children get a proper diagnosis. i sometimes wonder, had my wife and i not been engaged in this process, what might have become of my daughter's academic career and what about all the other students out there who may be misdiagnosed. so i encourage my colleagues to support the read act. mr. beyer. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. smith of texas. mr. speaker, i am prepared to close if the gentleman from virginia has no more speakers. mr. beyer. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. smith of texas. mr. speaker, i yield myself the balance of my time to close. mr. speaker, i thank the members on both sides of the aisle who have cosponsored the read act and spoken in favor of the bill. today we can shine a light on dyslexia and help millions of americans have a brighter and more prosperous future. i can think of no better way to honor dyslexia awareness month than to pass the read act, a bill that will help students and individuals with dyslexia and the parents and teachers who support them in very practical ways. jay leno, walt disney, steve jobs, and carol greider, the 2009 nobel prize winner in medicine, among others, are some of the most recognized and brilliant creators and innovators who have struggled with dyslexia but have not let it limit them. we need to enable those with dyslexia to achieve their maximum potential. the read act will help accomplish this. i yield back the balance of my time. ms. eddie bernice johnson of texas. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 3033, the research excellence and advancements for dyslexia act h.r. 3033 would require the national science foundation to have a line item for the research in disabilities education program and to fund at least $5 million dollars a year on dyslexia research. this would include research on the early identification of individuals with dyslexia, professional development for [[page h7187]] teachers and school administrators, curricula development and educational tools, and implementation and scaling of successful models of dyslexia intervention. i have known several people who have dyslexia. although dyslexia is a lifelong condition, if someone gets proper diagnosis and instruction, they can succeed in school and go on to have successful careers. the national science foundation currently supports fundamental research across a number of scientific fields that provide a foundation for dyslexia research. also, the national science foundation is a leader in educational research and funds learning science directly and indirectly related to dyslexia. a significant amount of the national science foundation research relevant to dyslexia is funded out of the social, behavioral, and economic sciences directorate and the education and human resources directorate--two important national science foundation directorates that fund high-priority research. research funded by the biological sciences directorate also contributes to foundational knowledge about the neuroscience behind dyslexia. i was pleased that when this bill was considered by the house science, space, and technology committee, we worked in a bipartisan manner and made several improvements to the bill, including incorporating some of the suggestions that expert witnesses had given us during committee hearings. i want to thank my fellow texan, chairman smith for working across the aisle on this bill. i support the bill and urge my colleagues to support it. mrs. lawrence. mr. speaker, i rise today to urge my support for h.r. 3033, the research excellence and advancements for dyslexia (read) act. i would like to emphasize the importance of supporting the academic development of the 8.5 million american school children struggling with dyslexia. before they are diagnosed, children with dyslexia often struggle in school. early detection of dyslexia can save students and parents the frustration that occurs as a result of the student's unexpected decline in academic performance. i am fighting for increased funding of the national science foundation's research in disabilities education to support these children and their families. research is crucial to ensure that dyslexic children have the opportunity to reach their full potential. that is why it is vitally important to expand funding for research in all of our schools and communities. in my district, i have spoken with many parents concerned about the lack of programs designed to assist with the diagnosis and development of dyslexic children. by passing this legislation, we will continue our legacy of supporting children and families. the read act would require that the president's annual budget request to congress includes a line item for the research in disabilities education program of the national science foundation and requires the national science foundation to conduct research on dyslexia. in addition, the national science foundation would encourage efforts to understand and address disability-based differences in stem education and workforce participation, including dyslexic learners. i am grateful that our chamber has taken this important step to ensure that dyslexic children and their families receive the support they need. i want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for supporting children's education and further dedicating ourselves to serving our hard-working american families and their children. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from texas (mr. smith) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 3033, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. a motion to reconsider

Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, we lost a good man, mentor, and coach this past weekend with the passing of Flip Saunders. While the veteran NBA coach grew up in the Cleveland, Ohio, area, he will forever be a true Minnesotan to many of us. It started with his career as a player at the University of Minnesota, where he started over 100 games for the Golden Gophers. After his playing career was over, he began his coaching career at Golden Valley Lutheran College before working his way up to the NBA. Flip coached the Minnesota Timberwolves to their first winning season, their first playoff appearance, and to an appearance in the Western Conference finals. More than accolades, though, Flip was a mentor to many. The outpouring of grief from players, coaches, sportswriters, and fans shows just what he meant to those who knew him. Mr. Speaker, Flip Saunders was a basketball icon in Minnesota, and he will be greatly missed. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Debbie and their four children. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015)] [House] [Page H7187] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] REMEMBERING COACH FLIP SAUNDERS (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)

Experts say the tools in the bipartisan cybersecurity bill the Senate voted to advance can help prevent future attacks through the sharing of information between the public and private sectors. The legislation's voluntary information sharing provisions are key to protecting the personal information of the people we all represent. The bill has also been carefully examined by Senators of both parties and contains important measures to protect civil liberties and individual privacy. I thank Chairman Burr and Vice Chairman Feinstein of the Intelligence Committee for their hard work on the bipartisan bill. We will consider a variety of amendments from both sides of the aisle tomorrow. After that, we can take a final vote on the underlying bill. That will be the Senate's initial focus this week.

CREC-2015-10-26-pt1-PgS7480,CREC-2015-10-26,114,PRESIDENTIAL FLAG AND SEAL ANNIVERSARY,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7480-S7481] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PRESIDENTIAL FLAG AND SEAL ANNIVERSARY Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise today to commemorate an important but largely unheralded anniversary. Seventy years ago yesterday, President Harry Truman changed the design of the Presidential flag and seal. That moment, which is a small moment in the grand scope of American history, was nevertheless very symbolic. I would like to discuss it. First, some context on President Truman. Truman was a great wartime President. He fought bravely in World War I in France, and then he had to make very momentous decisions at the close of World War II. Some would argue, and I think properly, that the decision on whether to use atomic weapons at Hiroshima and Nagasaki might have been the single most momentous decision ever made by a President. He wasn't even aware of the Manhattan Project and the development of the atomic weapons program until FDR died in April of 1945 and within a very few months had to make the decision whether to use those weapons against Japan. Nobody would question or challenge whether Harry Truman was a softy. In fact, even after World War II, in March of 1947, America was war- weary, but he went to Congress and in an address to Congress said that we need to continue to provide military and economic support to nations that are battling against Soviet influence. In this case, it was the nations of Greece and Turkey. That began the Truman doctrine, the basic strategic principle whereby the United States, for the next 40 years, would sort of check off efforts by the Soviet Union to expand their influence. Harry Truman was a great wartime President. Harry Truman did something on October 25, 1945, that was most unusual. He called the press into his office and said: Look what I have done. He unveiled the fact that he had taken the seal and flag of the Presidency of the United States and redesigned them. That design is essentially the same today with the exception that two stars were added for the States of Alaska and Hawaii that came in after the Truman Presidency. The seal of the President, as everybody knows--if we look around the Chamber, we can see some up on the wall here--was originally an eagle, and the eagle has two claws. In one set of claws the eagle is grasping the arrows of war, and in the other set of claws, the eagle is grasping the olive branches of peace and diplomacy. Prior to the Truman Presidency, the eagle faced toward the arrows of war. Harry Truman, this great wartime President, changed the seal so the olive branches of diplomacy would be in the right claw, the sort of preserved position, and the eagle would be facing toward the olive branches. When he did this he said: ``This new flag faces the eagle toward the staff, which is looking to the front all of the time when you are on the march, and also has it looking at the olive branch for peace, instead of the arrows of war.'' Truman biographer David McCullough stated that Truman meant the shift in the eagle's gaze to be seen as symbolic of a nation that was on the march and dedicated to peace and diplomacy. Significantly, right around the same time President Truman did something else that was notable and symbolical. He renamed the Department we think of as the Pentagon from the Department of War to the Department of Defense, also symbolic of the Nation's postwar dedication to peace. While we want to be the strongest--and we are the strongest military nation in the world, as the Presiding Officer knows so very well--we want to always suggest to the world that our interest is not primarily war; no, our interest is peace and prosperity for all. We always have to preserve and advance America's military strength because we know the connection. Sometimes the better your military strength, the more successful you can be diplomatically, but it is also the case that the strength of your diplomacy can also add to the credibility of your military might. I wish to talk quickly about the olive branches of peace and diplomacy and then the arrows of war. America has a great diplomatic tradition. Let's talk about recent Presidential history. President Truman went to Congress and said: Let's spend, in today's dollars, tens of billions of dollars to rebuild the economies of Japan and Germany, the two nations that had been at war against the United States. Germany had been engaged in two wars with the United States in the previous 30 years. Japan had invaded the United States at Pearl Harbor, but President Truman said: Tomorrow is more important than yesterday. Let's spend dollars to rebuild these economies. It was controversial when he proposed it, but the Marshall Plan ended up being one of the most successful things the United States has done from a foreign policy perspective. Right after the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, President Kennedy engaged in negotiations with the Soviet Union to reduce the nuclear threat, and the result was an agreement in 1963 to ban atmospheric nuclear tests, the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. President Reagan was actively engaged in trying to undermine the power of the Soviet Union and communism, but during those very vigorous and aggressive activities, he was also negotiating with the Soviet Union on arms control agreements. Probably the paramount example of that during the Reagan Presidency was the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 1987 that he successfully negotiated. I happen to believe that history is going to judge the recent Iran nuclear deal in the same way. It is an effort to make tomorrow more important than yesterday and to find--even in the midst of significant challenges between the United States and Iran--a way to reduce nuclear tension. Diplomacy is always a judgment where we should try to let go some of the baggage of the past and see if we can find a better way to tomorrow. I am a little bit worried that the Truman legacy of putting peace and diplomacy first is fraying in this body and maybe nationally. I hope by bringing to mind this anniversary today, it will remind us of our great diplomatic history and the power of our diplomatic principles. A number of times in recent years we have seen bits of evidence of a fraying commitment to diplomacy in this Chamber, in my view. One of the great Truman institutions was the International Monetary Fund which was designed to help nations work together on economic and monetary policy issues. It is a great global institution. When you set up an institution like that in the 1940s, the challenge is that when new nations emerge and rise, how do you incorporate nations that are newly powerful into the Fund? The most recent and challenging example has been the nation of China. As China has gotten more and more important, there were many who advised us to bring China more closely into the Fund so they could assist nations throughout the world, but Congress refused to change the bylaws of the IMF to give China proportionate responsibility given its population and the strength of its economy. What did China do after we would not change the bylaws to allow them a proportionate place at the table? China established their own development bank completely separate from the IMF. There is a debate going on right now in Congress about whether we should reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank--now, this dates back to FDR's Presidency--a premier institution that helps American companies find export markets abroad. Again, it is part of our broad diplomatic effort in outreach, and suddenly it is controversial after 80 years. There are a number of U.N. treaties that we could profitably advance our interests on. The U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, if the United States had ratified that, we would have an additional diplomatic tool to challenge Chinese island building in the South China Sea. The U.N. treaty on the rights of women and on the rights of those with disabilities are treaties that would, frankly, reflect American values and American principles because we are the leaders in the world in these areas, and yet we will not ratify these treaties. The prospect of trade deals is much less popular in Congress than they were 15 years ago. Trade is going to happen, the question is whether the United States will play a leadership [[Page S7481]] role in writing the rules, and if we step back and don't play a leadership role, some other nations will, but these are getting more and more complicated in this body. Finally, something I feel very strongly about is that it is hard to face the world with this strong diplomatic might when there are a lot of ambassadorial positions that are vacant. Especially in the last 6 or 7 years we have seen efforts to block or delay ambassadorial appointments that have left key posts in many nations around the world vacant. It sends a message to other countries. When they look at us, as the United States, not putting an ambassador in place, they basically conclude that the United States may not think we are important, and that is a very bad signal to send to other nations, especially when many nations that are allies have been without ambassadors for a while. I am hoping we can reembrace on this 70th anniversary the wisdom of Truman, who said: The nation has to be vigorous and forceful and look toward diplomacy first. With respect to the arrows of war--I am on the Armed Services Committee, and just like President Truman, I prefer diplomacy. I think we should lead with diplomacy, but we have to be willing to use military force. I voted for military force twice during my 3 years in the Senate. In 2013, in August, the President asked us to vote for military force against Syria to punish Bashar al-Assad for using chemical weapons against civilians. The only vote that was taken in either House was a vote in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I voted for it with a kind of foreboding and heavy heart because I knew there would be Virginians, some of whom I might know, who would be affected, but nevertheless I thought it was an important principle for America to stand for. Since September of 2014, I have also been pushing to have Congress cast a vote to authorize the war against ISIL that has been going on for 15 months. There is a lot of critique in this body--and I have critique--about the way that war is being waged about strategic decisions that the President is undertaking with respect to the war, but I think at the end of the day it is hard to just be a critic. Under article I of the Constitution, it is supposed to be Congress that authorizes war rather than a President just doing it on his own. Earlier I mentioned how the Truman olive branches of diplomacy and arrows of war reinforce one another. Obviously, you can be a stronger negotiator at the table in advancing a diplomatic solution if people understand that you have significant military capacity and the willingness to use it in the appropriate instance. The more we can do and the better we can do to empower or military through wise budgeting, for example--as we hope to find an end to sequester and a path forward--the stronger we will make our diplomatic effort. Similarly, the reverse is also true. The more we are vigorous in going after diplomacy, the more moral credibility we have in those instances where we can say, when looking at the world, looking at our citizens, and looking at our own troops, that we now think we need to take military action and we have exhausted the diplomatic alternatives first. That improves the moral credibility behind a military effort. It enables us to make the case better to all about the need for a military effort, and often it even creates a better international justification for a military effort. I believe the Presiding Officer and I were together last week when former Secretary Gates testified before the Armed Services Committee. It was one of the best bits of testimony I have seen in my time in the Senate. He had a word of caution for us. He said: ``While it is tempting to assert that the challenges facing the United States internationally have never been more numerous or complex, the reality is that turbulent, unstable and unpredictable times have recurred to challenge U.S. leaders regularly since World War II.'' We do live in a very complex and challenging world, where we see challenges that are known but also many unpredictable challenges. Other leaders of this country, since our first days, have lived in worlds that looked equally as challenging and confusing to them. We are true to our best traditions if the United States does what Truman so emblematically suggested we should do and we push in a vigorous and creative way all of the diplomatic tools at our disposal, and that involves diplomacy, but it also involves trade and humanitarian assistance. The United States is one of the most generous nations in the world. The strength of our moral example is something that stands as so important. If you live in a nation where journalists are being put in jail, the U.S. freedom of the press stands as a moral example. If you live in a nation where people are prosecuted because of their sexual orientation, the United States stands as a great moral example. We are not exemplary in everything. We have room to improve in everything, but we are exemplary in so many things. People around the world still look at us, and that is in fact a diplomatic area of importance. Let's be exemplary and stand for the principles we expose. Finally, I will say this. So many of the challenges we are facing now are challenges that at the end of the day are about diplomatic solutions. In the Armed Services or the Foreign Relations Committees, we are often talking about the vexing conundrum and humanitarian disaster in Syria, but at the end of the day we hear it has to be about a political solution to the civil war. There has to be a political solution to the conflict in Yemen. There has to be a political solution to the decades-long conflict between the Taliban and the Afghanistan Government. To find a political solution, you have to have strong diplomacy. Military action will not be enough to forge a political consensus moving forward. Ultimately, this was the message of what Harry Truman did 70 years ago. This strong wartime President, who made some of the toughest decisions that have ever been made by anybody in the Oval Office, recognized that America was a great nation because when push came to shove, we would prefer, push, and advocate for diplomacy first knowing that we would be militarily strong if we needed to be. It is my hope that we in Congress will take a lesson from that anniversary and continue to pursue that same path. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.

When they look at us, as the United States, not putting an ambassador in place, they basically conclude that the United States may not think we are important, and that is a very bad signal to send to other nations, especially when many nations that are allies have been without ambassadors for a while. I am hoping we can reembrace on this 70th anniversary the wisdom of Truman, who said: The nation has to be vigorous and forceful and look toward diplomacy first. With respect to the arrows of war--I am on the Armed Services Committee, and just like President Truman, I prefer diplomacy. I think we should lead with diplomacy, but we have to be willing to use military force. I voted for military force twice during my 3 years in the Senate. In 2013, in August, the President asked us to vote for military force against Syria to punish Bashar al-Assad for using chemical weapons against civilians. The only vote that was taken in either House was a vote in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I voted for it with a kind of foreboding and heavy heart because I knew there would be Virginians, some of whom I might know, who would be affected, but nevertheless I thought it was an important principle for America to stand for. Since September of 2014, I have also been pushing to have Congress cast a vote to authorize the war against ISIL that has been going on for 15 months. There is a lot of critique in this body--and I have critique--about the way that war is being waged about strategic decisions that the President is undertaking with respect to the war, but I think at the end of the day it is hard to just be a critic. Under article I of the Constitution, it is supposed to be Congress that authorizes war rather than a President just doing it on his own. Earlier I mentioned how the Truman olive branches of diplomacy and arrows of war reinforce one another. Obviously, you can be a stronger negotiator at the table in advancing a diplomatic solution if people understand that you have significant military capacity and the willingness to use it in the appropriate instance. The more we can do and the better we can do to empower or military through wise budgeting, for example--as we hope to find an end to sequester and a path forward--the stronger we will make our diplomatic effort. Similarly, the reverse is also true. The more we are vigorous in going after diplomacy, the more moral credibility we have in those instances where we can say, when looking at the world, looking at our citizens, and looking at our own troops, that we now think we need to take military action and we have exhausted the diplomatic alternatives first. That improves the moral credibility behind a military effort. It enables us to make the case better to all about the need for a military effort, and often it even creates a better international justification for a military effort. I believe the Presiding Officer and I were together last week when former Secretary Gates testified before the Armed Services Committee. It was one of the best bits of testimony I have seen in my time in the Senate. He had a word of caution for us. He said: ``While it is tempting to assert that the challenges facing the United States internationally have never been more numerous or complex, the reality is that turbulent, unstable and unpredictable times have recurred to challenge U.S. leaders regularly since World War II.'' We do live in a very complex and challenging world, where we see challenges that are known but also many unpredictable challenges. Other leaders of this country, since our first days, have lived in worlds that looked equally as challenging and confusing to them. We are true to our best traditions if the United States does what Truman so emblematically suggested we should do and we push in a vigorous and creative way all of the diplomatic tools at our disposal, and that involves diplomacy, but it also involves trade and humanitarian assistance. The United States is one of the most generous nations in the world. The strength of our moral example is something that stands as so important. If you live in a nation where journalists are being put in jail, the U.S. freedom of the press stands as a moral example. If you live in a nation where people are prosecuted because of their sexual orientation, the United States stands as a great moral example. We are not exemplary in everything. We have room to improve in everything, but we are exemplary in so many things. People around the world still look at us, and that is in fact a diplomatic area of importance. Let's be exemplary and stand for the principles we expose. Finally, I will say this. So many of the challenges we are facing now are challenges that at the end of the day are about diplomatic solutions. In the Armed Services or the Foreign Relations Committees, we are often talking about the vexing conundrum and humanitarian disaster in Syria, but at the end of the day we hear it has to be about a political solution to the civil war. There has to be a political solution to the conflict in Yemen. There has to be a political solution to the decades-long conflict between the Taliban and the Afghanistan Government. To find a political solution, you have to have strong diplomacy. Military action will not be enough to forge a political consensus moving forward. Ultimately, this was the message of what Harry Truman did 70 years ago. This strong wartime President, who made some of the toughest decisions that have ever been made by anybody in the Oval Office, recognized that America was a great nation because when push came to shove, we would prefer, push, and advocate for diplomacy first knowing that we would be militarily strong if we needed to be. It is my hope that we in Congress will take a lesson from that anniversary and continue to pursue that same path. With that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.

Madam President, I rise today to commemorate an important but largely unheralded anniversary. Seventy years ago yesterday, President Harry Truman changed the design of the Presidential flag and seal. That moment, which is a small moment in the grand scope of American history, was nevertheless very symbolic. I would like to discuss it. First, some context on President Truman. Truman was a great wartime President. He fought bravely in World War I in France, and then he had to make very momentous decisions at the close of World War II. Some would argue, and I think properly, that the decision on whether to use atomic weapons at Hiroshima and Nagasaki might have been the single most momentous decision ever made by a President. He wasn't even aware of the Manhattan Project and the development of the atomic weapons program until FDR died in April of 1945 and within a very few months had to make the decision whether to use those weapons against Japan. Nobody would question or challenge whether Harry Truman was a softy. In fact, even after World War II, in March of 1947, America was war- weary, but he went to Congress and in an address to Congress said that we need to continue to provide military and economic support to nations that are battling against Soviet influence. In this case, it was the nations of Greece and Turkey. That began the Truman doctrine, the basic strategic principle whereby the United States, for the next 40 years, would sort of check off efforts by the Soviet Union to expand their influence. Harry Truman was a great wartime President. Harry Truman did something on October 25, 1945, that was most unusual. He called the press into his office and said: Look what I have done. He unveiled the fact that he had taken the seal and flag of the Presidency of the United States and redesigned them. That design is essentially the same today with the exception that two stars were added for the States of Alaska and Hawaii that came in after the Truman Presidency. The seal of the President, as everybody knows--if we look around the Chamber, we can see some up on the wall here--was originally an eagle, and the eagle has two claws. In one set of claws the eagle is grasping the arrows of war, and in the other set of claws, the eagle is grasping the olive branches of peace and diplomacy. Prior to the Truman Presidency, the eagle faced toward the arrows of war. Harry Truman, this great wartime President, changed the seal so the olive branches of diplomacy would be in the right claw, the sort of preserved position, and the eagle would be facing toward the olive branches. When he did this he said: ``This new flag faces the eagle toward the staff, which is looking to the front all of the time when you are on the march, and also has it looking at the olive branch for peace, instead of the arrows of war.'' Truman biographer David McCullough stated that Truman meant the shift in the eagle's gaze to be seen as symbolic of a nation that was on the march and dedicated to peace and diplomacy. Significantly, right around the same time President Truman did something else that was notable and symbolical. He renamed the Department we think of as the Pentagon from the Department of War to the Department of Defense, also symbolic of the Nation's postwar dedication to peace. While we want to be the strongest--and we are the strongest military nation in the world, as the Presiding Officer knows so very well--we want to always suggest to the world that our interest is not primarily war; no, our interest is peace and prosperity for all. We always have to preserve and advance America's military strength because we know the connection. Sometimes the better your military strength, the more successful you can be diplomatically, but it is also the case that the strength of your diplomacy can also add to the credibility of your military might. I wish to talk quickly about the olive branches of peace and diplomacy and then the arrows of war. America has a great diplomatic tradition. Let's talk about recent Presidential history. President Truman went to Congress and said: Let's spend, in today's dollars, tens of billions of dollars to rebuild the economies of Japan and Germany, the two nations that had been at war against the United States. Germany had been engaged in two wars with the United States in the previous 30 years. Japan had invaded the United States at Pearl Harbor, but President Truman said: Tomorrow is more important than yesterday. Let's spend dollars to rebuild these economies. It was controversial when he proposed it, but the Marshall Plan ended up being one of the most successful things the United States has done from a foreign policy perspective. Right after the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, President Kennedy engaged in negotiations with the Soviet Union to reduce the nuclear threat, and the result was an agreement in 1963 to ban atmospheric nuclear tests, the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. President Reagan was actively engaged in trying to undermine the power of the Soviet Union and communism, but during those very vigorous and aggressive activities, he was also negotiating with the Soviet Union on arms control agreements. Probably the paramount example of that during the Reagan Presidency was the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 1987 that he successfully negotiated. I happen to believe that history is going to judge the recent Iran nuclear deal in the same way. It is an effort to make tomorrow more important than yesterday and to find--even in the midst of significant challenges between the United States and Iran--a way to reduce nuclear tension. Diplomacy is always a judgment where we should try to let go some of the baggage of the past and see if we can find a better way to tomorrow. I am a little bit worried that the Truman legacy of putting peace and diplomacy first is fraying in this body and maybe nationally. I hope by bringing to mind this anniversary today, it will remind us of our great diplomatic history and the power of our diplomatic principles. A number of times in recent years we have seen bits of evidence of a fraying commitment to diplomacy in this Chamber, in my view. One of the great Truman institutions was the International Monetary Fund which was designed to help nations work together on economic and monetary policy issues. It is a great global institution. When you set up an institution like that in the 1940s, the challenge is that when new nations emerge and rise, how do you incorporate nations that are newly powerful into the Fund? The most recent and challenging example has been the nation of China. As China has gotten more and more important, there were many who advised us to bring China more closely into the Fund so they could assist nations throughout the world, but Congress refused to change the bylaws of the IMF to give China proportionate responsibility given its population and the strength of its economy. What did China do after we would not change the bylaws to allow them a proportionate place at the table? China established their own development bank completely separate from the IMF. There is a debate going on right now in Congress about whether we should reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank--now, this dates back to FDR's Presidency--a premier institution that helps American companies find export markets abroad. Again, it is part of our broad diplomatic effort in outreach, and suddenly it is controversial after 80 years. There are a number of U.N. treaties that we could profitably advance our interests on. The U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, if the United States had ratified that, we would have an additional diplomatic tool to challenge Chinese island building in the South China Sea. The U.N. treaty on the rights of women and on the rights of those with disabilities are treaties that would, frankly, reflect American values and American principles because we are the leaders in the world in these areas, and yet we will not ratify these treaties. The prospect of trade deals is much less popular in Congress than they were 15 years ago. Trade is going to happen, the question is whether the United States will play a leadership [[Page S7481]] role in writing the rules, and if we step back and don't play a leadership role, some other nations will, but these are getting more and more complicated in this body. Finally, something I feel very strongly about is that it is hard to face the world with this strong diplomatic might when there are a lot of ambassadorial positions that are vacant. Especially in the last 6 or 7 years we have seen efforts to block or delay ambassadorial appointments that have left key posts in many nations around the world vacant. It sends a message to other countries. When they look at us, as the United States, not putting an ambassador in place, they basically conclude that the United States may not think we are important, and that is a very bad signal to send to other nations, especially when many nations that are allies have been without ambassadors for a while. I am hoping we can reembrace on this 70th anniversary the wisdom of Truman, who said: The nation has to be vigorous and forceful and look toward diplomacy first. With respect to the arrows of war--I am on the Armed Services Committee, and just like President Truman, I prefer diplomacy.

The more we are vigorous in going after diplomacy, the more moral credibility we have in those instances where we can say, when looking at the world, looking at our citizens, and looking at our own troops, that we now think we need to take military action and we have exhausted the diplomatic alternatives first. That improves the moral credibility behind a military effort. It enables us to make the case better to all about the need for a military effort, and often it even creates a better international justification for a military effort. I believe the Presiding Officer and I were together last week when former Secretary Gates testified before the Armed Services Committee.

Nearly 3 months ago, the Senate was unable to find a path forward to adopt this important bill. Let's look at what has happened since the time that the Senate refused to proceed. The fact is that our country has continued to endure a wave of damaging and expensive cyber attacks. These incidents include the first major hack of Apple's popular App Store, the compromise of 15 million T-Mobile users due to a breach at Experian, and the exposure of data of up to 8,000 Army families due to improper procedures followed by the General Services Administration. For the Army families who were affected, this sensitive information included medical histories, Social Security numbers, and child day care details. Today, I renew my support for this bill in light of the continuing state of cyber insecurity that affects information held in the public and private sectors. Passing the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act would make it easier for public and private sector entities to share cyber threat information and vulnerabilities in order to lessen the theft of trade secrets, intellectual property, and national security information, as well as the compromise of sensitive personal information. It would eliminate some of the legal and [[Page S7482]] economic barriers impeding voluntary two-way information sharing between private industry and government. It is a modest but essential first step to protect networks and their information. This bill would not in any way compromise our personal information. Its purpose is to help safeguard our personal information that breach after breach, cyber attack after cyber attack has proven to be vulnerable. While this bill promotes appropriate information sharing between the government and the private sector--a good first step, as I have indicated--it unfortunately does little in its original form to harden the protection of Federal networks or to guard the critical infrastructure we rely upon every day. Thus, I have filed two amendments to further strengthen our Nation's cyber security. The first amendment is directed at improving the security of sensitive personal data that is stored on networks of Federal civilian agencies. The insecurity of Federal databases and networks has been evident for years. Inspectors general reports have warned of it. Yet, by and large, those calls for action have not been heeded by Federal agencies, and certainly the weaknesses in our Federal agencies' security systems are underscored by recent breaches and intrusions. In June, more than 20 million--20 million--current, former, and retired Federal employees learned that their personal data was stolen from the poorly secured databases of the Office of Personnel Management. Since that time, we have learned that the personal emails of the Director of the CIA have been hacked. We have learned from the State Department's inspector general that the State Department is ``among the worst agencies in the Federal Government at protecting its computer networks.'' This substandard performance at the Department of State continued even as an adversary nation breached the Department's email system last year. According to the IG, compliance with Federal information security standards remains ``substandard'' at the State Department. I know from my many years of service on the committee on homeland security, where we worked on cyber security issues for literally a decade, producing legislation in 2010 and 2011 that unfortunately was not approved by this body, that this problem is long standing and it is only growing worse. We ignore it at our peril. This appalling performance in so many agencies and departments led to my introducing bipartisan legislation with my colleague from Virginia, Senator Warner, as well as Senator Mikulski, Senator Coats, Senator Ayotte, and Senator McCaskill, to strengthen the security of the networks of Federal civilian agencies. Our bill has five elements, but the most important provision would grant the Department of Homeland Security the authority to issue binding operational directives to Federal agencies to respond in the face of substantial breaches or to take action in the face of an imminent threat to a Federal network. Although the Secretary of Homeland Security is tasked with a very similar responsibility to protect Federal civilian networks, he has far less authority to accomplish this responsibility than does the Director of the National Security Agency for the dot-mil networks. We can no longer ignore the damaging consequences of failing to address these issues. Our amendment would fortify Federal computer networks from cyber threats in many ways. The key elements, I am pleased to say, in our bill were incorporated into an amendment that has been filed by Senator Carper, along with the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Johnson, and Senator Warner, my chief cosponsor of the bill we introduced, and, of course, myself. Our amendment has been included in the managers' substitute amendment, and I wish to thank Chairman Burr and Vice Chairman Feinstein for their willingness to include these much needed provisions to boost the security of the networks at Federal civilian agencies. Just think of the kind of data that civilian agencies have in the Federal Government. Whether we are talking about the Social Security Administration, the Medicare agency, the IRS, the VA or the Department of Defense, it is evident that millions of Americans--indeed, most Americans--have personal data, sensitive data, such as Social Security numbers, that are stored in these networks of Federal civilian agencies, and we have an obligation to protect as best we can that data. I have also filed another amendment to the cyber bill, amendment No. 2623, that is aimed at protecting our country's most vital critical infrastructure from cyber attack. This bipartisan amendment was cosponsored by Senator Coats, Senator Warner, and Senator Hirono. The livelihood and well-being of almost every American depend upon critical infrastructure that includes the electricity that powers our communities, the national air transportation system that moves passengers and cargo safely from one location to another, and the elements of the financial sector that ensure the $14 trillion of payments made every day are securely routed through the banking system. Those are just some examples of critical infrastructure. There are obviously many more. Our amendment would have created a second tier of mandatory reporting to the government for the fewer than 65 entities identified by the Department of Homeland Security where damage caused by a single cyber attack would likely result in catastrophic harm in the form of more than $50 billion in economic damage, 2,500 fatalities or a severe degradation of our national security. In other words, only cyber attacks that could cause catastrophic results would fall under this reporting requirement. For 99 percent of businesses, the voluntary information sharing framework established in the bill before us would be enough, and the decision on whether or not to share cyber threat information should rightfully be left up to them. A second tier of reporting is necessary, however, to protect the critical infrastructure that is vital to the safety, health, and economic well-being of the American people. Under our amendment, the owners and operators of the country's most critical infrastructure would report significant cyber attacks just as incidents of communicable disease outbreaks must be reported to public health authorities and to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Think about the situations we have here. Does it make sense that we require one case of measles to be reported to a Federal Government agency but not a cyber attack that could result in the death of more than 2,500 people? How does that make sense? The threats to our critical infrastructure are not hypothetical. They are already occurring and increasing in frequency and severity. At a recent Armed Services Committee hearing on cyber security, Senator Donnelly asked the Director of National Intelligence, Jim Clapper, what the No. 1 cyber challenge was that he was most concerned about. Director Clapper testified that, obviously, it was a large-scale cyber attack against the United States infrastructure. In light of this No. 1 threat, how protected is our country? Well, I have posed that very question to the Director of the NSA, Admiral Mike Rogers. His answer, on a scale of 1 to 10, was that we are at about a 5 or 6. That is a failing grade when it comes to protecting critical infrastructure, no matter what curve we are grading on. Although I am very disappointed that the Senate will not consider the original amendment I filed, I do want to acknowledge that Chairman Burr and Vice Chairman Feinstein have worked closely with me on a compromise to begin to address the issue of cyber security risks that present such significant security threats to our critical infrastructure, and I am grateful for their acknowledging that this is a problem that deserves our attention. This new amendment, which is section 407 of the managers' amendment, requires the DHS Secretary to conduct an assessment of the fewer than 65 critical infrastructure entities at greatest risk and develop a strategy to mitigate the risks of a catastrophic cyber attack. Let me stress two things. We are only talking about fewer than 65 entities that have already been designated by the Department of Homeland Security as critical infrastructure where a catastrophic cyber attack would cause terrible consequences. [[Page S7483]] Second, let me again describe what we mean by a catastrophic attack. It means a single cyber attack that would likely result in $50 billion in economic damage, 2,500 Americans dying or a severe degradation of our national security. We are talking about significant consequences that would be catastrophic for this country--consequences we cannot and should not ignore. There are plenty of cyber threats that cannot be discussed in public because they are classified--I know that as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee--but in light of the cyber threat to critical infrastructure described by Admiral Rogers and Director of National Intelligence Clapper in open testimony before the Congress, the bare minimum we ought to do is to ask to require DHS and the appropriate Federal agencies to describe to us what more could be done to prevent a catastrophic cyber attack on our critical infrastructure. One or two years from now, I don't want us to be standing here after a cyber 9/11 chastising ourselves, saying: Why didn't we do more to confront an obvious and serious threat to our critical infrastructure? By including these two provisions in the managers' substitute amendment, we are strengthening the protections for Federal civilian agencies and beginning--not going nearly as far as I would like but beginning the vital task of protecting our critical infrastructure. We will be strengthening the cyber defenses of our Nation. I urge my colleagues to support the managers' amendment and the underlying bill. By passing this long-overdue legislation, we will begin the long-overdue work of securing our economic and national security and our personal information for generations to come. Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7481-S7483] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CYBERSECURITY INFORMATION SHARING BILL Ms. COLLINS.

``substandard'' at the state department. i know from my many years of service on the committee on homeland security, where we worked on cyber security issues for literally a decade, producing legislation in 2010 and 2011 that unfortunately was not approved by this body, that this problem is long standing and it is only growing worse. we ignore it at our peril. this appalling performance in so many agencies and departments led to my introducing bipartisan legislation with my colleague from virginia, senator warner, as well as senator mikulski, senator coats, senator ayotte, and senator mccaskill, to strengthen the security of the networks of federal civilian agencies. our bill has five elements, but the most important provision would grant the department of homeland security the authority to issue binding operational directives to federal agencies to respond in the face of substantial breaches or to take action in the face of an imminent threat to a federal network. although the secretary of homeland security is tasked with a very similar responsibility to protect federal civilian networks, he has far less authority to accomplish this responsibility than does the director of the national security agency for the dot-mil networks. we can no longer ignore the damaging consequences of failing to address these issues. our amendment would fortify federal computer networks from cyber threats in many ways. the key elements, i am pleased to say, in our bill were incorporated into an amendment that has been filed by senator carper, along with the chairman of the homeland security and governmental affairs committee, senator johnson, and senator warner, my chief cosponsor of the bill we introduced, and, of course, myself. our amendment has been included in the managers' substitute amendment, and i wish to thank chairman burr and vice chairman feinstein for their willingness to include these much needed provisions to boost the security of the networks at federal civilian agencies. just think of the kind of data that civilian agencies have in the federal government. whether we are talking about the social security administration, the medicare agency, the irs, the va or the department of defense, it is evident that millions of americans--indeed, most americans--have personal data, sensitive data, such as social security numbers, that are stored in these networks of federal civilian agencies, and we have an obligation to protect as best we can that data. i have also filed another amendment to the cyber bill, amendment no. 2623, that is aimed at protecting our country's most vital critical infrastructure from cyber attack. this bipartisan amendment was cosponsored by senator coats, senator warner, and senator hirono. the livelihood and well-being of almost every american depend upon critical infrastructure that includes the electricity that powers our communities, the national air transportation system that moves passengers and cargo safely from one location to another, and the elements of the financial sector that ensure the $14 trillion of payments made every day are securely routed through the banking system. those are just some examples of critical infrastructure. there are obviously many more. our amendment would have created a second tier of mandatory reporting to the government for the fewer than 65 entities identified by the department of homeland security where damage caused by a single cyber attack would likely result in catastrophic harm in the form of more than $50 billion in economic damage, 2,500 fatalities or a severe degradation of our national security. in other words, only cyber attacks that could cause catastrophic results would fall under this reporting requirement. for 99 percent of businesses, the voluntary information sharing framework established in the bill before us would be enough, and the decision on whether or not to share cyber threat information should rightfully be left up to them. a second tier of reporting is necessary, however, to protect the critical infrastructure that is vital to the safety, health, and economic well-being of the american people. under our amendment, the owners and operators of the country's most critical infrastructure would report significant cyber attacks just as incidents of communicable disease outbreaks must be reported to public health authorities and to the centers for disease control and prevention. think about the situations we have here. does it make sense that we require one case of measles to be reported to a federal government agency but not a cyber attack that could result in the death of more than 2,500 people? how does that make sense? the threats to our critical infrastructure are not hypothetical. they are already occurring and increasing in frequency and severity. at a recent armed services committee hearing on cyber security, senator donnelly asked the director of national intelligence, jim clapper, what the no. 1 cyber challenge was that he was most concerned about. director clapper testified that, obviously, it was a large-scale cyber attack against the united states infrastructure. in light of this no. 1 threat, how protected is our country? well, i have posed that very question to the director of the nsa, admiral mike rogers. his answer, on a scale of 1 to 10, was that we are at about a 5 or 6. that is a failing grade when it comes to protecting critical infrastructure, no matter what curve we are grading on. although i am very disappointed that the senate will not consider the original amendment i filed, i do want to acknowledge that chairman burr and vice chairman feinstein have worked closely with me on a compromise to begin to address the issue of cyber security risks that present such significant security threats to our critical infrastructure, and i am grateful for their acknowledging that this is a problem that deserves our attention. this new amendment, which is section 407 of the managers' amendment, requires the dhs secretary to conduct an assessment of the fewer than 65 critical infrastructure entities at greatest risk and develop a strategy to mitigate the risks of a catastrophic cyber attack. let me stress two things. we are only talking about fewer than 65 entities that have already been designated by the department of homeland security as critical infrastructure where a catastrophic cyber attack would cause terrible consequences. [[page s7483]] second, let me again describe what we mean by a catastrophic attack. it means a single cyber attack that would likely result in $50 billion in economic damage, 2,500 americans dying or a severe degradation of our national security. we are talking about significant consequences that would be catastrophic for this country--consequences we cannot and should not ignore. there are plenty of cyber threats that cannot be discussed in public because they are classified--i know that as a member of the senate intelligence committee--but in light of the cyber threat to critical infrastructure described by admiral rogers and director of national intelligence clapper in open testimony before the congress, the bare minimum we ought to do is to ask to require dhs and the appropriate federal agencies to describe to us what more could be done to prevent a catastrophic cyber attack on our critical infrastructure. one or two years from now, i don't want us to be standing here after a cyber 9/11 chastising ourselves, saying: why didn't we do more to confront an obvious and serious threat to our critical infrastructure? by including these two provisions in the managers' substitute amendment, we are strengthening the protections for federal civilian agencies and beginning--not going nearly as far as i would like but beginning the vital task of protecting our critical infrastructure. we will be strengthening the cyber defenses of our nation. i urge my colleagues to support the managers' amendment and the underlying bill. by passing this long-overdue legislation, we will begin the long-overdue work of securing our economic and national security and our personal information for generations to come. thank you, madam president. i yield the floor. madam president, i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. nelson. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",12172
CREC-2015-10-26-pt1-PgS7483,CREC-2015-10-26,114,TAKATA AIRBAG RECALL,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7483-S7484] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TAKATA AIRBAG RECALL Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I rise today to speak about the Takata airbag recall and the continued need for urgency in this area. Last week the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced that they currently had--this figure will blow your mind--19 million vehicles and 23 million airbags under recall. So far, the completion rates for this recall are not very good. There is a national completion rate of some 22 percent, and for States such as Florida where there is high heat and humidity--that is suspected as part of the reason the components break down--the completion rate is just under 30 percent, meaning that people are not taking their cars in to fix the problem that caused the recall in the first place. Takata started running ads through the print media and social media, and Honda is running ads to get consumers to a dealer to replace their defective airbags. I am also aware that to boost replacement inflators, three other airbag manufacturers are helping to manufacture them. So this Senator wants to take this opportunity to state that wherever this message can be delivered to consumers, you better take your car if it is under recall and get it in to the dealer in order to get a replacement airbag; otherwise, you are walking around with, in effect, a grenade in the middle of your steering wheel or dashboard. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to show a number of items in the Senate to illustrate what I am talking about with the airbags. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. NELSON. To Members of the Senate, this is a deflated airbag that has already exploded. If you can see, this part is the center of the steering wheel. In this case, this happens to be a Honda; here is the letter ``h.'' This would be sitting right in front of you in the steering wheel. When you have an accident, if it is of sufficient impact, it is going to cause the airbag to inflate. This is designed as a lifesaver. This explosive device inside the airbag, and the gas compound in there is ammonium nitrate. If it is defective, when the explosion occurs, the hot gases that are released from the compound come out through these little holes around the side, and that inflates the airbag. But what has happened and has caused almost 20 million cars to be recalled is that the hot gases are exploding in this device with such force that it is causing the metal to break and come out in the inflated bag with such force, tearing through the bag, as this particular bag shows--it has a big hole in it. Here is the hole where the metal came out. It is like a grenade exploding in front of you, in your steering wheel, with shrapnel going into the people who are driving or who are in the passenger seat with the dashboard airbag. We are finding out now that a few months ago there was the explosion of side airbags in some of the cars, in the doors. Lo and behold, that is throwing out shrapnel as well. I want to show the Senate what it is like when these inflators explode. This is an inflator that was inside the device I just showed you. This photograph is a blowup by the Battelle Institute for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This is a blown-up photograph of the inflator starting to inflate. What it is supposed to do is shoot the gases out here, which inflates the bag I showed you, but look what has happened. It is being ruptured in the side, throwing out metal. This is what it looks like under very fast photography. Metal fragments are coming out when it should have been just gas coming out to inflate the bag. This is what one of those pieces of metal looks like. It is a shard of metal that is part of the inflator. Can you imagine that hitting you in the neck? Well, that is what happened to one of my citizens in Florida, in the Orlando area. She ran into a fender bender in an intersection at a traffic light. Lo and behold, when the police got there, they found her slumped over the wheel, and they thought it was a homicide because her neck was slashed. They found out that what happened was a piece of metal like this had lacerated her neck and cut her jugular vein. Another one of my constituents, a fireman--a big, hulking guy, the kind who will pick you up, if you are disabled and in a house that is burning down, and carry you out safely to save you--well, he won't be a fireman anymore because one of those metal fragments hit him in the eye and he is blind in one eye. Those are just two incidents of scores across the country, of which there have been a handful of deaths. If a jagged piece of metal can cause severe injury because it is coming at you at high speed, don't you think that if you have one of these vehicles that are under recall, you had better get it to the dealer to have it replaced? Check to see if your car is under recall because sometimes people don't get it in the mail or they don't open the mail. Go to www.safercar.gov and put in your car's vehicle identification number-- the VIN number--and then you will see if your car is on a recall list. Those that are on the recall list that I mentioned earlier unfortunately may not be the last to be recalled. The New York Times just reported that a study commissioned by Takata with Penn State University shows larger issues with the use of ammonium nitrate in the airbag inflators. In addition, there was another incident just this past June where a Takata side airbag ruptured in a relatively new 2015 Volkswagen. And just a week ago, General Motors recalled vehicles that also had defective Takata side airbags. It raises the question, are any of the Takata inflators safe? Last week Senator Thune and I sent a letter to Takata asking for additional documents and information regarding these side airbags. We also asked more questions about the use of ammonium nitrate. Also, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced that it may expand its recall to all the model year vehicles with Takata airbags. NHTSA must use all of its tools under the law to maximize consumer protection. These potential hand grenades, stored in the steering wheel or dashboard, must get off the road. The [[Page S7484]] American driving public cannot afford any more wasted time. Don't we think these corporations that are causing this outrageous situation that has killed seven people in the United States and severely injured dozens more--don't we think that they ought to be held accountable? If executives at Takata knew about their defective products, if they knew that and did nothing, or worse, if they covered it up, then they ought to go to jail. Not another fine, not another settlement, somebody ought to be going to jail. Lying about a danger of this magnitude is a criminal act. We have a crisis of consumer confidence in the vehicle-safety area. Certainly that has been demonstrated with these Takata airbags. What about General Motors' misinformation, lack of information, and outright deception about the defective ignition switches? And now what about Volkswagen's deliberate efforts to lie about--and to cover up-- emissions from its diesel vehicles? A few weeks ago I sent a letter to Chairwoman Edith Ramirez of the Federal Trade Commission, asking them to crack down on Volkswagen's unfair and deceptive practices in connection with its ``clean diesel'' vehicle claims, and today I received a response. The Chairwoman of that Commission told me they are investigating the claims against Volkswagen, along with the Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency. In her response she said: ``No reasonable consumer would knowingly purchase a vehicle that he or she could not legally drive.'' I agree. Don't we all agree? So it is time to get tough and to hold these folks and these corporations accountable. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7483-S7484] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TAKATA AIRBAG RECALL Mr. NELSON.

well, that is what happened to one of my citizens in florida, in the orlando area. she ran into a fender bender in an intersection at a traffic light. lo and behold, when the police got there, they found her slumped over the wheel, and they thought it was a homicide because her neck was slashed. they found out that what happened was a piece of metal like this had lacerated her neck and cut her jugular vein. another one of my constituents, a fireman--a big, hulking guy, the kind who will pick you up, if you are disabled and in a house that is burning down, and carry you out safely to save you--well, he won't be a fireman anymore because one of those metal fragments hit him in the eye and he is blind in one eye. those are just two incidents of scores across the country, of which there have been a handful of deaths. if a jagged piece of metal can cause severe injury because it is coming at you at high speed, don't you think that if you have one of these vehicles that are under recall, you had better get it to the dealer to have it replaced? check to see if your car is under recall because sometimes people don't get it in the mail or they don't open the mail. go to www.safercar.gov and put in your car's vehicle identification number-- the vin number--and then you will see if your car is on a recall list. those that are on the recall list that i mentioned earlier unfortunately may not be the last to be recalled. the new york times just reported that a study commissioned by takata with penn state university shows larger issues with the use of ammonium nitrate in the airbag inflators. in addition, there was another incident just this past june where a takata side airbag ruptured in a relatively new 2015 volkswagen. and just a week ago, general motors recalled vehicles that also had defective takata side airbags. it raises the question, are any of the takata inflators safe? last week senator thune and i sent a letter to takata asking for additional documents and information regarding these side airbags. we also asked more questions about the use of ammonium nitrate. also, the national highway traffic safety administration announced that it may expand its recall to all the model year vehicles with takata airbags. nhtsa must use all of its tools under the law to maximize consumer protection. these potential hand grenades, stored in the steering wheel or dashboard, must get off the road. the [[page s7484]] american driving public cannot afford any more wasted time. don't we think these corporations that are causing this outrageous situation that has killed seven people in the united states and severely injured dozens more--don't we think that they ought to be held accountable? if executives at takata knew about their defective products, if they knew that and did nothing, or worse, if they covered it up, then they ought to go to jail. not another fine, not another settlement, somebody ought to be going to jail. lying about a danger of this magnitude is a criminal act. we have a crisis of consumer confidence in the vehicle-safety area. certainly that has been demonstrated with these takata airbags. what about general motors' misinformation, lack of information, and outright deception about the defective ignition switches? and now what about volkswagen's deliberate efforts to lie about--and to cover up-- emissions from its diesel vehicles? a few weeks ago i sent a letter to chairwoman edith ramirez of the federal trade commission, asking them to crack down on volkswagen's unfair and deceptive practices in connection with its ``clean diesel'' vehicle claims, and today i received a response. the chairwoman of that commission told me they are investigating the claims against volkswagen, along with the department of justice and the environmental protection agency. in her response she said: ``no reasonable consumer would knowingly purchase a vehicle that he or she could not legally drive.'' i agree. don't we all agree? so it is time to get tough and to hold these folks and these corporations accountable. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the bill clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. tester. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",8356
CREC-2015-10-26-pt1-PgS7484-2,CREC-2015-10-26,114,TRANSPORTATION REAUTHORIZATION BILL,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7484-S7485] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRANSPORTATION REAUTHORIZATION BILL Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I came back today and had really good news over the weekend. I think a lot of people have gotten together on both sides, in the House and the Senate, to do what we are supposed to be doing. I often refer to that old instrument called the Constitution, which says there are two main things we are supposed to be doing here: One is defending America, and the other is building roads and bridges. That is what we are supposed to be doing. The Presiding Officer has heard me say before that my top priority as chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee is, and continues to be, passing a long-term highway reauthorization bill. The last one we passed was in 2005. I was proud to be the author of it at that time. It expired in 2009. Since that time, we have not had anything except short-term extensions. I have to remind my conservative friends, because I am a conservative, that the conservative position is to have a long-term reauthorization bill, because the short-term costs about 30 percent off the top. As a result, the industry stakeholders and local government leaders have lost faith in Congress's ability to provide funding certainty to maintain and advance our surface transportation and infrastructure. Ranking Member Barbara Boxer and I have been fighting for a long period of time to change this and reverse the trend of wasteful short-term patches. On June 24, our committee--and this is very unusual for this to happen. Our committee unanimously voted to advance to the Senate the DRIVE Act, which is a 6-year reauthorization bill. In July, the Senate gave strong bipartisan support by a vote of 65 to 34, a 2-to-1 majority. Again, this is not something that normally happens with a major piece of legislation. It also included contributions from the Senate Commerce Committee and the Senate Banking Committee, so it is not just the Environment and Public Works Committee. Other committees have parts of this legislation also. The Senate worked hard across party lines to put forward a solution for our Nation's roads and bridges. We ended the summer by passing yet another short-term patch in order to give more time for the House to join our efforts. Unfortunately, we are now 3 days away [[Page S7485]] from facing another cliff and the two Chambers have not yet been able to conference a long-term transportation solution. I just talked to Chairman Shuster of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. They marked up a 6-year reauthorization bill just this last Thursday. I am proud to see that both Chambers are on similar pages. Both bills recognize the need for a national freight program. We approach it just a little differently, but there is nothing that can't be reconciled in a matter of minutes. Further, environmental streamlining is absolutely necessary. Both bills are doing that. We place a new focus on innovation which provides States with flexibility, as in my State of Oklahoma. When we give flexibility to the States, we get a lot more done. This idea that no good ideas are put to work unless they originate in Washington is just not true. Also, long-term certainty, which we are very much concerned with, is there, and it is now a reality. We are now one step closer to putting America back on the map as a place to do business. It is my understanding that the House intends to move Chairman Shuster's 6-year reauthorization bill through the full House over the next 2 weeks. I just spoke with him a few minutes ago. Unlike in years past, I expect a very short conference period. Because we still face this important process, Congress will need one more extension to get us to the finish line. The finish line should be the 20th of November, and it can be done. When I say a very short conference period, it is because there is very little difference between the House bill and the Senate bill. I have talked to the likely conferees, and they are in accord with the idea that we can do this in a matter of hours, not days. I realize there are a lot of moving discussions on larger deals on the debt limit and budget caps; however, there is agreement that the surface transportation bill can and will move on its own timeline. The House will move a short-term extension to November 20 this week. The ones I have talked to assure me that is going to happen. I hope the Senate passes it quickly so the House can move the T&I-reported bill on the floor and we can move to a quickly resolved conference. Due to the similarity in both bills, I am confident we can and should have this on the President's desk by Thanksgiving. If we fail to get this done by November 20, we are going to be faced with two significant hurdles: First, Congress has other pressing deadlines to address in December--to include December 11, when funding of the Federal Government expires, and December 31, when a host of important tax provisions will expire. Another December 31 deadline would be the provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act. I can remember in years past when we got dangerously close to December 31. One time the Big Four had to take it, and it was not even a product of the committees. I was one of the Big Four. We were able to pass it, but we came so close to December 31, it was scary. Here we are, in the middle of a bunch of wars, and all of a sudden we would have provisions out there--reenlistment bonuses, hazard pay, and things that would expire. Nothing would be worse than to have our kids in combat facing that. We are addressing these deadlines that will require Congress's undivided attention. Some of the solutions for these bills could result, I fear, in Members attempting to siphon off the payoffs of the DRIVE Act. That is why this is important. The second significant hurdle we face is that later this year the highway trust fund will drop to a dangerously low level, as DOT Secretary Foxx has warned. At that point, agencies at the Federal and State level will begin to implement cash management procedures that significantly affect the States' construction seasons. In the majority of the United States, we would lose a construction season in States such as Iowa and in Northern States. Mark my words: A failure by Congress to enact a long-term bill by Thanksgiving will result in a loss of the 2016 construction season. Congress is going to return to its current pattern of short-term extensions. Again, short-term extensions syphon about 30 percent off the top. It is a terrible outcome that should be avoided at all costs. We have the opportunity to do it now. By making industry and States continue to hold their breath and budgets, we rob taxpayers of cost-efficient project planning and continue to stall on launching major economy-boosting projects. Look at my State of Oklahoma, which lost $63 million in construction dollars over the last few years as a direct result of inefficiency and contracting uncertainty that comes from short-term extensions. I have used that figure of 30 percent off the top with some of my conservative friends. I said: If you oppose a long-term extension, a long-term reauthorization bill, then you are saying that you want to have the liberal alternative, which is to lose 30 percent off the top. With a fully funded long-term reauthorization, Oklahoma would actually see a savings of $122 million and millions more in efficiency savings from long-term commitments and early completion savings from contracts. This is something a lot of people don't realize. The streamline you get--many of the NEPA requirements and the environmental requirements can be offset if you are able to get to a long-term bill. But you can't do it, you can't start any large projects--not any of these big projects--the bridge projects and others you can't do on short-term extensions. We haven't had an authorization bill since 2005, and I believe it is time for Congress to fulfill its constitutional duty to fund our roads and our bridges. As I said earlier, I am confident that the Senate and House will work together to get this bill to the President's desk within the next few weeks. That is my wish for my counterpart on the House side, Chairman Shuster--the best of luck in moving forward. He is now committed to doing that. He is going to get this done. He kept his word in getting the job done last Thursday, and now he is going to be able to get this bill up so that we can conference it together. I anticipate we can do a conference in a matter of a few hours. It wouldn't take the normal time. That is good news. It is good news to come back on a Monday and find that we are going to be doing what the Constitution says we ought to be doing, and that is roads and bridges. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SCHUMER.

That is my wish for my counterpart on the House side, Chairman Shuster--the best of luck in moving forward. He is now committed to doing that. He is going to get this done. He kept his word in getting the job done last Thursday, and now he is going to be able to get this bill up so that we can conference it together. I anticipate we can do a conference in a matter of a few hours. It wouldn't take the normal time. That is good news. It is good news to come back on a Monday and find that we are going to be doing what the Constitution says we ought to be doing, and that is roads and bridges. I yield the floor.

however, there is agreement that the surface transportation bill can and will move on its own timeline. the house will move a short-term extension to november 20 this week. the ones i have talked to assure me that is going to happen. i hope the senate passes it quickly so the house can move the t&i-reported bill on the floor and we can move to a quickly resolved conference. due to the similarity in both bills, i am confident we can and should have this on the president's desk by thanksgiving. if we fail to get this done by november 20, we are going to be faced with two significant hurdles: first, congress has other pressing deadlines to address in december--to include december 11, when funding of the federal government expires, and december 31, when a host of important tax provisions will expire. another december 31 deadline would be the provisions of the national defense authorization act. i can remember in years past when we got dangerously close to december 31. one time the big four had to take it, and it was not even a product of the committees. i was one of the big four. we were able to pass it, but we came so close to december 31, it was scary. here we are, in the middle of a bunch of wars, and all of a sudden we would have provisions out there--reenlistment bonuses, hazard pay, and things that would expire. nothing would be worse than to have our kids in combat facing that. we are addressing these deadlines that will require congress's undivided attention. some of the solutions for these bills could result, i fear, in members attempting to siphon off the payoffs of the drive act. that is why this is important. the second significant hurdle we face is that later this year the highway trust fund will drop to a dangerously low level, as dot secretary foxx has warned. at that point, agencies at the federal and state level will begin to implement cash management procedures that significantly affect the states' construction seasons. in the majority of the united states, we would lose a construction season in states such as iowa and in northern states. mark my words: a failure by congress to enact a long-term bill by thanksgiving will result in a loss of the 2016 construction season. congress is going to return to its current pattern of short-term extensions. again, short-term extensions syphon about 30 percent off the top. it is a terrible outcome that should be avoided at all costs. we have the opportunity to do it now. by making industry and states continue to hold their breath and budgets, we rob taxpayers of cost-efficient project planning and continue to stall on launching major economy-boosting projects. look at my state of oklahoma, which lost $63 million in construction dollars over the last few years as a direct result of inefficiency and contracting uncertainty that comes from short-term extensions. i have used that figure of 30 percent off the top with some of my conservative friends. i said: if you oppose a long-term extension, a long-term reauthorization bill, then you are saying that you want to have the liberal alternative, which is to lose 30 percent off the top. with a fully funded long-term reauthorization, oklahoma would actually see a savings of $122 million and millions more in efficiency savings from long-term commitments and early completion savings from contracts. this is something a lot of people don't realize. the streamline you get--many of the nepa requirements and the environmental requirements can be offset if you are able to get to a long-term bill. but you can't do it, you can't start any large projects--not any of these big projects--the bridge projects and others you can't do on short-term extensions. we haven't had an authorization bill since 2005, and i believe it is time for congress to fulfill its constitutional duty to fund our roads and our bridges. as i said earlier, i am confident that the senate and house will work together to get this bill to the president's desk within the next few weeks. that is my wish for my counterpart on the house side, chairman shuster--the best of luck in moving forward. he is now committed to doing that. he is going to get this done. he kept his word in getting the job done last thursday, and now he is going to be able to get this bill up so that we can conference it together. i anticipate we can do a conference in a matter of a few hours. it wouldn't take the normal time. that is good news. it is good news to come back on a monday and find that we are going to be doing what the constitution says we ought to be doing, and that is roads and bridges. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. schumer. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",9305

Madam President, today I rise as a staunch supporter of every American's right to privacy. I rise because, like many Montanans, I have grave concerns about whether my personal information gets handed over to the government. As the Senate debates the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, I start by acknowledging the inherent conflict between the right to privacy and national security. Some folks want to pretend this conflict doesn't exist, but it does. Ask yourself this: How do we stop cyber terrorists from crashing our networks, stealing our personal information, and throwing our entire economy into a tailspin--an economy that is dependent on technology? How do we do this without violating your right to privacy and mine? How do we do this without giving the Federal Government far-reaching authority to share the personal information of law-abiding citizens? These are tough questions that require thoughtful answers, and I do believe we can answer them. I do believe we can strike a balance that protects our right to privacy and protects our Nation from threats. That is why I want to offer my support for a couple of amendments sponsored by colleagues from both sides of the aisle. The first amendment, from Senators Flake and Franken, provides the necessary 6-year sunset for this legislation. That means that in 6 years Congress would be forced to have another conversation about how we ensure every American's right to privacy while also ensuring our national security. These conversations are incredibly important, and we should revisit them often. We should revisit them often because we know that a government unchecked is dangerous. In a world where technology changes faster than our laws, we cannot and must not give corporations and the Federal Government unbridled authority for generations to come. We already know that several Federal agencies have engaged in invasive surveillance of law-abiding Americans. They have utilized intrusive monitoring techniques--tracking our phone calls, listening to our conversations, gathering storehouses of personal information. They have done this in the name of the PATRIOT Act, one of the worst pieces of legislation ever to come out of this body. It took a long time for those agencies to own up to the fact that certain operations were far bigger in scope than what they had led Congress or the American public to believe. The best thing we can do to try to prevent a repeat of those mistakes is to pass the amendment offered by my good friend Senator Wyden. This amendment would improve cyber security and better protect privacy by reducing the amount of unnecessary personal information that would be shared about a possible cyber security threat. It seems like common sense to me, and I certainly appreciate Senator Wyden championing this issue. As Members of Congress we all took an oath to the people of this Nation to protect them from enemies both foreign and domestic, and we should not give up our ability to check and balance this administration or for that matter the next one. That is why the Flake-Franken amendment and the Wyden amendment are so critical, and I urge my colleagues to support them when they come to the floor. With that, Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. INHOFE.

It could not come too soon, because the Western District has been working without a single sitting Federal judge. That will finally change once Mr. Vilardo has been confirmed. He will now begin to hear cases and tackle the backlog that has been steadily building in the Western District. There are few more qualified to help take on this task than Larry Vilardo. That is because Mr. Vilardo is a classic Buffalonian--hard working, salt of the earth, honest, and grounded. He went to Canisius College and then took a brief detour out of Western New York to attend Harvard Law School and clerk on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in Texas before returning home and becoming one of Buffalo's leading legal lights, practicing at a firm he cofounded. Buffalo is where he was born, raised, and educated, and where he chose to raise his family. Buffalo is in his bones. They love him in Buffalo. When this vacancy occurred, I heard the voices in Buffalo chanting: Vilardo, Vilardo, Vilardo--not just the legal community but just about the whole community. Like so many other people from the region, the city has made him tough, level-headed, fair, and decent. As the first in his family to graduate from college, he adds an important element to the socioeconomic diversity of the court.

CREC-2015-10-26-pt1-PgS7486-3,CREC-2015-10-26,114,Cybersecurity Information Sharing Bill (Executive Session),"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7486-S7488] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] Cybersecurity Information Sharing Bill Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, tomorrow we will be turning to the cyber security bill, which the Presiding Officer is familiar with as a member of the committee, and I wish to speak about my amendment No. 2621 to that legislation. I also intend to address the amendments of our colleagues Senator Franken, Senator Heller, and Senator Coons because I believe all four of these amendments seek to achieve the same goal, and that goal--the goal of all four of these amendments--is to reduce the unnecessary sharing of Americans' private and personal information. The Senate has had a robust debate on the cyber security bill over the past week, and I think it is fair to say that Senators agree on a fair number of points. For example, the sponsors of the legislation have now acknowledged that the cyber security bill we will shortly vote on would not have prevented sophisticated cyber attacks, such as the Target and Home Depot hacks, and it would not have prevented the theft of millions of personnel records at the Office of Personnel Management. As for my part, I agree that sharing information about cyber security threats is generally a constructive idea. If private companies identify samples of malicious code or information that identifies foreign hackers, I would absolutely encourage them to share that information. However, I think companies should also take reasonable steps--and I underline ``reasonable steps''--to remove unrelated personal information about their customers before sharing that data with the government. It is important to understand that this legislation simply does not require companies to do that, and Senators can see that for themselves. As Senators can see for themselves, on page 17 of the bill, companies are allowed to conduct only a cursory review of the information they provide and would only be required to remove data that they know is personal information unrelated to cyber security. When it comes to customers' personal information, the message behind this bill is, when in doubt, hand it over. Once that data is shared-- and this is not widely known--the Department of Homeland Security would be required to send it on to a broad range of government agencies, from the NSA to the FBI. The amendment I have offered to the legislation we will vote on tomorrow would give companies a real responsibility for safeguarding their customers' information. It would say that in order for a company to receive liability protection before a company shares data with the government, it has to make efforts to the extent feasible to remove any personal information that is not necessary to identify or describe a cyber security threat. In my view, that would give this legislation a straightforward standard that could give consumers real confidence that their privacy is actually being protected. Let me give an example of how this might work in practice. Imagine that a health insurance company finds out that millions of its customers' records have been stolen. If that company has any evidence about who the hackers were or how they stole this information, of course it makes sense to share that information with the government. But the company shouldn't simply say ``Well, here you go'' and hand millions of its customers' financial and medical records over for distribution to a broad array of government agencies, such as the FBI and the NSA. The records of the victims of a hack should not be treated the same way information about the hacker is treated. Companies should be required to make reasonable efforts to remove personal information that is not needed for cyber security before they hand that information over to the government. That, in short, is what my amendment seeks to achieve. The sponsors of the legislation have argued that my amendment would somehow hold companies to an almost impossible standard. I say respectfully that the language of this amendment is quite measured. Companies are required to remove unrelated personal information and the legislation specifically states ``to the extent feasible.'' The language certainly doesn't require perfection; it creates a reasonable and flexible approach for companies to make a real effort to remove unrelated personal information about their customers instead of simply performing the sort of cursory review that would be permitted under the current language of the bill. A quick reading through the list of the pending amendments to the bill will make it clear that I am not the only Member of this body who is concerned about the unnecessary sharing of personal information. Our colleague from Nevada, Senator Heller, has a similar amendment that would seek to create a stronger requirement for companies to remove personal information. Our colleague from Delaware, Senator Coons, has crafted a very constructive amendment that would strengthen the requirement for review by the Department of Homeland Security. His amendment would create a stronger obligation for the Homeland Security Department to filter out unnecessary personal information before passing cyber security data on to other parts of our government. Senator Franken has drafted a strong amendment that would clarify the bill's definition of ``cyber security threat information'' to ensure that it focuses on information about real threats. It is important to remember that reducing unnecessary sharing of personal information will make any information sharing program more effective and easier to focus on the genuine threats involved. Finally, our colleague from Arizona, Senator Flake, has drafted an amendment that would require the Congress to come back and review this information sharing approach after 6 years to evaluate how it has worked in practice and whether privacy protections ought to be strengthened. I have cited amendments by Democrats and Republicans. The Presiding Officer knows that I feel strongly about working in a bipartisan way whenever I possibly can, and that is why I thought it was important to mention, as we go through these amendments, that all of these amendments I have described have sought to ensure this body would make it clear that cyber security is a very real problem. Cyber security, in terms of tackling it, which involves information sharing, can be very constructive, and we ought to try to find ways to do it. Each of these amendments is designed to make sure that when Americans hear about cyber security legislation--my colleague and I have discussed it--we don't have millions of Americans walking away and saying: They are sharing all of this unnecessary personal and unrelated information; I [[Page S7487]] guess it is another one of those surveillance kind of bills. We don't want that here. We want bills that are bipartisan, that deal with very real threats--and certainly cyber security is one of them-- but we also want to make sure the rights of innocent people are protected. With these amendments, we do that by ensuring that we have more than a cursory approach to filtering out unrelated and personal information. So it is my judgment that each of these amendments would be significant improvements to the bill, and I hope my colleagues will support all of them, as well as an amendment by our colleague from Vermont Senator Leahy that would remove an unnecessary modification of the Freedom of Information Act. Let me close by saying it is not just Senators--and I have listed both Democrats and Republicans tonight--it is not just Democrats and Republicans in this body who have raised concerns about this bill's inadequate privacy protection; privacy advocacy groups from the American Library Association to the Oregon Technology Institute have come out against the bill. America's leading technology companies-- companies that have to have expertise in both cyber security and protecting the data of their customers--have opposed it as well. Companies such as Apple, Dropbox, Twitter, Salesforce, Reddit, and Yelp have all said that they oppose the legislation because it does not include adequate privacy protections. The trade association that represents Google and Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Yahoo!, Netflix, eBay, and PayPal said: ``CISA's prescribed mechanism for sharing of cyber threat information does not sufficiently protect users' privacy.'' Now, reflect if we might for a minute on what that means. These are America's leading technology companies. They advantage America because they are the envy of the world for their innovation and their way of serving customers and businesses not just in this country but around the world. These companies have millions and millions of customers and have spoken out publicly against the bill, in its current form, before these amendments are considered. They sure know a lot about the importance of protecting both cyber security and individual privacy. The reason I say that is they have to manage that challenge each and every day. Customer confidence is the lifeblood of these companies, and the only way to ensure customer confidence is to convince customers that if they use a product, their information is going to be protected from both malicious hackers and from unnecessary collection by our government. Last Thursday, a coalition of America's leading consumer groups basically joined those major technology companies in announcing their opposition to the bill. They endorsed the pending consumer privacy amendments, including the amendment I will offer, No. 2621. In conclusion, I hope colleagues will listen to what these technology groups and companies have said, and I hope our colleagues will support the amendments that I and others, both Democrats and Republicans, will be offering tomorrow. Let's work together to produce a bill that does a better job of dealing with both real cyber threats and the liberties of the American people. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, we will vote on the nomination of Lawrence Vilardo to be a Federal district judge in the Western District of New York in Buffalo. He was first nominated in February, and his nomination was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote over 5 months ago on May 6. There is no reason why this highly qualified nominee should have waited so long for a vote. Despite having one of the busiest caseloads in the country, with more criminal cases than Washington, DC, Boston, or Cleveland, there is not a single active Federal judge in that district. The court has been staying afloat only through the voluntary efforts of two judges on senior status who are hearing cases in their retirement. It is about time that we confirmed Mr. Vilardo to this vacancy. Next week marks the 11th month that Republicans have been in the majority in the Senate. During that time, only nine judicial nominees have been confirmed. When Senate Democrats were in the majority during the last 2 years of the Bush Presidency, we had already confirmed 34 judges by this same time. The glacial pace at which Republicans are currently confirming judicial nominees is an inexcusable failure to carry out the Senate's constitutional duty of providing advice and consent. It also has real and dire consequences for hard-working Americans who seek justice but instead encounter lengthy delays in the Federal court system due to empty courthouses and overburdened courts. We can and should take action right now to alleviate this problem by holding confirmation votes on the rest of the 13 judicial nominees pending on the floor. A number of these pending nominees have the support of their Republican home State Senators; yet they continue to languish on the calendar without a vote. If Republican obstruction continues and if home State Senators cannot persuade the majority leader to schedule a vote for their nominees soon, then it is unlikely that even highly qualified nominees with Republican support will be confirmed by the end of the year. These are nominees that members of the majority leader's own party want confirmed, including those from Tennessee and Pennsylvania. And last week, we had a hearing for two Iowa nominees, who I expect to be reported out of the Judiciary Committee soon as well. None of these nominees are likely to be confirmed by the end of the year if Senate Republicans continue at this historically slow pace. No Senator has raised any objections to the judicial nominees pending on the floor. Every single one was reported out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote. Each has the backing of their home State Senators, including Republican Senators. These nominees are outstanding, accomplished legal professionals who are ready to serve in our justice system. They have devoted time away from work and their families to go through the rigorous nominations process. More than half of the pending Federal district and circuit court nominees would fill vacancies deemed to be ``judicial emergencies'' by the nonpartisan Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. Instead of working to ensure that all Americans have access to our Federal courts, Senate Republicans continue to obstruct President Obama's judicial nominees in a misguided effort to score political points against the President. The number of empty judgeships has increased by more than 50 percent since Republicans took over the majority. Their obstruction is reversing the hard-earned progress Senate Democrats made last Congress to drastically reduce the number of judicial vacancies. Making matters worse, the number of ``judicial emergency'' vacancies since Senate Republicans took the majority has risen by 158 percent. These vacancies impact communities across America, and it is doing the most harm to States with at least one Republican Senator. Of the 66 current vacancies that exist, 49 of them--or more than 70 percent--are in States with at least one Republican Senator. One of those vacancies is an emergency vacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Pennsylvania. Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo is nominated to fill the vacancy, and he has strong bipartisan support from his home State Senators, Senator Toomey and Senator Casey. At Judge Restrepo's hearing, Senator Toomey stated that ``there is no question [Judge Restrepo] is a very well qualified candidate to serve on the Third Circuit'' and underscored the fact that he recommended that the President nominate Judge Restrepo. Once confirmed, Judge Restrepo will be the first Hispanic judge from Pennsylvania to ever serve on this court and only the second Hispanic judge to serve on the Third Circuit. There is absolutely no reason to delay a vote on Judge Restrepo's confirmation; yet his nomination has been [[Page S7488]] pending on the floor for over 3 months. Since he was first nominated, Judge Restrepo's nomination has been pending for a staggering 348 days. The national president for the Hispanic National Bar Association, which strongly supports Judge Restrepo's nomination, wrote last week in the Huffington Post about the inexcusable delay in his confirmation. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this article be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks. Contrast Senate Republican's treatment of Judge Restrepo with President Bush's nominee to the third circuit, Judge Thomas Hardiman, who was nominated in the last 2 years of the Bush Presidency. Judge Hardiman was confirmed in nearly half the time Judge Restrepo has been waiting, taking only 183 days from nomination to his confirmation. Furthermore, it took only 7 days for Judge Hardiman to receive a confirmation vote once he was reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Judge Restrepo has been pending on the floor for 109 days-- 15 times longer than Judge Hardiman. I hope the Republican Senator from Pennsylvania will implore his leadership to bring this highly qualified nominee up for a vote without further delay. Let us then turn to votes on the rest of the 12 pending judicial nominees without further delay. Shortly we will begin voting on Lawrence Vilardo to fill a judicial vacancy in the Federal District Court for the Western District of New York. Since 1986, he has practiced as a named partner at the law firm of Connors & Vilardo, L.L.P., in Buffalo, NY. He previously practiced at Damon & Morey, in Buffalo, NY, from 1981 to 1986. The ABA standing committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Mr. Vilardo ``well qualified'' to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York, its highest rating. He has the support of his two home State Senators, Senator Schumer and Senator Gillibrand. He was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote on May 6, 2015. I will vote to support his nomination. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the Huffington Post, Oct. 21, 2015] The Current Senate Gridlock Is Hurting the Diversity of Our Justice System (By Robert T. Maldonado) Born in Medellin, Colombia and raised in the United States, Judge L. Felipe Restrepo's life reads like a textbook case of the American Dream. With a bachelor's from the University of Pennsylvania and a law degree from Tulane, he set off on a successful career in criminal defense and civil rights litigation, eventually serving as a magistrate judge for 7 years. But Judge Restrepo's story of immigrant success seems to be on hold for the moment. That's because he's been waiting since November 2014, when President Barack Obama appointed him to serve on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, to be confirmed as an appeals court judge. After a thorough due diligence process, the Hispanic National Bar Association (HNBA) endorsed Judge Restrepo in March 2015, but we didn't stop there. When we saw the lack of progress on his nomination, the HNBA successfully pushed for the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold his nomination hearing, and continues to push for a confirmation vote on the floor of the Senate. Unfortunately, Judge Restrepo's predicament isn't unique. Two other HNBA-endorsed judicial candidates are stuck in the political gridlock, and a total of 30 judicial nominees (two- thirds of them women or minorities) await Senate confirmation with little idea of when that will happen. According to the judicial watchdog group Alliance for Justice, the Senate has confirmed only 8 judges in 2015, the slowest pace in over 60 years. Almost half of the vacancies on the federal bench have been declared ``judicial emergencies,'' where the remaining judges are overworked trying to make a dent into the backlog of cases, sometimes in excess of 600 filings per judge. The backlogs are having a real effect on the people and businesses seeking recourse through the court system. As one California district court judge put it: ``Over the years I've received several letters from people indicating, `Even if I win this case now, my business has failed because of the delay. How is this justice?' And the simple answer, which I cannot give them, is this: It is not justice. We know it.'' Our state of justice is suffering and so is our economy. The states where the backlogs and vacancies are the worst (including Texas, New York, and Florida) happen to be where large Latino communities reside. Given that President Obama has nominated more female and minority candidates to the federal bench than any other President, the delay in judicial confirmations is also a delay in increased diversity, and thus the quality of justice, in our nation's court system. This manufactured crisis is the doing of Senate leaders who prefer to score political points rather than fulfill their constitutional obligations. Those same political leaders need to know that by dragging their feet on these nominations they are not only hurting the nominees but also the integrity and diversity of our federal court system. Nominees like Judge Restrepo have entire communities backing them in their professional journeys, and come election time, they won't hesitate to register their disapproval. For their sake and the sake of our justice system, let's end this judicial vacancy crisis. Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time be yielded back. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Senator Franken has drafted a strong amendment that would clarify the bill's definition of ``cyber security threat information'' to ensure that it focuses on information about real threats. It is important to remember that reducing unnecessary sharing of personal information will make any information sharing program more effective and easier to focus on the genuine threats involved. Finally, our colleague from Arizona, Senator Flake, has drafted an amendment that would require the Congress to come back and review this information sharing approach after 6 years to evaluate how it has worked in practice and whether privacy protections ought to be strengthened. I have cited amendments by Democrats and Republicans. The Presiding Officer knows that I feel strongly about working in a bipartisan way whenever I possibly can, and that is why I thought it was important to mention, as we go through these amendments, that all of these amendments I have described have sought to ensure this body would make it clear that cyber security is a very real problem. Cyber security, in terms of tackling it, which involves information sharing, can be very constructive, and we ought to try to find ways to do it. Each of these amendments is designed to make sure that when Americans hear about cyber security legislation--my colleague and I have discussed it--we don't have millions of Americans walking away and saying: They are sharing all of this unnecessary personal and unrelated information; I [[Page S7487]] guess it is another one of those surveillance kind of bills. We don't want that here. We want bills that are bipartisan, that deal with very real threats--and certainly cyber security is one of them-- but we also want to make sure the rights of innocent people are protected. With these amendments, we do that by ensuring that we have more than a cursory approach to filtering out unrelated and personal information. So it is my judgment that each of these amendments would be significant improvements to the bill, and I hope my colleagues will support all of them, as well as an amendment by our colleague from Vermont Senator Leahy that would remove an unnecessary modification of the Freedom of Information Act. Let me close by saying it is not just Senators--and I have listed both Democrats and Republicans tonight--it is not just Democrats and Republicans in this body who have raised concerns about this bill's inadequate privacy protection; privacy advocacy groups from the American Library Association to the Oregon Technology Institute have come out against the bill. America's leading technology companies-- companies that have to have expertise in both cyber security and protecting the data of their customers--have opposed it as well. Companies such as Apple, Dropbox, Twitter, Salesforce, Reddit, and Yelp have all said that they oppose the legislation because it does not include adequate privacy protections. The trade association that represents Google and Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Yahoo!, Netflix, eBay, and PayPal said: ``CISA's prescribed mechanism for sharing of cyber threat information does not sufficiently protect users' privacy.'' Now, reflect if we might for a minute on what that means. These are America's leading technology companies. They advantage America because they are the envy of the world for their innovation and their way of serving customers and businesses not just in this country but around the world. These companies have millions and millions of customers and have spoken out publicly against the bill, in its current form, before these amendments are considered. They sure know a lot about the importance of protecting both cyber security and individual privacy. The reason I say that is they have to manage that challenge each and every day. Customer confidence is the lifeblood of these companies, and the only way to ensure customer confidence is to convince customers that if they use a product, their information is going to be protected from both malicious hackers and from unnecessary collection by our government. Last Thursday, a coalition of America's leading consumer groups basically joined those major technology companies in announcing their opposition to the bill. They endorsed the pending consumer privacy amendments, including the amendment I will offer, No. 2621. In conclusion, I hope colleagues will listen to what these technology groups and companies have said, and I hope our colleagues will support the amendments that I and others, both Democrats and Republicans, will be offering tomorrow. Let's work together to produce a bill that does a better job of dealing with both real cyber threats and the liberties of the American people. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, we will vote on the nomination of Lawrence Vilardo to be a Federal district judge in the Western District of New York in Buffalo. He was first nominated in February, and his nomination was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote over 5 months ago on May 6. There is no reason why this highly qualified nominee should have waited so long for a vote. Despite having one of the busiest caseloads in the country, with more criminal cases than Washington, DC, Boston, or Cleveland, there is not a single active Federal judge in that district. The court has been staying afloat only through the voluntary efforts of two judges on senior status who are hearing cases in their retirement. It is about time that we confirmed Mr. Vilardo to this vacancy. Next week marks the 11th month that Republicans have been in the majority in the Senate. During that time, only nine judicial nominees have been confirmed. When Senate Democrats were in the majority during the last 2 years of the Bush Presidency, we had already confirmed 34 judges by this same time. The glacial pace at which Republicans are currently confirming judicial nominees is an inexcusable failure to carry out the Senate's constitutional duty of providing advice and consent. It also has real and dire consequences for hard-working Americans who seek justice but instead encounter lengthy delays in the Federal court system due to empty courthouses and overburdened courts. We can and should take action right now to alleviate this problem by holding confirmation votes on the rest of the 13 judicial nominees pending on the floor. A number of these pending nominees have the support of their Republican home State Senators; yet they continue to languish on the calendar without a vote. If Republican obstruction continues and if home State Senators cannot persuade the majority leader to schedule a vote for their nominees soon, then it is unlikely that even highly qualified nominees with Republican support will be confirmed by the end of the year. These are nominees that members of the majority leader's own party want confirmed, including those from Tennessee and Pennsylvania. And last week, we had a hearing for two Iowa nominees, who I expect to be reported out of the Judiciary Committee soon as well. None of these nominees are likely to be confirmed by the end of the year if Senate Republicans continue at this historically slow pace. No Senator has raised any objections to the judicial nominees pending on the floor. Every single one was reported out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote. Each has the backing of their home State Senators, including Republican Senators. These nominees are outstanding, accomplished legal professionals who are ready to serve in our justice system. They have devoted time away from work and their families to go through the rigorous nominations process. More than half of the pending Federal district and circuit court nominees would fill vacancies deemed to be ``judicial emergencies'' by the nonpartisan Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. Instead of working to ensure that all Americans have access to our Federal courts, Senate Republicans continue to obstruct President Obama's judicial nominees in a misguided effort to score political points against the President. The number of empty judgeships has increased by more than 50 percent since Republicans took over the majority. Their obstruction is reversing the hard-earned progress Senate Democrats made last Congress to drastically reduce the number of judicial vacancies. Making matters worse, the number of ``judicial emergency'' vacancies since Senate Republicans took the majority has risen by 158 percent. These vacancies impact communities across America, and it is doing the most harm to States with at least one Republican Senator. Of the 66 current vacancies that exist, 49 of them--or more than 70 percent--are in States with at least one Republican Senator. One of those vacancies is an emergency vacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Pennsylvania. Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo is nominated to fill the vacancy, and he has strong bipartisan support from his home State Senators, Senator Toomey and Senator Casey. At Judge Restrepo's hearing, Senator Toomey stated that ``there is no question [Judge Restrepo] is a very well qualified candidate to serve on the Third Circuit'' and underscored the fact that he recommended that the President nominate Judge Restrepo. Once confirmed, Judge Restrepo will be the first Hispanic judge from Pennsylvania to ever serve on this court and only the second Hispanic judge to serve on the Third Circuit. There is absolutely no reason to delay a vote on Judge Restrepo's confirmation; yet his nomination has been [[Page S7488]] pending on the floor for over 3 months. Since he was first nominated, Judge Restrepo's nomination has been pending for a staggering 348 days. The national president for the Hispanic National Bar Association, which strongly supports Judge Restrepo's nomination, wrote last week in the Huffington Post about the inexcusable delay in his confirmation. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this article be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks. Contrast Senate Republican's treatment of Judge Restrepo with President Bush's nominee to the third circuit, Judge Thomas Hardiman, who was nominated in the last 2 years of the Bush Presidency. Judge Hardiman was confirmed in nearly half the time Judge Restrepo has been waiting, taking only 183 days from nomination to his confirmation. Furthermore, it took only 7 days for Judge Hardiman to receive a confirmation vote once he was reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Judge Restrepo has been pending on the floor for 109 days-- 15 times longer than Judge Hardiman. I hope the Republican Senator from Pennsylvania will implore his leadership to bring this highly qualified nominee up for a vote without further delay. Let us then turn to votes on the rest of the 12 pending judicial nominees without further delay. Shortly we will begin voting on Lawrence Vilardo to fill a judicial vacancy in the Federal District Court for the Western District of New York. Since 1986, he has practiced as a named partner at the law firm of Connors & Vilardo, L.L.P., in Buffalo, NY. He previously practiced at Damon & Morey, in Buffalo, NY, from 1981 to 1986. The ABA standing committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Mr. Vilardo ``well qualified'' to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York, its highest rating. He has the support of his two home State Senators, Senator Schumer and Senator Gillibrand. He was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote on May 6, 2015. I will vote to support his nomination. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the Huffington Post, Oct. 21, 2015] The Current Senate Gridlock Is Hurting the Diversity of Our Justice System (By Robert T. Maldonado) Born in Medellin, Colombia and raised in the United States, Judge L. Felipe Restrepo's life reads like a textbook case of the American Dream. With a bachelor's from the University of Pennsylvania and a law degree from Tulane, he set off on a successful career in criminal defense and civil rights litigation, eventually serving as a magistrate judge for 7 years. But Judge Restrepo's story of immigrant success seems to be on hold for the moment. That's because he's been waiting since November 2014, when President Barack Obama appointed him to serve on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, to be confirmed as an appeals court judge. After a thorough due diligence process, the Hispanic National Bar Association (HNBA) endorsed Judge Restrepo in March 2015, but we didn't stop there. When we saw the lack of progress on his nomination, the HNBA successfully pushed for the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold his nomination hearing, and continues to push for a confirmation vote on the floor of the Senate. Unfortunately, Judge Restrepo's predicament isn't unique. Two other HNBA-endorsed judicial candidates are stuck in the political gridlock, and a total of 30 judicial nominees (two- thirds of them women or minorities) await Senate confirmation with little idea of when that will happen. According to the judicial watchdog group Alliance for Justice, the Senate has confirmed only 8 judges in 2015, the slowest pace in over 60 years. Almost half of the vacancies on the federal bench have been declared ``judicial emergencies,'' where the remaining judges are overworked trying to make a dent into the backlog of cases, sometimes in excess of 600 filings per judge. The backlogs are having a real effect on the people and businesses seeking recourse through the court system. As one California district court judge put it: ``Over the years I've received several letters from people indicating, `Even if I win this case now, my business has failed because of the delay. How is this justice?' And the simple answer, which I cannot give them, is this: It is not justice. We know it.'' Our state of justice is suffering and so is our economy. The states where the backlogs and vacancies are the worst (including Texas, New York, and Florida) happen to be where large Latino communities reside. Given that President Obama has nominated more female and minority candidates to the federal bench than any other President, the delay in judicial confirmations is also a delay in increased diversity, and thus the quality of justice, in our nation's court system. This manufactured crisis is the doing of Senate leaders who prefer to score political points rather than fulfill their constitutional obligations. Those same political leaders need to know that by dragging their feet on these nominations they are not only hurting the nominees but also the integrity and diversity of our federal court system. Nominees like Judge Restrepo have entire communities backing them in their professional journeys, and come election time, they won't hesitate to register their disapproval. For their sake and the sake of our justice system, let's end this judicial vacancy crisis. Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time be yielded back. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the Vilardo nomination? Mr. McCAIN. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tomorrow we will be turning to the cyber security bill, which the Presiding Officer is familiar with as a member of the committee, and I wish to speak about my amendment No. 2621 to that legislation. I also intend to address the amendments of our colleagues Senator Franken, Senator Heller, and Senator Coons because I believe all four of these amendments seek to achieve the same goal, and that goal--the goal of all four of these amendments--is to reduce the unnecessary sharing of Americans' private and personal information. The Senate has had a robust debate on the cyber security bill over the past week, and I think it is fair to say that Senators agree on a fair number of points. For example, the sponsors of the legislation have now acknowledged that the cyber security bill we will shortly vote on would not have prevented sophisticated cyber attacks, such as the Target and Home Depot hacks, and it would not have prevented the theft of millions of personnel records at the Office of Personnel Management. As for my part, I agree that sharing information about cyber security threats is generally a constructive idea. If private companies identify samples of malicious code or information that identifies foreign hackers, I would absolutely encourage them to share that information. However, I think companies should also take reasonable steps--and I underline ``reasonable steps''--to remove unrelated personal information about their customers before sharing that data with the government. It is important to understand that this legislation simply does not require companies to do that, and Senators can see that for themselves. As Senators can see for themselves, on page 17 of the bill, companies are allowed to conduct only a cursory review of the information they provide and would only be required to remove data that they know is personal information unrelated to cyber security. When it comes to customers' personal information, the message behind this bill is, when in doubt, hand it over. Once that data is shared-- and this is not widely known--the Department of Homeland Security would be required to send it on to a broad range of government agencies, from the NSA to the FBI. The amendment I have offered to the legislation we will vote on tomorrow would give companies a real responsibility for safeguarding their customers' information. It would say that in order for a company to receive liability protection before a company shares data with the government, it has to make efforts to the extent feasible to remove any personal information that is not necessary to identify or describe a cyber security threat. In my view, that would give this legislation a straightforward standard that could give consumers real confidence that their privacy is actually being protected. Let me give an example of how this might work in practice. Imagine that a health insurance company finds out that millions of its customers' records have been stolen. If that company has any evidence about who the hackers were or how they stole this information, of course it makes sense to share that information with the government. But the company shouldn't simply say ``Well, here you go'' and hand millions of its customers' financial and medical records over for distribution to a broad array of government agencies, such as the FBI and the NSA. The records of the victims of a hack should not be treated the same way information about the hacker is treated. Companies should be required to make reasonable efforts to remove personal information that is not needed for cyber security before they hand that information over to the government. That, in short, is what my amendment seeks to achieve. The sponsors of the legislation have argued that my amendment would somehow hold companies to an almost impossible standard. I say respectfully that the language of this amendment is quite measured. Companies are required to remove unrelated personal information and the legislation specifically states ``to the extent feasible.'' The language certainly doesn't require perfection; it creates a reasonable and flexible approach for companies to make a real effort to remove unrelated personal information about their customers instead of simply performing the sort of cursory review that would be permitted under the current language of the bill. A quick reading through the list of the pending amendments to the bill will make it clear that I am not the only Member of this body who is concerned about the unnecessary sharing of personal information. Our colleague from Nevada, Senator Heller, has a similar amendment that would seek to create a stronger requirement for companies to remove personal information. Our colleague from Delaware, Senator Coons, has crafted a very constructive amendment that would strengthen the requirement for review by the Department of Homeland Security. His amendment would create a stronger obligation for the Homeland Security Department to filter out unnecessary personal information before passing cyber security data on to other parts of our government. Senator Franken has drafted a strong amendment that would clarify the bill's definition of ``cyber security threat information'' to ensure that it focuses on information about real threats. It is important to remember that reducing unnecessary sharing of personal information will make any information sharing program more effective and easier to focus on the genuine threats involved. Finally, our colleague from Arizona, Senator Flake, has drafted an amendment that would require the Congress to come back and review this information sharing approach after 6 years to evaluate how it has worked in practice and whether privacy protections ought to be strengthened. I have cited amendments by Democrats and Republicans.

____________________",package_114_50.csv,22871,22871,22941,"[congressional record volume 161, number 157 (monday, october 26, 2015)] [senate] [pages s7486-s7488] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] cybersecurity information sharing bill mr. wyden. mr. president, tomorrow we will be turning to the cyber security bill, which the presiding officer is familiar with as a member of the committee, and i wish to speak about my amendment no. 2621 to that legislation. i also intend to address the amendments of our colleagues senator franken, senator heller, and senator coons because i believe all four of these amendments seek to achieve the same goal, and that goal--the goal of all four of these amendments--is to reduce the unnecessary sharing of americans' private and personal information. the senate has had a robust debate on the cyber security bill over the past week, and i think it is fair to say that senators agree on a fair number of points. for example, the sponsors of the legislation have now acknowledged that the cyber security bill we will shortly vote on would not have prevented sophisticated cyber attacks, such as the target and home depot hacks, and it would not have prevented the theft of millions of personnel records at the office of personnel management. as for my part, i agree that sharing information about cyber security threats is generally a constructive idea. if private companies identify samples of malicious code or information that identifies foreign hackers, i would absolutely encourage them to share that information. however, i think companies should also take reasonable steps--and i underline ``reasonable steps''--to remove unrelated personal information about their customers before sharing that data with the government. it is important to understand that this legislation simply does not require companies to do that, and senators can see that for themselves. as senators can see for themselves, on page 17 of the bill, companies are allowed to conduct only a cursory review of the information they provide and would only be required to remove data that they know is personal information unrelated to cyber security. when it comes to customers' personal information, the message behind this bill is, when in doubt, hand it over. once that data is shared-- and this is not widely known--the department of homeland security would be required to send it on to a broad range of government agencies, from the nsa to the fbi. the amendment i have offered to the legislation we will vote on tomorrow would give companies a real responsibility for safeguarding their customers' information. it would say that in order for a company to receive liability protection before a company shares data with the government, it has to make efforts to the extent feasible to remove any personal information that is not necessary to identify or describe a cyber security threat. in my view, that would give this legislation a straightforward standard that could give consumers real confidence that their privacy is actually being protected. let me give an example of how this might work in practice. imagine that a health insurance company finds out that millions of its customers' records have been stolen. if that company has any evidence about who the hackers were or how they stole this information, of course it makes sense to share that information with the government. but the company shouldn't simply say ``well, here you go'' and hand millions of its customers' financial and medical records over for distribution to a broad array of government agencies, such as the fbi and the nsa. the records of the victims of a hack should not be treated the same way information about the hacker is treated. companies should be required to make reasonable efforts to remove personal information that is not needed for cyber security before they hand that information over to the government. that, in short, is what my amendment seeks to achieve. the sponsors of the legislation have argued that my amendment would somehow hold companies to an almost impossible standard. i say respectfully that the language of this amendment is quite measured. companies are required to remove unrelated personal information and the legislation specifically states ``to the extent feasible.'' the language certainly doesn't require perfection; it creates a reasonable and flexible approach for companies to make a real effort to remove unrelated personal information about their customers instead of simply performing the sort of cursory review that would be permitted under the current language of the bill. a quick reading through the list of the pending amendments to the bill will make it clear that i am not the only member of this body who is concerned about the unnecessary sharing of personal information. our colleague from nevada, senator heller, has a similar amendment that would seek to create a stronger requirement for companies to remove personal information. our colleague from delaware, senator coons, has crafted a very constructive amendment that would strengthen the requirement for review by the department of homeland security. his amendment would create a stronger obligation for the homeland security department to filter out unnecessary personal information before passing cyber security data on to other parts of our government. senator franken has drafted a strong amendment that would clarify the bill's definition of ``cyber security threat information'' to ensure that it focuses on information about real threats. it is important to remember that reducing unnecessary sharing of personal information will make any information sharing program more effective and easier to focus on the genuine threats involved. finally, our colleague from arizona, senator flake, has drafted an amendment that would require the congress to come back and review this information sharing approach after 6 years to evaluate how it has worked in practice and whether privacy protections ought to be strengthened. i have cited amendments by democrats and republicans. the presiding officer knows that i feel strongly about working in a bipartisan way whenever i possibly can, and that is why i thought it was important to mention, as we go through these amendments, that all of these amendments i have described have sought to ensure this body would make it clear that cyber security is a very real problem. cyber security, in terms of tackling it, which involves information sharing, can be very constructive, and we ought to try to find ways to do it. each of these amendments is designed to make sure that when americans hear about cyber security legislation--my colleague and i have discussed it--we don't have millions of americans walking away and saying: they are sharing all of this unnecessary personal and unrelated information; i [[page s7487]] guess it is another one of those surveillance kind of bills. we don't want that here. we want bills that are bipartisan, that deal with very real threats--and certainly cyber security is one of them-- but we also want to make sure the rights of innocent people are protected. with these amendments, we do that by ensuring that we have more than a cursory approach to filtering out unrelated and personal information. so it is my judgment that each of these amendments would be significant improvements to the bill, and i hope my colleagues will support all of them, as well as an amendment by our colleague from vermont senator leahy that would remove an unnecessary modification of the freedom of information act. let me close by saying it is not just senators--and i have listed both democrats and republicans tonight--it is not just democrats and republicans in this body who have raised concerns about this bill's inadequate privacy protection; privacy advocacy groups from the american library association to the oregon technology institute have come out against the bill. america's leading technology companies-- companies that have to have expertise in both cyber security and protecting the data of their customers--have opposed it as well. companies such as apple, dropbox, twitter, salesforce, reddit, and yelp have all said that they oppose the legislation because it does not include adequate privacy protections. the trade association that represents google and amazon, facebook, microsoft, yahoo!, netflix, ebay, and paypal said: ``cisa's prescribed mechanism for sharing of cyber threat information does not sufficiently protect users' privacy.'' now, reflect if we might for a minute on what that means. these are america's leading technology companies. they advantage america because they are the envy of the world for their innovation and their way of serving customers and businesses not just in this country but around the world. these companies have millions and millions of customers and have spoken out publicly against the bill, in its current form, before these amendments are considered. they sure know a lot about the importance of protecting both cyber security and individual privacy. the reason i say that is they have to manage that challenge each and every day. customer confidence is the lifeblood of these companies, and the only way to ensure customer confidence is to convince customers that if they use a product, their information is going to be protected from both malicious hackers and from unnecessary collection by our government. last thursday, a coalition of america's leading consumer groups basically joined those major technology companies in announcing their opposition to the bill. they endorsed the pending consumer privacy amendments, including the amendment i will offer, no. 2621. in conclusion, i hope colleagues will listen to what these technology groups and companies have said, and i hope our colleagues will support the amendments that i and others, both democrats and republicans, will be offering tomorrow. let's work together to produce a bill that does a better job of dealing with both real cyber threats and the liberties of the american people. mr. president, i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. mccain. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. leahy. mr. president, today, we will vote on the nomination of lawrence vilardo to be a federal district judge in the western district of new york in buffalo. he was first nominated in february, and his nomination was voted out of the judiciary committee by unanimous voice vote over 5 months ago on may 6. there is no reason why this highly qualified nominee should have waited so long for a vote. despite having one of the busiest caseloads in the country, with more criminal cases than washington, dc, boston, or cleveland, there is not a single active federal judge in that district. the court has been staying afloat only through the voluntary efforts of two judges on senior status who are hearing cases in their retirement. it is about time that we confirmed mr. vilardo to this vacancy. next week marks the 11th month that republicans have been in the majority in the senate. during that time, only nine judicial nominees have been confirmed. when senate democrats were in the majority during the last 2 years of the bush presidency, we had already confirmed 34 judges by this same time. the glacial pace at which republicans are currently confirming judicial nominees is an inexcusable failure to carry out the senate's constitutional duty of providing advice and consent. it also has real and dire consequences for hard-working americans who seek justice but instead encounter lengthy delays in the federal court system due to empty courthouses and overburdened courts. we can and should take action right now to alleviate this problem by holding confirmation votes on the rest of the 13 judicial nominees pending on the floor. a number of these pending nominees have the support of their republican home state senators; yet they continue to languish on the calendar without a vote. if republican obstruction continues and if home state senators cannot persuade the majority leader to schedule a vote for their nominees soon, then it is unlikely that even highly qualified nominees with republican support will be confirmed by the end of the year. these are nominees that members of the majority leader's own party want confirmed, including those from tennessee and pennsylvania. and last week, we had a hearing for two iowa nominees, who i expect to be reported out of the judiciary committee soon as well. none of these nominees are likely to be confirmed by the end of the year if senate republicans continue at this historically slow pace. no senator has raised any objections to the judicial nominees pending on the floor. every single one was reported out of the judiciary committee by unanimous voice vote. each has the backing of their home state senators, including republican senators. these nominees are outstanding, accomplished legal professionals who are ready to serve in our justice system. they have devoted time away from work and their families to go through the rigorous nominations process. more than half of the pending federal district and circuit court nominees would fill vacancies deemed to be ``judicial emergencies'' by the nonpartisan administrative office of the u.s. courts. instead of working to ensure that all americans have access to our federal courts, senate republicans continue to obstruct president obama's judicial nominees in a misguided effort to score political points against the president. the number of empty judgeships has increased by more than 50 percent since republicans took over the majority. their obstruction is reversing the hard-earned progress senate democrats made last congress to drastically reduce the number of judicial vacancies. making matters worse, the number of ``judicial emergency'' vacancies since senate republicans took the majority has risen by 158 percent. these vacancies impact communities across america, and it is doing the most harm to states with at least one republican senator. of the 66 current vacancies that exist, 49 of them--or more than 70 percent--are in states with at least one republican senator. one of those vacancies is an emergency vacancy on the u.s. court of appeals for the third circuit in pennsylvania. judge luis felipe restrepo is nominated to fill the vacancy, and he has strong bipartisan support from his home state senators, senator toomey and senator casey. at judge restrepo's hearing, senator toomey stated that ``there is no question [judge restrepo] is a very well qualified candidate to serve on the third circuit'' and underscored the fact that he recommended that the president nominate judge restrepo. once confirmed, judge restrepo will be the first hispanic judge from pennsylvania to ever serve on this court and only the second hispanic judge to serve on the third circuit. there is absolutely no reason to delay a vote on judge restrepo's confirmation; yet his nomination has been [[page s7488]] pending on the floor for over 3 months. since he was first nominated, judge restrepo's nomination has been pending for a staggering 348 days. the national president for the hispanic national bar association, which strongly supports judge restrepo's nomination, wrote last week in the huffington post about the inexcusable delay in his confirmation. i ask unanimous consent that a copy of this article be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks. contrast senate republican's treatment of judge restrepo with president bush's nominee to the third circuit, judge thomas hardiman, who was nominated in the last 2 years of the bush presidency. judge hardiman was confirmed in nearly half the time judge restrepo has been waiting, taking only 183 days from nomination to his confirmation. furthermore, it took only 7 days for judge hardiman to receive a confirmation vote once he was reported out of the senate judiciary committee. judge restrepo has been pending on the floor for 109 days-- 15 times longer than judge hardiman. i hope the republican senator from pennsylvania will implore his leadership to bring this highly qualified nominee up for a vote without further delay. let us then turn to votes on the rest of the 12 pending judicial nominees without further delay. shortly we will begin voting on lawrence vilardo to fill a judicial vacancy in the federal district court for the western district of new york. since 1986, he has practiced as a named partner at the law firm of connors & vilardo, l.l.p., in buffalo, ny. he previously practiced at damon & morey, in buffalo, ny, from 1981 to 1986. the aba standing committee on the federal judiciary unanimously rated mr. vilardo ``well qualified'' to serve on the u.s. district court for the western district of new york, its highest rating. he has the support of his two home state senators, senator schumer and senator gillibrand. he was voted out of the judiciary committee by unanimous voice vote on may 6, 2015. i will vote to support his nomination. there being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: [from the huffington post, oct. 21, 2015] the current senate gridlock is hurting the diversity of our justice system (by robert t. maldonado) born in medellin, colombia and raised in the united states, judge l. felipe restrepo's life reads like a textbook case of the american dream. with a bachelor's from the university of pennsylvania and a law degree from tulane, he set off on a successful career in criminal defense and civil rights litigation, eventually serving as a magistrate judge for 7 years. but judge restrepo's story of immigrant success seems to be on hold for the moment. that's because he's been waiting since november 2014, when president barack obama appointed him to serve on the third circuit court of appeals, to be confirmed as an appeals court judge. after a thorough due diligence process, the hispanic national bar association (hnba) endorsed judge restrepo in march 2015, but we didn't stop there. when we saw the lack of progress on his nomination, the hnba successfully pushed for the senate judiciary committee to hold his nomination hearing, and continues to push for a confirmation vote on the floor of the senate. unfortunately, judge restrepo's predicament isn't unique. two other hnba-endorsed judicial candidates are stuck in the political gridlock, and a total of 30 judicial nominees (two- thirds of them women or minorities) await senate confirmation with little idea of when that will happen. according to the judicial watchdog group alliance for justice, the senate has confirmed only 8 judges in 2015, the slowest pace in over 60 years. almost half of the vacancies on the federal bench have been declared ``judicial emergencies,'' where the remaining judges are overworked trying to make a dent into the backlog of cases, sometimes in excess of 600 filings per judge. the backlogs are having a real effect on the people and businesses seeking recourse through the court system. as one california district court judge put it: ``over the years i've received several letters from people indicating, `even if i win this case now, my business has failed because of the delay. how is this justice?' and the simple answer, which i cannot give them, is this: it is not justice. we know it.'' our state of justice is suffering and so is our economy. the states where the backlogs and vacancies are the worst (including texas, new york, and florida) happen to be where large latino communities reside. given that president obama has nominated more female and minority candidates to the federal bench than any other president, the delay in judicial confirmations is also a delay in increased diversity, and thus the quality of justice, in our nation's court system. this manufactured crisis is the doing of senate leaders who prefer to score political points rather than fulfill their constitutional obligations. those same political leaders need to know that by dragging their feet on these nominations they are not only hurting the nominees but also the integrity and diversity of our federal court system. nominees like judge restrepo have entire communities backing them in their professional journeys, and come election time, they won't hesitate to register their disapproval. for their sake and the sake of our justice system, let's end this judicial vacancy crisis. mr. mccain. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that all time be yielded back. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. the question is, will the senate advise and consent to the vilardo nomination? mr. mccain. i ask for

Res. 298 Whereas, on March 2, 1867, Congress enacted a naval appropriations Act that authorized the Secretary of the Navy to ``receive and accept a deed of gift, when offered by the State of Connecticut, of a tract of land with not less than one mile of shore front on the Thames River near New London, Connecticut, to be held by the United States for naval purposes''; Whereas the people of Connecticut and the towns and cities in the southeastern region of Connecticut subsequently donated land and provided funding to establish a military installation to fulfil the Nation's need for a naval facility on the Atlantic coast; Whereas, on April 11, 1868, the Navy accepted the deed of gift of land from Connecticut to establish a naval yard and storage depot along the eastern shore of the Thames River in Groton, Connecticut; Whereas, between 1868 and 1912, the New London Navy Yard supported a diverse range of missions, including berthing inactive Civil War era ironclad warships and serving as a coaling station for refueling naval ships traveling in New England waters; Whereas Congress rejected the Navy's proposal to close New London Navy Yard in 1912, following an impassioned effort by Congressman Edwin W. Higgins, who stated that this ``action proposed is not only unjust but unreasonable and unsound as a military proposition''; Whereas the outbreak of World War I and the enemy use of submarines to sink allied military and civilian ships in the Atlantic sparked a new focus on developing submarine capabilities in the United States; Whereas October 18, 1915, marked the arrival at the New London Navy Yard of the submarines G-1, G-2, and G-4 under the care of the tender USS OZARK, soon followed by the arrival of submarines E-1, D-1, and D-3 under the care of the tender USS TONOPAH, and on November 1, 1915, the arrival of the first ship built as a submarine tender, the USS FULTON (AS-1); Whereas, on June 21, 1916, Commander Yeates Stirling assumed the command of the newly designated Naval Submarine Base New London, the New London Submarine Flotilla, and the Submarine School; Whereas, in the 100 years since the arrival of the first submarines to the base, Naval Submarine Base New London has grown to occupy more than 680 acres along the east side of the Thames River, with more than 160 major facilities, 15 nuclear submarines, and more than 70 tenant commands and activities, including the Submarine Learning Center, Naval Submarine School, the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory, the Naval Undersea Medical Institute, and the newly established Undersea Warfare Development Center; Whereas, in addition to being the site of the first submarine base in the United States, Connecticut was home to the foremost submarine manufactures of the time, the Lake Torpedo Boat Company in Bridgeport and the Electric Boat Company in Groton, which later became General Dynamics Electric Boat; Whereas General Dynamics Electric Boat, its talented workforce, and its Connecticut-based and nationwide network of suppliers have delivered more than 200 submarines from its current location in Groton, Connecticut, including the first nuclear-powered submarine, the USS NAUTILUS (SSN 571), and nearly half of the nuclear submarines ever built by the United States; Whereas the Submarine Force Library and Museum, located adjacent to Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, Connecticut, is the only submarine museum operated by the United States Navy and today serves as the primary repository for artifacts, documents, and photographs relating to the bold and courageous history of the Submarine Force and highlights as its core exhibit the historic ship Nautilus following her retirement from service; Whereas, reflecting the close ties between Connecticut and the Navy that began with the gift of land that established the base, the State of Connecticut has set aside $40,000,000 in funding for critical infrastructure investments to support the mission of the base, including construction of a new dive locker building, expansion of the Submarine Learning Center, and modernization of energy infrastructure; Whereas, on September 29, 2015, Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy designated October 2015 through October 2016 as Connecticut's Submarine Century, a year-long observance that celebrates 100 years of submarine activity in Connecticut, including the Town of Groton's distinction as the Submarine Capital of the World, to coincide with the centennial anniversary of the establishment of Naval Submarine Base New London and the Naval Submarine School;

CREC-2015-10-26-pt1-PgS7496-2,CREC-2015-10-26,114,CYBERSECURITY INFORMATION SHARING BILL,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S7496] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CYBERSECURITY INFORMATION SHARING BILL Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, tomorrow we will vote on my amendment to the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, or CISA. I am proud to be joined on this amendment by Senators Leahy, Durbin, and Wyden, each of whom has worked to try to ensure that any cyber legislation passed by this body is effective and adequately safeguards the privacy and civil liberties of the American people. My amendment tightens the definitions of the terms ``cyber security threat'' and ``cyber threat indicator'' in the bill. These changes will help ensure that CISA's broad authorities are not triggered in circumstances where no real cyber threats are present. This makes the bill more privacy protected and more likely to work effectively. The amendment is supported by more than 30 civil society organizations, from the American Civil Liberties Union to prominent Libertarian groups like R Street. As I will describe, it addresses specific concerns that have been raised by security experts, major tech companies, and even the Department of Homeland Security. Under CISA, companies are authorized to monitor users online, share information with one another and with the Federal Government, and deploy defensive measures--all to protect against ``cyber security threats.'' Any action that may result in any unauthorized effort to adversely impact cyber security can be deemed a cyber security threat; that is, may result. That sets the lowest possible standard for determining when actions under CISA are justified, and that is a problem. It sets us up for the oversharing of information, or worse it jeopardizes privacy and threatens to hinder our cyber defense efforts by increasing the noise-to-signal ratio. My amendment would clarify that a threat is any action at least reasonably likely--reasonably likely--to result in an unauthorized effort to adversely impact cyber security. That definition gives companies ample flexibility to act on threats and ensures Americans that CISA isn't a free pass to share people's personal information when there is no threat. CISA's definition of cyber threat indicator has also been criticized by security experts, by companies such as Mozilla and, again, even by DHS, which has called the definition ``expansive'' and said that expansive definition heightens concerns raised by the bill. My amendment addresses the two parts of the definition that experts have suggested are the most likely to open the door to the sharing of extraneous information. First, as drafted, CISA would let companies share people's communications if they believe that the files have been harmed in a cyber attack or could potentially--potentially--be harmed by a perceived threat. The latter is especially problematic. The range of information that could be shared as evidence of potential harm is vast, and, as experts have explained, unnecessary to the technical work of identifying cyber threats. My amendment continues to allow companies to share information that reveals harms caused by a cyber incident but doesn't extend this to conjecture about hypothetical potential harms, which is unnecessarily broad. Finally, my amendment eliminates a troubling loophole in the cyber threat indicator definition. In addition to letting companies share information that reveals certain specified attributes or features of cyber threats, CISA also lets them share information that reveals ``any other attribute of a cybersecurity threat'' if the disclosure of that attribute is legal. Bill supporters claim that this final clause adequately limits the scope of this provision, but looking at whether disclosure of a threat attribute is lawful is an unclear and unhelpful standard. Privacy law is about protecting information, not threat attributes. So my amendment clarifies that companies can share information in this catchall category only if it is legal to share the information being provided. It is a technical change, but it matters. This amendment represents a real effort to find common ground for moving forward. Quite frankly, it doesn't do all the work that needs to be done to limit the definitions in this act, but it makes necessary changes--necessary changes--to improve the legislation, both for the sake of privacy and ultimately security. I urge my colleagues to support amendment No. 2612. I yield the floor. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S7496] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CYBERSECURITY INFORMATION SHARING BILL Mr. FRANKEN.

PELLEGRINI'S RECEIPT OF ENRICO FERMI AWARD ______ HON. TED LIEU of california in the house of representatives Monday, October 26, 2015 Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Claudio Pellegrini for his remarkable and groundbreaking work in the scientific community. On October 20, 2015, Dr. Pellegrini received the Enrico Fermi Award for his research on relativistic electron beams and free-electron lasers. This honor is among the most respected and prestigious awards for scientific achievement. Throughout his lifetime, Dr. Pellegrini has held many prominent positions and earned numerous impressive awards. After studying at the University of Rome, he became Director of the laser division at the Frascati National Laboratories in the 1970s. He later served at the Brookhaven National Laboratory and at the Nordic Institute of Theoretical Physics. In recent years he has worked at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. He is the distinguished recipient of a Fulbright fellowship and the FEL Prize. Still, these include only a fraction of Dr. Pellegrini's accomplishments. I am especially pleased to recognize Dr. Pellegrini's position as a Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Physics at the University of California Los Angeles. Widely considered an expert in electron and photon beams physics, his research contributed to the development of the first hard x-ray free-electron laser and helped advance high-energy physics more generally. The university and surrounding community has undoubtedly benefited from Dr. Pellegrini's presence. I am confident that Dr. Pellegrini's work will continue to benefit the scientific community in the United States and throughout the world. Today, California's 33rd Congressional District is proud to congratulate Dr. Pellegrini as a Fermi Award recipient and as a tremendous scientist and individual. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1531] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF DR.

BARBARA LEE of california in the house of representatives Monday, October 26, 2015 Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an exceptional leader and activist, who fought for equality and civil rights for many decades, Malcolm ``Mal'' Burnstein. Mal Burnstein was born in 1933 in Detroit, and faced heavy oppression and intolerance growing up as a Jewish man in the 1930's and 1940's. The difficulties Mal faced inspired him to be an advocate for civil rights. In the 1940's, Mal was very active in politics in his youth, and volunteered on quite a few campaigns. Some of the campaigns he volunteered for include Henry Wallace's campaign for president; Mennen Williams's campaign for governor; and Martha Griffith's campaign for Congress. Mal graduated with his law degree from Boalt Law School at UC Berkeley in 1958, and after law school, he pursued a fellowship in Europe and studied international law at the Sorbonne in Paris. He then clerked for a year under California Supreme Court Justice Thomas White. Mal's strong conviction to fight for civil rights and equality led him back to Europe for another fellowship, where he worked in Geneva, [[Page E1532]] advocating for the cause of international human rights. In 1961, Mal began working for Robert Trehauft at the Trehauft firm, practicing labor law. The Trehauft firm soon disbanded, and Robert Treuhauft joined Doris Walker's firm, hiring Mal as the only associate. In 1962, Mal formed the Boatrackers Democratic Club, a group dedicated to representing civil rights demonstrators. The club is notable for defeating a recall proposed by conservative Berkeley citizens to recall the Berkeley School Board for racially integrating their Berkeley schools. Mal worked with the Free Speech Movement, the student protest that took place at UC Berkeley in 1964, when the Movement organizers sought legal representation from the Walker firm. Mal provided legal counsel for the Movement, and advised the Movement student organizers during negotiations with the school. Mal's admiration for student leadership and commitment to the Free Speech Movement proved vital during the trials of the 800 arrested students. Mal was also a member of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), and was one of its volunteer lawyers. He participated in CORE organized eat-ins, sit-ins, shops-ins, and picket protests. Such actions were instrumental in paving the way for diversification in workplaces around the East Bay. On a personal note, Mal has been a confidant, my lawyer, a mentor, and most importantly, a wonderful friend. I value his wise counsel and am always energized by his soaring spirit. On behalf of the residents of California's 13th Congressional District, I extend my sincerest congratulations to Malcolm ``Mal'' Burnstein. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1531-E1532] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING MALCOLM ``MAL'' BURNSTEIN ______ HON.

Mal's strong conviction to fight for civil rights and equality led him back to Europe for another fellowship, where he worked in Geneva, [[Page E1532]] advocating for the cause of international human rights. In 1961, Mal began working for Robert Trehauft at the Trehauft firm, practicing labor law. The Trehauft firm soon disbanded, and Robert Treuhauft joined Doris Walker's firm, hiring Mal as the only associate. In 1962, Mal formed the Boatrackers Democratic Club, a group dedicated to representing civil rights demonstrators. The club is notable for defeating a recall proposed by conservative Berkeley citizens to recall the Berkeley School Board for racially integrating their Berkeley schools. Mal worked with the Free Speech Movement, the student protest that took place at UC Berkeley in 1964, when the Movement organizers sought legal representation from the Walker firm. Mal provided legal counsel for the Movement, and advised the Movement student organizers during negotiations with the school. Mal's admiration for student leadership and commitment to the Free Speech Movement proved vital during the trials of the 800 arrested students. Mal was also a member of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), and was one of its volunteer lawyers. He participated in CORE organized eat-ins, sit-ins, shops-ins, and picket protests. Such actions were instrumental in paving the way for diversification in workplaces around the East Bay. On a personal note, Mal has been a confidant, my lawyer, a mentor, and most importantly, a wonderful friend. I value his wise counsel and am always energized by his soaring spirit. On behalf of the residents of California's 13th Congressional District, I extend my sincerest congratulations to Malcolm ``Mal'' Burnstein. ____________________",package_114_50.csv,3057,3057,3127,"[congressional record volume 161, number 157 (monday, october 26, 2015)] [extensions of remarks] [pages e1531-e1532] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] honoring malcolm ``mal'' burnstein ______ hon. barbara lee of california in the house of representatives monday, october 26, 2015 ms. lee. mr. speaker, i rise today to honor an exceptional leader and activist, who fought for equality and civil rights for many decades, malcolm ``mal'' burnstein. mal burnstein was born in 1933 in detroit, and faced heavy oppression and intolerance growing up as a jewish man in the 1930's and 1940's. the difficulties mal faced inspired him to be an advocate for civil rights. in the 1940's, mal was very active in politics in his youth, and volunteered on quite a few campaigns. some of the campaigns he volunteered for include henry wallace's campaign for president; mennen williams's campaign for governor; and martha griffith's campaign for congress. mal graduated with his law degree from boalt law school at uc berkeley in 1958, and after law school, he pursued a fellowship in europe and studied international law at the sorbonne in paris. he then clerked for a year under california supreme court justice thomas white. mal's strong conviction to fight for civil rights and equality led him back to europe for another fellowship, where he worked in geneva, [[page e1532]] advocating for the cause of international human rights. in 1961, mal began working for robert trehauft at the trehauft firm, practicing labor law. the trehauft firm soon disbanded, and robert treuhauft joined doris walker's firm, hiring mal as the only associate. in 1962, mal formed the boatrackers democratic club, a group dedicated to representing civil rights demonstrators. the club is notable for defeating a recall proposed by conservative berkeley citizens to recall the berkeley school board for racially integrating their berkeley schools. mal worked with the free speech movement, the student protest that took place at uc berkeley in 1964, when the movement organizers sought legal representation from the walker firm. mal provided legal counsel for the movement, and advised the movement student organizers during negotiations with the school. mal's admiration for student leadership and commitment to the free speech movement proved vital during the trials of the 800 arrested students. mal was also a member of the congress of racial equality (core), and was one of its volunteer lawyers. he participated in core organized eat-ins, sit-ins, shops-ins, and picket protests. such actions were instrumental in paving the way for diversification in workplaces around the east bay. on a personal note, mal has been a confidant, my lawyer, a mentor, and most importantly, a wonderful friend. i value his wise counsel and am always energized by his soaring spirit. on behalf of the residents of california's 13th congressional district, i extend my sincerest congratulations to malcolm ``mal'' burnstein. ____________________",3057

RICHARD M. NOLAN of minnesota in the house of representatives Monday, October 26, 2015 Mr. NOLAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mark Sertich of Duluth, Minnesota, who continues to celebrate victories on the ice at ninety-four years old. Mark, who during World War II fought in General George Patton's Third Army liberating concentration camps, still puts on his ice skates several times a week to play a pick-up game of hockey. At fifty-nine years old he ran his first marathon and did not stop there. As of today, he has finished five marathons and eleven inline skating marathons. Ice hockey remains his favorite sport, which is why Mark plays every week--no excuses. Forty-two years ago Mark began competing in the annual Snoopy's Senior World Tournament with the late cartoonist Charles Schulz. The two played on the same line together for many years and became good friends. After taking a hard hit on the ice, resulting in two fractured ribs and a punctured lung, doctors said would keep him out of the game for at least six weeks. Mark was back on the ice in just three. His commitment makes him a role model for us all. When asked in a recent interview how he stays motivated to play every week, he responded, ``I say the most important step is the first one out the door.'' I congratulate Mark for not only continuing to play his favorite sport, but also for his victories on the ice, including winning paid skating fees for life in a bet with his teammates when he was eighty years old. Hopefully when I am ninety-four years old I can still lace up my skates and hold my own with players my grandchildren's age--and win a few games too. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1531] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] LIFELONG ATHLETE: MARK SERTICH ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Anderson's Grocery in Republic, Washington for receiving the 2015 Excellence in Operations Award from the Washington Food Industry Association. I want to recognize the owners Ms. Kari Beedle, Ms. Julie Padilla, and Ms. Judee Young for their tireless effort, serving people in Republic and across Eastern Washington. The Excellence in Operations Award recognizes those who excel in daily store operations, product merchandising, and employee relations of community-focused grocers in Washington State. As a family-owned grocery store, Anderson's Grocery has continuously served Republic, Washington for one hundred and fifteen years. It is this type of devotion and commitment that makes Anderson's Grocery truly deserving of this distinguished award. Anderson's Grocery and its owners care deeply about their customers and employees and operate with the philosophy that their employees are the key to their success. Under this philosophy, the owners have implemented many worker-friendly programs. Additionally, to better meet the needs of Ferry County and the surrounding areas, through the years, Anderson's Grocery added capacity in their frozen food, deli, produce and meat departments, and added a bakery department, further exemplifying their commitment to providing enhanced goods and services in order to better the lives of all within our community. Outside of the store, Kari Beedle, Julie Padilla, and Judee Young established the Mary French Foundation. This foundation, named after an Anderson's Grocery employee who passed away of breast cancer, works to raise funds to support scholarship efforts for Republic High School seniors. This commitment illustrates what involved and devoted community members look like and Anderson's Grocery continually goes above and beyond to provide exemplary service and to give back to all of those in Republic, Washington and in Ferry County. So today I recognize these accomplishments and congratulate Anderson's Grocery and its owners on being leaders in our community, on their dedicated service to Republic and Ferry County, and on receiving the distinct 2015 Excellence in Operations Award from the Washington Food Industry Association.

Tammy won the title at the National Auctioneers Association Conference and Show in July. In addition to her work as an auctioneer, Tammy dedicates much of her spare time to helping veterans and their families in her community. As a member of the American Legion Auxiliary, American Legion Riders, and Patriot Guard Riders she has found helping veterans and their families greatly rewarding. Tammy has been in the auction industry fourteen years and enjoys ``helping folks move from one chapter in life to another.'' During the competition she was judged on everything from her professional presentation to effective selling skills, to her bid call. Tammy attributes her success to a culmination of evolving as a competitor, following the advice of her mentors, and growing not only her involvement with the National Auctioneers Association but also learning to be a giver within the NAA. As 2015 IAC champion she hopes to motivate young auctioneers to give back to the industry and the people it serves as they pursue their goals.

BRADLEY BYRNE of alabama in the house of representatives Monday, October 26, 2015 Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share my appreciation to Matt Weinstein for his nine years of service to Alabama's First Congressional District. Matt's last day serving the people of Southwest Alabama will be Friday, October 30. Matt started his service to Alabama's First Congressional District in 2010 as a legislative assistant to Congressman Jo Bonner (R-AL). Prior to working for the First District, Matt worked in the office of Alabama Congressman Mike Rogers (R-AL) starting in January 2007. Upon my election to Congress in December 2013, I was proud to name Matt Weinstein my legislative director. In my office, Matt has been a dedicated advisor on all policy matters and served as a liaison with small businesses and elected officials in Southwest Alabama. Matt has been instrumental in my office's efforts to push forward with construction of a new I-10 bridge over the Mobile River. Matt has done an impressive job of working with the Alabama Department of Transportation and the federal Department of Transportation to remove bureaucratic hurdles. With Matt's help, we have been able to make real, tangible process over the last two years. [[Page E1533]] When the BP/Deepwater Horizon oil spill hit Alabama's Gulf Coast, Matt helped Congressman Bonner advocate for our coastal communities. Matt played an important role in crafting the RESTORE Act, which was intended to keep oil spill settlement money under control of the coastal counties. I am especially grateful for Matt's service to our nation's service members and veterans. Matt did tremendous work supporting our nation's Navy and the thousands of Alabamians who work at the Austal USA shipyard in Mobile, Alabama. Matt has also assisted countless veterans with various issues related to the Department of Veterans Affairs and has supported my efforts to give veterans greater access to private care. Mr. Speaker, I asked former Congressman Jo Bonner to share his gratitude with Matt as well. Congressman Bonner said, ``Matt is one of the most talented and dedicated young men I know. He thinks strategically, always looking for ways to build consensus and get the job done. He was invaluable to the people of South Alabama during the aerial refueling tanker war, but he was equally helpful in getting those early contracts for Austal and during those difficult months following the BP/Deepwater Horizon explosion. I can't say enough good things about Matt Weinstein; he is truly one in a million.'' A native of Mobile, Alabama, Matt has served his hometown with dedication, passion, and steady leadership. I wish him and his wife, Paige, all the best in their future endeavors. Alabama's First Congressional District will be forever grateful for his service. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1532-E1533] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] APPLAUDING MATT WEINSTEIN FOR HIS SERVICE TO ALABAMA'S FIRST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT ______ HON.

DAVID SCOTT of georgia in the house of representatives Monday, October 26, 2015 Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss a disease that is important to my family, breast cancer. This devastating disease strikes 1 in 8 women, affecting our mothers, wives, daughters, sisters, and loved ones. In Georgia, breast cancer is a particularly serious problem as it is the most common type of cancer and the second most deadly type of cancer among women in the state. According to the nonprofit Sisters by Choice, 6000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer, and 1000 will die from breast cancer in Georgia each year. This epidemic is made worse by the fact that 19 percent of Georgians do not have health insurance, 33 percent of Georgia counties do not have mammography machines, and 75 percent of Georgia counties are medically underserved. Due to slow detection caused by these facts, 30 percent of breast cancers will have metastasized and be present in other places throughout the body by the time they are found. Despite the disheartening statistics about cancer, I know that there is still hope. Detection and treatment advances found in the past few years will help to both lessen the risk of cancer and win the fight to eradicate cancer. I am pleased that Georgia is a hub for medical innovation in the fight against cancer, utilizing public and private partnerships to research the disease. Moreover, the CDC and the internationally regarded cancer centers at Emory University, Georgia Regents University, the University of Georgia, Northside Hospital, and other centers throughout the state have pioneered effective, yet minimally invasive ways to treat this disease. Additionally, the CDC has contributed to this effort through public outreach programs aimed at improving surveillance so that cancers can be caught early. In addition, the internationally-renowned Winship Cancer Institute at Emory University has tested 75 percent of FDA- approved new cancer treatments in the past seven years. At another renowned institution, researchers at the University of Georgia have discovered a vaccine that attacks a previously unassailable protein. This vaccine is vitally important because this protein is found in the majority of killing cancers and in the ``triple-negative'' tumors common in a particularly dangerous variant of breast cancer. In addition to the work done by the professional research institutions in Georgia, I am proud that the Georgia community has come together to support those who are suffering from not just breast cancer, but cancers of all types. For instance, Sisters by Choice, a nonprofit organization centered around helping underinsured and underserved women to find and treat breast cancer, is working on creating a mobile clinic that will provide screenings, diagnostic services, access to clinical trials, and other resources to these disadvantaged populations. In addition, wonderful nonprofit organizations working with cancer centers, such as the Cancer Support Community Atlanta and the Treehouse Gang, an organization based around supporting children with a parent suffering from cancer, provide vital assistance and hope to cancer sufferers and their families. Finally, the Atlanta 2-Day Walk has raised $11 million in just 13 years to help find new ways to treat and prevent breast cancer. Through these initiatives, and the hard work of the cancer centers in Georgia, I know that definite progress has been and will continue to be made to treat and eradicate this deadly disease. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1533] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF MEDICAL RESEARCH IN GEORGIA ______ HON.

Through these initiatives, and the hard work of the cancer centers in Georgia, I know that definite progress has been and will continue to be made to treat and eradicate this deadly disease. ____________________",package_114_50.csv,3847,3847,3917,"[congressional record volume 161, number 157 (monday, october 26, 2015)] [extensions of remarks] [page e1533] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] in honor of the achievements of medical research in georgia ______ hon. david scott of georgia in the house of representatives monday, october 26, 2015 mr. david scott of georgia. mr. speaker, i rise today to discuss a disease that is important to my family, breast cancer. this devastating disease strikes 1 in 8 women, affecting our mothers, wives, daughters, sisters, and loved ones. in georgia, breast cancer is a particularly serious problem as it is the most common type of cancer and the second most deadly type of cancer among women in the state. according to the nonprofit sisters by choice, 6000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer, and 1000 will die from breast cancer in georgia each year. this epidemic is made worse by the fact that 19 percent of georgians do not have health insurance, 33 percent of georgia counties do not have mammography machines, and 75 percent of georgia counties are medically underserved. due to slow detection caused by these facts, 30 percent of breast cancers will have metastasized and be present in other places throughout the body by the time they are found. despite the disheartening statistics about cancer, i know that there is still hope. detection and treatment advances found in the past few years will help to both lessen the risk of cancer and win the fight to eradicate cancer. i am pleased that georgia is a hub for medical innovation in the fight against cancer, utilizing public and private partnerships to research the disease. moreover, the cdc and the internationally regarded cancer centers at emory university, georgia regents university, the university of georgia, northside hospital, and other centers throughout the state have pioneered effective, yet minimally invasive ways to treat this disease. additionally, the cdc has contributed to this effort through public outreach programs aimed at improving surveillance so that cancers can be caught early. in addition, the internationally-renowned winship cancer institute at emory university has tested 75 percent of fda- approved new cancer treatments in the past seven years. at another renowned institution, researchers at the university of georgia have discovered a vaccine that attacks a previously unassailable protein. this vaccine is vitally important because this protein is found in the majority of killing cancers and in the ``triple-negative'' tumors common in a particularly dangerous variant of breast cancer. in addition to the work done by the professional research institutions in georgia, i am proud that the georgia community has come together to support those who are suffering from not just breast cancer, but cancers of all types. for instance, sisters by choice, a nonprofit organization centered around helping underinsured and underserved women to find and treat breast cancer, is working on creating a mobile clinic that will provide screenings, diagnostic services, access to clinical trials, and other resources to these disadvantaged populations. in addition, wonderful nonprofit organizations working with cancer centers, such as the cancer support community atlanta and the treehouse gang, an organization based around supporting children with a parent suffering from cancer, provide vital assistance and hope to cancer sufferers and their families. finally, the atlanta 2-day walk has raised $11 million in just 13 years to help find new ways to treat and prevent breast cancer. through these initiatives, and the hard work of the cancer centers in georgia, i know that definite progress has been and will continue to be made to treat and eradicate this deadly disease. ____________________",3847

JACKIE SPEIER of california in the house of representatives Monday, October 26, 2015 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Patricia Miljanich, a departing member of the Board of Trustees of the San Mateo County Community College District. Ms. Miljanich has served the public in her position since 1995, and she has been part of a board of trustees that has created over 20 years an outstanding college system for residents. When Trustee Miljanich began her service, the district had decades- old buildings, stagnant enrollment, and curriculum that needed upgrading. She and her fellow trustees went to work hiring new staff, passing several bonds, and overseeing the resurrection of a community gem. In addition to her role as a trustee, Patricia Miljanich has served on the board of the nonprofit corporation overseeing an innovative housing project on the campuses of the community colleges. She has also served as a board member of the foundation supporting the community colleges. As a result of her leadership and that of her board colleagues, the San Mateo County Community Colleges now have stunning state-of-the-art campuses, classes that offer a broad path to a four year institution, and several shorter programs that prepare students to be job ready through two year degrees and certificates. As a pathway to lifelong learning and prosperity, the college district reflects the vision of Trustee Miljanich that every young person, and many who are in mid- career or retirement, should view the community colleges as their ongoing ticket to a rigorous education. Ms. Miljanich has another side to her public service beyond her years as a trustee. At one point she served as a field representative for a member of the state assembly, and as a legal advocate for low income children while Director of Legal Services for Children in San Francisco. Most of all, Ms. Miljanich has distinguished herself as a remarkable leader of the nonprofit Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA), an organization that pairs caring adults with children who are in the protection of the courts when their parents cannot care for them. There is no question that Patricia Miljanich, in this role, has saved the lives of many children. CASA is an extraordinary organization which brings out the best of caring volunteers and matches it with the most basic need of a child: to have a friend and advocate during times of tremendous insecurity and trauma. Patricia is a graduate of the University of Virginia and the University of San Francisco School of Law. Her greatest archievements, no doubt, are her four children, Nicolene Mefford, Martine Miljanich, Peter Miljanich, and Sophia Miljanich, and her four grandchildren. Mr. Speaker and members, Patricia Miljanich is retiring from the Board of Trustees of the San Mateo County Community College District, but she will remain very active in our community. She put in countless hours during her 20 years of service to the district, and offered decades of additional help to children and our most vulnerable residents. As she leaves, the wind at her back is the force of [[Page E1534]] those praying for her to succeed in her next adventure. As she will experience shortly, this wind will likely be a gale force event, so beloved is Patricia Miljanich in San Mateo County. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1533-E1534] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF PATRICIA MILJANICH ______ HON.

JUAN VARGAS of california in the house of representatives Monday, October 26, 2015 Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and commend the 25th anniversary of the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanics. The initiative, established in 1990, has sought to address the educational disparities faced by the Hispanic community. This year, the White House launched the Bright Spots catalog to commemorate the initiative's success. This newly created resource honors organizations around the country significantly furthering the educational attainment of the Hispanic community. While there are 230 programs included in the catalog, I would like to honor three organizations in California's 51 District: Barrio Logan College Institute, Reality Changers, and the San Ysidro Vanguard Education Foundation. Barrio Logan College Institute, established in 2007, is a nonprofit working to provide disadvantaged students with the opportunity to attend college. The organization begins working with students in third grade and continues providing support and guidance throughout high school. Since its creation, 100 percent of its graduates have gone on to college. Reality Changers was founded in 2001 in an attempt to better prepare disadvantaged Hispanic youth for college. By establishing various support systems and college readiness programs, the organization has seen 97 percent of its students become first generation college students. San Ysidro Vanguard Education Foundation was created in 2012 to address the racial and ethnic disparities within the San Ysidro School District. The organization focuses on early learning, college access, Latino teacher recruitment, and STEM education. Again, I would like to extend my admiration and sincere appreciation for all the work that these groups continue to do for our community. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1534] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WHITE HOUSE INITIATIVE ON EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE FOR HISPANICS ______ HON.

IRVING J. SELIKOFF, A PIONEER IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE ______ HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of new york in the house of representatives Monday, October 26, 2015 Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Dr. Irving J. Selikoff (1915-1992), whose ground breaking work created the field of environmental and occupational medicine. Dr. Selikoff established the first hospital division of occupational and environmental medicine in the nation at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, developing clinical programs that have cared for thousands of workers impacted by occupational diseases. This month, Mount Sinai cut the ribbon on the Selikoff Centers for Occupational Health, named in his honor. Revered as the father of occupational health, Dr. Selikoff's research and tireless advocacy has saved millions of lives. In 1952, working with Dr. Edward H. Robitzek, he demonstrated that isonazaid was an effective treatment for tuberculosis. He subsequently opened a clinic for lung patients in Paterson, N.J., where he saw 17 workers from an asbestos plant with similar symptoms. Within a few years, 15 were dead, 14 of them from lung cancer, asbestosis or mesothelioma. This led him to begin investigating the cause of their illnesses. His research expanded and he began studying the health of other insulation workers, often collaborating with labor unions. Despite heavy resistance from the industry, he ultimately recruited 17,800 workers for a survey that documented widespread illness among those who had worked with asbestos. Even people who had been exposed for less than a week had lung scarring 30 years later. Dr. Selikoff's research on asbestos disease and his expert testimony shaped public policy and improved working conditions for America's working men and women. Thanks to his careful research, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration imposed safeguards for workers starting in the 1970s. His work also prompted the Environmental Protection Administration to implement regulations regarding asbestos products; however, the United States remains one of the few developed nations that do not ban asbestos. Dr. Selikoff's tireless advocacy led to a fundamental understanding in this country that workers have the right to safe working conditions. Over the span of his 50-year career until his death in 1992, he taught two generations of physicians, published over 380 scientific works, and publicized the health risks associated with toxins found in everyday work environments. He wrote more than 350 scientific articles and two books, edited 11 books and founded two journals. In 1982 Dr. Selikoff, Cesare Maltoni and other eminent scientists founded the Collegium Ramazzini. Comprised of 180 internationally renowned experts in occupational and environmental health, the Collegium Ramazzini helps social and political leaders understand how scientific discoveries impact public health. Researchers at Mount Sinai and around the world continue his work and are leaders in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of workplace injuries and illnesses. After 9/11, when people who had worked at Ground Zero began to experience disproportionate levels of illness, Mount Sinai began to do research on the cause. Their work helped document the need for a program to provide care for people who had been made sick by the toxins released on 9/11. Mount Sinai was naturally selected as one of the Centers of Excellence to treat their illnesses under the direction of Dr. Philip J. Landrigan. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in applauding the extraordinary work and legacy of Dr. Irving J. Selikoff. His focus on the health impacts of workplace conditions has benefitted millions of American workers. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1535] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN TRIBUTE TO DR.

JACKIE SPEIER of california in the house of representatives Monday, October 26, 2015 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a broadcast legend who is celebrating his 40th anniversary at KGO Newstalk 810 today and who will be inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in November. Ronn Owens is a household name in the Bay Area and beyond, a master in his field, and a remarkably talented, opinionated and intellectually curious man whom I am proud to call a good friend. I have spent many hours on the air with Ronn and he is always tough, thoughtful, informed and unpredictable. He has honed his skills in thousands of interviews with guests in the hot seat, including President Barack Obama, Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, actor Steve Martin, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, 49er quarterback Joe Montana, singer Tony Bennett and a long list of Secretaries of State, CIA Directors, mayors and community leaders. His longevity and style on the air have earned him many prestigious awards: The Bay Area Radio Hall of Fame, the National Association of Broadcaster's Marconi Award twice, Talkers Magazine's Top 25 Greatest Radio Talk Show Host of All Time, and now the National Radio Hall of Fame where he will be joining the likes of Edward R. Murrow, Bob Hope and Terry Gross. Ronn was born Ronald Lowenstein on October 17, 1945 in New York City. He graduated from Temple University in Philadelphia in 1968 and launched his broadcast career hosting radio programs in Atlanta, Miami, Cleveland and Philadelphia. In 1975 he moved to San Francisco and began his four decade run at KGO radio. Today, he remains the only weekday talk radio host on the station and has a regular audience of half a million listeners. While Ronn is very vocal about his opinions--he also wrote a book titled Voice of Reason: Why the Left and Right Are Wrong--he is the first to admit when he is wrong. Facts matter and he is dedicated to seeking the truth. Last year, Ronn revealed a challenging personal truth to his listeners. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease over a decade ago. He decided to go public after the tragic death of Robin Williams who was diagnosed with Parkinson's. Ronn hasn't let his symptoms get in the way of doing his job. Recently he joked before surgery, ``If I come out and say, `you know, that Sarah Palin would make a heckuva president,' we'll know something went wrong.'' He meets the challenges of his disease with great courage and humor. Ronn started his radio career when analog reel-to-reel tape recorders, cartridges and [[Page E1535]] turntables were modern, but he has stayed with the times, in fact he is an early adopter and loves technology. I remember when at a visit to his studio I pulled out my Blackberry to take a photo, and he burst out laughing making fun of my ``antique'' phone, I promptly bought an iPhone. The love for radio and story-telling has shaped Ronn's professional and personal life. He is married to former KGO and KCBS anchor Jan Black and they have two truly accomplished daughters, Sarah and Laura. Mr. Speaker, I ask the House of Representatives to rise with me to honor Ronn Owens, an icon in radio news and commentary, for his extraordinary career. He has kept me and countless public officials on our political toes and will continue to do so for a long time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1534-E1535] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF RONN OWENS ______ HON.

JACKIE SPEIER of california in the house of representatives Monday, October 26, 2015 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a broadcast legend who is celebrating his 40th anniversary at KGO Newstalk 810 today and who will be inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in November. Ronn Owens is a household name in the Bay Area and beyond, a master in his field, and a remarkably talented, opinionated and intellectually curious man whom I am proud to call a good friend. I have spent many hours on the air with Ronn and he is always tough, thoughtful, informed and unpredictable. He has honed his skills in thousands of interviews with guests in the hot seat, including President Barack Obama, Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, actor Steve Martin, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, 49er quarterback Joe Montana, singer Tony Bennett and a long list of Secretaries of State, CIA Directors, mayors and community leaders. His longevity and style on the air have earned him many prestigious awards: The Bay Area Radio Hall of Fame, the National Association of Broadcaster's Marconi Award twice, Talkers Magazine's Top 25 Greatest Radio Talk Show Host of All Time, and now the National Radio Hall of Fame where he will be joining the likes of Edward R. Murrow, Bob Hope and Terry Gross. Ronn was born Ronald Lowenstein on October 17, 1945 in New York City. He graduated from Temple University in Philadelphia in 1968 and launched his broadcast career hosting radio programs in Atlanta, Miami, Cleveland and Philadelphia. In 1975 he moved to San Francisco and began his four decade run at KGO radio. Today, he remains the only weekday talk radio host on the station and has a regular audience of half a million listeners. While Ronn is very vocal about his opinions--he also wrote a book titled Voice of Reason: Why the Left and Right Are Wrong--he is the first to admit when he is wrong. Facts matter and he is dedicated to seeking the truth. Last year, Ronn revealed a challenging personal truth to his listeners. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease over a decade ago. He decided to go public after the tragic death of Robin Williams who was diagnosed with Parkinson's. Ronn hasn't let his symptoms get in the way of doing his job. Recently he joked before surgery, ``If I come out and say, `you know, that Sarah Palin would make a heckuva president,' we'll know something went wrong.'' He meets the challenges of his disease with great courage and humor.

JEFF DENHAM of california in the house of representatives Monday, October 26, 2015 Mr. DENHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, on behalf of myself and Congressman McClintock to acknowledge and honor Dan Jensen who announced his retirement as President of Delaware North at Yosemite. In that position, he is responsible for overseeing lodging, food service, retail, transportation and guest recreation in Yosemite National Park provided under contract to the National Park Service. Born and raised in Visalia, a central California community, located in a rich agricultural region, Dan attended college at UC Riverside and graduated in 1971 with a Bachelors of Arts in Economics. In addition he holds an MBA from University of California, Los Angeles. Immediately after graduating, he joined the Los Angeles office of Price Waterhouse, the world's largest professional services firm, where he worked in the audit services division. In 1993, Dan began his career in the theme park industry as the executive vice president and general manager of Universal Studios in Florida. He was instrumental in the expansion of the major resort destination which included a second theme park, three themed hotels and a nighttime entertainment complex known as City Walk. In 2001, Dan's theme park career went overseas, where he became the executive vice president and chief operating officer of the newly opened park Universal Studios in Japan. During Dan's time with Universal Studios Japan, it had the most successful first year of operations in the history of theme parks. Participating in a cultural exchange program in Russia in 1998, gave Dan the opportunity to visit various national parks throughout Russia. The purpose was to gain valuable insight into business and social issues that would contribute to improved funding for Russia's national park system. This made him an ideal candidate for his extensive role as President of Delaware North located near one of California's most established National Parks. Having worked for the previous concessioner from 1979 to 1992 in various financial and operational roles, Dan returned to Yosemite in 2006 as President of Delaware North at Yosemite. The global leading company's operations in Yosemite includes 1,350 hotel rooms, 21 food service operations and 16 retail locations as well as a variety of recreational activities. Despite Dan's extensive work load, he finds the time to be an active participant in the community of Yosemite. He was on the board of trustees and the council of the Yosemite Conservancy, chairman of the Yosemite/Mariposa Tourism Bureau and a member of the University of California at Merced Board of trustees. Dan is an active supporter of NatureBridge, an educational nonprofit organization that provides outdoor environmental education in Yosemite as well as other national parks. Dan and his wife Susan, parents of two now adult children, reside in the Yosemite Valley. Mr. Speaker, please join Congressman McClintock and I in honoring and commending the outstanding contributions made to Yosemite by the President of Delaware North, Dan Jensen. We wish him continued success in his retirement. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1535] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING DAN JENSEN ______ HON.

NYDIA M. VELAZQUEZ of new york in the house of representatives Monday, October 26, 2015 Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, today I extend a heartfelt appreciation of Joan Millman for her tireless work for the residents of the 52nd Assembly District over the last two decades. ``Brownstone Joan'' has represented us in Albany as a reformer to challenge the establishment. She has lent her voice to those who too often are neglected or ignored in the political process. Joan has been a trailblazer like our beloved Eileen Dugan before her, and today our new Assemblywoman Jo Anne Simon continues that tradition. Joan Millman has been a steadfast and dedicated champion of seniors, children and the most vulnerable among us. Among her many achievements, she has been critical to making the dream of Brooklyn Bridge Park a reality.

CREC-2015-10-26-pt1-PgE1536-3,CREC-2015-10-26,114,IN RECOGNITION OF 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE METROPOLITAN CLUB,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1536] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE METROPOLITAN CLUB ______ HON. JACKIE SPEIER of california in the house of representatives Monday, October 26, 2015 Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the 100th anniversary of a landmark in San Francisco that is beloved as an important gathering place for women and as a historic building. The Metropolitan Club at 640 Sutter Street today serves over 1,000 members and countless non- profits that use the beautiful building for meetings and events. The Metropolitan Club started in 1912-1914 as a vision of a group of Bay Area women who were determined to build an athletic club for women similar in size, grandeur and services to those available to men. These ladies were active in civic and charitable organizations and the preparations for the 1915 Panama Pacifica International Exposition. On October 25, 1915 their vision became a reality and the Women's Athletic Club of San Francisco was incorporated as the first women's athletic club west of Chicago. For a century now, the club has been a special place for women of all ages to pursue physical and intellectual fitness. The historic building was designed by Bliss & Faville, a prominent architectural firm that is responsible for landmarks such as the Bank of California, the Geary Theater, the Masonic Temple, Southern Pacific headquarters, China Basin, the Marines' Memorial Club and the University Club. After a major addition to the clubhouse was finished in 1923, the San Francisco Chronicle lauded the club as ``unlike anything in the United States maintained for and by women.'' The unique character of the Metropolitan Club has made it a desirable place for historic events. It became the unofficial headquarters for visiting women journalists who covered the signing of the United Nations Charter in San Francisco in 1945. In 1948, it was the only local club represented at the first Western meeting of UNESCO. In 2004, the Metropolitan Club received one of the most prestigious honors from the U.S. Department of the Interior; it was nominated to be listed in the National Register of Historic Places which is the official list of the Nation's historic places worthy of preservation. The Metropolitan Club was described as a ``place where the women who formed a club and generations of San Francisco women after them have met their friends, exercised, dined, played cards, celebrated holidays, attended lectures, entertained others and engaged in all the activities of the club.'' The same year, the 640 Heritage Preservation Foundation was created as a 502(c)3 with the mission to preserve the club's historic building and important heritage. Major seismic and life-saving renovations were completed in 2009 to prepare the club for its second century as the ``House that Women Built.'' Mr. Speaker, I ask that the House of Representatives join me in saying happy 100th birthday to the Metropolitan Club which has touched the lives of countless San Francisco families and helped shape the history of our beautiful city by the bay. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1536] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE METROPOLITAN CLUB ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate an outstanding school in my district that is being honored as a 2015 National Blue Ribbon School. It is a pleasure to congratulate Oak Trace Elementary School in Westfield, Indiana in celebration of this special occasion. The National Blue Ribbon designation, given by the United States Department of Education, is awarded to both public and private schools across our great nation. Started by President Reagan and given annually since 1982, the award celebrates great American schools that achieve very high learning standards or are making significant improvements in the academic achievements of their students. In my district and across the country, the award recognizes the great educators, students, and parents who have worked so hard to ensure Indiana's children reach their full potential and achieve academic success. For all of these reasons and many more, I am so proud that Oak Trace Elementary School is receiving this prestigious designation. It is a wonderful acknowledgement of the school's commitment to providing young Hoosiers an exceptional education. While hundreds of schools nationwide were nominated, only 335 schools were designated as 2015 National Blue Ribbon Schools, making this recognition all the more impressive. Serving developmental preschool children through fourth grade, Oak Trace Elementary School provides its students with a safe and exciting learning environment. Oak Trace is a C.L.A.S.S. (Connecting Learning Assures Successful Students) school that implements a non-cognitive curriculum focused on doing the right thing and treating people right. They offer a unique learning atmosphere that focuses on building life skills, measures performance by individual student growth, and offers plenty of opportunities to give back to the community. Through differentiated instruction, students achieve well above the national average and consistently place in the top 5 percent of all students in Indiana. I applaud its administrators and teachers for their focus on individual growth and commitment to ensuring its students engage with the Hoosier community. [[Page E1537]] As an advocate for education and youth, I also want to acknowledge how important it is to our nation's future to encourage and raise a new generation of Americans who have the skills and knowledge to succeed both in and out of the classroom.

According to press reports, DiFusco-Funk earned her Bachelor of Arts in Education and her Master of Education at Boston College, and in 2013, earned her National Board Certification in Literacy. She is a 12- year veteran of the classroom who has been teaching in Salem City Schools for five years.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate an outstanding school in my district that is being honored as a 2015 National Blue Ribbon School. It is a pleasure to congratulate Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic School in Carmel, Indiana in celebration of this special occasion. The National Blue Ribbon designation, given by the United States Department of Education, is awarded to both public and private schools across our great nation. Started by President Reagan and given annually since 1982, the award celebrates great American schools that achieve very high learning standards or are making significant improvements in the academic achievements of their students. In my district and across the country, the award recognizes the great educators, students, and parents who have worked so hard to ensure Indiana's children reach their full potential and achieve academic success. For all of these reasons and many more, I am so proud that Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic School is receiving this prestigious designation. It is a wonderful acknowledgement of the school's commitment to providing young Hoosiers an exceptional education. While hundreds of schools nationwide were nominated, only 335 schools were designated as 2015 National Blue Ribbon Schools. Of the 335 schools, Our Lady of Mount Carmel was 1 of 50 private schools to receive recognition, making this recognition all the more impressive. Serving children from kindergarten through eighth grade, Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic School provides its students with an outstanding education in both academics and the Catholic faith. It is a Four Star School, awarded by the state of Indiana. The school achieved this designation by placing in the top 25th percentile of schools in three ISTEP-based categories. Our Lady consistently provides excellence in education by facilitating a Christ-centered educational community that creates a vibrant learning community, provides opportunities to serve others, and prepares students for lifelong learning. As a mother whose children attended Catholic school, I applaud Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic School for its work to ensure its students engage in significant acts of community service and remain dedicated to carrying out the mission of Jesus Christ. As an advocate for education and youth, I also want to acknowledge how important it is to our nation's future to encourage and raise a new generation of Americans who have the skills and knowledge to succeed both in and out of the classroom. Students like those at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic School give me hope that we will accomplish this vital mission. Their outstanding work is an inspiration to students, educators, and parents across the nation. Once again, congratulations to Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic School. I am very proud of you.

BRAD ASHFORD of nebraska in the house of representatives Monday, October 26, 2015 Mr. ASHFORD. Mr. Speaker, today I'd like to recognize CQuence Health Group, named number one on the list of ``Best Places to Work in Healthcare'' by Modern Healthcare. Ranked on their commitment to wellness, balance, and workplace fitness, Modern Healthcare definitively found CQuence was on top this year. This type of recognition is not unusual for CQuence, who were also named ``Employee Voice Award'' this year as well. In 2014 they were ranked Top 10 ``Best Places to Work'' and given the ``Golden Well Workplace Award''. The list of awards and accomplishments spans back all the way to 2009, demonstrating CQuence's real commitment to a better work place. Not only am I proud that CQuence's 31 employees work in my district, I'm also proud to represent this innovative leadership. CEO Mike Cassling clearly understands that the way we work has dramatically changed, so must we change the way we deal with stress and quality of life. Studies have shown workplace stress is costing our economy money: from health care costs, low productivity, to job turnover, stress negatively impacts businesses everywhere. CQuence's approach to work life balance and employee wellness will certainly change their employees' lives, which in turn will change the lives of their families and friends. Soon, this employee wellness first approach will permeate into the Omaha community, the greater state of Nebraska, and our country. I hope to see more businesses follow this example. If anyone is seeking a new job, I encourage them to see what Nebraska has to offer. Our low unemployment to our high employee satisfaction, Nebraska leads the way. I applaud Mike and CQuence for their award winning wellness programs and I am excited to see how they continue to enrich their lives next year. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 157 (Monday, October 26, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1538] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CQUENCE HEALTH GROUP: BEST PLACE TO WORK IN HEALTH CARE _____ HON.
