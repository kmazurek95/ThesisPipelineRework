At this hour, my heart is full with gratitude. I wish to thank the people of Ohio's Eighth District for giving me the opportunity to serve, my staff for being the linchpins of that service, and my colleagues for honoring me with their trust by electing me their Speaker. Together, we banned earmarks, cut spending by more than $2 trillion, made the first entitlement reforms in nearly two decades, and made it possible for kids in Washington, D.C.'s toughest neighborhoods to go to great schools. Put another way, we did the right things for the right reasons, and good things happened. It has been an honor to serve. Sincerely, John A. Boehner. (Representative John A.

I look forward to Speaker Ryan's conservative leadership, cited in the National Journal Daily as ``chief Democratic villain in Washington.'' He was also condemned as a ``budget-slashing fiend.'' Despite these attacks, his service will advance meaningful, conservative change for the American people, limiting government, and expanding freedom. Congress has a positive leader, as we work to promote a strong national defense of peace through strength.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3505) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to improve the management and administration of the security clearance processes throughout the Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 3505 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Homeland Security Clearance Management and Administration Act''. SEC. 2. SECURITY CLEARANCE MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION.

Such training shall include guidance on factors for determining eligibility for access to classified information and eligibility to hold a national security position. ``SEC. 712. REVIEW OF POSITION DESIGNATIONS. ``(a) In General.--Not later than July 6, 2017, and every five years thereafter, the Secretary shall review all sensitivity level designations of national security positions (pursuant to part 1400 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, or similar successor regulation) at the Department. ``(b) Determination.--If during the course of a review required under subsection (a), the Secretary determines that a change in the sensitivity level of a position that affects the need for an individual to obtain access to classified information is warranted, such access shall be administratively adjusted and an appropriate level periodic reinvestigation completed, as necessary. ``(c) Congressional Reporting.--Upon completion of each review required under subsection (a), the Secretary shall report to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate on the findings of each such review, including the number of positions by classification level and by component and office of the Department in which the Secretary made a determination in accordance with subsection (b) to-- ``(1) require access to classified information; ``(2) no longer require access to classified information; or ``(3) otherwise require a different level of access to classified information. ``SEC. 713. AUDITS. ``Beginning not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this section, the Inspector General of the Department shall conduct regular audits of compliance of the Department with part 1400 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, or similar successor regulation. ``SEC. 714.

UNIFORM ADJUDICATION, SUSPENSION, DENIAL, AND REVOCATION. ``Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this section, the Secretary, in consultation with the Homeland Security Advisory Committee, shall develop a plan to achieve greater uniformity within the Department with respect to the adjudication of eligibility of an individual for access to classified information that are consistent with the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Access to Classified Information published on December 29, 2005, or similar successor regulation. The Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate the plan. The plan shall consider the following: ``(1) Mechanisms to foster greater compliance with the uniform Department adjudication, suspension, denial, and revocation standards by the head of each component and office of the Department with the authority to adjudicate access to classified information. ``(2) The establishment of an internal appeals panel responsible for final national security clearance denial and revocation determinations that is comprised of designees who are career, supervisory employees from components and offices of the Department with the authority to adjudicate access to classified information and headquarters, as appropriate. ``SEC. 716. DATA PROTECTION. ``The Secretary shall ensure that all information received for the adjudication of eligibility of an individual for access to classified information that is consistent with the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Access to Classified Information published on December 29, 2005, or similar successor regulation, and is protected against misappropriation. ``SEC. 717. REFERENCE. ``Except as otherwise provided, for purposes of this subtitle, any reference to the `Department' includes all components and offices of the Department.''. (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended-- (1) by inserting before the item relating to section 701 the following new item: ``Subtitle A--Headquarters Activities''; and (2) by inserting after the item relating to section 707 the following new items: ``Subtitle B--Security Clearances ``Sec. 711. Designation of national security sensitive and public trust positions. ``Sec. 712. Review of position designations. ``Sec. 713. Audits. ``Sec. 714. Reporting. ``Sec. 715. Uniform adjudication, suspension, denial, and revocation. ``Sec. 716. Data protection. ``Sec. 717. Reference.''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. King) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. General Leave Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the legislation. In 2013, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper called the number of individuals with clearances ``too high.'' In a memo to government agencies, Director Clapper expressed his concern with the growing number of individuals with access to classified information, particularly TS/SCI clearances. H.R. 3505 complements the bill the House just passed, H.R. 3361. One important element of any Insider Threat Program is knowing who has access to classified information and who has a need to know specific information. This bill requires the DHS Secretary to conduct a review of all positions within the Department designated as positions of national security to confirm whether or not those positions continue to require security clearances. This is an example of good government. The bill directs the Department to conduct an inventory of its positions that require security clearances and assess what positions may be duplicative or are no longer necessary. As we know, security clearances are costly to investigate, adjudicate, and maintain. This bill will ensure that DHS conducts a thorough screening of its workforce needs and reduces the number of positions, if determined appropriate. The bill introduced by Ranking Member Thompson is an example of the accounting that each Federal department should be conducting today and will lead to a more lean and effective Department of Homeland Security in the future. I urge support for the bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3505, the Department of Homeland Security Clearance Management and Administration Act. Mr. Speaker, I want to start off by thanking the chairman of the Counterterrorism and Intelligence Subcommittee, Mr. King, as well as Chairman McCaul, for their support of my bill. I introduced H.R. 3505, the Department of Homeland Security Clearance Management and Administration Act, to make specific reforms in how the Department manages its security clearance process. Specifically, H.R. 3505 addresses how DHS carries out the complex and extensive tasks of identifying positions that warrant security clearances, investigating candidates for clearances, and administering its clearance adjudications, denials, suspensions, revocations, and appeals process. Since September 11, there has been a massive proliferation of original and derivative classified materials across the Federal Government. Along with the enormous growth of classified material holdings has come a sizeable growth in the number of Federal positions requiring security clearances. H.R. 3505 reflects recent regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to help ensure that Federal agencies make correct designations for national security positions and, in turn, avoid the costly exercise of recruiting, investigating, and hiring an individual at a clearance level and salary well above what is necessary. H.R. 3505 seeks to put DHS on a path of right-sizing the position designations for its workforce. Specifically, my bill directs the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to ensure that the sensitivity levels of national security positions are designated appropriately across the Department and its components. It also requires the Department's Chief Security Officer to audit national security positions periodically to ensure that such security designations are still appropriate. Additionally, the bill requires the Department to develop a plan to ensure that adjudications of eligibility for a security clearance are done accurately across the Department. Lastly, in response to the growing security threat from data breaches, this act also provides safeguards for the protection of the applicant's personal information. Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned, my bill seeks to take targeted steps at improving critical aspects of how the Department of Homeland Security administers its security clearance program. If enacted, H.R. 3505 would make DHS a leader among Federal agencies [[Page H7355]] with respect to security clearance and position designation practices. I ask for my colleagues' support. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3505. I commend the ranking member, the gentleman from Mississippi, for authoring this legislation. I am proud to support it. It is a commonsense, good-government bill that will reduce waste and improve security. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3505 the ``Fusion Center Enhancement Act,'' which would guarantee improvement of security for the Department of Homeland Security. This bill requires the Homeland Security Department to provide training to appropriate staff of the Department to determine eligibility for access to classified information. At least 88 DHS workers have been on administrative leave pending resolution of claims against them, according to the office of Senator Charles Grassley (R-Iowa). Four workers had been on leave for three years or more with another 17 on leave for two years or more. The 88 were placed on leave for a variety of reasons. Amongst those reasons it was noted that 13 were placed on leave due to security clearance issues. Earlier this year officials said that a database holding sensitive security clearance information on millions of prior, current, as well as potential federal employees and contractors was compromised, via a Chinese Breach. That database was also breached last year by the Chinese in a separate incident. The bill will ensure that: 1. The Secretary will review all sensitivity level designations of national security positions; 2. Access shall be administratively adjusted and an appropriate level periodic reinvestigation completed, as necessary; and 3. The Inspector General of the Department shall conduct regular audits. With cyber security threats on the rise across the world, and our continued dependence on technology we must be ever vigilant of the threats that we face. It is for these reasons, as well as the previously mentioned cases of threats to DHS security clearance, that I seek the support of my colleagues today to support H.R. 3505. I am confident that my colleagues will heed my advice and realize the need for the enactment of H.R. 3505. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. King) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3505. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H7353-H7355] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY CLEARANCE MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION ACT Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3505) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to improve the management and administration of the security clearance processes throughout the Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. King) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. General Leave Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the legislation. In 2013, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper called the number of individuals with clearances ``too high.'' In a memo to government agencies, Director Clapper expressed his concern with the growing number of individuals with access to classified information, particularly TS/SCI clearances. H.R. 3505 complements the bill the House just passed, H.R. 3361. One important element of any Insider Threat Program is knowing who has access to classified information and who has a need to know specific information. This bill requires the DHS Secretary to conduct a review of all positions within the Department designated as positions of national security to confirm whether or not those positions continue to require security clearances. This is an example of good government. The bill directs the Department to conduct an inventory of its positions that require security clearances and assess what positions may be duplicative or are no longer necessary. As we know, security clearances are costly to investigate, adjudicate, and maintain. This bill will ensure that DHS conducts a thorough screening of its workforce needs and reduces the number of positions, if determined appropriate. The bill introduced by Ranking Member Thompson is an example of the accounting that each Federal department should be conducting today and will lead to a more lean and effective Department of Homeland Security in the future. I urge support for the bill. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3505, the Department of Homeland Security Clearance Management and Administration Act.

control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from new york. general leave mr. king of new york. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from new york? there was no objection. mr. king of new york. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in support of the legislation. in 2013, director of national intelligence james clapper called the number of individuals with clearances ``too high.'' in a memo to government agencies, director clapper expressed his concern with the growing number of individuals with access to classified information, particularly ts/sci clearances. h.r. 3505 complements the bill the house just passed, h.r. 3361. one important element of any insider threat program is knowing who has access to classified information and who has a need to know specific information. this bill requires the dhs secretary to conduct a review of all positions within the department designated as positions of national security to confirm whether or not those positions continue to require security clearances. this is an example of good government. the bill directs the department to conduct an inventory of its positions that require security clearances and assess what positions may be duplicative or are no longer necessary. as we know, security clearances are costly to investigate, adjudicate, and maintain. this bill will ensure that dhs conducts a thorough screening of its workforce needs and reduces the number of positions, if determined appropriate. the bill introduced by ranking member thompson is an example of the accounting that each federal department should be conducting today and will lead to a more lean and effective department of homeland security in the future. i urge support for the bill. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. thompson of mississippi. i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 3505, the department of homeland security clearance management and administration act. mr. speaker, i want to start off by thanking the chairman of the counterterrorism and intelligence subcommittee, mr. king, as well as chairman mccaul, for their support of my bill. i introduced h.r. 3505, the department of homeland security clearance management and administration act, to make specific reforms in how the department manages its security clearance process. specifically, h.r. 3505 addresses how dhs carries out the complex and extensive tasks of identifying positions that warrant security clearances, investigating candidates for clearances, and administering its clearance adjudications, denials, suspensions, revocations, and appeals process. since september 11, there has been a massive proliferation of original and derivative classified materials across the federal government. along with the enormous growth of classified material holdings has come a sizeable growth in the number of federal positions requiring security clearances. h.r. 3505 reflects recent regulations issued by the office of personnel management and the office of the director of national intelligence to help ensure that federal agencies make correct designations for national security positions and, in turn, avoid the costly exercise of recruiting, investigating, and hiring an individual at a clearance level and salary well above what is necessary. h.r. 3505 seeks to put dhs on a path of right-sizing the position designations for its workforce. specifically, my bill directs the secretary of the department of homeland security to ensure that the sensitivity levels of national security positions are designated appropriately across the department and its components. it also requires the department's chief security officer to audit national security positions periodically to ensure that such security designations are still appropriate. additionally, the bill requires the department to develop a plan to ensure that adjudications of eligibility for a security clearance are done accurately across the department. lastly, in response to the growing security threat from data breaches, this act also provides safeguards for the protection of the applicant's personal information. mr. speaker, as i mentioned, my bill seeks to take targeted steps at improving critical aspects of how the department of homeland security administers its security clearance program. if enacted, h.r. 3505 would make dhs a leader among federal agencies [[page h7355]] with respect to security clearance and position designation practices. i ask for my colleagues' support. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. king of new york. mr. speaker, i once again urge my colleagues to support h.r. 3505. i commend the ranking member, the gentleman from mississippi, for authoring this legislation. i am proud to support it. it is a commonsense, good-government bill that will reduce waste and improve security. i yield back the balance of my time. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, as a senior member of the homeland security committee, and ranking member of the subcommittee on border and maritime security, i rise in strong support of h.r. 3505 the ``fusion center enhancement act,'' which would guarantee improvement of security for the department of homeland security. this bill requires the homeland security department to provide training to appropriate staff of the department to determine eligibility for access to classified information. at least 88 dhs workers have been on administrative leave pending resolution of claims against them, according to the office of senator charles grassley (r-iowa). four workers had been on leave for three years or more with another 17 on leave for two years or more. the 88 were placed on leave for a variety of reasons. amongst those reasons it was noted that 13 were placed on leave due to security clearance issues. earlier this year officials said that a database holding sensitive security clearance information on millions of prior, current, as well as potential federal employees and contractors was compromised, via a chinese breach. that database was also breached last year by the chinese in a separate incident. the bill will ensure that: 1. the secretary will review all sensitivity level designations of national security positions; 2. access shall be administratively adjusted and an appropriate level periodic reinvestigation completed, as necessary; and 3. the inspector general of the department shall conduct regular audits. with cyber security threats on the rise across the world, and our continued dependence on technology we must be ever vigilant of the threats that we face. it is for these reasons, as well as the previously mentioned cases of threats to dhs security clearance, that i seek the support of my colleagues today to support h.r. 3505. i am confident that my colleagues will heed my advice and realize the need for the enactment of h.r. 3505. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from new york (mr. king) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 3505. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",15366

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3361) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish the Insider Threat Program, and for other purposes, as amended.

(b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended by inserting after the item relating to section 103 the following new item: ``Sec. 104. Insider Threat Program.''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. King) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. General Leave Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. The bill under consideration ensures that the Department of Homeland Security has the authority and congressional mandate to create a robust Insider Threat Program. In the Manning and Snowden espionage scandals, two trusted insiders abused their access to classified information. When Aaron Alexis attacked the Washington Navy Yard, 12 Americans lost their lives. In the face of these insider threat scenarios, it is vital that government agencies have the tools to detect and disrupt future insider threat situations before damage is done. Unfortunately, all three were able to conduct their traitorous work undetected because the government had at one time vetted and granted them access to secure facilities and information systems. H.R. 3361 reinforces the message that a security clearance is a privilege granted to individuals who have pledged to protect the American people from threats domestically and abroad. Had investigators more thoroughly scrutinized Edward Snowden's background, they might have identified disturbing trends that made him unfit to hold a clearance of any kind and a potential insider threat to U.S. national security. Had Federal adjudicators had access to criminal history records from the Seattle Police Department, they would have been aware of Aaron Alexis' arrest in 2004 on firearms charges and potentially conducted a more rigorous screening of his background prior to authorizing him access to the Washington Navy Yard. Trusted insiders, going back to Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen, not only severely damaged national security, their traitorous actions led to the loss of life. In each case, the post-breach review highlighted that the previously trusted individual exhibited suspicious behavior, but it was not reported due to a lack of understanding by colleagues or failures in the reinvestigation process. In describing the new type of insider threat represented by Snowden and WikiLeaks, Michael Hayden correctly concluded that, ``in this new, modern, connected era, the trusted insider who betrays us is far more empowered to do damage far greater than these kinds of people were able to do in the past. And therefore we have to be even more vigilant.'' The Department of Homeland Security has over 280,000 employees, including tens of thousands with access to classified or sensitive information. The Department has an existing Insider Threat Program and is moving forward to increase security controls on internal systems, but much more remains to be done. The bill directs DHS to develop a strategy for the Department to identify, prevent, mitigate, and respond to insider threats, and requires DHS to ensure that personnel understand what workplace behavior may be indicative of a potential insider threat and how their activity on DHS networks will be monitored. The bill codifies a comprehensive Insider Threat Program at DHS that can be implemented throughout the Department and its component agencies and, most importantly, reinforces the importance of preventing future insider attacks. I want to thank Homeland Security Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member Thompson, Ranking Member Higgins, and Congressmen Katko, Donovan, and Barletta for working with me to bring this bill to the floor. The bill went through regular order and received bipartisan support during subcommittee and full committee consideration. I urge my colleagues to support this bill so we can establish a comprehensive, transparent DHS-wide Insider Threat Program that is a model for the public and private sectors. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 3361, the Department of Homeland Security Insider Threat and Mitigation Act of 2015. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3361, the Department of Homeland Security Insider Threat and Mitigation Act of 2015, authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to address the homeland and national security risk posed by trusted insiders. Typically, trusted insiders are given unrestricted access to mission- critical assets such as personnel, facilities, and computer networks. While DHS, like other Federal agencies, conducts extensive vetting of prospective employees, there remains a risk that someone who gains ``insider status'' exploits their position to damage the United States through espionage, terrorism, or even the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive national security information. As the ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security, I am supportive of the Department of Homeland Security's current Insider Threat Program. It is targeted at preventing and detecting when a vetted DHS employee or contractor with authorized access to U.S. Government resources, including personnel, facilities, information, equipment, networks, and systems, exploits such access for nefarious, terroristic, or criminal purposes. While I support the DHS program, I could not support this legislation when it was considered by the full committee because it did not include language to prevent the somewhat broad authority granted under this bill for being used by DHS to deploy ``continuous evaluation.'' Continuous evaluation is an automated system that constantly monitors public and private databases for information regarding the credit, criminal, and social media activities of certain individuals. The Defense Department has an extensive pilot underway, and I am concerned that Federal agencies, with the understandable urge to protect their IT systems and facilities, are racing to acquire this capability before knowing whether such costly systems are even effective. At this time, I would like to engage in a colloquy with the gentleman from New York (Mr. King) about some concerns I have with the prospect that the Department will use the authority under this act to establish a continuous evaluation program. {time} 1615 Would the gentleman agree that it is important that, prior to establishing any such program under which certain DHS employees would be subjected to ongoing automated credit, criminal, or social media monitoring, the Department engages Congress about not only the potential costs and benefits of such a program but what protections would be in place for workers subject to such program? I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. King). Mr. KING of New York. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Yes, I agree with the gentleman from Mississippi. The implementation of the Insider Threat Program, including a possible continuous evaluation component, needs congressional oversight and must be transparent. [[Page H7353]] I look forward to working with the gentleman from Mississippi on this issue as we go forward. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, we live at a time when the threats to our Nation are complex. None of us want to see someone exploit their access to DHS networks to carry out cybercrimes or other criminal activity. Even as DHS works to detect and prevent such threats, it is important that such activities be carried out in a transparent way so as not to compound the chronic morale challenges that exist within the workforce. Each time DHS considers making an adjustment to its Insider Threat Program, thoughtful consideration must be paid to whether the operational drawbacks and costs of such an adjustment outweigh the benefit of such change. That said, I commend General Taylor, the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis at DHS, for the attention he has given to the insider threat challenge and look forward to continuing to work with him to bolster security within the Department. I appreciate the gentleman from New York's cooperation and colloquy. I look forward to the successful passage and approval of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, let me also at the outset thank the distinguished ranking member for his support and his cooperation as this bill has gone forward. I am sure the two of us will be able to continue to work and cooperate as, again, this will be monitored in the future. The Department of Homeland Security and all Federal agencies are targeted by adversaries on a daily basis. Some of the most damaging attacks to the U.S. Government have been committed by U.S. citizens who have been granted access to government facilities and electronic networks. This bill provides the framework for DHS to implement an Insider Threat Program that identifies and disrupts malicious insiders who seek to do the Department and its employees harm. It also seeks to protect the Department's workforce by conducting a transparent process to reinforce cyber hygiene, data security, and awareness of malicious activity through a robust training program. I want to thank the committee staff, especially John Neal and Tyler Lowe. I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 3361. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, I rise in support of H.R. 3361, the ``Department of Homeland Security Insider Threat and Mitigation Act.'' I am in support of this bill because it amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish an Insider Threat Program, which shall: provide training and education for DHS personnel to identify, prevent, mitigate, and respond to insider threat risks to DHS's critical assets; provide investigative support regarding such threats; and conduct risk mitigation activities for such threats. The Department of Homeland Security will establish a Steering Committee headed by the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis who will serve as the Chair; and the Chief Security Officer of the office as the Vice Chair of the Committee. The Under Secretary and the Chief Security Officer, in coordination with the Steering Committee, shall: develop a holistic strategy for DHS-wide efforts to identify, prevent, mitigate, and respond to insider threats to DHS's critical assets; develop a plan to implement the strategy across DHS components and offices; document insider threat policies and controls; conduct a baseline risk assessment of such threats; examine existing programmatic and technology best practices adopted by the federal government, industry, and research institutions; develop a timeline for deploying workplace monitoring technologies, employee awareness campaigns, and education and training programs related to potential insider threats; consult with the Under Secretary for Science and Technology and other stakeholders to ensure that the Insider Threat Program is informed by current information regarding threats, best practices, and available technology; and develop, collect, and report metrics on the effectiveness of DHS's insider threat mitigation efforts. Threat mitigation is focused on blunting the effectiveness of threats posed by terrorists seeking to carry out attacks in the United States. This is a core mission of the Department of Homeland Security and this bill will support that mission. I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. King) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3361, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H7351-H7353] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY INSIDER THREAT AND MITIGATION ACT OF 2015 Mr. KING of New York.

(b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended by inserting after the item relating to section 103 the following new item: ``Sec. 104. Insider Threat Program.''. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New York (Mr. King) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York. General Leave Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. The bill under consideration ensures that the Department of Homeland Security has the authority and congressional mandate to create a robust Insider Threat Program. In the Manning and Snowden espionage scandals, two trusted insiders abused their access to classified information. When Aaron Alexis attacked the Washington Navy Yard, 12 Americans lost their lives. In the face of these insider threat scenarios, it is vital that government agencies have the tools to detect and disrupt future insider threat situations before damage is done. Unfortunately, all three were able to conduct their traitorous work undetected because the government had at one time vetted and granted them access to secure facilities and information systems. H.R. 3361 reinforces the message that a security clearance is a privilege granted to individuals who have pledged to protect the American people from threats domestically and abroad. Had investigators more thoroughly scrutinized Edward Snowden's background, they might have identified disturbing trends that made him unfit to hold a clearance of any kind and a potential insider threat to U.S. national security. Had Federal adjudicators had access to criminal history records from the Seattle Police Department, they would have been aware of Aaron Alexis' arrest in 2004 on firearms charges and potentially conducted a more rigorous screening of his background prior to authorizing him access to the Washington Navy Yard. Trusted insiders, going back to Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen, not only severely damaged national security, their traitorous actions led to the loss of life. In each case, the post-breach review highlighted that the previously trusted individual exhibited suspicious behavior, but it was not reported due to a lack of understanding by colleagues or failures in the reinvestigation process. In describing the new type of insider threat represented by Snowden and WikiLeaks, Michael Hayden correctly concluded that, ``in this new, modern, connected era, the trusted insider who betrays us is far more empowered to do damage far greater than these kinds of people were able to do in the past. And therefore we have to be even more vigilant.'' The Department of Homeland Security has over 280,000 employees, including tens of thousands with access to classified or sensitive information. The Department has an existing Insider Threat Program and is moving forward to increase security controls on internal systems, but much more remains to be done. The bill directs DHS to develop a strategy for the Department to identify, prevent, mitigate, and respond to insider threats, and requires DHS to ensure that personnel understand what workplace behavior may be indicative of a potential insider threat and how their activity on DHS networks will be monitored. The bill codifies a comprehensive Insider Threat Program at DHS that can be implemented throughout the Department and its component agencies and, most importantly, reinforces the importance of preventing future insider attacks. I want to thank Homeland Security Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member Thompson, Ranking Member Higgins, and Congressmen Katko, Donovan, and Barletta for working with me to bring this bill to the floor. The bill went through regular order and received bipartisan support during subcommittee and full committee consideration. I urge my colleagues to support this bill so we can establish a comprehensive, transparent DHS-wide Insider Threat Program that is a model for the public and private sectors. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 3361, the Department of Homeland Security Insider Threat and Mitigation Act of 2015. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3361, the Department of Homeland Security Insider Threat and Mitigation Act of 2015, authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to address the homeland and national security risk posed by trusted insiders. Typically, trusted insiders are given unrestricted access to mission- critical assets such as personnel, facilities, and computer networks. While DHS, like other Federal agencies, conducts extensive vetting of prospective employees, there remains a risk that someone who gains ``insider status'' exploits their position to damage the United States through espionage, terrorism, or even the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive national security information. As the ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security, I am supportive of the Department of Homeland Security's current Insider Threat Program. It is targeted at preventing and detecting when a vetted DHS employee or contractor with authorized access to U.S. Government resources, including personnel, facilities, information, equipment, networks, and systems, exploits such access for nefarious, terroristic, or criminal purposes. While I support the DHS program, I could not support this legislation when it was considered by the full committee because it did not include language to prevent the somewhat broad authority granted under this bill for being used by DHS to deploy ``continuous evaluation.'' Continuous evaluation is an automated system that constantly monitors public and private databases for information regarding the credit, criminal, and social media activities of certain individuals. The Defense Department has an extensive pilot underway, and I am concerned that Federal agencies, with the understandable urge to protect their IT systems and facilities, are racing to acquire this capability before knowing whether such costly systems are even effective. At this time, I would like to engage in a colloquy with the gentleman from New York (Mr. King) about some concerns I have with the prospect that the Department will use the authority under this act to establish a continuous evaluation program. {time} 1615 Would the gentleman agree that it is important that, prior to establishing any such program under which certain DHS employees would be subjected to ongoing automated credit, criminal, or social media monitoring, the Department engages Congress about not only the potential costs and benefits of such a program but what protections would be in place for workers subject to such program? I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. King). Mr. KING of New York. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Yes, I agree with the gentleman from Mississippi. The implementation of the Insider Threat Program, including a possible continuous evaluation component, needs congressional oversight and must be transparent. [[Page H7353]] I look forward to working with the gentleman from Mississippi on this issue as we go forward. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, we live at a time when the threats to our Nation are complex. None of us want to see someone exploit their access to DHS networks to carry out cybercrimes or other criminal activity. Even as DHS works to detect and prevent such threats, it is important that such activities be carried out in a transparent way so as not to compound the chronic morale challenges that exist within the workforce. Each time DHS considers making an adjustment to its Insider Threat Program, thoughtful consideration must be paid to whether the operational drawbacks and costs of such an adjustment outweigh the benefit of such change. That said, I commend General Taylor, the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis at DHS, for the attention he has given to the insider threat challenge and look forward to continuing to work with him to bolster security within the Department. I appreciate the gentleman from New York's cooperation and colloquy. I look forward to the successful passage and approval of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, let me also at the outset thank the distinguished ranking member for his support and his cooperation as this bill has gone forward. I am sure the two of us will be able to continue to work and cooperate as, again, this will be monitored in the future. The Department of Homeland Security and all Federal agencies are targeted by adversaries on a daily basis. Some of the most damaging attacks to the U.S. Government have been committed by U.S. citizens who have been granted access to government facilities and electronic networks. This bill provides the framework for DHS to implement an Insider Threat Program that identifies and disrupts malicious insiders who seek to do the Department and its employees harm. It also seeks to protect the Department's workforce by conducting a transparent process to reinforce cyber hygiene, data security, and awareness of malicious activity through a robust training program. I want to thank the committee staff, especially John Neal and Tyler Lowe. I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 3361. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, I rise in support of H.R. 3361, the ``Department of Homeland Security Insider Threat and Mitigation Act.'' I am in support of this bill because it amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish an Insider Threat Program, which shall: provide training and education for DHS personnel to identify, prevent, mitigate, and respond to insider threat risks to DHS's critical assets; provide investigative support regarding such threats; and conduct risk mitigation activities for such threats. The Department of Homeland Security will establish a Steering Committee headed by the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis who will serve as the Chair; and the Chief Security Officer of the office as the Vice Chair of the Committee. The Under Secretary and the Chief Security Officer, in coordination with the Steering Committee, shall: develop a holistic strategy for DHS-wide efforts to identify, prevent, mitigate, and respond to insider threats to DHS's critical assets; develop a plan to implement the strategy across DHS components and offices; document insider threat policies and controls; conduct a baseline risk assessment of such threats; examine existing programmatic and technology best practices adopted by the federal government, industry, and research institutions; develop a timeline for deploying workplace monitoring technologies, employee awareness campaigns, and education and training programs related to potential insider threats; consult with the Under Secretary for Science and Technology and other stakeholders to ensure that the Insider Threat Program is informed by current information regarding threats, best practices, and available technology; and develop, collect, and report metrics on the effectiveness of DHS's insider threat mitigation efforts. Threat mitigation is focused on blunting the effectiveness of threats posed by terrorists seeking to carry out attacks in the United States. This is a core mission of the Department of Homeland Security and this bill will support that mission. I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. King) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3361, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H7351-H7353] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY INSIDER THREAT AND MITIGATION ACT OF 2015 Mr. KING of New York.

(b) clerical amendment.--the table of contents of the homeland security act of 2002 is amended by inserting after the item relating to section 103 the following new item: ``sec. 104. insider threat program.''. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from new york (mr. king) and the gentleman from mississippi (mr. thompson) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from new york. general leave mr. king of new york. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from new york? there was no objection. mr. king of new york. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in support of this legislation. the bill under consideration ensures that the department of homeland security has the authority and congressional mandate to create a robust insider threat program. in the manning and snowden espionage scandals, two trusted insiders abused their access to classified information. when aaron alexis attacked the washington navy yard, 12 americans lost their lives. in the face of these insider threat scenarios, it is vital that government agencies have the tools to detect and disrupt future insider threat situations before damage is done. unfortunately, all three were able to conduct their traitorous work undetected because the government had at one time vetted and granted them access to secure facilities and information systems. h.r. 3361 reinforces the message that a security clearance is a privilege granted to individuals who have pledged to protect the american people from threats domestically and abroad. had investigators more thoroughly scrutinized edward snowden's background, they might have identified disturbing trends that made him unfit to hold a clearance of any kind and a potential insider threat to u.s. national security. had federal adjudicators had access to criminal history records from the seattle police department, they would have been aware of aaron alexis' arrest in 2004 on firearms charges and potentially conducted a more rigorous screening of his background prior to authorizing him access to the washington navy yard. trusted insiders, going back to aldrich ames and robert hanssen, not only severely damaged national security, their traitorous actions led to the loss of life. in each case, the post-breach review highlighted that the previously trusted individual exhibited suspicious behavior, but it was not reported due to a lack of understanding by colleagues or failures in the reinvestigation process. in describing the new type of insider threat represented by snowden and wikileaks, michael hayden correctly concluded that, ``in this new, modern, connected era, the trusted insider who betrays us is far more empowered to do damage far greater than these kinds of people were able to do in the past. and therefore we have to be even more vigilant.'' the department of homeland security has over 280,000 employees, including tens of thousands with access to classified or sensitive information. the department has an existing insider threat program and is moving forward to increase security controls on internal systems, but much more remains to be done. the bill directs dhs to develop a strategy for the department to identify, prevent, mitigate, and respond to insider threats, and requires dhs to ensure that personnel understand what workplace behavior may be indicative of a potential insider threat and how their activity on dhs networks will be monitored. the bill codifies a comprehensive insider threat program at dhs that can be implemented throughout the department and its component agencies and, most importantly, reinforces the importance of preventing future insider attacks. i want to thank homeland security chairman mccaul, ranking member thompson, ranking member higgins, and congressmen katko, donovan, and barletta for working with me to bring this bill to the floor. the bill went through regular order and received bipartisan support during subcommittee and full committee consideration. i urge my colleagues to support this bill so we can establish a comprehensive, transparent dhs-wide insider threat program that is a model for the public and private sectors. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. thompson of mississippi. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in support of h.r. 3361, the department of homeland security insider threat and mitigation act of 2015. mr. speaker, h.r. 3361, the department of homeland security insider threat and mitigation act of 2015, authorizes the department of homeland security to address the homeland and national security risk posed by trusted insiders. typically, trusted insiders are given unrestricted access to mission- critical assets such as personnel, facilities, and computer networks. while dhs, like other federal agencies, conducts extensive vetting of prospective employees, there remains a risk that someone who gains ``insider status'' exploits their position to damage the united states through espionage, terrorism, or even the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive national security information. as the ranking member of the committee on homeland security, i am supportive of the department of homeland security's current insider threat program. it is targeted at preventing and detecting when a vetted dhs employee or contractor with authorized access to u.s. government resources, including personnel, facilities, information, equipment, networks, and systems, exploits such access for nefarious, terroristic, or criminal purposes. while i support the dhs program, i could not support this legislation when it was considered by the full committee because it did not include language to prevent the somewhat broad authority granted under this bill for being used by dhs to deploy ``continuous evaluation.'' continuous evaluation is an automated system that constantly monitors public and private databases for information regarding the credit, criminal, and social media activities of certain individuals. the defense department has an extensive pilot underway, and i am concerned that federal agencies, with the understandable urge to protect their it systems and facilities, are racing to acquire this capability before knowing whether such costly systems are even effective. at this time, i would like to engage in a colloquy with the gentleman from new york (mr. king) about some concerns i have with the prospect that the department will use the authority under this act to establish a continuous evaluation program. {time} 1615 would the gentleman agree that it is important that, prior to establishing any such program under which certain dhs employees would be subjected to ongoing automated credit, criminal, or social media monitoring, the department engages congress about not only the potential costs and benefits of such a program but what protections would be in place for workers subject to such program? i yield to the gentleman from new york (mr. king). mr. king of new york. i thank the gentleman for yielding. yes, i agree with the gentleman from mississippi. the implementation of the insider threat program, including a possible continuous evaluation component, needs congressional oversight and must be transparent. [[page h7353]] i look forward to working with the gentleman from mississippi on this issue as we go forward. mr. thompson of mississippi. i thank the gentleman. mr. speaker, we live at a time when the threats to our nation are complex. none of us want to see someone exploit their access to dhs networks to carry out cybercrimes or other criminal activity. even as dhs works to detect and prevent such threats, it is important that such activities be carried out in a transparent way so as not to compound the chronic morale challenges that exist within the workforce. each time dhs considers making an adjustment to its insider threat program, thoughtful consideration must be paid to whether the operational drawbacks and costs of such an adjustment outweigh the benefit of such change. that said, i commend general taylor, the under secretary for intelligence and analysis at dhs, for the attention he has given to the insider threat challenge and look forward to continuing to work with him to bolster security within the department. i appreciate the gentleman from new york's cooperation and colloquy. i look forward to the successful passage and approval of this bill. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. king of new york. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, let me also at the outset thank the distinguished ranking member for his support and his cooperation as this bill has gone forward. i am sure the two of us will be able to continue to work and cooperate as, again, this will be monitored in the future. the department of homeland security and all federal agencies are targeted by adversaries on a daily basis. some of the most damaging attacks to the u.s. government have been committed by u.s. citizens who have been granted access to government facilities and electronic networks. this bill provides the framework for dhs to implement an insider threat program that identifies and disrupts malicious insiders who seek to do the department and its employees harm. it also seeks to protect the department's workforce by conducting a transparent process to reinforce cyber hygiene, data security, and awareness of malicious activity through a robust training program. i want to thank the committee staff, especially john neal and tyler lowe. i urge my colleagues to vote for h.r. 3361. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ms. jackson lee. mr. speaker, as a senior member of the homeland security committee, i rise in support of h.r. 3361, the ``department of homeland security insider threat and mitigation act.'' i am in support of this bill because it amends the homeland security act of 2002 to direct the department of homeland security (dhs) to establish an insider threat program, which shall: provide training and education for dhs personnel to identify, prevent, mitigate, and respond to insider threat risks to dhs's critical assets; provide investigative support regarding such threats; and conduct risk mitigation activities for such threats. the department of homeland security will establish a steering committee headed by the under secretary for intelligence and analysis who will serve as the chair; and the chief security officer of the office as the vice chair of the committee. the under secretary and the chief security officer, in coordination with the steering committee, shall: develop a holistic strategy for dhs-wide efforts to identify, prevent, mitigate, and respond to insider threats to dhs's critical assets; develop a plan to implement the strategy across dhs components and offices; document insider threat policies and controls; conduct a baseline risk assessment of such threats; examine existing programmatic and technology best practices adopted by the federal government, industry, and research institutions; develop a timeline for deploying workplace monitoring technologies, employee awareness campaigns, and education and training programs related to potential insider threats; consult with the under secretary for science and technology and other stakeholders to ensure that the insider threat program is informed by current information regarding threats, best practices, and available technology; and develop, collect, and report metrics on the effectiveness of dhs's insider threat mitigation efforts. threat mitigation is focused on blunting the effectiveness of threats posed by terrorists seeking to carry out attacks in the united states. this is a core mission of the department of homeland security and this bill will support that mission. i ask my colleagues to join me in support of this bill. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from new york (mr. king) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 3361, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",18814

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. General Leave Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3598, the Fusion Center Enhancement Act of 2015. The purpose of this legislation is to clarify and enhance the partnership between the Department of Homeland Security and the National Network of Fusion Centers. The bill amends the existing statute to update the Department's responsibilities for sharing information with State and local law enforcement and other emergency personnel within the National Network of Fusion Centers. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, State and local governments created fusion centers as a way to communicate Federal homeland security information to State and local law enforcement officials as well as to fuse State and locally collected information with Federal intelligence. Congress supported this partnership by mandating that the Office of Intelligence and Analysis within the Department of Homeland Security coordinate and share information with fusion centers. There are now 78 State and locally owned fusion centers across the country. H.R. 3598 amends existing law to improve the relationship and flow of information between the Federal Government and fusion centers. The bill includes language updating the responsibilities of the Department of Homeland Security related to support and coordination within the National Network. This includes improving coordination with other Federal departments to provide better operational intelligence, reducing inefficiencies, and coordinating nationwide suspicious activity reporting. As a member of the Homeland Security Committee and a former mayor, a concern I have heard from law enforcement in my district is a lack of information and coordination from ICE, CBP, and other DHS component agencies. I have seen this problem firsthand and know that more can be done to help our local law enforcement get the support that they need from the Federal Government. This bill is one small step to make that fusion center a better resource for the people who know our communities the best: our local law enforcement officers. The bill includes language to direct DHS to ensure that each component is providing information and personnel to work with the fusion centers. To address the need for better accountability, language is included throughout the bill requiring DHS to coordinate with fusion centers and State Homeland Security advisers in carrying out the assigned responsibilities. {time} 1630 Additionally, I added a requirement for the Department to submit a report to Congress on their efforts, including the components, to support fusion centers and specifically report on how they are meeting the requirements set forth in this bill. I want to thank House Intelligence Committee Chairman Nunes, Committee on Homeland Security Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson, and Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence Chairman King and Ranking Member Higgins for working with me to bring this bill to the floor. The bill went through regular order and received bipartisan support during subcommittee and full committee consideration. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill so we can add important requirements and accountability [[Page H7357]] in how the Department of Homeland Security interacts and shares information with key State and local stakeholders. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Washington, DC, October 28, 2015. Hon. Michael McCaul, Chairman, House Committee on Homeland Security, Ford Office Building, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman McCaul: On September 30, 2015, your committee ordered H.R. 3503, the ``Department of Homeland Security Support to Fusion Centers Act of 2015,'' reported. Additionally, on that same day, your committee ordered H.R. 3598, the ``Fusion Center Enhancement Act of 2015,'' reported. As you know, both H.R. 3503 and H.R. 3598 contain provisions within the jurisdiction of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. On the basis of your consultations with the Committee and in order to expedite the House's consideration of both bills, the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence will not assert a jurisdictional claim over either bill by seeking a sequential referral. This courtesy is, however, conditioned on our mutual understanding and agreement that it will in no way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Permanent Select Committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bills or any similar legislation. I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming this understanding and would request that you include a copy of this letter and your response in the committee reports for both bills and in the Congressional Record during their floor consideration. Thank you in advance for your cooperation. Sincerely, Devin Nunes, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC, October 29, 2015. Hon. Devin Nunes, Chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, The Capitol, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Nunes: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 3503, the ``Department of Homeland Security Support to Fusion Centers Act of 2015,'' and H.R. 3598, the ``Fusion Center Enhancement Act of 2015.'' I appreciate your support in bringing both of these measures before the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence will not seek a sequential referral on either bill. I acknowledge that by foregoing a sequential referral on these two pieces of legislation, your Committee is not diminishing or altering its jurisdiction with respect to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in these bills or any similar legislation. Additionally, should a conference on either bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Permanent Select Committee represented on the conference committee. I will include copies of this exchange in the reports for H.R. 3503 and H.R. 3598 and in the Congressional Record during consideration of these bills on the House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, Michael T. McCaul, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3598, the Fusion Center Enhancement Act of 2015. First of all, let me compliment Mr. Barletta for his bill. Those of us who have been around kind of know the confusion that exists among fusion centers throughout the country, and any effort to streamline that confusion is much appreciated. Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill seeks to update the law to reflect the evolution of the Department of Homeland Security's National Network of Fusion Centers as well as the relationship of the Department's Office of Intelligence and Analysis with the fusion centers in the network. H.R. 3598, as introduced by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta), clarifies that fusion centers are State- and locally owned and operated and requires the Department's Office of Intelligence and Analysis to provide support to centers in its network through the deployment of appropriate personnel and providing access to information. Importantly, H.R. 3598 also adds several new responsibilities to the Under Secretary of Intelligence and Analysis related to grant guidance, coordinating nationwide suspicious activity reports, and ensuring that fusion centers are the focal points for sharing information. This bill makes several technical changes to existing statutory language to help ensure increased information-sharing resources are made available to Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials at our National Network of Fusion Centers. If enacted, H.R. 3598 will go a long way to providing States and localities that have invested significant resources in standing up fusion centers to participate in DHS' National Network with the support they need to keep their communities and, ultimately, the Nation secure. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I want to express my support again for this bill and commend the leaders of the committee's Counterterrorism and Intelligence Subcommittee, Mr. King and Mr. Higgins, for working together to advance this timely and important piece of legislation. Again, let me thank Mr. Barletta and talk about the longstanding confusion that has existed with fusion centers around the country. When created, it was Congress' hope that everybody would be singing from the same sheet of music. Hopefully this gets us real close to that performance. I urge the passage of H.R. 3598 and look forward to its passage. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, one of the most critical responsibilities of the Department of Homeland Security is to share threat information with State and local first responders. Fusion centers are a key mechanism for that process. The original requirements directing DHS' responsibilities towards fusion centers were enacted in 2007. In the past 8 years, there have been significant changes to the information- sharing environment and the fusion centers across the country. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 3598 in order to bolster the information-sharing environment within the Department and between the Department and State and local stakeholders. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3598, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H7355-H7357] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FUSION CENTER ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2015 Mr. BARLETTA.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania. General Leave Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? There was no objection. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3598, the Fusion Center Enhancement Act of 2015. The purpose of this legislation is to clarify and enhance the partnership between the Department of Homeland Security and the National Network of Fusion Centers. The bill amends the existing statute to update the Department's responsibilities for sharing information with State and local law enforcement and other emergency personnel within the National Network of Fusion Centers. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, State and local governments created fusion centers as a way to communicate Federal homeland security information to State and local law enforcement officials as well as to fuse State and locally collected information with Federal intelligence. Congress supported this partnership by mandating that the Office of Intelligence and Analysis within the Department of Homeland Security coordinate and share information with fusion centers. There are now 78 State and locally owned fusion centers across the country. H.R. 3598 amends existing law to improve the relationship and flow of information between the Federal Government and fusion centers. The bill includes language updating the responsibilities of the Department of Homeland Security related to support and coordination within the National Network. This includes improving coordination with other Federal departments to provide better operational intelligence, reducing inefficiencies, and coordinating nationwide suspicious activity reporting. As a member of the Homeland Security Committee and a former mayor, a concern I have heard from law enforcement in my district is a lack of information and coordination from ICE, CBP, and other DHS component agencies. I have seen this problem firsthand and know that more can be done to help our local law enforcement get the support that they need from the Federal Government. This bill is one small step to make that fusion center a better resource for the people who know our communities the best: our local law enforcement officers. The bill includes language to direct DHS to ensure that each component is providing information and personnel to work with the fusion centers. To address the need for better accountability, language is included throughout the bill requiring DHS to coordinate with fusion centers and State Homeland Security advisers in carrying out the assigned responsibilities. {time} 1630 Additionally, I added a requirement for the Department to submit a report to Congress on their efforts, including the components, to support fusion centers and specifically report on how they are meeting the requirements set forth in this bill. I want to thank House Intelligence Committee Chairman Nunes, Committee on Homeland Security Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson, and Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence Chairman King and Ranking Member Higgins for working with me to bring this bill to the floor. The bill went through regular order and received bipartisan support during subcommittee and full committee consideration. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill so we can add important requirements and accountability [[Page H7357]] in how the Department of Homeland Security interacts and shares information with key State and local stakeholders. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Washington, DC, October 28, 2015. Hon. Michael McCaul, Chairman, House Committee on Homeland Security, Ford Office Building, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman McCaul: On September 30, 2015, your committee ordered H.R. 3503, the ``Department of Homeland Security Support to Fusion Centers Act of 2015,'' reported. Additionally, on that same day, your committee ordered H.R. 3598, the ``Fusion Center Enhancement Act of 2015,'' reported. As you know, both H.R. 3503 and H.R. 3598 contain provisions within the jurisdiction of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. On the basis of your consultations with the Committee and in order to expedite the House's consideration of both bills, the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence will not assert a jurisdictional claim over either bill by seeking a sequential referral. This courtesy is, however, conditioned on our mutual understanding and agreement that it will in no way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Permanent Select Committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bills or any similar legislation. I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming this understanding and would request that you include a copy of this letter and your response in the committee reports for both bills and in the Congressional Record during their floor consideration. Thank you in advance for your cooperation. Sincerely, Devin Nunes, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC, October 29, 2015. Hon. Devin Nunes, Chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, The Capitol, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Nunes: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 3503, the ``Department of Homeland Security Support to Fusion Centers Act of 2015,'' and H.R. 3598, the ``Fusion Center Enhancement Act of 2015.'' I appreciate your support in bringing both of these measures before the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence will not seek a sequential referral on either bill. I acknowledge that by foregoing a sequential referral on these two pieces of legislation, your Committee is not diminishing or altering its jurisdiction with respect to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in these bills or any similar legislation. Additionally, should a conference on either bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Permanent Select Committee represented on the conference committee. I will include copies of this exchange in the reports for H.R. 3503 and H.R. 3598 and in the Congressional Record during consideration of these bills on the House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, Michael T. McCaul, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3598, the Fusion Center Enhancement Act of 2015. First of all, let me compliment Mr. Barletta for his bill. Those of us who have been around kind of know the confusion that exists among fusion centers throughout the country, and any effort to streamline that confusion is much appreciated. Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill seeks to update the law to reflect the evolution of the Department of Homeland Security's National Network of Fusion Centers as well as the relationship of the Department's Office of Intelligence and Analysis with the fusion centers in the network. H.R. 3598, as introduced by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta), clarifies that fusion centers are State- and locally owned and operated and requires the Department's Office of Intelligence and Analysis to provide support to centers in its network through the deployment of appropriate personnel and providing access to information. Importantly, H.R. 3598 also adds several new responsibilities to the Under Secretary of Intelligence and Analysis related to grant guidance, coordinating nationwide suspicious activity reports, and ensuring that fusion centers are the focal points for sharing information. This bill makes several technical changes to existing statutory language to help ensure increased information-sharing resources are made available to Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials at our National Network of Fusion Centers. If enacted, H.R. 3598 will go a long way to providing States and localities that have invested significant resources in standing up fusion centers to participate in DHS' National Network with the support they need to keep their communities and, ultimately, the Nation secure. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I want to express my support again for this bill and commend the leaders of the committee's Counterterrorism and Intelligence Subcommittee, Mr. King and Mr. Higgins, for working together to advance this timely and important piece of legislation. Again, let me thank Mr. Barletta and talk about the longstanding confusion that has existed with fusion centers around the country. When created, it was Congress' hope that everybody would be singing from the same sheet of music. Hopefully this gets us real close to that performance. I urge the passage of H.R. 3598 and look forward to its passage. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, one of the most critical responsibilities of the Department of Homeland Security is to share threat information with State and local first responders. Fusion centers are a key mechanism for that process. The original requirements directing DHS' responsibilities towards fusion centers were enacted in 2007. In the past 8 years, there have been significant changes to the information- sharing environment and the fusion centers across the country. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 3598 in order to bolster the information-sharing environment within the Department and between the Department and State and local stakeholders. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3598, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H7355-H7357] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FUSION CENTER ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2015 Mr. BARLETTA.

Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill seeks to update the law to reflect the evolution of the Department of Homeland Security's National Network of Fusion Centers as well as the relationship of the Department's Office of Intelligence and Analysis with the fusion centers in the network. H.R. 3598, as introduced by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta), clarifies that fusion centers are State- and locally owned and operated and requires the Department's Office of Intelligence and Analysis to provide support to centers in its network through the deployment of appropriate personnel and providing access to information. Importantly, H.R. 3598 also adds several new responsibilities to the Under Secretary of Intelligence and Analysis related to grant guidance, coordinating nationwide suspicious activity reports, and ensuring that fusion centers are the focal points for sharing information. This bill makes several technical changes to existing statutory language to help ensure increased information-sharing resources are made available to Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials at our National Network of Fusion Centers. If enacted, H.R. 3598 will go a long way to providing States and localities that have invested significant resources in standing up fusion centers to participate in DHS' National Network with the support they need to keep their communities and, ultimately, the Nation secure. In closing, Mr. Speaker, I want to express my support again for this bill and commend the leaders of the committee's Counterterrorism and Intelligence Subcommittee, Mr. King and Mr. Higgins, for working together to advance this timely and important piece of legislation. Again, let me thank Mr. Barletta and talk about the longstanding confusion that has existed with fusion centers around the country. When created, it was Congress' hope that everybody would be singing from the same sheet of music. Hopefully this gets us real close to that performance. I urge the passage of H.R. 3598 and look forward to its passage. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. BARLETTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, one of the most critical responsibilities of the Department of Homeland Security is to share threat information with State and local first responders. Fusion centers are a key mechanism for that process. The original requirements directing DHS' responsibilities towards fusion centers were enacted in 2007. In the past 8 years, there have been significant changes to the information- sharing environment and the fusion centers across the country. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 3598 in order to bolster the information-sharing environment within the Department and between the Department and State and local stakeholders. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3598, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_271.csv,21972,21972,22042,"[congressional record volume 161, number 162 (monday, november 2, 2015)] [house] [pages h7355-h7357] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] fusion center enhancement act of 2015 mr. barletta. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 3598) to amend the homeland security act of 2002 to enhance the partnership between the department of homeland security and the national network of fusion centers, and for other purposes, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 3598 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``fusion center enhancement act of 2015''. sec. 2. department of homeland security fusion center partnership initiative.

within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from pennsylvania? there was no objection. mr. barletta. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in support of h.r. 3598, the fusion center enhancement act of 2015. the purpose of this legislation is to clarify and enhance the partnership between the department of homeland security and the national network of fusion centers. the bill amends the existing statute to update the department's responsibilities for sharing information with state and local law enforcement and other emergency personnel within the national network of fusion centers. after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, state and local governments created fusion centers as a way to communicate federal homeland security information to state and local law enforcement officials as well as to fuse state and locally collected information with federal intelligence. congress supported this partnership by mandating that the office of intelligence and analysis within the department of homeland security coordinate and share information with fusion centers. there are now 78 state and locally owned fusion centers across the country. h.r. 3598 amends existing law to improve the relationship and flow of information between the federal government and fusion centers. the bill includes language updating the responsibilities of the department of homeland security related to support and coordination within the national network. this includes improving coordination with other federal departments to provide better operational intelligence, reducing inefficiencies, and coordinating nationwide suspicious activity reporting. as a member of the homeland security committee and a former mayor, a concern i have heard from law enforcement in my district is a lack of information and coordination from ice, cbp, and other dhs component agencies. i have seen this problem firsthand and know that more can be done to help our local law enforcement get the support that they need from the federal government. this bill is one small step to make that fusion center a better resource for the people who know our communities the best: our local law enforcement officers. the bill includes language to direct dhs to ensure that each component is providing information and personnel to work with the fusion centers. to address the need for better accountability, language is included throughout the bill requiring dhs to coordinate with fusion centers and state homeland security advisers in carrying out the assigned responsibilities. {time} 1630 additionally, i added a requirement for the department to submit a report to congress on their efforts, including the components, to support fusion centers and specifically report on how they are meeting the requirements set forth in this bill. i want to thank house intelligence committee chairman nunes, committee on homeland security chairman mccaul and ranking member thompson, and subcommittee on counterterrorism and intelligence chairman king and ranking member higgins for working with me to bring this bill to the floor. the bill went through regular order and received bipartisan support during subcommittee and full committee consideration. mr. speaker, i urge my colleagues to support this bill so we can add important requirements and accountability [[page h7357]] in how the department of homeland security interacts and shares information with key state and local stakeholders. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. house of representatives, permanent select committee on intelligence, washington,

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona. General Leave Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Arizona? There was no objection. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3503, the Department of Homeland Security Support to Fusion Centers Act of 2015. We have made improvements since the 9/11 attacks, the Boston Marathon bombings, and Fort Hood to increase and enhance the Nation's ability to detect and prevent terrorist attacks. However, the elevated potential for attacks carried out by individuals either directed or inspired by radical violent extremism reinforces that there is more work to be done, especially breaking down information-sharing stovepipes. Ensuring that the Federal Government is sharing intelligence and homeland security information with State and local officials is a vital component to that effort. In June, I visited the Arizona Counter-Terrorism Intelligence Center, or the ACTIC, my State's fusion center. I saw firsthand how fusion centers are disseminating Federal threat and intelligence information out to emergency responder providers, as well as collecting State and local information, and fusing it with Federal intelligence to enhance terrorist investigations and create a more complete picture. While fusion centers are continuing to mature, I am concerned about the lack of small cities' and rural areas' representation in fusion centers. As we continue to enhance the Nation's ability to share intelligence information, we need to ensure that all emergency service providers have access to this vital information. To help break down the information-sharing stovepipes, the ACTIC and 77 other fusion centers across the country need greater access to intelligence and information from the Department of Homeland Security and its components. Mr. Speaker, I introduced H.R. 3503 along with Chairman McCaul, Chairman King, and Representatives Barletta and Loudermilk to ensure that the Department is providing fusion centers with the resources needed to protect our Nation from terrorist attacks and other emergencies. This bill passed the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence and the full Committee on Homeland Security by voice vote with bipartisan support. I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) for adding two important provisions to this bill during the full committee markup. These provisions ensure that the Department of Homeland Security's information technology systems are user-friendly for State and local analysts, and require the Under Secretary of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis to sign a memorandum of understanding with each fusion center to ensure that each center is aware of what information can be publicly disclosed. Also, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Nunes of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and his staff for working with me and the Committee on Homeland Security to get this bill to the floor today. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3503, as amended, requires the Government Accountability Office, GAO, to conduct an assessment of the Department of Homeland Security personnel detailed to fusion centers and whether deploying additional personnel from several of the departmental components will enhance threat and homeland security information sharing. Having an unbiased assessment of staffing levels and responsibilities for Department of Homeland Security personnel deployed to fusion centers will be valuable in making decisions moving forward on the appropriate staffing levels. Additionally, this bill applauds the effort of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis in establishing a program to provide top secret clearances to appropriate State and local analysts in fusion centers. To ensure that this initiative is carried out efficiently and in a manner that ensures operational security, the bill requires DHS to submit a onetime report to Congress. The committee has received testimony from State and local law enforcement about the value additional clearances will provide. The need for top secret clearances was also a key finding [[Page H7359]] of the committee's Foreign Fighter Task Force, of which I was proud to be a member. It is especially timely that we are considering this bill today. This week is the annual conference held by the National Fusion Center Association. This bill will help ensure that our State and local law enforcement officers, as well as fire and EMS personnel, are getting access to the information they need to protect our communities. Since the summer, our country has been at its highest threat posture since 9/11, given the large number of foreign fighters and ISIS- inspired plots. It is essential that Congress ensure that all of the dots are being connected. I urge all Members to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, October 28, 2015. Hon. Michael McCaul, Chairman, House Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman McCaul: On September 30, 2015, your committee ordered H.R. 3503, the ``Department of Homeland Security Support to Fusion Centers Act of 2015,'' reported. Additionally, on that same day, your committee ordered H.R. 3598, the ``Fusion Center Enhancement Act of 2015,'' reported. As you know, both H.R. 3503 and H.R. 3598 contain provisions within the jurisdiction of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. On the basis of your consultations with the Committee and in order to expedite the House's consideration of both bills, the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence will not assert a jurisdictional claim over either bill by seeking a sequential referral.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation. Sincerely, Devin Nunes, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC, October 29, 2015. Hon. Devin Nunes, Chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Nunes: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 3503, the ``Department of Homeland Security Support to Fusion Centers Act of 2015,'' and H.R. 3598, the ``Fusion Center Enhancement Act of 2015.'' I appreciate your support in bringing both of these measures before the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence will not seek a sequential referral on either bill. I acknowledge that by foregoing a sequential referral on these two pieces of legislation, your Committee is not diminishing or altering its jurisdiction with respect to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in these bills or any similar legislation. Additionally, should a conference on either bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Permanent Select Committee represented on the conference committee. I will include copies of this exchange in the reports for H.R. 3503 and H.R. 3598 and in the Congressional Record during consideration of these bills on the House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, Michael T. McCaul, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3503, the Department of Homeland Security Support Fusion Centers Act of 2015. Mr. Speaker, this bill was passed unanimously by the committee last month, and I am pleased that it is being considered on the House floor today. After the terrorist attacks of 9/11, there was broad recognition that the traditional stovepipes to the sharing of homeland security information needed to be cleared and that the Federal Government needed to do more to share timely information with State and local partners. A key mechanism to fostering such information sharing has been the development of a network of fusion centers across the Nation. These centers allow Federal intelligence and homeland security information to be shared with State and local law enforcement and other key stakeholders. As of today, 77 fusion centers have been stood up by State and local governments and participate in the Department of Homeland Security's National Network of Fusion Centers. For fusion centers to realize their full promise, it is critical that personnel assigned to fusion centers be able to access Department of Homeland Security information, data, and personnel. In the course of conducting oversight of fusion centers, the committee has learned that not enough State and local analysts and officials assigned to these centers have the TS/SCI clearances necessary to foster the timely sharing of homeland security information and intelligence. H.R. 3503, for the first time, authorizes DHS to sponsor State and local analysts for security clearances. All of us, as the chairwoman has said, have heard from our State and locals that this is, indeed, a problem. The approach taken is consistent with ongoing DHS efforts to sponsor TS and SCI clearances on appropriate State, local, tribal, as well as territorial partners' levels. In the 14 years since 9/11, there has been progress across the Federal Government at breaking down institutional stovepipes and moving away from a ``need to know'' to a ``need to share'' culture. Certainly with the right support and buy-in at the Federal level, the Department's National Network of Fusion Centers holds great promise for fostering more opportunities to interdict would-be terrorists before they attack and contributing to better awareness, preparedness, and responses at all levels. Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the gentlewoman from Arizona for this legislation. Again, this is getting us all on the same sheet of music. We absolutely have to have fusion centers operating in uniformity, and we should not have fusion centers doing their own thing. We are fighting this together. The stovepiping of information is not good, and it is not healthy. We have problems identifying bad actors, terrorists, and what have you. So I urge passage of H.R. 3503, the Department of Homeland Security Support to Fusion Centers Act of 2015. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. {time} 1645 Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. One of the core missions of the Department of Homeland Security is to share threat information with State and local first responders. Fusion centers are a key mechanism for that process. As fusion centers continue to mature into national assets, Congress must ensure the Department of Homeland Security is supporting fusion centers with the resources needed to keep our communities safe. Once again, I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 3503. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, I rise in support of H.R. 3503, the ``Homeland Security Support Fusion Centers Act of 2015.'' State and major urban area fusion centers serve as central points within the state and local environment for the receipt, analysis, gathering, and sharing of threat-related information between the federal government and state, local, tribal, territorial, and private sector partners. H.R. 3503 will require the Under Secretary of Intelligence and Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in coordination with the homeland security advisors of the states to provide an assessment of fusion center personnel needs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security. H.R. 3503 will amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to improve the management and administration of the security clearance processes throughout the Department of Homeland Security. Homeland Security advisors must conduct a needs assessment of Department personnel assigned to fusion centers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 210A of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The assessment must include information on: the current deployment of DHS personnel to each fusion center; the roles and responsibilities of Office of Intelligence and Analysis intelligence officers, intelligence analysts, senior reports officers, reports officers, and regional directors deployed to fusion centers; federal resources, in addition to personnel, [[Page H7360]] provided to each fusion center; whether deploying additional personnel would enhance intelligence and information sharing between DHS and federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial partners; fusion centers located in jurisdictions along land and maritime borders of the United States and the degree to which deploying personnel from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Coast Guard to such centers would enhance the integrity and security at such borders; and fusion centers located in jurisdictions with large and medium hub airports and the degree to which deploying personnel from the Transportation Security Administration to such centers would enhance aviation security. The Under Secretary must submit such assessment to specified congressional committees, together with a report on: the number of personnel assigned to fusion centers from the Office of Intelligence and Analysis; the number of personnel assigned to the National Network of Fusion Centers from components and offices of DHS and the methodology for determining the fusion centers to which such personnel are assigned; and an implementation plan for determining how DHS's personnel resources will be allocated to fusion centers in the future. H.R. 3503 will help to ensure the safety of our fusion centers and the personnel that work within these centers. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 3503. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3503, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H7357-H7360] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SUPPORT TO FUSION CENTERS ACT OF 2015 Ms. McSALLY.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona. General Leave Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Arizona? There was no objection. Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3503, the Department of Homeland Security Support to Fusion Centers Act of 2015. We have made improvements since the 9/11 attacks, the Boston Marathon bombings, and Fort Hood to increase and enhance the Nation's ability to detect and prevent terrorist attacks. However, the elevated potential for attacks carried out by individuals either directed or inspired by radical violent extremism reinforces that there is more work to be done, especially breaking down information-sharing stovepipes. Ensuring that the Federal Government is sharing intelligence and homeland security information with State and local officials is a vital component to that effort. In June, I visited the Arizona Counter-Terrorism Intelligence Center, or the ACTIC, my State's fusion center. I saw firsthand how fusion centers are disseminating Federal threat and intelligence information out to emergency responder providers, as well as collecting State and local information, and fusing it with Federal intelligence to enhance terrorist investigations and create a more complete picture. While fusion centers are continuing to mature, I am concerned about the lack of small cities' and rural areas' representation in fusion centers. As we continue to enhance the Nation's ability to share intelligence information, we need to ensure that all emergency service providers have access to this vital information. To help break down the information-sharing stovepipes, the ACTIC and 77 other fusion centers across the country need greater access to intelligence and information from the Department of Homeland Security and its components. Mr. Speaker, I introduced H.R. 3503 along with Chairman McCaul, Chairman King, and Representatives Barletta and Loudermilk to ensure that the Department is providing fusion centers with the resources needed to protect our Nation from terrorist attacks and other emergencies. This bill passed the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence and the full Committee on Homeland Security by voice vote with bipartisan support. I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) for adding two important provisions to this bill during the full committee markup. These provisions ensure that the Department of Homeland Security's information technology systems are user-friendly for State and local analysts, and require the Under Secretary of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis to sign a memorandum of understanding with each fusion center to ensure that each center is aware of what information can be publicly disclosed. Also, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Nunes of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and his staff for working with me and the Committee on Homeland Security to get this bill to the floor today. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3503, as amended, requires the Government Accountability Office, GAO, to conduct an assessment of the Department of Homeland Security personnel detailed to fusion centers and whether deploying additional personnel from several of the departmental components will enhance threat and homeland security information sharing. Having an unbiased assessment of staffing levels and responsibilities for Department of Homeland Security personnel deployed to fusion centers will be valuable in making decisions moving forward on the appropriate staffing levels. Additionally, this bill applauds the effort of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis in establishing a program to provide top secret clearances to appropriate State and local analysts in fusion centers. To ensure that this initiative is carried out efficiently and in a manner that ensures operational security, the bill requires DHS to submit a onetime report to Congress. The committee has received testimony from State and local law enforcement about the value additional clearances will provide. The need for top secret clearances was also a key finding [[Page H7359]] of the committee's Foreign Fighter Task Force, of which I was proud to be a member. It is especially timely that we are considering this bill today. This week is the annual conference held by the National Fusion Center Association. This bill will help ensure that our State and local law enforcement officers, as well as fire and EMS personnel, are getting access to the information they need to protect our communities. Since the summer, our country has been at its highest threat posture since 9/11, given the large number of foreign fighters and ISIS- inspired plots. It is essential that Congress ensure that all of the dots are being connected. I urge all Members to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

I saw firsthand how fusion centers are disseminating Federal threat and intelligence information out to emergency responder providers, as well as collecting State and local information, and fusing it with Federal intelligence to enhance terrorist investigations and create a more complete picture. While fusion centers are continuing to mature, I am concerned about the lack of small cities' and rural areas' representation in fusion centers. As we continue to enhance the Nation's ability to share intelligence information, we need to ensure that all emergency service providers have access to this vital information. To help break down the information-sharing stovepipes, the ACTIC and 77 other fusion centers across the country need greater access to intelligence and information from the Department of Homeland Security and its components. Mr. Speaker, I introduced H.R. 3503 along with Chairman McCaul, Chairman King, and Representatives Barletta and Loudermilk to ensure that the Department is providing fusion centers with the resources needed to protect our Nation from terrorist attacks and other emergencies. This bill passed the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence and the full Committee on Homeland Security by voice vote with bipartisan support. I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) for adding two important provisions to this bill during the full committee markup. These provisions ensure that the Department of Homeland Security's information technology systems are user-friendly for State and local analysts, and require the Under Secretary of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis to sign a memorandum of understanding with each fusion center to ensure that each center is aware of what information can be publicly disclosed. Also, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Nunes of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and his staff for working with me and the Committee on Homeland Security to get this bill to the floor today. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3503, as amended, requires the Government Accountability Office, GAO, to conduct an assessment of the Department of Homeland Security personnel detailed to fusion centers and whether deploying additional personnel from several of the departmental components will enhance threat and homeland security information sharing. Having an unbiased assessment of staffing levels and responsibilities for Department of Homeland Security personnel deployed to fusion centers will be valuable in making decisions moving forward on the appropriate staffing levels. Additionally, this bill applauds the effort of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis in establishing a program to provide top secret clearances to appropriate State and local analysts in fusion centers. To ensure that this initiative is carried out efficiently and in a manner that ensures operational security, the bill requires DHS to submit a onetime report to Congress. The committee has received testimony from State and local law enforcement about the value additional clearances will provide. The need for top secret clearances was also a key finding [[Page H7359]] of the committee's Foreign Fighter Task Force, of which I was proud to be a member. It is especially timely that we are considering this bill today. This week is the annual conference held by the National Fusion Center Association. This bill will help ensure that our State and local law enforcement officers, as well as fire and EMS personnel, are getting access to the information they need to protect our communities. Since the summer, our country has been at its highest threat posture since 9/11, given the large number of foreign fighters and ISIS- inspired plots. It is essential that Congress ensure that all of the dots are being connected. I urge all Members to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, October 28, 2015. Hon. Michael McCaul, Chairman, House Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman McCaul: On September 30, 2015, your committee ordered H.R. 3503, the ``Department of Homeland Security Support to Fusion Centers Act of 2015,'' reported. Additionally, on that same day, your committee ordered H.R. 3598, the ``Fusion Center Enhancement Act of 2015,'' reported. As you know, both H.R. 3503 and H.R. 3598 contain provisions within the jurisdiction of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. On the basis of your consultations with the Committee and in order to expedite the House's consideration of both bills, the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence will not assert a jurisdictional claim over either bill by seeking a sequential referral. This courtesy is, however, conditioned on our mutual understanding and agreement that it will in no way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Permanent Select Committee with respect to the appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in the bills or any similar legislation. I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming this understanding and would request that you include a copy of this letter and your response in the committee reports for both bills and in the Congressional Record during their floor consideration. Thank you in advance for your cooperation. Sincerely, Devin Nunes, Chairman. ____ House of Representatives, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC, October 29, 2015. Hon. Devin Nunes, Chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Washington, DC. Dear Chairman Nunes: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 3503, the ``Department of Homeland Security Support to Fusion Centers Act of 2015,'' and H.R. 3598, the ``Fusion Center Enhancement Act of 2015.'' I appreciate your support in bringing both of these measures before the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence will not seek a sequential referral on either bill. I acknowledge that by foregoing a sequential referral on these two pieces of legislation, your Committee is not diminishing or altering its jurisdiction with respect to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in these bills or any similar legislation. Additionally, should a conference on either bill be necessary, I would support your request to have the Permanent Select Committee represented on the conference committee. I will include copies of this exchange in the reports for H.R. 3503 and H.R. 3598 and in the Congressional Record during consideration of these bills on the House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this matter. Sincerely, Michael T. McCaul, Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security. Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3503, the Department of Homeland Security Support Fusion Centers Act of 2015. Mr. Speaker, this bill was passed unanimously by the committee last month, and I am pleased that it is being considered on the House floor today. After the terrorist attacks of 9/11, there was broad recognition that the traditional stovepipes to the sharing of homeland security information needed to be cleared and that the Federal Government needed to do more to share timely information with State and local partners. A key mechanism to fostering such information sharing has been the development of a network of fusion centers across the Nation. These centers allow Federal intelligence and homeland security information to be shared with State and local law enforcement and other key stakeholders. As of today, 77 fusion centers have been stood up by State and local governments and participate in the Department of Homeland Security's National Network of Fusion Centers. For fusion centers to realize their full promise, it is critical that personnel assigned to fusion centers be able to access Department of Homeland Security information, data, and personnel. In the course of conducting oversight of fusion centers, the committee has learned that not enough State and local analysts and officials assigned to these centers have the TS/SCI clearances necessary to foster the timely sharing of homeland security information and intelligence. H.R. 3503, for the first time, authorizes DHS to sponsor State and local analysts for security clearances. All of us, as the chairwoman has said, have heard from our State and locals that this is, indeed, a problem. The approach taken is consistent with ongoing DHS efforts to sponsor TS and SCI clearances on appropriate State, local, tribal, as well as territorial partners' levels. In the 14 years since 9/11, there has been progress across the Federal Government at breaking down institutional stovepipes and moving away from a ``need to know'' to a ``need to share'' culture. Certainly with the right support and buy-in at the Federal level, the Department's National Network of Fusion Centers holds great promise for fostering more opportunities to interdict would-be terrorists before they attack and contributing to better awareness, preparedness, and responses at all levels. Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the gentlewoman from Arizona for this legislation. Again, this is getting us all on the same sheet of music. We absolutely have to have fusion centers operating in uniformity, and we should not have fusion centers doing their own thing. We are fighting this together. The stovepiping of information is not good, and it is not healthy. We have problems identifying bad actors, terrorists, and what have you. So I urge passage of H.R. 3503, the Department of Homeland Security Support to Fusion Centers Act of 2015. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. {time} 1645 Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. One of the core missions of the Department of Homeland Security is to share threat information with State and local first responders. Fusion centers are a key mechanism for that process. As fusion centers continue to mature into national assets, Congress must ensure the Department of Homeland Security is supporting fusion centers with the resources needed to keep our communities safe. Once again, I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 3503. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland Security Committee, I rise in support of H.R. 3503, the ``Homeland Security Support Fusion Centers Act of 2015.'' State and major urban area fusion centers serve as central points within the state and local environment for the receipt, analysis, gathering, and sharing of threat-related information between the federal government and state, local, tribal, territorial, and private sector partners. H.R. 3503 will require the Under Secretary of Intelligence and Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in coordination with the homeland security advisors of the states to provide an assessment of fusion center personnel needs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security. H.R. 3503 will amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to improve the management and administration of the security clearance processes throughout the Department of Homeland Security. Homeland Security advisors must conduct a needs assessment of Department personnel assigned to fusion centers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 210A of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The assessment must include information on: the current deployment of DHS personnel to each fusion center; the roles and responsibilities of Office of Intelligence and Analysis intelligence officers, intelligence analysts, senior reports officers, reports officers, and regional directors deployed to fusion centers; federal resources, in addition to personnel, [[Page H7360]] provided to each fusion center; whether deploying additional personnel would enhance intelligence and information sharing between DHS and federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial partners; fusion centers located in jurisdictions along land and maritime borders of the United States and the degree to which deploying personnel from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Coast Guard to such centers would enhance the integrity and security at such borders; and fusion centers located in jurisdictions with large and medium hub airports and the degree to which deploying personnel from the Transportation Security Administration to such centers would enhance aviation security. The Under Secretary must submit such assessment to specified congressional committees, together with a report on: the number of personnel assigned to fusion centers from the Office of Intelligence and Analysis; the number of personnel assigned to the National Network of Fusion Centers from components and offices of DHS and the methodology for determining the fusion centers to which such personnel are assigned; and an implementation plan for determining how DHS's personnel resources will be allocated to fusion centers in the future. H.R. 3503 will help to ensure the safety of our fusion centers and the personnel that work within these centers. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 3503. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3503, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_271.csv,21991,21991,22061,"[congressional record volume 161, number 162 (monday, november 2, 2015)] [house] [pages h7357-h7360] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] department of homeland security support to fusion centers act of 2015 ms. mcsally. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 3503) to require an assessment of fusion center personnel needs, and for other purposes, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 3503 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``department of homeland security support to fusion centers act of 2015''. sec. 2. fusion center personnel needs assessment. not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of this act, the comptroller general of the united states shall conduct an assessment of department of homeland security personnel assigned to fusion centers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 210a of the homeland security act of 2002 (6 u.s.c. 124h), including an assessment of whether deploying additional department personnel to such fusion centers would enhance the department's mission under section 101(b) of such act and the national network of fusion centers. the assessment required under this subsection shall include the following: (1) information on the current deployment of the department's personnel to each fusion center.

boston marathon bombings, and fort hood to increase and enhance the nation's ability to detect and prevent terrorist attacks. however, the elevated potential for attacks carried out by individuals either directed or inspired by radical violent extremism reinforces that there is more work to be done, especially breaking down information-sharing stovepipes. ensuring that the federal government is sharing intelligence and homeland security information with state and local officials is a vital component to that effort. in june, i visited the arizona counter-terrorism intelligence center, or the actic, my state's fusion center. i saw firsthand how fusion centers are disseminating federal threat and intelligence information out to emergency responder providers, as well as collecting state and

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1853) to direct the President to develop a strategy to obtain observer status for Taiwan in the International Criminal Police Organization, and for other purposes. [[Page H7364]] The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 1853 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL POLICE ORGANIZATION. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) Safety, security and peace is important to every citizen of the world, and shared information ensuring wide assistance among police authorities of nations for expeditious dissemination of information regarding criminal activities greatly assists in these efforts. (2) Direct and unobstructed participation in the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) is beneficial for all nations and their police authorities. Internationally shared information with authorized police authorities is vital to peacekeeping efforts. (3) With a history dating back to 1914, the role of INTERPOL is defined in its constitution: ``To ensure and promote the widest possible mutual assistance between all criminal police authorities within the limits of the laws existing in the different countries and in the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.''. (4) Ongoing international threats, including international networks of terrorism, show the ongoing necessity to be ever inclusive of nations willing to work together to combat criminal activity. The ability of police authorities to coordinate, preempt, and act swiftly and in unison is an essential element of crisis prevention and response. (5) Taiwan maintained full membership in INTERPOL starting in 1964 through its National Police Administration but was ejected in 1984 when the People's Republic of China (PRC) applied for membership. (6) Nonmembership prevents Taiwan from gaining access to INTERPOL's I-24/7 global police communications system, which provides real-time information on criminals and global criminal activities. Taiwan is relegated to second-hand information from friendly nations, including the United States. (7) Taiwan is unable to swiftly share information on criminals and suspicious activity with the international community, leaving a huge void in the global crime-fighting efforts and leaving the entire world at risk. (8) The United States, in the 1994 Taiwan Policy Review, declared its intention to support Taiwan's participation in appropriate international organizations and has consistently reiterated that support. (9) Following the enactment of Public Law 108-235, a law authorizing the Secretary of State to initiate and implement a plan to endorse and obtain observer status for Taiwan at the annual summit of the World Health Assembly and subsequent advocacy by the United States, Taiwan was granted observer status to the World Health Assembly for six consecutive years since 2009. Both prior to and in its capacity as an observer, Taiwan has contributed significantly to the international community's collective efforts in pandemic control, monitoring, early warning, and other related matters. (10) INTERPOL's constitution allows for observers at its meetings by ``police bodies which are not members of the Organization''. (b) Taiwan's Participation in INTERPOL.--The President shall-- (1) develop a strategy to obtain observer status for Taiwan in INTERPOL and at other related meetings, activities, and mechanisms thereafter; and (2) instruct INTERPOL Washington to officially request observer status for Taiwan in INTERPOL and to actively urge INTERPOL member states to support such observer status and participation for Taiwan. (c) Report Concerning Observer Status for Taiwan in INTERPOL.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the President shall transmit to Congress a report, in unclassified form, describing the United States strategy to endorse and obtain observer status for Taiwan in INTERPOL and at other related meetings, activities, and mechanisms thereafter. The report shall include the following: (1) A description of the efforts the President has made to encourage INTERPOL member states to promote Taiwan's bid to obtain observer status in INTERPOL. (2) A description of the actions the President will take to endorse and obtain observer status for Taiwan in INTERPOL and at other related meetings, activities, and mechanisms thereafter. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida. General Leave Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Florida? There was no objection. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank the chairman of the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee, Congressman Matt Salmon, for introducing this important resolution. Taiwan is indeed a strong ally of the United States, one which shares our interests and values, including an enduring commitment to democracy and the freedom of expression. Taiwan is a beacon of freedom in the Pacific, serving as an inspiration for the world's oppressed, and it serves as a model for future democratic transitions. Unfortunately, however, Taiwan is under increasing pressure from an aggressive China that is attempting to assert its dominance in the Pacific and to isolate Taiwan on the international stage. One organization that China has prevented Taiwan from joining is INTERPOL, the International Criminal Police Organization. INTERPOL was created, Mr. Speaker, to promote international cooperation between criminal police authorities; but because of undue Chinese pressure, Taiwan is no longer a member of INTERPOL. Taiwan is forced to receive less effective, secondhand information about international criminals and their illicit activities. Likewise, Taiwan cannot share the law enforcement information that it gathers in order to benefit INTERPOL. In China's efforts to exclude Taiwan and in the efforts of some nations to accommodate China, they have ended up hurting Taiwan and the entire international community in the process. So we have this bill before us, Mr. Speaker. This bill by Congressman Salmon directs the President to request observer status for Taiwan at INTERPOL, to urge other INTERPOL members to support it, and for the President to develop a strategy to ensure the participation of Taiwan. I am pleased to support this legislation. I believe that the United States should be helping Taiwan's meaningful participation in all international organizations and entities in which it has expressed an interest in participating. Taiwan's exclusion from organizations like INTERPOL is dangerous. It is a dangerous practice. It hurts the international community just as much as it hurts the people of Taiwan. We must not allow U.N. politics or China's efforts to isolate Taiwan to exclude it from international organizations. It is, therefore, crucial that the United States provide the kind of military assistance, economic assistance, and political assistance that will allow Taiwan to resist any type of Chinese coercion. The Taiwan Relations Act, together with the Six Assurances are the cornerstone of U.S.-Taiwan relations, and we must always keep it as our guiding beacon. I know that this is a sentiment that is greatly shared by the members of our Foreign Affairs Committee and by the chairman of our committee, Mr. Royce of California, because the friendship between the people of the United States and Taiwan has cemented into one of the most cherished partnerships. I look forward to the United States Government demonstrating its continued commitment to the people of Taiwan with the passage of Mr. Salmon's bill. I want to thank, again, Chairman Salmon for introducing this important resolution. I am pleased to offer my support, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in support of this measure. Mr. Speaker, I want to also thank Mr. Salmon from Arizona, who chairs our Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, for authoring this bill. I am proud to be a cosponsor. The International Criminal Police Organization, what we call INTERPOL, helps law enforcement agencies around the world collaborate with one another. Thanks to INTERPOL, a task force in New York can share information with a police agency in Hamburg or flag a terrorist suspect for authorities in Tokyo. Sensitive information about criminals or missing persons is available at the push of a button for INTERPOL's [[Page H7365]] members. For decades, it has been a vital tool for global security. Until 1984, Taiwan was a member of INTERPOL; but since the People's Republic of China applied for membership, Taiwan has been left out. This is ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous. Taiwan has the 16th or 17th largest economy in the world. And anyone who has ever been to Taiwan, as I have and as my colleague has, will just be amazed at the democracy they have built themselves on that tiny island. The fact is that they look to the United States for protecting them and helping them. Because just like we share the same values with Israel, we share the same values with Taiwan, and that is why we work with them. Taiwan has been left out, and this gap in INTERPOL's membership creates a public safety risk for the people of Taiwan and also for the rest of the world. So nobody is saying that China should not be a member, but China should not have the right to exclude Taiwan. This legislation would close that gap. It would instruct the administration to push for Taiwan to be granted observer status in INTERPOL. Observer status, that is what we are asking for. There are countries around the world that function as countries, that have everything that all other countries have, and yet, because of politics, they are excluded from these international organizations. Taiwan is one such country. Kosovo is another type of country. We have to stop this. People that live in these countries need to not bear the brunt of politics, but really need the protections that citizens of other countries have. By our not giving them the protections, we leave ourselves a bit unprotected as well. So this legislation would instruct the administration to push for Taiwan to be granted observer status in INTERPOL. As an observer, Taiwan would have access to the information that law enforcement agencies already have. It would also allow Taiwan to contribute information to INTERPOL, information that could be used to stop crime or thwart terrorist activity, arrest human traffickers, or sideline other bad actors. Good precedent exists for giving Taiwan this status. Taiwan is an observer in the World Health Assembly, where it has played a vital role in contributing to public health and fighting pandemic disease. In fact, Taiwan has repeatedly shown itself to be a constructive, positive force in the global community. Countries around the world stand to benefit from Taiwan's inclusion in international organizations like INTERPOL. So not only does Taiwan benefit, but the rest of the world benefits. It is a no-brainer. It is a win-win situation for everybody. I support this legislation wholeheartedly. I urge my colleagues to do the same. I thank my colleague from Florida, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and the chairman from California, Ed Royce. Again, we are all in this together. This is great bipartisan legislation of the Foreign Affairs Committee. It is important for Taiwan and important for the United States. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, before I yield to Mr. Salmon, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), the esteemed chairman of our committee, who is here with us now, manage the rest of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Florida? There was no objection. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Salmon). He is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific and the author of this important measure. Mr. SALMON. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Ed Royce for bringing this important measure to the floor today and for being a constant champion of the people of Taiwan. I was able to go on a trip with the chairman to Taiwan, and I think that he is as close to royalty in Taiwan as anybody that I have ever met. They love Ed Royce. In fact, the guy that used to be called ``Mr. Taiwan'' was the former Senator from Arizona, Barry Goldwater, but I think Ed Royce has maybe taken that title away. I am just honored to be able to be here supporting this bill that he has allowed to come to the floor. I have been a long-time supporter of Taiwan, as have Members throughout this body on both sides of the aisle. Let me just segue for a minute. A lot of people out there get really, really frustrated by the partisan nature of what they see happening here in the Nation's Capital. A lot of people are frustrated: Why can't both sides just agree? I mean, after all, aren't we all Americans? The interesting thing is I wish more Americans could come and see our committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee, in action because it is the epitome of bipartisanship. Besides the fact that Chairman Ed Royce leads the committee and demands that we exhibit bipartisanship, Ranking Member Eliot Engel is one of the best men I have ever met in my life. And I mean that from the bottom of my heart. Whether it is dealing with terrorism in the Middle East or fairness across the globe like this issue with Taiwan and common sense, he is always on the right side. He leads his delegation, his folks on that side of the aisle in something that we have long believed, but sometimes it kind of gets lost in the cacophony of arguments here on Capitol Hill on other things, but that is that partisanship ends at the water's edge. My hat is off to you, Mr. Engel, because you have always exhibited that, and I appreciate the way that you have led this body in that way. Taiwan is a wonderful, thriving democracy. In fact, I had an opportunity as a young man to live there for 2 years, from 1977 to 1979, while serving a mission for my church. While I was there in 1978, the Nixon administration normalized relations with China, recognizing the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole, legal government of China and declaring it would withdraw diplomatic recognition from Taiwan. The U.S. Government has since articulated a one-China policy, which was a dark turn for U.S.-Taiwan relations. Since then, we have seen a Taiwan that is marginalized in the international community. Taiwan's ambiguous sovereignty status has contributed to its exclusion from many, many international organizations, despite Taiwan's obvious willingness to play a larger role in international affairs and international security, as it should. From humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to law enforcement and global health, so often it has been denied the right to share its knowledge and its expertise in the international fora. This bill, H.R. 1853, would improve Taiwan's capability to contribute and benefit from the international community in the interest of international security. H.R. 1853 would direct the President to develop a strategy to obtain observer status for Taiwan in the International Criminal Police Organization, or INTERPOL. It would also require the President to report to Congress on efforts to encourage Taiwan's inclusion in INTERPOL. Since the early 20th century, INTERPOL has facilitated mutual assistance between criminal police authorities worldwide through the sharing of information, such as access to comprehensive lists of suspicious persons and criminals. As we all know and, I think, as every American knows, terrorism and other nontraditional security challenges no longer end at our borders or anybody's borders. These threats are global by nature. {time} 1730 In order to secure domestic and international security, the sharing of information across borders is vital. Taiwan's exclusion from INTERPOL hampers efforts to prevent and respond to threats. To ensure that potential terrorists are barred from entering Taiwan, it is essential that Taiwan have direct access to INTERPOL and its I- 24/7 system, which provides real-time information on criminals and global criminal activities. Without this access, Taiwan is forced to cobble together its own list based on incomplete and untimely information obtained from a small number of friendly countries to Taiwan and Taiwan's own domestic intelligence. [[Page H7366]] Equally important, Taiwan is unable to share the information that it gathers on criminals and suspicious persons with INTERPOL directly. Mr. Engel called this policy silly. I think that that is very, very appropriate and accurate. This puts everybody at risk, when we have a policy that plays politics instead of common sense. Cooperation between Taiwan and INTERPOL could be markedly enhanced if Taiwan is able to become an observer. H.R. 1853, with 114 bipartisan cosponsors, continues to carry the torch of congressional support for Taiwan's membership and inclusion in the international community. Taiwan is a vibrant, democratic society, with much to contribute to the international community. The United States must do more to fulfill our obligations under the Taiwan Relations Act, which provides that the U.S. treat Taiwan the same as foreign countries, nations, states, government, or similar entities. This is a vote for U.S. support of Taiwan's inclusion in international affairs. This is a vote for international security. I urge my colleagues to vote to support Taiwan's participation in international policing efforts by supporting this legislation, H.R. 1853. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. We are all saying the same thing, and I think it really shows how important this legislation is. I want to mention the gentleman from Arizona, as I mentioned before. He was very kind about some of the things he said about me. You need to go on a trip to China or Taiwan with the gentleman from Arizona because he is very modest, but he speaks fluent Mandarin. He has great diplomatic skills, and the people there really appreciate what he has done. I appreciate him being the author of this important piece of legislation. It is true, when we talk about bipartisanship in foreign affairs, it is probably more important than in any other place. I have gone on a number of trips and we have had delegations of Republicans and Democrats together, and always, as Americans, the differences that we might have are very, very tiny. When you travel together and you go to another country, we realize how important it is that, as Americans, we stand united and that other countries respect our country for what our country has done and is doing. That is really important. I want to thank the gentleman from Arizona, my friend. He has been a vital force for this legislation, H.R. 1853, but he has also been a vital force on so many other issues on the Committee on Foreign Affairs and global issues that are really just so important. When we talk about global issues and talk about policy that we need to do, there really are no Democrats and no Republicans. We are all Americans. We want to make sure that other countries respect what we try to do. We believe in what this country stands for, and we want to have good relations with countries around the world. I think it is so important when Members travel there and meet with dignitaries and meet with leaders of the country and meet with other parliamentarians that people understand what the United States of America is all about. I want to thank the gentleman from Arizona for his leadership. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, as a strong original cosponsor. I want to thank Mr. Engel, and I want to thank Mr. Salmon and Mr. Brad Sherman for this legislation. Taiwan is a nation of 23 million people. It is a booming democracy, with a free and open media. It is a loyal friend. It is a loyal partner to the United States. Taiwan is engaged in important missions worldwide. We see the results of a lot of that engagement. Ebola is one most recently on our mind. When Ebola hit West Africa, it was Taiwan that donated 100,000 sets of protective equipment that were used to stop the spread of Ebola. It was Taiwan that gave so much in financial resources to help the sickest in Liberia. Taiwan today is assisting those who have been forced out of their homes by terrorists, whether it is in Syria or Iraq; yet, despite its active and constructive role internationally, Taiwan is excluded from many international organizations because of its political status. While Taiwan voluntarily adheres to the rules and the regulations of international organizations like the U.N., it is barred from participating. It is barred from being included in U.N. treaties against transnational organized crime and nuclear proliferation. This is not good for Taiwan, and it is not good for us. To better protect its citizens and all the people around the world who travel there, Taiwan is seeking observer status in the International Criminal Police Organization, which many know as INTERPOL. This organization enables police from 190 member countries to work together to make the world a safer place through information sharing, capacity building, and response coordination between police departments. That is 190 countries, but Taiwan is not included. The legislation before us today will help to secure observer status for Taiwan at INTERPOL. The measure requires the President of the United States to develop and execute a strategy to ensure that Taiwan participates in INTERPOL's next General Assembly meeting, which is coming up in Indonesia. This will bring better international law enforcement cooperation with one of our most important partners: Taiwan. Mr. Speaker, by way of history, Taiwan had full membership in INTERPOL starting back in 1964, but Taiwan was ejected from the law enforcement group in 1984, when the People's Republic of China applied for membership. Since then, Taiwan has relied on delayed secondhand information that they get from the United States about international criminals and global criminal activities, and that, frankly, makes Taiwan more vulnerable to security threats. Likewise, Taiwan cannot share the law enforcement information it gathers to the benefit, frankly, of INTERPOL and the rest of the community and all of the members of INTERPOL, all the police organizations that try to rely on that. And, of course, we are part of that. We could utilize that benefit. Mr. Speaker, the fact that Taiwan must rely on a convoluted process, with an added layer of bureaucracy, to access this critical information makes no sense. Taiwan regularly hosts the type of megaevents which often, unfortunately, attract terrorist activity, or they could. For example, in 2009 Taiwan hosted the World Games and had to rely solely on the United States to vet athletes and media lists, and with the U.S.' help, several suspicious persons were, in fact, identified. They were denied entry into Taiwan. In 2017 Taiwan will host the Summer Universiade, a student sporting event in which 900 athletes from 170 countries are expected to attend. This event is second only to the Olympics in the number of participants and countries that are represented. There must be a more streamlined way for Taiwan to access information from INTERPOL. As the number of visitors from Taiwan to the United States has grown exponentially, there is an urgent need to ensure that Taiwan's police forces have real-time access to information on criminal activities and on threats. Taiwan entered into the U.S. Visa Waiver Program in 2012. Since then, the number of Taiwanese visitors to the United States has increased by nearly 42 percent. From my home State of California, the increase in visitors from Taiwan has been a boon to the economy. I am proud to have worked on Taiwan's entry into the Visa Waiver Program because I know that, as a result of this agreement, Taiwanese Americans in southern California have a much easier time staying connected to their families, and business travelers are having an easier time, too. That is why I am also supporting Taiwan's participation in Customs and Border Protection's Global Entry program, which will make two-way travel even easier. Mr. Speaker, strengthening Taiwan's law enforcement capabilities benefits American citizens as much as it does the Taiwanese. Every year tens of thousands of Americans travel to Taiwan, and this bill will certainly help [[Page H7367]] Taiwan's police forces protect American citizens traveling in Taiwan. INTERPOL's constitution allows for observers at its meetings by police bodies which are not members of the organization. And so I am confident Taiwan will be able to be an observer. H.R. 1853 will support Taiwan's efforts to gain observer status with INTERPOL. It is going to improve everybody's security. Mr. Speaker, we must constantly be pressing to ensure that security across the globe is protected. Taiwan's unique political status has thus far hindered its inclusion in INTERPOL and is a vulnerable loophole for criminals and, frankly, for terrorists to target. With this piece of legislation, we are sending a clear message that safety is a priority. I want to again commend Representative Matt Salmon of Arizona, chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, and, of course, Mr. Engel and Mr. Sherman for authoring and introducing this important measure. I appreciated working with them on it. I will just say this of Mr. Salmon as well. He has a longstanding interest in Taiwan. His leadership on this measure is very much appreciated by all of us. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close on my side. I yield myself such time as I may consume. As I have said, we need to use every tool available to combat terrorism and disrupt criminal networks around the world. It only makes sense to have more partners at the table in that effort. So bringing Taiwan back into INTERPOL as an observer just makes common sense. The more participants in INTERPOL, the more good the organization can do. We should do all we can to bring willing contributors off the sidelines. Again, Taiwan was a member and was thrown out when everyone recognized People's Republic of China. There is room for both. There should be both. I again want to commend my friend, Mr. Salmon, who is largely responsible for this, and our chairman, Mr. Royce, who I think has more people from Taiwan in his district than virtually any other district in the country. So he knows quite a bit about Taiwan and quite a bit about what should be done. It is something that we are all saying the same thing. It makes sense for Taiwan. It makes sense for the United States. It makes sense for INTERPOL. I encourage my colleagues to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1853. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H7363-H7367] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1715 PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL POLICE ORGANIZATION Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1853) to direct the President to develop a strategy to obtain observer status for Taiwan in the International Criminal Police Organization, and for other purposes. [[Page H7364]] The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 1853 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL POLICE ORGANIZATION. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) Safety, security and peace is important to every citizen of the world, and shared information ensuring wide assistance among police authorities of nations for expeditious dissemination of information regarding criminal activities greatly assists in these efforts. (2) Direct and unobstructed participation in the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) is beneficial for all nations and their police authorities. Internationally shared information with authorized police authorities is vital to peacekeeping efforts. (3) With a history dating back to 1914, the role of INTERPOL is defined in its constitution: ``To ensure and promote the widest possible mutual assistance between all criminal police authorities within the limits of the laws existing in the different countries and in the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.''. (4) Ongoing international threats, including international networks of terrorism, show the ongoing necessity to be ever inclusive of nations willing to work together to combat criminal activity. The ability of police authorities to coordinate, preempt, and act swiftly and in unison is an essential element of crisis prevention and response. (5) Taiwan maintained full membership in INTERPOL starting in 1964 through its National Police Administration but was ejected in 1984 when the People's Republic of China (PRC) applied for membership. (6) Nonmembership prevents Taiwan from gaining access to INTERPOL's I-24/7 global police communications system, which provides real-time information on criminals and global criminal activities. Taiwan is relegated to second-hand information from friendly nations, including the United States. (7) Taiwan is unable to swiftly share information on criminals and suspicious activity with the international community, leaving a huge void in the global crime-fighting efforts and leaving the entire world at risk. (8) The United States, in the 1994 Taiwan Policy Review, declared its intention to support Taiwan's participation in appropriate international organizations and has consistently reiterated that support. (9) Following the enactment of Public Law 108-235, a law authorizing the Secretary of State to initiate and implement a plan to endorse and obtain observer status for Taiwan at the annual summit of the World Health Assembly and subsequent advocacy by the United States, Taiwan was granted observer status to the World Health Assembly for six consecutive years since 2009. Both prior to and in its capacity as an observer, Taiwan has contributed significantly to the international community's collective efforts in pandemic control, monitoring, early warning, and other related matters. (10) INTERPOL's constitution allows for observers at its meetings by ``police bodies which are not members of the Organization''. (b) Taiwan's Participation in INTERPOL.--The President shall-- (1) develop a strategy to obtain observer status for Taiwan in INTERPOL and at other related meetings, activities, and mechanisms thereafter; and (2) instruct INTERPOL Washington to officially request observer status for Taiwan in INTERPOL and to actively urge INTERPOL member states to support such observer status and participation for Taiwan. (c) Report Concerning Observer Status for Taiwan in INTERPOL.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the President shall transmit to Congress a report, in unclassified form, describing the United States strategy to endorse and obtain observer status for Taiwan in INTERPOL and at other related meetings, activities, and mechanisms thereafter. The report shall include the following: (1) A description of the efforts the President has made to encourage INTERPOL member states to promote Taiwan's bid to obtain observer status in INTERPOL. (2) A description of the actions the President will take to endorse and obtain observer status for Taiwan in INTERPOL and at other related meetings, activities, and mechanisms thereafter. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida. General Leave Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Florida? There was no objection. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank the chairman of the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee, Congressman Matt Salmon, for introducing this important resolution. Taiwan is indeed a strong ally of the United States, one which shares our interests and values, including an enduring commitment to democracy and the freedom of expression.

It is a no-brainer. It is a win-win situation for everybody. I support this legislation wholeheartedly. I urge my colleagues to do the same. I thank my colleague from Florida, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and the chairman from California, Ed Royce. Again, we are all in this together. This is great bipartisan legislation of the Foreign Affairs Committee. It is important for Taiwan and important for the United States. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, before I yield to Mr. Salmon, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), the esteemed chairman of our committee, who is here with us now, manage the rest of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Florida? There was no objection. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Salmon). He is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific and the author of this important measure. Mr. SALMON. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Ed Royce for bringing this important measure to the floor today and for being a constant champion of the people of Taiwan. I was able to go on a trip with the chairman to Taiwan, and I think that he is as close to royalty in Taiwan as anybody that I have ever met. They love Ed Royce. In fact, the guy that used to be called ``Mr. Taiwan'' was the former Senator from Arizona, Barry Goldwater, but I think Ed Royce has maybe taken that title away. I am just honored to be able to be here supporting this bill that he has allowed to come to the floor. I have been a long-time supporter of Taiwan, as have Members throughout this body on both sides of the aisle. Let me just segue for a minute. A lot of people out there get really, really frustrated by the partisan nature of what they see happening here in the Nation's Capital. A lot of people are frustrated: Why can't both sides just agree? I mean, after all, aren't we all Americans? The interesting thing is I wish more Americans could come and see our committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee, in action because it is the epitome of bipartisanship. Besides the fact that Chairman Ed Royce leads the committee and demands that we exhibit bipartisanship, Ranking Member Eliot Engel is one of the best men I have ever met in my life. And I mean that from the bottom of my heart. Whether it is dealing with terrorism in the Middle East or fairness across the globe like this issue with Taiwan and common sense, he is always on the right side. He leads his delegation, his folks on that side of the aisle in something that we have long believed, but sometimes it kind of gets lost in the cacophony of arguments here on Capitol Hill on other things, but that is that partisanship ends at the water's edge. My hat is off to you, Mr. Engel, because you have always exhibited that, and I appreciate the way that you have led this body in that way. Taiwan is a wonderful, thriving democracy. In fact, I had an opportunity as a young man to live there for 2 years, from 1977 to 1979, while serving a mission for my church. While I was there in 1978, the Nixon administration normalized relations with China, recognizing the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole, legal government of China and declaring it would withdraw diplomatic recognition from Taiwan. The U.S. Government has since articulated a one-China policy, which was a dark turn for U.S.-Taiwan relations. Since then, we have seen a Taiwan that is marginalized in the international community. Taiwan's ambiguous sovereignty status has contributed to its exclusion from many, many international organizations, despite Taiwan's obvious willingness to play a larger role in international affairs and international security, as it should. From humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to law enforcement and global health, so often it has been denied the right to share its knowledge and its expertise in the international fora. This bill, H.R. 1853, would improve Taiwan's capability to contribute and benefit from the international community in the interest of international security. H.R. 1853 would direct the President to develop a strategy to obtain observer status for Taiwan in the International Criminal Police Organization, or INTERPOL. It would also require the President to report to Congress on efforts to encourage Taiwan's inclusion in INTERPOL. Since the early 20th century, INTERPOL has facilitated mutual assistance between criminal police authorities worldwide through the sharing of information, such as access to comprehensive lists of suspicious persons and criminals. As we all know and, I think, as every American knows, terrorism and other nontraditional security challenges no longer end at our borders or anybody's borders. These threats are global by nature. {time} 1730 In order to secure domestic and international security, the sharing of information across borders is vital. Taiwan's exclusion from INTERPOL hampers efforts to prevent and respond to threats. To ensure that potential terrorists are barred from entering Taiwan, it is essential that Taiwan have direct access to INTERPOL and its I- 24/7 system, which provides real-time information on criminals and global criminal activities. Without this access, Taiwan is forced to cobble together its own list based on incomplete and untimely information obtained from a small number of friendly countries to Taiwan and Taiwan's own domestic intelligence. [[Page H7366]] Equally important, Taiwan is unable to share the information that it gathers on criminals and suspicious persons with INTERPOL directly. Mr. Engel called this policy silly. I think that that is very, very appropriate and accurate. This puts everybody at risk, when we have a policy that plays politics instead of common sense. Cooperation between Taiwan and INTERPOL could be markedly enhanced if Taiwan is able to become an observer. H.R. 1853, with 114 bipartisan cosponsors, continues to carry the torch of congressional support for Taiwan's membership and inclusion in the international community. Taiwan is a vibrant, democratic society, with much to contribute to the international community. The United States must do more to fulfill our obligations under the Taiwan Relations Act, which provides that the U.S. treat Taiwan the same as foreign countries, nations, states, government, or similar entities. This is a vote for U.S. support of Taiwan's inclusion in international affairs. This is a vote for international security. I urge my colleagues to vote to support Taiwan's participation in international policing efforts by supporting this legislation, H.R. 1853. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. We are all saying the same thing, and I think it really shows how important this legislation is. I want to mention the gentleman from Arizona, as I mentioned before. He was very kind about some of the things he said about me. You need to go on a trip to China or Taiwan with the gentleman from Arizona because he is very modest, but he speaks fluent Mandarin. He has great diplomatic skills, and the people there really appreciate what he has done. I appreciate him being the author of this important piece of legislation. It is true, when we talk about bipartisanship in foreign affairs, it is probably more important than in any other place. I have gone on a number of trips and we have had delegations of Republicans and Democrats together, and always, as Americans, the differences that we might have are very, very tiny. When you travel together and you go to another country, we realize how important it is that, as Americans, we stand united and that other countries respect our country for what our country has done and is doing. That is really important. I want to thank the gentleman from Arizona, my friend. He has been a vital force for this legislation, H.R. 1853, but he has also been a vital force on so many other issues on the Committee on Foreign Affairs and global issues that are really just so important. When we talk about global issues and talk about policy that we need to do, there really are no Democrats and no Republicans. We are all Americans. We want to make sure that other countries respect what we try to do. We believe in what this country stands for, and we want to have good relations with countries around the world. I think it is so important when Members travel there and meet with dignitaries and meet with leaders of the country and meet with other parliamentarians that people understand what the United States of America is all about. I want to thank the gentleman from Arizona for his leadership. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, as a strong original cosponsor. I want to thank Mr. Engel, and I want to thank Mr. Salmon and Mr. Brad Sherman for this legislation. Taiwan is a nation of 23 million people. It is a booming democracy, with a free and open media. It is a loyal friend. It is a loyal partner to the United States. Taiwan is engaged in important missions worldwide. We see the results of a lot of that engagement. Ebola is one most recently on our mind. When Ebola hit West Africa, it was Taiwan that donated 100,000 sets of protective equipment that were used to stop the spread of Ebola. It was Taiwan that gave so much in financial resources to help the sickest in Liberia. Taiwan today is assisting those who have been forced out of their homes by terrorists, whether it is in Syria or Iraq; yet, despite its active and constructive role internationally, Taiwan is excluded from many international organizations because of its political status. While Taiwan voluntarily adheres to the rules and the regulations of international organizations like the U.N., it is barred from participating. It is barred from being included in U.N. treaties against transnational organized crime and nuclear proliferation. This is not good for Taiwan, and it is not good for us. To better protect its citizens and all the people around the world who travel there, Taiwan is seeking observer status in the International Criminal Police Organization, which many know as INTERPOL. This organization enables police from 190 member countries to work together to make the world a safer place through information sharing, capacity building, and response coordination between police departments. That is 190 countries, but Taiwan is not included. The legislation before us today will help to secure observer status for Taiwan at INTERPOL. The measure requires the President of the United States to develop and execute a strategy to ensure that Taiwan participates in INTERPOL's next General Assembly meeting, which is coming up in Indonesia. This will bring better international law enforcement cooperation with one of our most important partners: Taiwan. Mr. Speaker, by way of history, Taiwan had full membership in INTERPOL starting back in 1964, but Taiwan was ejected from the law enforcement group in 1984, when the People's Republic of China applied for membership. Since then, Taiwan has relied on delayed secondhand information that they get from the United States about international criminals and global criminal activities, and that, frankly, makes Taiwan more vulnerable to security threats. Likewise, Taiwan cannot share the law enforcement information it gathers to the benefit, frankly, of INTERPOL and the rest of the community and all of the members of INTERPOL, all the police organizations that try to rely on that. And, of course, we are part of that. We could utilize that benefit. Mr. Speaker, the fact that Taiwan must rely on a convoluted process, with an added layer of bureaucracy, to access this critical information makes no sense. Taiwan regularly hosts the type of megaevents which often, unfortunately, attract terrorist activity, or they could. For example, in 2009 Taiwan hosted the World Games and had to rely solely on the United States to vet athletes and media lists, and with the U.S.' help, several suspicious persons were, in fact, identified. They were denied entry into Taiwan. In 2017 Taiwan will host the Summer Universiade, a student sporting event in which 900 athletes from 170 countries are expected to attend. This event is second only to the Olympics in the number of participants and countries that are represented. There must be a more streamlined way for Taiwan to access information from INTERPOL. As the number of visitors from Taiwan to the United States has grown exponentially, there is an urgent need to ensure that Taiwan's police forces have real-time access to information on criminal activities and on threats. Taiwan entered into the U.S. Visa Waiver Program in 2012. Since then, the number of Taiwanese visitors to the United States has increased by nearly 42 percent. From my home State of California, the increase in visitors from Taiwan has been a boon to the economy. I am proud to have worked on Taiwan's entry into the Visa Waiver Program because I know that, as a result of this agreement, Taiwanese Americans in southern California have a much easier time staying connected to their families, and business travelers are having an easier time, too. That is why I am also supporting Taiwan's participation in Customs and Border Protection's Global Entry program, which will make two-way travel even easier. Mr. Speaker, strengthening Taiwan's law enforcement capabilities benefits American citizens as much as it does the Taiwanese. Every year tens of thousands of Americans travel to Taiwan, and this bill will certainly help [[Page H7367]] Taiwan's police forces protect American citizens traveling in Taiwan. INTERPOL's constitution allows for observers at its meetings by police bodies which are not members of the organization. And so I am confident Taiwan will be able to be an observer. H.R. 1853 will support Taiwan's efforts to gain observer status with INTERPOL. It is going to improve everybody's security. Mr. Speaker, we must constantly be pressing to ensure that security across the globe is protected. Taiwan's unique political status has thus far hindered its inclusion in INTERPOL and is a vulnerable loophole for criminals and, frankly, for terrorists to target. With this piece of legislation, we are sending a clear message that safety is a priority. I want to again commend Representative Matt Salmon of Arizona, chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, and, of course, Mr. Engel and Mr. Sherman for authoring and introducing this important measure. I appreciated working with them on it. I will just say this of Mr. Salmon as well. He has a longstanding interest in Taiwan. His leadership on this measure is very much appreciated by all of us. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close on my side. I yield myself such time as I may consume. As I have said, we need to use every tool available to combat terrorism and disrupt criminal networks around the world. It only makes sense to have more partners at the table in that effort. So bringing Taiwan back into INTERPOL as an observer just makes common sense. The more participants in INTERPOL, the more good the organization can do. We should do all we can to bring willing contributors off the sidelines. Again, Taiwan was a member and was thrown out when everyone recognized People's Republic of China. There is room for both. There should be both. I again want to commend my friend, Mr. Salmon, who is largely responsible for this, and our chairman, Mr. Royce, who I think has more people from Taiwan in his district than virtually any other district in the country. So he knows quite a bit about Taiwan and quite a bit about what should be done. It is something that we are all saying the same thing. It makes sense for Taiwan. It makes sense for the United States. It makes sense for INTERPOL. I encourage my colleagues to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1853. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H7363-H7367] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1715 PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL POLICE ORGANIZATION Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1853) to direct the President to develop a strategy to obtain observer status for Taiwan in the International Criminal Police Organization, and for other purposes. [[Page H7364]] The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 1853 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL POLICE ORGANIZATION. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) Safety, security and peace is important to every citizen of the world, and shared information ensuring wide assistance among police authorities of nations for expeditious dissemination of information regarding criminal activities greatly assists in these efforts. (2) Direct and unobstructed participation in the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) is beneficial for all nations and their police authorities. Internationally shared information with authorized police authorities is vital to peacekeeping efforts. (3) With a history dating back to 1914, the role of INTERPOL is defined in its constitution: ``To ensure and promote the widest possible mutual assistance between all criminal police authorities within the limits of the laws existing in the different countries and in the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.''. (4) Ongoing international threats, including international networks of terrorism, show the ongoing necessity to be ever inclusive of nations willing to work together to combat criminal activity. The ability of police authorities to coordinate, preempt, and act swiftly and in unison is an essential element of crisis prevention and response. (5) Taiwan maintained full membership in INTERPOL starting in 1964 through its National Police Administration but was ejected in 1984 when the People's Republic of China (PRC) applied for membership. (6) Nonmembership prevents Taiwan from gaining access to INTERPOL's I-24/7 global police communications system, which provides real-time information on criminals and global criminal activities. Taiwan is relegated to second-hand information from friendly nations, including the United States. (7) Taiwan is unable to swiftly share information on criminals and suspicious activity with the international community, leaving a huge void in the global crime-fighting efforts and leaving the entire world at risk. (8) The United States, in the 1994 Taiwan Policy Review, declared its intention to support Taiwan's participation in appropriate international organizations and has consistently reiterated that support. (9) Following the enactment of Public Law 108-235, a law authorizing the Secretary of State to initiate and implement a plan to endorse and obtain observer status for Taiwan at the annual summit of the World Health Assembly and subsequent advocacy by the United States, Taiwan was granted observer status to the World Health Assembly for six consecutive years since 2009. Both prior to and in its capacity as an observer, Taiwan has contributed significantly to the international community's collective efforts in pandemic control, monitoring, early warning, and other related matters. (10) INTERPOL's constitution allows for observers at its meetings by ``police bodies which are not members of the Organization''. (b) Taiwan's Participation in INTERPOL.--The President shall-- (1) develop a strategy to obtain observer status for Taiwan in INTERPOL and at other related meetings, activities, and mechanisms thereafter; and (2) instruct INTERPOL Washington to officially request observer status for Taiwan in INTERPOL and to actively urge INTERPOL member states to support such observer status and participation for Taiwan. (c) Report Concerning Observer Status for Taiwan in INTERPOL.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the President shall transmit to Congress a report, in unclassified form, describing the United States strategy to endorse and obtain observer status for Taiwan in INTERPOL and at other related meetings, activities, and mechanisms thereafter. The report shall include the following: (1) A description of the efforts the President has made to encourage INTERPOL member states to promote Taiwan's bid to obtain observer status in INTERPOL. (2) A description of the actions the President will take to endorse and obtain observer status for Taiwan in INTERPOL and at other related meetings, activities, and mechanisms thereafter. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida. General Leave Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Florida? There was no objection. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank the chairman of the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee, Congressman Matt Salmon, for introducing this important resolution. Taiwan is indeed a strong ally of the United States, one which shares our interests and values, including an enduring commitment to democracy and the freedom of expression. Taiwan is a beacon of freedom in the Pacific, serving as an inspiration for the world's oppressed, and it serves as a model for future democratic transitions. Unfortunately, however, Taiwan is under increasing pressure from an aggressive China that is attempting to assert its dominance in the Pacific and to isolate Taiwan on the international stage. One organization that China has prevented Taiwan from joining is INTERPOL, the International Criminal Police Organization. INTERPOL was created, Mr. Speaker, to promote international cooperation between criminal police authorities; but because of undue Chinese pressure, Taiwan is no longer a member of INTERPOL. Taiwan is forced to receive less effective, secondhand information about international criminals and their illicit activities. Likewise, Taiwan cannot share the law enforcement information that it gathers in order to benefit INTERPOL. In China's efforts to exclude Taiwan and in the efforts of some nations to accommodate China, they have ended up hurting Taiwan and the entire international community in the process. So we have this bill before us, Mr. Speaker. This bill by Congressman Salmon directs the President to request observer status for Taiwan at INTERPOL, to urge other INTERPOL members to support it, and for the President to develop a strategy to ensure the participation of Taiwan. I am pleased to support this legislation. I believe that the United States should be helping Taiwan's meaningful participation in all international organizations and entities in which it has expressed an interest in participating. Taiwan's exclusion from organizations like INTERPOL is dangerous. It is a dangerous practice. It hurts the international community just as much as it hurts the people of Taiwan. We must not allow U.N. politics or China's efforts to isolate Taiwan to exclude it from international organizations. It is, therefore, crucial that the United States provide the kind of military assistance, economic assistance, and political assistance that will allow Taiwan to resist any type of Chinese coercion. The Taiwan Relations Act, together with the Six Assurances are the cornerstone of U.S.-Taiwan relations, and we must always keep it as our guiding beacon. I know that this is a sentiment that is greatly shared by the members of our Foreign Affairs Committee and by the chairman of our committee, Mr. Royce of California, because the friendship between the people of the United States and Taiwan has cemented into one of the most cherished partnerships. I look forward to the United States Government demonstrating its continued commitment to the people of Taiwan with the passage of Mr. Salmon's bill. I want to thank, again, Chairman Salmon for introducing this important resolution. I am pleased to offer my support, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in support of this measure. Mr. Speaker, I want to also thank Mr. Salmon from Arizona, who chairs our Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, for authoring this bill. I am proud to be a cosponsor. The International Criminal Police Organization, what we call INTERPOL, helps law enforcement agencies around the world collaborate with one another. Thanks to INTERPOL, a task force in New York can share information with a police agency in Hamburg or flag a terrorist suspect for authorities in Tokyo. Sensitive information about criminals or missing persons is available at the push of a button for INTERPOL's [[Page H7365]] members. For decades, it has been a vital tool for global security. Until 1984, Taiwan was a member of INTERPOL; but since the People's Republic of China applied for membership, Taiwan has been left out. This is ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous. Taiwan has the 16th or 17th largest economy in the world. And anyone who has ever been to Taiwan, as I have and as my colleague has, will just be amazed at the democracy they have built themselves on that tiny island. The fact is that they look to the United States for protecting them and helping them. Because just like we share the same values with Israel, we share the same values with Taiwan, and that is why we work with them. Taiwan has been left out, and this gap in INTERPOL's membership creates a public safety risk for the people of Taiwan and also for the rest of the world. So nobody is saying that China should not be a member, but China should not have the right to exclude Taiwan. This legislation would close that gap. It would instruct the administration to push for Taiwan to be granted observer status in INTERPOL. Observer status, that is what we are asking for. There are countries around the world that function as countries, that have everything that all other countries have, and yet, because of politics, they are excluded from these international organizations. Taiwan is one such country. Kosovo is another type of country. We have to stop this. People that live in these countries need to not bear the brunt of politics, but really need the protections that citizens of other countries have. By our not giving them the protections, we leave ourselves a bit unprotected as well. So this legislation would instruct the administration to push for Taiwan to be granted observer status in INTERPOL. As an observer, Taiwan would have access to the information that law enforcement agencies already have. It would also allow Taiwan to contribute information to INTERPOL, information that could be used to stop crime or thwart terrorist activity, arrest human traffickers, or sideline other bad actors. Good precedent exists for giving Taiwan this status. Taiwan is an observer in the World Health Assembly, where it has played a vital role in contributing to public health and fighting pandemic disease. In fact, Taiwan has repeatedly shown itself to be a constructive, positive force in the global community. Countries around the world stand to benefit from Taiwan's inclusion in international organizations like INTERPOL. So not only does Taiwan benefit, but the rest of the world benefits. It is a no-brainer. It is a win-win situation for everybody. I support this legislation wholeheartedly. I urge my colleagues to do the same. I thank my colleague from Florida, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and the chairman from California, Ed Royce. Again, we are all in this together. This is great bipartisan legislation of the Foreign Affairs Committee. It is important for Taiwan and important for the United States. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, before I yield to Mr. Salmon, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), the esteemed chairman of our committee, who is here with us now, manage the rest of the bill. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Florida? There was no objection. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Salmon). He is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific and the author of this important measure. Mr. SALMON. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Ed Royce for bringing this important measure to the floor today and for being a constant champion of the people of Taiwan.

My hat is off to you, Mr. Engel, because you have always exhibited that, and I appreciate the way that you have led this body in that way. Taiwan is a wonderful, thriving democracy.

We want to make sure that other countries respect what we try to do. We believe in what this country stands for, and we want to have good relations with countries around the world. I think it is so important when Members travel there and meet with dignitaries and meet with leaders of the country and meet with other parliamentarians that people understand what the United States of America is all about. I want to thank the gentleman from Arizona for his leadership. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, as a strong original cosponsor. I want to thank Mr. Engel, and I want to thank Mr. Salmon and Mr. Brad Sherman for this legislation. Taiwan is a nation of 23 million people. It is a booming democracy, with a free and open media. It is a loyal friend. It is a loyal partner to the United States. Taiwan is engaged in important missions worldwide. We see the results of a lot of that engagement. Ebola is one most recently on our mind. When Ebola hit West Africa, it was Taiwan that donated 100,000 sets of protective equipment that were used to stop the spread of Ebola. It was Taiwan that gave so much in financial resources to help the sickest in Liberia. Taiwan today is assisting those who have been forced out of their homes by terrorists, whether it is in Syria or Iraq; yet, despite its active and constructive role internationally, Taiwan is excluded from many international organizations because of its political status. While Taiwan voluntarily adheres to the rules and the regulations of international organizations like the U.N., it is barred from participating. It is barred from being included in U.N. treaties against transnational organized crime and nuclear proliferation. This is not good for Taiwan, and it is not good for us. To better protect its citizens and all the people around the world who travel there, Taiwan is seeking observer status in the International Criminal Police Organization, which many know as INTERPOL. This organization enables police from 190 member countries to work together to make the world a safer place through information sharing, capacity building, and response coordination between police departments. That is 190 countries, but Taiwan is not included. The legislation before us today will help to secure observer status for Taiwan at INTERPOL. The measure requires the President of the United States to develop and execute a strategy to ensure that Taiwan participates in INTERPOL's next General Assembly meeting, which is coming up in Indonesia. This will bring better international law enforcement cooperation with one of our most important partners: Taiwan. Mr. Speaker, by way of history, Taiwan had full membership in INTERPOL starting back in 1964, but Taiwan was ejected from the law enforcement group in 1984, when the People's Republic of China applied for membership. Since then, Taiwan has relied on delayed secondhand information that they get from the United States about international criminals and global criminal activities, and that, frankly, makes Taiwan more vulnerable to security threats. Likewise, Taiwan cannot share the law enforcement information it gathers to the benefit, frankly, of INTERPOL and the rest of the community and all of the members of INTERPOL, all the police organizations that try to rely on that. And, of course, we are part of that. We could utilize that benefit. Mr. Speaker, the fact that Taiwan must rely on a convoluted process, with an added layer of bureaucracy, to access this critical information makes no sense. Taiwan regularly hosts the type of megaevents which often, unfortunately, attract terrorist activity, or they could. For example, in 2009 Taiwan hosted the World Games and had to rely solely on the United States to vet athletes and media lists, and with the U.S.' help, several suspicious persons were, in fact, identified. They were denied entry into Taiwan. In 2017 Taiwan will host the Summer Universiade, a student sporting event in which 900 athletes from 170 countries are expected to attend. This event is second only to the Olympics in the number of participants and countries that are represented. There must be a more streamlined way for Taiwan to access information from INTERPOL. As the number of visitors from Taiwan to the United States has grown exponentially, there is an urgent need to ensure that Taiwan's police forces have real-time access to information on criminal activities and on threats. Taiwan entered into the U.S. Visa Waiver Program in 2012. Since then, the number of Taiwanese visitors to the United States has increased by nearly 42 percent. From my home State of California, the increase in visitors from Taiwan has been a boon to the economy. I am proud to have worked on Taiwan's entry into the Visa Waiver Program because I know that, as a result of this agreement, Taiwanese Americans in southern California have a much easier time staying connected to their families, and business travelers are having an easier time, too. That is why I am also supporting Taiwan's participation in Customs and Border Protection's Global Entry program, which will make two-way travel even easier. Mr. Speaker, strengthening Taiwan's law enforcement capabilities benefits American citizens as much as it does the Taiwanese. Every year tens of thousands of Americans travel to Taiwan, and this bill will certainly help [[Page H7367]] Taiwan's police forces protect American citizens traveling in Taiwan. INTERPOL's constitution allows for observers at its meetings by police bodies which are not members of the organization. And so I am confident Taiwan will be able to be an observer. H.R. 1853 will support Taiwan's efforts to gain observer status with INTERPOL. It is going to improve everybody's security. Mr. Speaker, we must constantly be pressing to ensure that security across the globe is protected. Taiwan's unique political status has thus far hindered its inclusion in INTERPOL and is a vulnerable loophole for criminals and, frankly, for terrorists to target. With this piece of legislation, we are sending a clear message that safety is a priority. I want to again commend Representative Matt Salmon of Arizona, chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, and, of course, Mr. Engel and Mr. Sherman for authoring and introducing this important measure. I appreciated working with them on it. I will just say this of Mr. Salmon as well. He has a longstanding interest in Taiwan. His leadership on this measure is very much appreciated by all of us. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close on my side. I yield myself such time as I may consume. As I have said, we need to use every tool available to combat terrorism and disrupt criminal networks around the world. It only makes sense to have more partners at the table in that effort. So bringing Taiwan back into INTERPOL as an observer just makes common sense. The more participants in INTERPOL, the more good the organization can do. We should do all we can to bring willing contributors off the sidelines. Again, Taiwan was a member and was thrown out when everyone recognized People's Republic of China. There is room for both. There should be both. I again want to commend my friend, Mr. Salmon, who is largely responsible for this, and our chairman, Mr. Royce, who I think has more people from Taiwan in his district than virtually any other district in the country. So he knows quite a bit about Taiwan and quite a bit about what should be done. It is something that we are all saying the same thing. It makes sense for Taiwan. It makes sense for the United States. It makes sense for INTERPOL. I encourage my colleagues to support this measure. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1853. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered.

[[page h7364]] the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 1853 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. participation of taiwan in the international criminal police organization. (a) findings.--congress makes the following findings: (1) safety, security and peace is important to every citizen of the world, and shared information ensuring wide assistance among police authorities of nations for expeditious dissemination of information regarding criminal activities greatly assists in these efforts. (2) direct and unobstructed participation in the international criminal police organization (interpol) is beneficial for all nations and their police authorities. internationally shared information with authorized police authorities is vital to peacekeeping efforts. (3) with a history dating back to 1914, the role of interpol is defined in its constitution: ``to ensure and promote the widest possible mutual assistance between all criminal police authorities within the limits of the laws existing in the different countries and in the spirit of the universal declaration of human rights.''. (4) ongoing international threats, including international networks of terrorism, show the ongoing necessity to be ever inclusive of nations willing to work together to combat criminal activity. the ability of police authorities to coordinate, preempt, and act swiftly and in unison is an essential element of crisis prevention and response. (5) taiwan maintained full membership in interpol starting in 1964 through its national police administration but was ejected in 1984 when the people's republic of china (prc) applied for membership. (6) nonmembership prevents taiwan from gaining access to interpol's i-24/7 global police communications system, which provides real-time information on criminals and global criminal activities. taiwan is relegated to second-hand information from friendly nations, including the united states. (7) taiwan is unable to swiftly share information on criminals and suspicious activity with the international community, leaving a huge void in the global crime-fighting efforts and leaving the entire world at risk. (8) the united states, in the 1994 taiwan policy review, declared its intention to support taiwan's participation in appropriate international organizations and has consistently reiterated that support. (9) following the enactment of public law 108-235, a law authorizing the secretary of state to initiate and implement a plan to endorse and obtain observer status for taiwan at the annual summit of the world health assembly and subsequent advocacy by the united states, taiwan was granted observer status to the world health assembly for six consecutive years since 2009. both prior to and in its capacity as an observer, taiwan has contributed significantly to the international community's collective efforts in pandemic control, monitoring, early warning, and other related matters. (10) interpol's constitution allows for observers at its meetings by ``police bodies which are not members of the organization''. (b) taiwan's participation in interpol.--the president shall-- (1) develop a strategy to obtain observer status for taiwan in interpol and at other related meetings, activities, and mechanisms thereafter; and (2) instruct interpol washington to officially request observer status for taiwan in interpol and to actively urge interpol member states to support such observer status and participation for taiwan. (c) report concerning observer status for taiwan in interpol.--not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this act, the president shall transmit to congress a report, in unclassified form, describing the united states strategy to endorse and obtain observer status for taiwan in interpol and at other related meetings, activities, and mechanisms thereafter. the report shall include the following: (1) a description of the efforts the president has made to encourage interpol member states to promote taiwan's bid to obtain observer status in interpol. (2) a description of the actions the president will take to endorse and obtain observer status for taiwan in interpol and at other related meetings, activities, and mechanisms thereafter. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from florida (ms. ros-lehtinen) and the gentleman from new york (mr. engel) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentlewoman from florida. general leave ms. ros-lehtinen. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on this bill. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from florida? there was no objection. ms. ros-lehtinen. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i first want to thank the chairman of the asia and the pacific subcommittee, congressman matt salmon, for introducing this important resolution. taiwan is indeed a strong ally of the united states, one which shares our interests and values, including an enduring commitment to democracy and the freedom of expression. taiwan is a beacon of freedom in the pacific, serving as an inspiration for the world's oppressed, and it serves as a model for future democratic transitions. unfortunately, however, taiwan is under increasing pressure from an aggressive china that is attempting to assert its dominance in the pacific and to isolate taiwan on the international stage. one organization that china has prevented taiwan from joining is interpol, the international criminal police organization. interpol was created, mr. speaker, to promote international cooperation between criminal police authorities; but because of undue chinese pressure, taiwan is no longer a member of interpol. taiwan is forced to receive less effective, secondhand information about international criminals and their illicit activities. likewise, taiwan cannot share the law enforcement information that it gathers in order to benefit interpol. in china's efforts to exclude taiwan and in the efforts of some nations to accommodate china, they have ended up hurting taiwan and the entire international community in the process. so we have this bill before us, mr. speaker. this bill by congressman salmon directs the president to request observer status for taiwan at interpol, to urge other interpol members to support it, and for the president to develop a strategy to ensure the participation of taiwan. i am pleased to support this legislation. i believe that the united states should be helping taiwan's meaningful participation in all international organizations and entities in which it has expressed an interest in participating. taiwan's exclusion from organizations like interpol is dangerous. it is a dangerous practice. it hurts the international community just as much as it hurts the people of taiwan. we must not allow u.n. politics or china's efforts to isolate taiwan to exclude it from international organizations. it is, therefore, crucial that the united states provide the kind of military assistance, economic assistance, and political assistance that will allow taiwan to resist any type of chinese coercion. the taiwan relations act, together with the six assurances are the cornerstone of u.s.-taiwan relations, and we must always keep it as our guiding beacon. i know that this is a sentiment that is greatly shared by the members of our foreign affairs committee and by the chairman of our committee, mr. royce of california, because the friendship between the people of the united states and taiwan has cemented into one of the most cherished partnerships. i look forward to the united states government demonstrating its continued commitment to the people of taiwan with the passage of mr. salmon's bill. i want to thank, again, chairman salmon for introducing this important resolution. i am pleased to offer my support, and i urge my colleagues to do the same. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume, and i rise in support of this measure. mr. speaker, i want to also thank mr. salmon from arizona, who chairs our foreign affairs subcommittee on asia and the pacific, for authoring this bill. i am proud to be a cosponsor. the international criminal police organization, what we call interpol, helps law enforcement agencies around the world collaborate with one another. thanks to interpol, a task force in new york can share information with a police agency in hamburg or flag a terrorist suspect for authorities in tokyo. sensitive information about criminals or missing persons is available at the push of a button for interpol's [[page h7365]] members. for decades, it has been a vital tool for global security. until 1984, taiwan was a member of interpol; but since the people's republic of china applied for membership, taiwan has been left out. this is ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous. taiwan has the 16th or 17th largest economy in the world. and anyone who has ever been to taiwan, as i have and as my colleague has, will just be amazed at the democracy they have built themselves on that tiny island. the fact is that they look to the united states for protecting them and helping them. because just like we share the same values with israel, we share the same values with taiwan, and that is why we work with them. taiwan has been left out, and this gap in interpol's membership creates a public safety risk for the people of taiwan and also for the rest of the world. so nobody is saying that china should not be a member, but china should not have the right to exclude taiwan. this legislation would close that gap. it would instruct the administration to push for taiwan to be granted observer status in interpol. observer status, that is what we are asking for. there are countries around the world that function as countries, that have everything that all other countries have, and yet, because of politics, they are excluded from these international organizations. taiwan is one such country. kosovo is another type of country. we have to stop this. people that live in these countries need to not bear the brunt of politics, but really need the protections that citizens of other countries have. by our not giving them the protections, we leave ourselves a bit unprotected as well. so this legislation would instruct the administration to push for taiwan to be granted observer status in interpol. as an observer, taiwan would have access to the information that law enforcement agencies already have. it would also allow taiwan to contribute information to interpol, information that could be used to stop crime or thwart terrorist activity, arrest human traffickers, or sideline other bad actors. good precedent exists for giving taiwan this status. taiwan is an observer in the world health assembly, where it has played a vital role in contributing to public health and fighting pandemic disease. in fact, taiwan has repeatedly shown itself to be a constructive, positive force in the global community. countries around the world stand to benefit from taiwan's inclusion in international organizations like interpol. so not only does taiwan benefit, but the rest of the world benefits. it is a no-brainer. it is a win-win situation for everybody. i support this legislation wholeheartedly. i urge my colleagues to do the same. i thank my colleague from florida, ileana ros-lehtinen, and the chairman from california, ed royce. again, we are all in this together. this is great bipartisan legislation of the foreign affairs committee. it is important for taiwan and important for the united states. i reserve the balance of my time. ms. ros-lehtinen. mr. speaker, before i yield to mr. salmon, i ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from california (mr. royce), the esteemed chairman of our committee, who is here with us now, manage the rest of the bill. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from florida? there was no objection. ms. ros-lehtinen. mr. speaker, i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from arizona (mr. salmon). he is the chairman of the subcommittee on asia and the pacific and the author of this important measure. mr. salmon. mr. speaker, i thank chairman ed royce for bringing this important measure to the floor today and for being a constant champion of the people of taiwan. i was able to go on a trip with the chairman to taiwan, and i think that he is as close to royalty in taiwan as anybody that i have ever met. they love ed royce. in fact, the guy that used to be called ``mr. taiwan'' was the former senator from arizona, barry goldwater, but i think ed royce has maybe taken that title away. i am just honored to be able to be here supporting this bill that he has allowed to come to the floor. i have been a long-time supporter of taiwan, as have members throughout this body on both sides of the aisle. let me just segue for a minute. a lot of people out there get really, really frustrated by the partisan nature of what they see happening here in the nation's capital. a lot of people are frustrated: why can't both sides just agree? i mean, after all, aren't we all americans? the interesting thing is i wish more americans could come and see our committee, the foreign affairs committee, in action because it is the epitome of bipartisanship. besides the fact that chairman ed royce leads the committee and demands that we exhibit bipartisanship, ranking member eliot engel is one of the best men i have ever met in my life. and i mean that from the bottom of my heart. whether it is dealing with terrorism in the middle east or fairness across the globe like this issue with taiwan and common sense, he is always on the right side. he leads his delegation, his folks on that side of the aisle in something that we have long believed, but sometimes it kind of gets lost in the cacophony of arguments here on capitol hill on other things, but that is that partisanship ends at the water's edge. my hat is off to you, mr. engel, because you have always exhibited that, and i appreciate the way that you have led this body in that way. taiwan is a wonderful, thriving democracy. in fact, i had an opportunity as a young man to live there for 2 years, from 1977 to 1979, while serving a mission for my church. while i was there in 1978, the nixon administration normalized relations with china, recognizing the government of the people's republic of china as the sole, legal government of china and declaring it would withdraw diplomatic recognition from taiwan. the u.s. government has since articulated a one-china policy, which was a dark turn for u.s.-taiwan relations. since then, we have seen a taiwan that is marginalized in the international community. taiwan's ambiguous sovereignty status has contributed to its exclusion from many, many international organizations, despite taiwan's obvious willingness to play a larger role in international affairs and international security, as it should. from humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to law enforcement and global health, so often it has been denied the right to share its knowledge and its expertise in the international fora. this bill, h.r. 1853, would improve taiwan's capability to contribute and benefit from the international community in the interest of international security. h.r. 1853 would direct the president to develop a strategy to obtain observer status for taiwan in the international criminal police organization, or interpol. it would also require the president to report to congress on efforts to encourage taiwan's inclusion in interpol. since the early 20th century, interpol has facilitated mutual assistance between criminal police authorities worldwide through the sharing of information, such as access to comprehensive lists of suspicious persons and criminals. as we all know and, i think, as every american knows, terrorism and other nontraditional security challenges no longer end at our borders or anybody's borders. these threats are global by nature. {time} 1730 in order to secure domestic and international security, the sharing of information across borders is vital. taiwan's exclusion from interpol hampers efforts to prevent and respond to threats. to ensure that potential terrorists are barred from entering taiwan, it is essential that taiwan have direct access to interpol and its i- 24/7 system, which provides real-time information on criminals and global criminal activities. without this access, taiwan is forced to cobble together its own list based on incomplete and untimely information obtained from a small number of friendly countries to taiwan and taiwan's own domestic intelligence. [[page h7366]] equally important, taiwan is unable to share the information that it gathers on criminals and suspicious persons with interpol directly. mr. engel called this policy silly. i think that that is very, very appropriate and accurate. this puts everybody at risk, when we have a policy that plays politics instead of common sense. cooperation between taiwan and interpol could be markedly enhanced if taiwan is able to become an observer. h.r. 1853, with 114 bipartisan cosponsors, continues to carry the torch of congressional support for taiwan's membership and inclusion in the international community. taiwan is a vibrant, democratic society, with much to contribute to the international community. the united states must do more to fulfill our obligations under the taiwan relations act, which provides that the u.s. treat taiwan the same as foreign countries, nations, states, government, or similar entities. this is a vote for u.s. support of taiwan's inclusion in international affairs. this is a vote for international security. i urge my colleagues to vote to support taiwan's participation in international policing efforts by supporting this legislation, h.r. 1853. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. we are all saying the same thing, and i think it really shows how important this legislation is. i want to mention the gentleman from arizona, as i mentioned before. he was very kind about some of the things he said about me. you need to go on a trip to china or taiwan with the gentleman from arizona because he is very modest, but he speaks fluent mandarin. he has great diplomatic skills, and the people there really appreciate what he has done. i appreciate him being the author of this important piece of legislation. it is true, when we talk about bipartisanship in foreign affairs, it is probably more important than in any other place. i have gone on a number of trips and we have had delegations of republicans and democrats together, and always, as americans, the differences that we might have are very, very tiny. when you travel together and you go to another country, we realize how important it is that, as americans, we stand united and that other countries respect our country for what our country has done and is doing. that is really important. i want to thank the gentleman from arizona, my friend. he has been a vital force for this legislation, h.r. 1853, but he has also been a vital force on so many other issues on the committee on foreign affairs and global issues that are really just so important. when we talk about global issues and talk about policy that we need to do, there really are no democrats and no republicans. we are all americans. we want to make sure that other countries respect what we try to do. we believe in what this country stands for, and we want to have good relations with countries around the world. i think it is so important when members travel there and meet with dignitaries and meet with leaders of the country and meet with other parliamentarians that people understand what the united states of america is all about. i want to thank the gentleman from arizona for his leadership. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in support of this bill, as a strong original cosponsor. i want to thank mr. engel, and i want to thank mr. salmon and mr. brad sherman for this legislation. taiwan is a nation of 23 million people. it is a booming democracy, with a free and open media. it is a loyal friend. it is a loyal partner to the united states. taiwan is engaged in important missions worldwide. we see the results of a lot of that engagement. ebola is one most recently on our mind. when ebola hit west africa, it was taiwan that donated 100,000 sets of protective equipment that were used to stop the spread of ebola. it was taiwan that gave so much in financial resources to help the sickest in liberia. taiwan today is assisting those who have been forced out of their homes by terrorists, whether it is in syria or iraq;

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 293) expressing concern over anti-Israel and anti-Semitic incitement within the Palestinian Authority, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: H. Res. 293 Whereas the 1995 Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, commonly referred to as Oslo II, specifically details that Israel and the Palestinian Authority shall ``abstain from incitement, including hostile propaganda, against each other and, without derogating from the principle of freedom of expression, shall take legal measures to prevent such incitement by any organizations, groups or individuals within their jurisdiction''; Whereas the Oslo II agreement further states that Israel and the Palestinian Authority ``will ensure that their respective educational systems contribute to the peace between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples and to peace in the entire region''; Whereas Palestinian Authority incitement against Israelis has continued unabated for many years despite periods of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority; Whereas this incitement takes on many forms, and has included the glorification of terrorists who have murdered Israeli civilians; advocating struggle against Israel despite entering into negotiations with Israel; the demonization of Jews and Israelis, including by the use of anti-Semitic motifs; the denial of Israel's existence and its delegitimization as evidenced by the absence of Israel on official maps used in Palestinian Authority institutions; and false claims that Israel or the Jews are endangering Muslim holy sites, such as the Al-Aqsa mosque/Temple Mount in Jerusalem; Whereas in June 2013, Abbas referenced Israeli acts which ``indicate an evil and dangerous plot to destroy Al-Aqsa and build the alleged temple''; Whereas on September 16, 2015, Abbas stated on Palestinian television that ``we welcome every drop of blood spilled in Jerusalem. This is pure blood, clean blood, blood on its way to Allah. With the help of Allah, every martyr will be in heaven, and every wounded will get his reward''; Whereas since mid-September 2015 there has been a wave of Palestinian violence in Israel and the West Bank, including stabbings, shootings, and other terrorist acts; Whereas this situation has been inflamed by statements made by Palestinian President Abbas, other Palestinian officials, clerics, and official Palestinian Authority media, and frequently amplified on social media platforms; Whereas these statements have included repeated false claims that Israel seeks to change the ``status quo'' on the Temple Mount/al-Aqsa Mosque compound; Whereas despite the incitement-induced wave of terrorism, the Palestinian Authority security forces and the Israel Defense Forces have continued security cooperation; Whereas section 7038 of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 states that ``none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act may be used to provide equipment, technical support, consulting services, or any other form of assistance to the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation''; Whereas section 7040(e) of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 requires the Secretary of State, if the President waives section 7040(a) of that Act, to ``certify and report to the Committees on Appropriations prior to the obligation of funds that . . . the Palestinian Authority is acting to counter incitement of violence against Israelis and is supporting activities aimed at promoting peace, coexistence, and security cooperation with Israel''; and Whereas the Palestinian Authority has not fully lived up to its prior agreements with Israel to end incitement and should do more to prepare the Palestinian people for peace with Israel: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives-- (1) expresses support and admiration for individuals and organizations working to encourage cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians; (2) strongly condemns the wave of violent attacks in Israel and the West Bank; (3) reiterates the strong condemnation of anti-Israel and anti-Semitic incitement to violence in the Palestinian Authority as antithetical to the cause of peace; (4) calls on the Palestinian Authority to-- (A) immediately discontinue incitement to violence in all Palestinian Authority-controlled media outlets, and officially and publicly repudiate attacks against Israelis and engage in a sustained effort to publicly and officially rebuke anti-Israel incitement to violence; (B) continue important security cooperation with Israel; and (C) agree to unconditionally renew direct talks with the Israelis, including the reconstitution of the Trilateral Commission on Incitement; (5) encourages responsible nations to condemn in the strongest possible terms incitement to violence by the Palestinian Authority; (6) expresses support for the Government of Israel in its fight against terror; (7) directs the Department of State to regularly monitor and publish information on all official incitement by the Palestinian Authority against Jews and the State of Israel; and (8) calls on the Administration to continue publicly repudiating and raising the issue of Palestinian anti-Israel incitement to violence in all appropriate bilateral and international forums. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida. General Leave Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Florida? There was no objection. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the esteemed chairman of our full committee, Chairman Royce, and Ranking Member Engel, who is before us today, for their leadership and for helping us to mark up and vote on this resolution at the subcommittee and at the full committee, thereby landing us right here on the floor this afternoon. I would also like to thank my friend and dear south Florida colleague, ranking member of the Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee, Mr. Deutch, for joining me in introducing this important resolution condemning the anti-Israel and anti-Semitic incitement from within the Palestinian Authority. Sadly, Mr. Speaker, as we have seen over the past 2 months in Israel, violence and terror are on the rise, and hardly a day goes by when we don't hear about yet another attack against innocent Israelis. Since the most recent round of attacks began on the Jewish New Year in mid-September, there have been nearly 60 stabbing attacks, 5 shootings, and 6 car-ramming attacks, resulting in 10 deaths and scores more injured. Let me repeat that again, Mr. Speaker: 60 stabbing attacks, 5 shootings, [[Page H7361]] and 6 car-ramming attacks, resulting in 10 deaths and many people injured, not to mention the psychological toll that these acts of terror have taken on Israelis. Today--today--Mr. Speaker, there were two separate stabbing attacks in two different cities. An 80-year-old woman was among the victims, showing that these random attacks can happen anywhere, at any time, to anyone. When Israeli citizens cannot walk out of their homes to go to work or they cannot walk out of their homes to go to the grocery store for fear of yet another terrorist attack, we must hold the Palestinian leadership accountable for its incitement and its unwillingness to ease tensions in the region. The resolution before us, Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 293, unfortunately is the consequence of the continued failure of the Palestinian leadership. Instead of working toward achieving lasting peace with Israel, what is Abu Mazen, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, doing? He is undermining the peace process. Instead of encouraging the Palestinian people and leading them toward a better future, Abu Mazen's divisive actions are tearing the Palestinians apart, leading them into despair, into hatred, into violence. Instead of calling for an emergency meeting with Palestinian leaders to discuss a way to walk back the rhetoric, a way to calm the tensions, no, Abu Mazen called for an emergency meeting at the United Nations Human Rights Council, the preferred platform to spew anti-Israel hatred. Why? In an effort to delegitimize the Jewish state where he further fanned the flames of violence once again, as he has been doing, Mr. Speaker, since he assumed leadership. Already the perpetrators of these acts of terror are being glorified--yes, glorified--hailed as heroes, hailed as martyrs. Last week, in fact, the Palestinian Authority named a street after a Palestinian terrorist. What did that person do? He fatally stabbed two innocent Israelis in Jerusalem. But where is the world's condemnation of this? What is the response from the international community? Silence. Too often we see attempts to place this false moral equivalence between the Israelis' actions and the Palestinians' because too many are unwilling to accept the truth, and that is that the Palestinian leadership is the problem, not the solution, to the peace process. We cannot allow Abu Mazen's words and Abu Mazen's actions to continue to go unpunished because, as we have seen over the past month and a half, they have consequences and innocent people have died. Today, Mr. Speaker, we have an opportunity to send a clear message to Abu Mazen, that his words and actions are unacceptable, that we condemn these actions, and that we hold the Palestinian Authority responsible for inciting these recent acts of terror against Israeli citizens. Palestinian leaders have been indoctrinating the Palestinian people with incitement against Israel for generations, and that is not something that is easily reversed. But by passing this resolution tonight, Mr. Speaker, we are sending a message to the Palestinian leader that this behavior will not be tolerated and it will not be unaddressed. This is an opportunity to start to hold Abu Mazen and the PA accountable for their words, accountable for their deadly actions. I urge my colleagues to join me in condemning anti-Israel and anti- Semitic incitement in all of its forms. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of this measure. Let me start by thanking our former chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for sponsoring this resolution. I agree with every word she just said. She has been a good friend to the state and people of Israel, and this measure, which I am happy to cosponsor, shows once again that support for Israel in Congress is not a partisan issue. Israel has much bipartisan support in this Congress, and we intend to keep it this way. As the Congresswoman has mentioned, the violence in Israel has gone from bad to worse in recent days. Day after day, we hear new reports of innocent Israeli victims of stabbings or shootings at the hands of Palestinian terrorists. I use the word ``terrorist,'' Mr. Speaker, because what they are doing are acts of terrorism. If random people, average citizens, have nothing to do with policy, have nothing to do with politics--they are just civilians that are walking in the street--if they are attacked by a knife or something else that harms them, that is a terrorist attack. Imagine if we had such things going on in the United States. It would have a chilling effect on what people can do, and whether they can move around or can't move around as a result of it. So this is not something that is random. It is not something that is confined. It can strike anybody at any time, any place, and it is terrorism. I have often said that while I support a two-state solution, if the Palestinians continue to use terrorism because they think it will get them closer to their state, they are wrong. It will prevent them from ever having a state if they don't renounce terrorism. That is what this is all about. It is the incitement. It is the encouraging of hatred for Israelis and the Jews and for the United States as well. This goes on time and time and time again, and then we wonder why we have these acts of violence, because you cannot fan the fires and be a leader in it and then suddenly look the other way and say, ``Well, you know, we are not encouraging it.'' The Palestinian Authority has been irresponsible, and they have been irresponsible for many, many years. So, as it has every right to do, Israel has defended itself against these attacks, these stabbings and shootings. But this bloodshed must be brought to an end. I have no doubt, Mr. Speaker, that it could be in a hurry if Palestinian leaders would do the right thing: repudiate the violence and, most importantly, the ceaseless campaign of incitement that demonizes Jews and Israelis and glorifies terrorists. Chairman Royce and I will soon send a bipartisan letter signed by more than 350 of our colleagues in both parties. I am very, very happy with the overwhelming support we have gotten from our colleagues on both sides of the aisle for this letter. That is why Chairman Royce and I try to do things in a bipartisan manner: because something like this is bipartisan; support for Israel is bipartisan; support against terror is bipartisan. We have to stand together as Americans, regardless of party affiliation, and say: we will not countenance terror. And we are going to point fingers at the Palestinian Authority, who has been utterly irresponsible in this whole thing. So if Palestinian leaders would do the right thing and repudiate the violence and, most importantly, end the ceaseless campaign of incitement that demonizes Jews and Israelis and glorifies terrorists, this could stop. This letter that Chairman Royce and I have done, signed by more than 350 of our colleagues, to Palestinian President Abbas urges him to take that course, but I cannot say that I have high hopes. After all, this type of rhetoric by Palestinians against Jews and Israelis and even just Americans, in general, is nothing new. In Palestinian books and newspapers, on the television and radio, we see and hear a constant message of hatred and incitement. From a young age, Palestinians are taught that the people of Israel are their enemies and those who use violence are heroes, and this is very, very infuriating. It is the fuel that fires the violence we are seeing today, and it is a roadblock, as I said before, on the path towards a two-state solution. Palestinians will never build their own state on the backs of terrorists. It is a dead end for them, and it is counterproductive. They ought to know it. They are doing their people a tremendous disservice. This resolution calls on Palestinian leaders to show real responsibility to reject the violence and end incitement and to return to the negotiating table with no preconditions, sit down and negotiate. It reaffirms our commitment to our Israeli allies and our desire to see [[Page H7362]] peace for both Israelis and Palestinians. I urge my colleagues to support this measure. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), who is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for yielding on this important resolution. Mr. Speaker, the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians has reached new levels of terror. Over the past month, Palestinians have stabbed, shot, or run over innocent Israelis almost every day. The cause of these tragedies is simple: the incitement by Palestinian leaders. Of course, our government is on the wrong side of this issue. Our government stands by while Palestinian Authority President Abbas praises violent riots on the Temple Mount. But the problem is bigger than speeches. Palestinian leaders have turned their schools into terrorist breeding grounds that teach hate. {time} 1700 Israel reacted to this violence how any other country should react; but the United States State Department callously calls Israel's self- defense executive force. Like I said, the State Department has got it wrong. The Palestinians should be called out for what they are doing: inciting violence and committing violence. They are responsible for their criminal acts, not the Israelis. We can stand side by side with Israel by condemning these terrorist acts, and the Palestinian leaders should be held personally accountable for inciting violence in the Palestinian community. The State Department and the world need to quit making excuses for Palestinian terrorists and hold them accountable for the crimes that they commit. I am glad to be an original cosponsor of House Resolution 293. I urge its passage so that America and the rest of the world understand that we stand by Israel and not by the terrorists. And that is just the way it is. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch), the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa. Mr. DEUTCH. I thank my friend, Mr. Engel. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel and their staffs for working to bring this bipartisan resolution to the floor. I want to thank my friend and colleague and neighbor, Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for partnering with me on this effort. In the month of October, there have been more than 50 stabbings in Israel, there have been attempted stabbings, there have been shootings, there have been cars rammed into civilians. Terrorists have killed 11 and have wounded more than 10 times that number. In a span of just 12 hours today, there were 4 separate terror attacks. This resolution is important because these attacks aren't a protest or a political statement about holy sites or politics. It is terrorism, and it flows from incitement at the highest levels of the Palestinian Government. Now, I have said many times that all attacks on innocent civilians should be condemned and that they should be condemned regardless of who commits them. Yet I have to point out that, when a revenge attack occurs, committed by Israelis, the Prime Minister of Israel himself condemns that action on national television; but when there are attempted stabbings every single day for nearly 8 weeks, Palestinian leadership does not condemn even one single attack. Instead, we continue to see officials trying to justify acts of terror as an expected part of a religious conflict. False accusations about changes at the Temple Mount, when they have been repeatedly denied by Israeli leadership, send a very dangerous message that violence is necessary to preserve Muslim holy sites when, in fact, those holy sites are not threatened at all. Unfortunately, incitement from officials within the Palestinian Authority is not new. Despite statements from President Abbas that he is committed and has been committed for years to nonviolence, there are still countless examples in official textbooks, on social media pages, and in television speeches that call for an armed conflict and that depict Jews as dirty pigs. Mr. Speaker, Secretary Kerry was right when he recently said, ``President Abbas has been committed to nonviolence. He needs to be condemning this loudly and clearly, and he needs to not engage in the incitement that his voice has sometimes been heard to encourage; so that has to stop.'' If President Abbas remains committed to his stated vision of a peaceful, stable Palestinian state, living side by side with a safe and secure Israel, then now is the time for real leadership. Now is the time to go on national television and condemn these attacks. Now is the time to accept the Jordanian plan for surveillance at the Temple Mount to ensure that religious freedom is, in fact, being protected. Now is the time to stop dangerous rhetoric, like when he said that he would ``welcome every drop of blood spilled in Jerusalem'' or when he accused Israel of the ``summary execution of children'' when, in fact, the 13-year-old whom he referenced was receiving medical care in an Israeli hospital after he stabbed two Israeli teenagers. Even before these recent terror attacks, incitement within the Palestinian Authority has been well documented. If these are the messages that are sent to Palestinian youth, if they never see the State of Israel on a map in their textbooks or if they watch television programs that glorify attacks on Israelis and Jews, how can we ever expect him to be committed to peace? By passing today's resolution, the United States House of Representatives is sending a message. It is a very simple message to the world, that we stand with the people of Israel as they face this onslaught of terror and that incitement spurred by inflammatory, violent rhetoric will not be tolerated. We won't tolerate officials using religion as a means to spur violence, and we won't tolerate actions like the recent Palestinian- backed resolution at UNESCO that attempted to rewrite history and inflame tension on the ground. Our resolution also expresses support for individuals and organizations that are working to encourage cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians. Unfortunately, President Abbas and his government are doing just the opposite. Mr. Speaker, there must be an end to this wave of terrorism. It is time to stop the spread of incitement. This resolution puts the House on record that incitement leads to violence, and it must end if there is to be a chance for peace. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin), who is a member of our Committee on Foreign Affairs. Mr. ZELDIN. I thank Ms. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen for her inspiring leadership in bringing forth this bipartisan resolution. I am inspired as I listen to the words of Mr. Deutch and Mr. Engel as this is something that allows Americans to unite for a cause of strengthening our relationships with our friends, like Israel, ensuring that we treat our enemies as our enemies. Mr. Speaker, according to the Maariv daily, Palestinian Authority President Abbas said in a Ramallah address: We will not forsake our country, and we will keep every inch of our land. Every drop of blood spilled in Jerusalem is pure. Every Shahid will reach paradise, and every injured person will be rewarded by God. The Palestinian Authority President said he would insist that a future Palestinian state include East Jerusalem as its capital. He said: The Al-Aqsa Mosque is ours. The church is ours as well. They have no right to desecrate the mosque with their dirty feet. We won't allow them to do that. A top Hamas official in the Gaza Strip called on all of the Palestinians to turn their weapons against the Israelis, saying that Allah created man only to wage jihad and to plunge knives into the chests of the enemies. We hear a lot of talk about the pursuit of a viable two-state solution. It is not just about Israel and its recognizing the Palestinians' right to exist. [[Page H7363]] It is also about the Palestinians and its recognizing Israel's right to exist. Yet the Palestinian Authority, by the day, is under more and more influence of an element that will not rest until the other side is wiped off the map. I was disturbed when the Secretary of State's spokesperson, John Kirby, said: Individuals on both sides of this divide are, have been proven capable of, and, in our view, are guilty of acts of terrorism. Last month the State Department claimed that the Temple Mount status quo was violated. I was just there a couple of months back. I was at a place called Decks Restaurant in Tiberias. It is right on the Sea of Galilee. The owner of the restaurant got on the microphone--the place was crowded with locals--and she started preaching about her love of America, about her appreciation of the strength of that bond between the U.S. and Israel. As she is saying this, a boat pulls in off the Sea of Galilee and starts setting off fireworks. As the fireworks start blowing off, they start playing ``God Bless America'' over the loud speaker. All the locals stood up and were singing along, and if they didn't know the words, they were lip-syncing it. It was such a proud moment. Where else in the world can you go where you will find a restaurant at which the owner will get on the microphone and start talking about her love of America? I value the relationship that we have with our friends, such as Israel. We didn't see the Israeli Prime Minister going on international TV trying to embarrass the President of the United States after there was a hospital strike, which the President took responsibility for. It is important that we don't embarrass our allies and that we stand with them in tough times. Right now we stand with innocent victims in Israel, who are being targeted by terrorist attacks through the incitement of violence by the leadership of the Palestinian Authority. That is why I am so proud to stand here today with Ms. Ileana Ros- Lehtinen for, again, her consistent and strong dedication and leadership and for her determination in ensuring that this body stands united with Israel every single day. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In closing, as you have heard from everyone who has spoken, the recent surge of Palestinian violence against Israel must stop. It must stop to save innocent lives. It must stop so that negotiations can go forward. It must stop because acts of terrorism are not to be tolerated. Any way you look at it, these are terrorist acts, and the only way we can have peace and the only way we can have a two-state solution is if both parties sit opposite each other, with no preconditions, and start negotiating. I do support a two-state solution--a Palestinian Arab state and an Israeli Jewish state--living together in peace and harmony; but it is not going to happen if the Palestinian leadership, which is bankrupt in more ways than one, refuses to teach its people the right thing, if it refuses to repudiate acts of terror. Mahmoud Abbas, or Abu Mazen--the leader of the Palestinians--is, I think, on the eighth year of his 4-year term. He is not really legitimate anymore. The more he talks with rhetoric and incitement, the less relevant he becomes. It is really a shame because I do think that the Palestinians deserve better and I do think that, ultimately, they deserve their own state; but they will not have their own state if they resort to terror. It is bankrupt, and it is a dead end for them. Instead of encouraging these kinds of acts of terror against innocent civilians, the leadership of the Palestinians ought to be dismissing it, ought to be condemning it, ought to be taking strong stands against it. We have yet to hear, and that is why this resolution is so important. This resolution sends the signal that Palestinian leaders have a responsibility to repudiate this violence and put an end to the horrific campaign of incitement against Jews and Israelis. Everyone who spoke today is saying the same thing. We are saying the same thing because it is clear as night and day what is going on over there. So I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure. The United States will always stand with the people of Israel, and the United States will always stand against violence and terrorism wherever it rears its head around the world. I again thank my good friend, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for her leadership and Mr. Deutch for his leadership as well. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank the chairman of our committee, Mr. Royce, for his help in bringing this resolution to the floor after the markup in the subcommittee and the full committee. I want to thank Mr. Engel for his steadfast support of doing everything that is humanly possible to support efforts in getting peace in the Middle East and his support for the democratic Jewish state of Israel. I want to thank Mr. Deutch, who is my partner on the Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee. He has been a person who understands the many obstacles to peace that the Palestinians encounter because of their failed leadership, and the responsibility lies in that leadership. I have had the opportunity to travel to Israel with Mr. Deutch, and I am very thankful for his friendship and for his guidance. I also want to thank Mr. Poe and Mr. Zeldin--valued members of our Committee on Foreign Affairs--for their perspectives on how to reach peace, because, when all is said and done, this is what this resolution is all about. We are condemning the anti-Israel and anti-Semitic incitement to violence by the Palestinian Authority, but we do so because this is antithetical to the cause of peace, which is what this body is all about and what the United States' foreign policy is based on in the Middle East. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, securing a lasting peace between Israel and Palestine requires a commitment to humanizing the experiences of both peoples. Divisive rhetoric dehumanizes people and undermines the prospect of long-term peace. This resolution is divisive. Incitement by either party, including Palestinian Authority leaders, is a serious issue and deserves to be condemned. But when we denounce the Palestinians and leave no mention of divisive rhetoric by the Israeli government, we do a disservice to Palestinians and Israelis. Just two weeks ago, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ``Hitler didn't want to exterminate the Jews at the time, he wanted to expel the Jews.'' He laid the blame for the Shoa at the feet of a Palestinian Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini. Al-Husseini was a virulent anti-Semite. But Prime Minister Netanyahu's blaming the idea of the Holocaust on a Palestinian, and by implication Palestinians, deserves to be condemned by this body just as Palestinian incitement does. I oppose this resolution, not because the Palestinians are not inciting, and not because I believe this incitement should not be condemned. I oppose this resolution because any resolution that attacks one side while ignoring the other can only further tension and violence. If Congress wants to be considered a legitimate arbiter of peace between Israel and Palestine we must pursue a balanced approach that calls for an end to incitement on both sides and both leaders to live up to their obligations under the Oslo Accords. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Harris). The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 293, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution, as amended, was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H7360-H7363] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EXPRESSING CONCERN OVER ANTI-ISRAEL AND ANTI-SEMITIC INCITEMENT WITHIN THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN.

Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Florida? There was no objection. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the esteemed chairman of our full committee, Chairman Royce, and Ranking Member Engel, who is before us today, for their leadership and for helping us to mark up and vote on this resolution at the subcommittee and at the full committee, thereby landing us right here on the floor this afternoon. I would also like to thank my friend and dear south Florida colleague, ranking member of the Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee, Mr. Deutch, for joining me in introducing this important resolution condemning the anti-Israel and anti-Semitic incitement from within the Palestinian Authority. Sadly, Mr. Speaker, as we have seen over the past 2 months in Israel, violence and terror are on the rise, and hardly a day goes by when we don't hear about yet another attack against innocent Israelis. Since the most recent round of attacks began on the Jewish New Year in mid-September, there have been nearly 60 stabbing attacks, 5 shootings, and 6 car-ramming attacks, resulting in 10 deaths and scores more injured. Let me repeat that again, Mr. Speaker: 60 stabbing attacks, 5 shootings, [[Page H7361]] and 6 car-ramming attacks, resulting in 10 deaths and many people injured, not to mention the psychological toll that these acts of terror have taken on Israelis. Today--today--Mr. Speaker, there were two separate stabbing attacks in two different cities. An 80-year-old woman was among the victims, showing that these random attacks can happen anywhere, at any time, to anyone. When Israeli citizens cannot walk out of their homes to go to work or they cannot walk out of their homes to go to the grocery store for fear of yet another terrorist attack, we must hold the Palestinian leadership accountable for its incitement and its unwillingness to ease tensions in the region. The resolution before us, Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 293, unfortunately is the consequence of the continued failure of the Palestinian leadership. Instead of working toward achieving lasting peace with Israel, what is Abu Mazen, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, doing? He is undermining the peace process. Instead of encouraging the Palestinian people and leading them toward a better future, Abu Mazen's divisive actions are tearing the Palestinians apart, leading them into despair, into hatred, into violence. Instead of calling for an emergency meeting with Palestinian leaders to discuss a way to walk back the rhetoric, a way to calm the tensions, no, Abu Mazen called for an emergency meeting at the United Nations Human Rights Council, the preferred platform to spew anti-Israel hatred. Why? In an effort to delegitimize the Jewish state where he further fanned the flames of violence once again, as he has been doing, Mr. Speaker, since he assumed leadership. Already the perpetrators of these acts of terror are being glorified--yes, glorified--hailed as heroes, hailed as martyrs. Last week, in fact, the Palestinian Authority named a street after a Palestinian terrorist. What did that person do? He fatally stabbed two innocent Israelis in Jerusalem. But where is the world's condemnation of this? What is the response from the international community? Silence. Too often we see attempts to place this false moral equivalence between the Israelis' actions and the Palestinians' because too many are unwilling to accept the truth, and that is that the Palestinian leadership is the problem, not the solution, to the peace process. We cannot allow Abu Mazen's words and Abu Mazen's actions to continue to go unpunished because, as we have seen over the past month and a half, they have consequences and innocent people have died. Today, Mr. Speaker, we have an opportunity to send a clear message to Abu Mazen, that his words and actions are unacceptable, that we condemn these actions, and that we hold the Palestinian Authority responsible for inciting these recent acts of terror against Israeli citizens. Palestinian leaders have been indoctrinating the Palestinian people with incitement against Israel for generations, and that is not something that is easily reversed. But by passing this resolution tonight, Mr. Speaker, we are sending a message to the Palestinian leader that this behavior will not be tolerated and it will not be unaddressed. This is an opportunity to start to hold Abu Mazen and the PA accountable for their words, accountable for their deadly actions. I urge my colleagues to join me in condemning anti-Israel and anti- Semitic incitement in all of its forms. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of this measure. Let me start by thanking our former chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for sponsoring this resolution. I agree with every word she just said. She has been a good friend to the state and people of Israel, and this measure, which I am happy to cosponsor, shows once again that support for Israel in Congress is not a partisan issue. Israel has much bipartisan support in this Congress, and we intend to keep it this way. As the Congresswoman has mentioned, the violence in Israel has gone from bad to worse in recent days. Day after day, we hear new reports of innocent Israeli victims of stabbings or shootings at the hands of Palestinian terrorists. I use the word ``terrorist,'' Mr. Speaker, because what they are doing are acts of terrorism. If random people, average citizens, have nothing to do with policy, have nothing to do with politics--they are just civilians that are walking in the street--if they are attacked by a knife or something else that harms them, that is a terrorist attack. Imagine if we had such things going on in the United States. It would have a chilling effect on what people can do, and whether they can move around or can't move around as a result of it. So this is not something that is random. It is not something that is confined. It can strike anybody at any time, any place, and it is terrorism. I have often said that while I support a two-state solution, if the Palestinians continue to use terrorism because they think it will get them closer to their state, they are wrong. It will prevent them from ever having a state if they don't renounce terrorism. That is what this is all about. It is the incitement. It is the encouraging of hatred for Israelis and the Jews and for the United States as well. This goes on time and time and time again, and then we wonder why we have these acts of violence, because you cannot fan the fires and be a leader in it and then suddenly look the other way and say, ``Well, you know, we are not encouraging it.'' The Palestinian Authority has been irresponsible, and they have been irresponsible for many, many years. So, as it has every right to do, Israel has defended itself against these attacks, these stabbings and shootings. But this bloodshed must be brought to an end. I have no doubt, Mr. Speaker, that it could be in a hurry if Palestinian leaders would do the right thing: repudiate the violence and, most importantly, the ceaseless campaign of incitement that demonizes Jews and Israelis and glorifies terrorists. Chairman Royce and I will soon send a bipartisan letter signed by more than 350 of our colleagues in both parties. I am very, very happy with the overwhelming support we have gotten from our colleagues on both sides of the aisle for this letter. That is why Chairman Royce and I try to do things in a bipartisan manner: because something like this is bipartisan; support for Israel is bipartisan; support against terror is bipartisan. We have to stand together as Americans, regardless of party affiliation, and say: we will not countenance terror. And we are going to point fingers at the Palestinian Authority, who has been utterly irresponsible in this whole thing. So if Palestinian leaders would do the right thing and repudiate the violence and, most importantly, end the ceaseless campaign of incitement that demonizes Jews and Israelis and glorifies terrorists, this could stop. This letter that Chairman Royce and I have done, signed by more than 350 of our colleagues, to Palestinian President Abbas urges him to take that course, but I cannot say that I have high hopes. After all, this type of rhetoric by Palestinians against Jews and Israelis and even just Americans, in general, is nothing new. In Palestinian books and newspapers, on the television and radio, we see and hear a constant message of hatred and incitement. From a young age, Palestinians are taught that the people of Israel are their enemies and those who use violence are heroes, and this is very, very infuriating. It is the fuel that fires the violence we are seeing today, and it is a roadblock, as I said before, on the path towards a two-state solution. Palestinians will never build their own state on the backs of terrorists. It is a dead end for them, and it is counterproductive. They ought to know it. They are doing their people a tremendous disservice. This resolution calls on Palestinian leaders to show real responsibility to reject the violence and end incitement and to return to the negotiating table with no preconditions, sit down and negotiate. It reaffirms our commitment to our Israeli allies and our desire to see [[Page H7362]] peace for both Israelis and Palestinians. I urge my colleagues to support this measure. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), who is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for yielding on this important resolution. Mr. Speaker, the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians has reached new levels of terror. Over the past month, Palestinians have stabbed, shot, or run over innocent Israelis almost every day. The cause of these tragedies is simple: the incitement by Palestinian leaders. Of course, our government is on the wrong side of this issue. Our government stands by while Palestinian Authority President Abbas praises violent riots on the Temple Mount. But the problem is bigger than speeches. Palestinian leaders have turned their schools into terrorist breeding grounds that teach hate. {time} 1700 Israel reacted to this violence how any other country should react; but the United States State Department callously calls Israel's self- defense executive force. Like I said, the State Department has got it wrong. The Palestinians should be called out for what they are doing: inciting violence and committing violence. They are responsible for their criminal acts, not the Israelis. We can stand side by side with Israel by condemning these terrorist acts, and the Palestinian leaders should be held personally accountable for inciting violence in the Palestinian community. The State Department and the world need to quit making excuses for Palestinian terrorists and hold them accountable for the crimes that they commit. I am glad to be an original cosponsor of House Resolution 293. I urge its passage so that America and the rest of the world understand that we stand by Israel and not by the terrorists. And that is just the way it is. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch), the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa. Mr. DEUTCH. I thank my friend, Mr. Engel. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel and their staffs for working to bring this bipartisan resolution to the floor. I want to thank my friend and colleague and neighbor, Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for partnering with me on this effort. In the month of October, there have been more than 50 stabbings in Israel, there have been attempted stabbings, there have been shootings, there have been cars rammed into civilians. Terrorists have killed 11 and have wounded more than 10 times that number. In a span of just 12 hours today, there were 4 separate terror attacks. This resolution is important because these attacks aren't a protest or a political statement about holy sites or politics. It is terrorism, and it flows from incitement at the highest levels of the Palestinian Government. Now, I have said many times that all attacks on innocent civilians should be condemned and that they should be condemned regardless of who commits them. Yet I have to point out that, when a revenge attack occurs, committed by Israelis, the Prime Minister of Israel himself condemns that action on national television; but when there are attempted stabbings every single day for nearly 8 weeks, Palestinian leadership does not condemn even one single attack. Instead, we continue to see officials trying to justify acts of terror as an expected part of a religious conflict. False accusations about changes at the Temple Mount, when they have been repeatedly denied by Israeli leadership, send a very dangerous message that violence is necessary to preserve Muslim holy sites when, in fact, those holy sites are not threatened at all. Unfortunately, incitement from officials within the Palestinian Authority is not new. Despite statements from President Abbas that he is committed and has been committed for years to nonviolence, there are still countless examples in official textbooks, on social media pages, and in television speeches that call for an armed conflict and that depict Jews as dirty pigs. Mr. Speaker, Secretary Kerry was right when he recently said, ``President Abbas has been committed to nonviolence. He needs to be condemning this loudly and clearly, and he needs to not engage in the incitement that his voice has sometimes been heard to encourage; so that has to stop.'' If President Abbas remains committed to his stated vision of a peaceful, stable Palestinian state, living side by side with a safe and secure Israel, then now is the time for real leadership. Now is the time to go on national television and condemn these attacks. Now is the time to accept the Jordanian plan for surveillance at the Temple Mount to ensure that religious freedom is, in fact, being protected. Now is the time to stop dangerous rhetoric, like when he said that he would ``welcome every drop of blood spilled in Jerusalem'' or when he accused Israel of the ``summary execution of children'' when, in fact, the 13-year-old whom he referenced was receiving medical care in an Israeli hospital after he stabbed two Israeli teenagers. Even before these recent terror attacks, incitement within the Palestinian Authority has been well documented. If these are the messages that are sent to Palestinian youth, if they never see the State of Israel on a map in their textbooks or if they watch television programs that glorify attacks on Israelis and Jews, how can we ever expect him to be committed to peace? By passing today's resolution, the United States House of Representatives is sending a message. It is a very simple message to the world, that we stand with the people of Israel as they face this onslaught of terror and that incitement spurred by inflammatory, violent rhetoric will not be tolerated. We won't tolerate officials using religion as a means to spur violence, and we won't tolerate actions like the recent Palestinian- backed resolution at UNESCO that attempted to rewrite history and inflame tension on the ground. Our resolution also expresses support for individuals and organizations that are working to encourage cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians. Unfortunately, President Abbas and his government are doing just the opposite. Mr. Speaker, there must be an end to this wave of terrorism. It is time to stop the spread of incitement. This resolution puts the House on record that incitement leads to violence, and it must end if there is to be a chance for peace. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin), who is a member of our Committee on Foreign Affairs. Mr. ZELDIN. I thank Ms. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen for her inspiring leadership in bringing forth this bipartisan resolution. I am inspired as I listen to the words of Mr. Deutch and Mr. Engel as this is something that allows Americans to unite for a cause of strengthening our relationships with our friends, like Israel, ensuring that we treat our enemies as our enemies. Mr. Speaker, according to the Maariv daily, Palestinian Authority President Abbas said in a Ramallah address: We will not forsake our country, and we will keep every inch of our land. Every drop of blood spilled in Jerusalem is pure. Every Shahid will reach paradise, and every injured person will be rewarded by God. The Palestinian Authority President said he would insist that a future Palestinian state include East Jerusalem as its capital. He said: The Al-Aqsa Mosque is ours. The church is ours as well. They have no right to desecrate the mosque with their dirty feet. We won't allow them to do that. A top Hamas official in the Gaza Strip called on all of the Palestinians to turn their weapons against the Israelis, saying that Allah created man only to wage jihad and to plunge knives into the chests of the enemies. We hear a lot of talk about the pursuit of a viable two-state solution. It is not just about Israel and its recognizing the Palestinians' right to exist. [[Page H7363]] It is also about the Palestinians and its recognizing Israel's right to exist. Yet the Palestinian Authority, by the day, is under more and more influence of an element that will not rest until the other side is wiped off the map. I was disturbed when the Secretary of State's spokesperson, John Kirby, said: Individuals on both sides of this divide are, have been proven capable of, and, in our view, are guilty of acts of terrorism. Last month the State Department claimed that the Temple Mount status quo was violated. I was just there a couple of months back. I was at a place called Decks Restaurant in Tiberias. It is right on the Sea of Galilee. The owner of the restaurant got on the microphone--the place was crowded with locals--and she started preaching about her love of America, about her appreciation of the strength of that bond between the U.S. and Israel. As she is saying this, a boat pulls in off the Sea of Galilee and starts setting off fireworks. As the fireworks start blowing off, they start playing ``God Bless America'' over the loud speaker. All the locals stood up and were singing along, and if they didn't know the words, they were lip-syncing it. It was such a proud moment. Where else in the world can you go where you will find a restaurant at which the owner will get on the microphone and start talking about her love of America? I value the relationship that we have with our friends, such as Israel. We didn't see the Israeli Prime Minister going on international TV trying to embarrass the President of the United States after there was a hospital strike, which the President took responsibility for. It is important that we don't embarrass our allies and that we stand with them in tough times. Right now we stand with innocent victims in Israel, who are being targeted by terrorist attacks through the incitement of violence by the leadership of the Palestinian Authority. That is why I am so proud to stand here today with Ms. Ileana Ros- Lehtinen for, again, her consistent and strong dedication and leadership and for her determination in ensuring that this body stands united with Israel every single day. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In closing, as you have heard from everyone who has spoken, the recent surge of Palestinian violence against Israel must stop. It must stop to save innocent lives. It must stop so that negotiations can go forward. It must stop because acts of terrorism are not to be tolerated. Any way you look at it, these are terrorist acts, and the only way we can have peace and the only way we can have a two-state solution is if both parties sit opposite each other, with no preconditions, and start negotiating. I do support a two-state solution--a Palestinian Arab state and an Israeli Jewish state--living together in peace and harmony; but it is not going to happen if the Palestinian leadership, which is bankrupt in more ways than one, refuses to teach its people the right thing, if it refuses to repudiate acts of terror. Mahmoud Abbas, or Abu Mazen--the leader of the Palestinians--is, I think, on the eighth year of his 4-year term. He is not really legitimate anymore. The more he talks with rhetoric and incitement, the less relevant he becomes. It is really a shame because I do think that the Palestinians deserve better and I do think that, ultimately, they deserve their own state; but they will not have their own state if they resort to terror. It is bankrupt, and it is a dead end for them. Instead of encouraging these kinds of acts of terror against innocent civilians, the leadership of the Palestinians ought to be dismissing it, ought to be condemning it, ought to be taking strong stands against it. We have yet to hear, and that is why this resolution is so important. This resolution sends the signal that Palestinian leaders have a responsibility to repudiate this violence and put an end to the horrific campaign of incitement against Jews and Israelis. Everyone who spoke today is saying the same thing. We are saying the same thing because it is clear as night and day what is going on over there. So I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure. The United States will always stand with the people of Israel, and the United States will always stand against violence and terrorism wherever it rears its head around the world. I again thank my good friend, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for her leadership and Mr. Deutch for his leadership as well. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank the chairman of our committee, Mr. Royce, for his help in bringing this resolution to the floor after the markup in the subcommittee and the full committee. I want to thank Mr. Engel for his steadfast support of doing everything that is humanly possible to support efforts in getting peace in the Middle East and his support for the democratic Jewish state of Israel. I want to thank Mr. Deutch, who is my partner on the Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee. He has been a person who understands the many obstacles to peace that the Palestinians encounter because of their failed leadership, and the responsibility lies in that leadership. I have had the opportunity to travel to Israel with Mr. Deutch, and I am very thankful for his friendship and for his guidance. I also want to thank Mr. Poe and Mr. Zeldin--valued members of our Committee on Foreign Affairs--for their perspectives on how to reach peace, because, when all is said and done, this is what this resolution is all about. We are condemning the anti-Israel and anti-Semitic incitement to violence by the Palestinian Authority, but we do so because this is antithetical to the cause of peace, which is what this body is all about and what the United States' foreign policy is based on in the Middle East. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, securing a lasting peace between Israel and Palestine requires a commitment to humanizing the experiences of both peoples. Divisive rhetoric dehumanizes people and undermines the prospect of long-term peace. This resolution is divisive. Incitement by either party, including Palestinian Authority leaders, is a serious issue and deserves to be condemned. But when we denounce the Palestinians and leave no mention of divisive rhetoric by the Israeli government, we do a disservice to Palestinians and Israelis. Just two weeks ago, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ``Hitler didn't want to exterminate the Jews at the time, he wanted to expel the Jews.'' He laid the blame for the Shoa at the feet of a Palestinian Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini. Al-Husseini was a virulent anti-Semite. But Prime Minister Netanyahu's blaming the idea of the Holocaust on a Palestinian, and by implication Palestinians, deserves to be condemned by this body just as Palestinian incitement does. I oppose this resolution, not because the Palestinians are not inciting, and not because I believe this incitement should not be condemned. I oppose this resolution because any resolution that attacks one side while ignoring the other can only further tension and violence. If Congress wants to be considered a legitimate arbiter of peace between Israel and Palestine we must pursue a balanced approach that calls for an end to incitement on both sides and both leaders to live up to their obligations under the Oslo Accords. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Harris). The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 293, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution, as amended, was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H7360-H7363] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] EXPRESSING CONCERN OVER ANTI-ISRAEL AND ANTI-SEMITIC INCITEMENT WITHIN THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 293) expressing concern over anti-Israel and anti-Semitic incitement within the Palestinian Authority, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: H. Res. 293 Whereas the 1995 Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, commonly referred to as Oslo II, specifically details that Israel and the Palestinian Authority shall ``abstain from incitement, including hostile propaganda, against each other and, without derogating from the principle of freedom of expression, shall take legal measures to prevent such incitement by any organizations, groups or individuals within their jurisdiction''; Whereas the Oslo II agreement further states that Israel and the Palestinian Authority ``will ensure that their respective educational systems contribute to the peace between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples and to peace in the entire region''; Whereas Palestinian Authority incitement against Israelis has continued unabated for many years despite periods of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority; Whereas this incitement takes on many forms, and has included the glorification of terrorists who have murdered Israeli civilians; advocating struggle against Israel despite entering into negotiations with Israel; the demonization of Jews and Israelis, including by the use of anti-Semitic motifs; the denial of Israel's existence and its delegitimization as evidenced by the absence of Israel on official maps used in Palestinian Authority institutions; and false claims that Israel or the Jews are endangering Muslim holy sites, such as the Al-Aqsa mosque/Temple Mount in Jerusalem; Whereas in June 2013, Abbas referenced Israeli acts which ``indicate an evil and dangerous plot to destroy Al-Aqsa and build the alleged temple''; Whereas on September 16, 2015, Abbas stated on Palestinian television that ``we welcome every drop of blood spilled in Jerusalem. This is pure blood, clean blood, blood on its way to Allah. With the help of Allah, every martyr will be in heaven, and every wounded will get his reward''; Whereas since mid-September 2015 there has been a wave of Palestinian violence in Israel and the West Bank, including stabbings, shootings, and other terrorist acts; Whereas this situation has been inflamed by statements made by Palestinian President Abbas, other Palestinian officials, clerics, and official Palestinian Authority media, and frequently amplified on social media platforms; Whereas these statements have included repeated false claims that Israel seeks to change the ``status quo'' on the Temple Mount/al-Aqsa Mosque compound; Whereas despite the incitement-induced wave of terrorism, the Palestinian Authority security forces and the Israel Defense Forces have continued security cooperation; Whereas section 7038 of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 states that ``none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act may be used to provide equipment, technical support, consulting services, or any other form of assistance to the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation''; Whereas section 7040(e) of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 requires the Secretary of State, if the President waives section 7040(a) of that Act, to ``certify and report to the Committees on Appropriations prior to the obligation of funds that . . . the Palestinian Authority is acting to counter incitement of violence against Israelis and is supporting activities aimed at promoting peace, coexistence, and security cooperation with Israel''; and Whereas the Palestinian Authority has not fully lived up to its prior agreements with Israel to end incitement and should do more to prepare the Palestinian people for peace with Israel: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives-- (1) expresses support and admiration for individuals and organizations working to encourage cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians; (2) strongly condemns the wave of violent attacks in Israel and the West Bank; (3) reiterates the strong condemnation of anti-Israel and anti-Semitic incitement to violence in the Palestinian Authority as antithetical to the cause of peace; (4) calls on the Palestinian Authority to-- (A) immediately discontinue incitement to violence in all Palestinian Authority-controlled media outlets, and officially and publicly repudiate attacks against Israelis and engage in a sustained effort to publicly and officially rebuke anti-Israel incitement to violence; (B) continue important security cooperation with Israel; and (C) agree to unconditionally renew direct talks with the Israelis, including the reconstitution of the Trilateral Commission on Incitement; (5) encourages responsible nations to condemn in the strongest possible terms incitement to violence by the Palestinian Authority; (6) expresses support for the Government of Israel in its fight against terror; (7) directs the Department of State to regularly monitor and publish information on all official incitement by the Palestinian Authority against Jews and the State of Israel; and (8) calls on the Administration to continue publicly repudiating and raising the issue of Palestinian anti-Israel incitement to violence in all appropriate bilateral and international forums. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida. General Leave Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Florida? There was no objection. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the esteemed chairman of our full committee, Chairman Royce, and Ranking Member Engel, who is before us today, for their leadership and for helping us to mark up and vote on this resolution at the subcommittee and at the full committee, thereby landing us right here on the floor this afternoon. I would also like to thank my friend and dear south Florida colleague, ranking member of the Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee, Mr. Deutch, for joining me in introducing this important resolution condemning the anti-Israel and anti-Semitic incitement from within the Palestinian Authority. Sadly, Mr. Speaker, as we have seen over the past 2 months in Israel, violence and terror are on the rise, and hardly a day goes by when we don't hear about yet another attack against innocent Israelis. Since the most recent round of attacks began on the Jewish New Year in mid-September, there have been nearly 60 stabbing attacks, 5 shootings, and 6 car-ramming attacks, resulting in 10 deaths and scores more injured. Let me repeat that again, Mr. Speaker: 60 stabbing attacks, 5 shootings, [[Page H7361]] and 6 car-ramming attacks, resulting in 10 deaths and many people injured, not to mention the psychological toll that these acts of terror have taken on Israelis. Today--today--Mr. Speaker, there were two separate stabbing attacks in two different cities. An 80-year-old woman was among the victims, showing that these random attacks can happen anywhere, at any time, to anyone. When Israeli citizens cannot walk out of their homes to go to work or they cannot walk out of their homes to go to the grocery store for fear of yet another terrorist attack, we must hold the Palestinian leadership accountable for its incitement and its unwillingness to ease tensions in the region. The resolution before us, Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 293, unfortunately is the consequence of the continued failure of the Palestinian leadership. Instead of working toward achieving lasting peace with Israel, what is Abu Mazen, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, doing? He is undermining the peace process. Instead of encouraging the Palestinian people and leading them toward a better future, Abu Mazen's divisive actions are tearing the Palestinians apart, leading them into despair, into hatred, into violence. Instead of calling for an emergency meeting with Palestinian leaders to discuss a way to walk back the rhetoric, a way to calm the tensions, no, Abu Mazen called for an emergency meeting at the United Nations Human Rights Council, the preferred platform to spew anti-Israel hatred. Why? In an effort to delegitimize the Jewish state where he further fanned the flames of violence once again, as he has been doing, Mr. Speaker, since he assumed leadership. Already the perpetrators of these acts of terror are being glorified--yes, glorified--hailed as heroes, hailed as martyrs. Last week, in fact, the Palestinian Authority named a street after a Palestinian terrorist. What did that person do? He fatally stabbed two innocent Israelis in Jerusalem. But where is the world's condemnation of this? What is the response from the international community? Silence. Too often we see attempts to place this false moral equivalence between the Israelis' actions and the Palestinians' because too many are unwilling to accept the truth, and that is that the Palestinian leadership is the problem, not the solution, to the peace process. We cannot allow Abu Mazen's words and Abu Mazen's actions to continue to go unpunished because, as we have seen over the past month and a half, they have consequences and innocent people have died. Today, Mr. Speaker, we have an opportunity to send a clear message to Abu Mazen, that his words and actions are unacceptable, that we condemn these actions, and that we hold the Palestinian Authority responsible for inciting these recent acts of terror against Israeli citizens. Palestinian leaders have been indoctrinating the Palestinian people with incitement against Israel for generations, and that is not something that is easily reversed. But by passing this resolution tonight, Mr. Speaker, we are sending a message to the Palestinian leader that this behavior will not be tolerated and it will not be unaddressed. This is an opportunity to start to hold Abu Mazen and the PA accountable for their words, accountable for their deadly actions. I urge my colleagues to join me in condemning anti-Israel and anti- Semitic incitement in all of its forms. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of this measure. Let me start by thanking our former chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for sponsoring this resolution. I agree with every word she just said. She has been a good friend to the state and people of Israel, and this measure, which I am happy to cosponsor, shows once again that support for Israel in Congress is not a partisan issue. Israel has much bipartisan support in this Congress, and we intend to keep it this way. As the Congresswoman has mentioned, the violence in Israel has gone from bad to worse in recent days. Day after day, we hear new reports of innocent Israeli victims of stabbings or shootings at the hands of Palestinian terrorists. I use the word ``terrorist,'' Mr. Speaker, because what they are doing are acts of terrorism. If random people, average citizens, have nothing to do with policy, have nothing to do with politics--they are just civilians that are walking in the street--if they are attacked by a knife or something else that harms them, that is a terrorist attack. Imagine if we had such things going on in the United States. It would have a chilling effect on what people can do, and whether they can move around or can't move around as a result of it. So this is not something that is random. It is not something that is confined. It can strike anybody at any time, any place, and it is terrorism. I have often said that while I support a two-state solution, if the Palestinians continue to use terrorism because they think it will get them closer to their state, they are wrong. It will prevent them from ever having a state if they don't renounce terrorism. That is what this is all about. It is the incitement. It is the encouraging of hatred for Israelis and the Jews and for the United States as well. This goes on time and time and time again, and then we wonder why we have these acts of violence, because you cannot fan the fires and be a leader in it and then suddenly look the other way and say, ``Well, you know, we are not encouraging it.'' The Palestinian Authority has been irresponsible, and they have been irresponsible for many, many years. So, as it has every right to do, Israel has defended itself against these attacks, these stabbings and shootings. But this bloodshed must be brought to an end. I have no doubt, Mr. Speaker, that it could be in a hurry if Palestinian leaders would do the right thing: repudiate the violence and, most importantly, the ceaseless campaign of incitement that demonizes Jews and Israelis and glorifies terrorists. Chairman Royce and I will soon send a bipartisan letter signed by more than 350 of our colleagues in both parties. I am very, very happy with the overwhelming support we have gotten from our colleagues on both sides of the aisle for this letter. That is why Chairman Royce and I try to do things in a bipartisan manner: because something like this is bipartisan; support for Israel is bipartisan; support against terror is bipartisan. We have to stand together as Americans, regardless of party affiliation, and say: we will not countenance terror. And we are going to point fingers at the Palestinian Authority, who has been utterly irresponsible in this whole thing. So if Palestinian leaders would do the right thing and repudiate the violence and, most importantly, end the ceaseless campaign of incitement that demonizes Jews and Israelis and glorifies terrorists, this could stop. This letter that Chairman Royce and I have done, signed by more than 350 of our colleagues, to Palestinian President Abbas urges him to take that course, but I cannot say that I have high hopes. After all, this type of rhetoric by Palestinians against Jews and Israelis and even just Americans, in general, is nothing new. In Palestinian books and newspapers, on the television and radio, we see and hear a constant message of hatred and incitement. From a young age, Palestinians are taught that the people of Israel are their enemies and those who use violence are heroes, and this is very, very infuriating. It is the fuel that fires the violence we are seeing today, and it is a roadblock, as I said before, on the path towards a two-state solution. Palestinians will never build their own state on the backs of terrorists. It is a dead end for them, and it is counterproductive. They ought to know it. They are doing their people a tremendous disservice. This resolution calls on Palestinian leaders to show real responsibility to reject the violence and end incitement and to return to the negotiating table with no preconditions, sit down and negotiate. It reaffirms our commitment to our Israeli allies and our desire to see [[Page H7362]] peace for both Israelis and Palestinians. I urge my colleagues to support this measure. I reserve the balance of my time. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), who is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for yielding on this important resolution. Mr. Speaker, the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians has reached new levels of terror. Over the past month, Palestinians have stabbed, shot, or run over innocent Israelis almost every day. The cause of these tragedies is simple: the incitement by Palestinian leaders. Of course, our government is on the wrong side of this issue. Our government stands by while Palestinian Authority President Abbas praises violent riots on the Temple Mount. But the problem is bigger than speeches. Palestinian leaders have turned their schools into terrorist breeding grounds that teach hate. {time} 1700 Israel reacted to this violence how any other country should react; but the United States State Department callously calls Israel's self- defense executive force. Like I said, the State Department has got it wrong. The Palestinians should be called out for what they are doing: inciting violence and committing violence. They are responsible for their criminal acts, not the Israelis. We can stand side by side with Israel by condemning these terrorist acts, and the Palestinian leaders should be held personally accountable for inciting violence in the Palestinian community. The State Department and the world need to quit making excuses for Palestinian terrorists and hold them accountable for the crimes that they commit. I am glad to be an original cosponsor of House Resolution 293. I urge its passage so that America and the rest of the world understand that we stand by Israel and not by the terrorists. And that is just the way it is. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch), the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa. Mr. DEUTCH. I thank my friend, Mr. Engel. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel and their staffs for working to bring this bipartisan resolution to the floor. I want to thank my friend and colleague and neighbor, Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for partnering with me on this effort. In the month of October, there have been more than 50 stabbings in Israel, there have been attempted stabbings, there have been shootings, there have been cars rammed into civilians. Terrorists have killed 11 and have wounded more than 10 times that number. In a span of just 12 hours today, there were 4 separate terror attacks. This resolution is important because these attacks aren't a protest or a political statement about holy sites or politics. It is terrorism, and it flows from incitement at the highest levels of the Palestinian Government. Now, I have said many times that all attacks on innocent civilians should be condemned and that they should be condemned regardless of who commits them. Yet I have to point out that, when a revenge attack occurs, committed by Israelis, the Prime Minister of Israel himself condemns that action on national television; but when there are attempted stabbings every single day for nearly 8 weeks, Palestinian leadership does not condemn even one single attack. Instead, we continue to see officials trying to justify acts of terror as an expected part of a religious conflict. False accusations about changes at the Temple Mount, when they have been repeatedly denied by Israeli leadership, send a very dangerous message that violence is necessary to preserve Muslim holy sites when, in fact, those holy sites are not threatened at all. Unfortunately, incitement from officials within the Palestinian Authority is not new. Despite statements from President Abbas that he is committed and has been committed for years to nonviolence, there are still countless examples in official textbooks, on social media pages, and in television speeches that call for an armed conflict and that depict Jews as dirty pigs. Mr. Speaker, Secretary Kerry was right when he recently said, ``President Abbas has been committed to nonviolence. He needs to be condemning this loudly and clearly, and he needs to not engage in the incitement that his voice has sometimes been heard to encourage; so that has to stop.'' If President Abbas remains committed to his stated vision of a peaceful, stable Palestinian state, living side by side with a safe and secure Israel, then now is the time for real leadership. Now is the time to go on national television and condemn these attacks. Now is the time to accept the Jordanian plan for surveillance at the Temple Mount to ensure that religious freedom is, in fact, being protected. Now is the time to stop dangerous rhetoric, like when he said that he would ``welcome every drop of blood spilled in Jerusalem'' or when he accused Israel of the ``summary execution of children'' when, in fact, the 13-year-old whom he referenced was receiving medical care in an Israeli hospital after he stabbed two Israeli teenagers. Even before these recent terror attacks, incitement within the Palestinian Authority has been well documented. If these are the messages that are sent to Palestinian youth, if they never see the State of Israel on a map in their textbooks or if they watch television programs that glorify attacks on Israelis and Jews, how can we ever expect him to be committed to peace? By passing today's resolution, the United States House of Representatives is sending a message. It is a very simple message to the world, that we stand with the people of Israel as they face this onslaught of terror and that incitement spurred by inflammatory, violent rhetoric will not be tolerated. We won't tolerate officials using religion as a means to spur violence, and we won't tolerate actions like the recent Palestinian- backed resolution at UNESCO that attempted to rewrite history and inflame tension on the ground. Our resolution also expresses support for individuals and organizations that are working to encourage cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians. Unfortunately, President Abbas and his government are doing just the opposite. Mr. Speaker, there must be an end to this wave of terrorism. It is time to stop the spread of incitement. This resolution puts the House on record that incitement leads to violence, and it must end if there is to be a chance for peace. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin), who is a member of our Committee on Foreign Affairs. Mr. ZELDIN. I thank Ms. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen for her inspiring leadership in bringing forth this bipartisan resolution. I am inspired as I listen to the words of Mr. Deutch and Mr. Engel as this is something that allows Americans to unite for a cause of strengthening our relationships with our friends, like Israel, ensuring that we treat our enemies as our enemies. Mr. Speaker, according to the Maariv daily, Palestinian Authority President Abbas said in a Ramallah address: We will not forsake our country, and we will keep every inch of our land. Every drop of blood spilled in Jerusalem is pure. Every Shahid will reach paradise, and every injured person will be rewarded by God. The Palestinian Authority President said he would insist that a future Palestinian state include East Jerusalem as its capital. He said: The Al-Aqsa Mosque is ours. The church is ours as well. They have no right to desecrate the mosque with their dirty feet. We won't allow them to do that. A top Hamas official in the Gaza Strip called on all of the Palestinians to turn their weapons against the Israelis, saying that Allah created man only to wage jihad and to plunge knives into the chests of the enemies. We hear a lot of talk about the pursuit of a viable two-state solution. It is not just about Israel and its recognizing the Palestinians' right to exist. [[Page H7363]] It is also about the Palestinians and its recognizing Israel's right to exist. Yet the Palestinian Authority, by the day, is under more and more influence of an element that will not rest until the other side is wiped off the map. I was disturbed when the Secretary of State's spokesperson, John Kirby, said: Individuals on both sides of this divide are, have been proven capable of, and, in our view, are guilty of acts of terrorism. Last month the State Department claimed that the Temple Mount status quo was violated. I was just there a couple of months back. I was at a place called Decks Restaurant in Tiberias. It is right on the Sea of Galilee. The owner of the restaurant got on the microphone--the place was crowded with locals--and she started preaching about her love of America, about her appreciation of the strength of that bond between the U.S. and Israel. As she is saying this, a boat pulls in off the Sea of Galilee and starts setting off fireworks. As the fireworks start blowing off, they start playing ``God Bless America'' over the loud speaker. All the locals stood up and were singing along, and if they didn't know the words, they were lip-syncing it. It was such a proud moment. Where else in the world can you go where you will find a restaurant at which the owner will get on the microphone and start talking about her love of America? I value the relationship that we have with our friends, such as Israel. We didn't see the Israeli Prime Minister going on international TV trying to embarrass the President of the United States after there was a hospital strike, which the President took responsibility for. It is important that we don't embarrass our allies and that we stand with them in tough times. Right now we stand with innocent victims in Israel, who are being targeted by terrorist attacks through the incitement of violence by the leadership of the Palestinian Authority. That is why I am so proud to stand here today with Ms. Ileana Ros- Lehtinen for, again, her consistent and strong dedication and leadership and for her determination in ensuring that this body stands united with Israel every single day. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In closing, as you have heard from everyone who has spoken, the recent surge of Palestinian violence against Israel must stop. It must stop to save innocent lives. It must stop so that negotiations can go forward. It must stop because acts of terrorism are not to be tolerated. Any way you look at it, these are terrorist acts, and the only way we can have peace and the only way we can have a two-state solution is if both parties sit opposite each other, with no preconditions, and start negotiating. I do support a two-state solution--a Palestinian Arab state and an Israeli Jewish state--living together in peace and harmony; but it is not going to happen if the Palestinian leadership, which is bankrupt in more ways than one, refuses to teach its people the right thing, if it refuses to repudiate acts of terror. Mahmoud Abbas, or Abu Mazen--the leader of the Palestinians--is, I think, on the eighth year of his 4-year term. He is not really legitimate anymore. The more he talks with rhetoric and incitement, the less relevant he becomes. It is really a shame because I do think that the Palestinians deserve better and I do think that, ultimately, they deserve their own state; but they will not have their own state if they resort to terror. It is bankrupt, and it is a dead end for them. Instead of encouraging these kinds of acts of terror against innocent civilians, the leadership of the Palestinians ought to be dismissing it, ought to be condemning it, ought to be taking strong stands against it. We have yet to hear, and that is why this resolution is so important. This resolution sends the signal that Palestinian leaders have a responsibility to repudiate this violence and put an end to the horrific campaign of incitement against Jews and Israelis. Everyone who spoke today is saying the same thing. We are saying the same thing because it is clear as night and day what is going on over there. So I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure. The United States will always stand with the people of Israel, and the United States will always stand against violence and terrorism wherever it rears its head around the world. I again thank my good friend, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, for her leadership and Mr. Deutch for his leadership as well. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I want to thank the chairman of our committee, Mr. Royce, for his help in bringing this resolution to the floor after the markup in the subcommittee and the full committee. I want to thank Mr. Engel for his steadfast support of doing everything that is humanly possible to support efforts in getting peace in the Middle East and his support for the democratic Jewish state of Israel. I want to thank Mr. Deutch, who is my partner on the Middle East and North Africa Subcommittee. He has been a person who understands the many obstacles to peace that the Palestinians encounter because of their failed leadership, and the responsibility lies in that leadership. I have had the opportunity to travel to Israel with Mr. Deutch, and I am very thankful for his friendship and for his guidance. I also want to thank Mr. Poe and Mr. Zeldin--valued members of our Committee on Foreign Affairs--for their perspectives on how to reach peace, because, when all is said and done, this is what this resolution is all about. We are condemning the anti-Israel and anti-Semitic incitement to violence by the Palestinian Authority, but we do so because this is antithetical to the cause of peace, which is what this body is all about and what the United States' foreign policy is based on in the Middle East. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, securing a lasting peace between Israel and Palestine requires a commitment to humanizing the experiences of both peoples. Divisive rhetoric dehumanizes people and undermines the prospect of long-term peace. This resolution is divisive. Incitement by either party, including Palestinian Authority leaders, is a serious issue and deserves to be condemned. But when we denounce the Palestinians and leave no mention of divisive rhetoric by the Israeli government, we do a disservice to Palestinians and Israelis. Just two weeks ago, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ``Hitler didn't want to exterminate the Jews at the time, he wanted to expel the Jews.'' He laid the blame for the Shoa at the feet of a Palestinian Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini. Al-Husseini was a virulent anti-Semite. But Prime Minister Netanyahu's blaming the idea of the Holocaust on a Palestinian, and by implication Palestinians, deserves to be condemned by this body just as Palestinian incitement does. I oppose this resolution, not because the Palestinians are not inciting, and not because I believe this incitement should not be condemned. I oppose this resolution because any resolution that attacks one side while ignoring the other can only further tension and violence. If Congress wants to be considered a legitimate arbiter of peace between Israel and Palestine we must pursue a balanced approach that calls for an end to incitement on both sides and both leaders to live up to their obligations under the Oslo Accords. The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Harris). The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 293, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution, as amended, was agreed to. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_271.csv,31816,31816,31886,"[congressional record volume 161, number 162 (monday, november 2, 2015)] [house] [pages h7360-h7363] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] expressing concern over anti-israel and anti-semitic incitement within the palestinian authority ms. ros-lehtinen. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (h. res. 293) expressing concern over anti-israel and anti-semitic incitement within the palestinian authority, as amended. the clerk read the title of the resolution. the text of the resolution is as follows: h. res. 293 whereas the 1995 interim agreement on the west bank and the gaza strip, commonly referred to as oslo ii, specifically details that israel and the palestinian authority shall ``abstain from incitement, including hostile propaganda, against each other and, without derogating from the principle of freedom of expression, shall take legal measures to prevent such incitement by any organizations, groups or individuals within their jurisdiction''; whereas the oslo ii agreement further states that israel and the palestinian authority ``will ensure that their respective educational systems contribute to the peace between the israeli and palestinian peoples and to peace in the entire region''; whereas palestinian authority incitement against israelis has continued unabated for many years despite periods of negotiations between israel and the palestinian authority; whereas this incitement takes on many forms, and has included the glorification of terrorists who have murdered israeli civilians; advocating struggle against israel despite entering into negotiations with israel; the demonization of jews and israelis, including by the use of anti-semitic motifs; the denial of israel's existence and its delegitimization as evidenced by the absence of israel on official maps used in palestinian authority institutions; and false claims that israel or the jews are endangering muslim holy sites, such as the al-aqsa mosque/temple mount in jerusalem; whereas in june 2013, abbas referenced israeli acts which ``indicate an evil and dangerous plot to destroy al-aqsa and build the alleged temple''; whereas on september 16, 2015, abbas stated on palestinian television that ``we welcome every drop of blood spilled in jerusalem. this is pure blood, clean blood, blood on its way to allah. with the help of allah, every martyr will be in heaven, and every wounded will get his reward''; whereas since mid-september 2015 there has been a wave of palestinian violence in israel and the west bank, including stabbings, shootings, and other terrorist acts; whereas this situation has been inflamed by statements made by palestinian president abbas, other palestinian officials, clerics, and official palestinian authority media, and frequently amplified on social media platforms; whereas these statements have included repeated false claims that israel seeks to change the ``status quo'' on the temple mount/al-aqsa mosque compound; whereas despite the incitement-induced wave of terrorism, the palestinian authority security forces and the israel defense forces have continued security cooperation; whereas section 7038 of the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act, 2015 states that ``none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this act may be used to provide equipment, technical support, consulting services, or any other form of assistance to the palestinian broadcasting corporation''; whereas section 7040(e) of the consolidated and further continuing appropriations act, 2015 requires the secretary of state, if the president waives section 7040(a) of that act, to ``certify and report to the committees on appropriations prior to the obligation of funds that . . . the palestinian authority is acting to counter incitement of violence against israelis and is supporting activities aimed at promoting peace, coexistence, and security cooperation with israel''; and whereas the palestinian authority has not fully lived up to its prior agreements with israel to end incitement and should do more to prepare the palestinian people for peace with israel: now, therefore, be it resolved, that the house of representatives-- (1) expresses support and admiration for individuals and organizations working to encourage cooperation between israelis and palestinians; (2) strongly condemns the wave of violent attacks in israel and the west bank; (3) reiterates the strong condemnation of anti-israel and anti-semitic incitement to violence in the palestinian authority as antithetical to the cause of peace; (4) calls on the palestinian authority to-- (a) immediately discontinue incitement to violence in all palestinian authority-controlled media outlets, and officially and publicly repudiate attacks against israelis and engage in a sustained effort to publicly and officially rebuke anti-israel incitement to violence; (b) continue important security cooperation with israel; and (c) agree to unconditionally renew direct talks with the israelis, including the reconstitution of the trilateral commission on incitement; (5) encourages responsible nations to condemn in the strongest possible terms incitement to violence by the palestinian authority; (6) expresses support for the government of israel in its fight against terror; (7) directs the department of state to regularly monitor and publish information on all official incitement by the palestinian authority against jews and the state of israel; and (8) calls on the administration to continue publicly repudiating and raising the issue of palestinian anti-israel incitement to violence in all appropriate bilateral and international forums. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from florida (ms. ros-lehtinen) and the gentleman from new york (mr. engel) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentlewoman from florida. general leave ms. ros-lehtinen. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material on the resolution. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from florida? there was no objection. ms. ros-lehtinen. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i would like to thank the esteemed chairman of our full committee, chairman royce, and ranking member engel, who is before us today, for their leadership and for helping us to mark up and vote on this resolution at the subcommittee and at the full committee, thereby landing us right here on the floor this afternoon. i would also like to thank my friend and dear south florida colleague, ranking member of the middle east and north africa subcommittee, mr. deutch, for joining me in introducing this important resolution condemning the anti-israel and anti-semitic incitement from within the palestinian authority. sadly, mr. speaker, as we have seen over the past 2 months in israel, violence and terror are on the rise, and hardly a day goes by when we don't hear about yet another attack against innocent israelis. since the most recent round of attacks began on the jewish new year in mid-september, there have been nearly 60 stabbing attacks, 5 shootings, and 6 car-ramming attacks, resulting in 10 deaths and scores more injured. let me repeat that again, mr. speaker: 60 stabbing attacks, 5 shootings, [[page h7361]] and 6 car-ramming attacks, resulting in 10 deaths and many people injured, not to mention the psychological toll that these acts of terror have taken on israelis. today--today--mr. speaker, there were two separate stabbing attacks in two different cities. an 80-year-old woman was among the victims, showing that these random attacks can happen anywhere, at any time, to anyone. when israeli citizens cannot walk out of their homes to go to work or they cannot walk out of their homes to go to the grocery store for fear of yet another terrorist attack, we must hold the palestinian leadership accountable for its incitement and its unwillingness to ease tensions in the region. the resolution before us, mr. speaker, house resolution 293, unfortunately is the consequence of the continued failure of the palestinian leadership. instead of working toward achieving lasting peace with israel, what is abu mazen, the leader of the palestinian authority, doing? he is undermining the peace process. instead of encouraging the palestinian people and leading them toward a better future, abu mazen's divisive actions are tearing the palestinians apart, leading them into despair, into hatred, into violence. instead of calling for an emergency meeting with palestinian leaders to discuss a way to walk back the rhetoric, a way to calm the tensions, no, abu mazen called for an emergency meeting at the united nations human rights council, the preferred platform to spew anti-israel hatred. why? in an effort to delegitimize the jewish state where he further fanned the flames of violence once again, as he has been doing, mr. speaker, since he assumed leadership. already the perpetrators of these acts of terror are being glorified--yes, glorified--hailed as heroes, hailed as martyrs. last week, in fact, the palestinian authority named a street after a palestinian terrorist. what did that person do? he fatally stabbed two innocent israelis in jerusalem. but where is the world's condemnation of this? what is the response from the international community? silence. too often we see attempts to place this false moral equivalence between the israelis' actions and the palestinians' because too many are unwilling to accept the truth, and that is that the palestinian leadership is the problem, not the solution, to the peace process. we cannot allow abu mazen's words and abu mazen's actions to continue to go unpunished because, as we have seen over the past month and a half, they have consequences and innocent people have died. today, mr. speaker, we have an opportunity to send a clear message to abu mazen, that his words and actions are unacceptable, that we condemn these actions, and that we hold the palestinian authority responsible for inciting these recent acts of terror against israeli citizens. palestinian leaders have been indoctrinating the palestinian people with incitement against israel for generations, and that is not something that is easily reversed. but by passing this resolution tonight, mr. speaker, we are sending a message to the palestinian leader that this behavior will not be tolerated and it will not be unaddressed. this is an opportunity to start to hold abu mazen and the pa accountable for their words, accountable for their deadly actions. i urge my colleagues to join me in condemning anti-israel and anti- semitic incitement in all of its forms. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i rise in support of this measure. let me start by thanking our former chair of the foreign affairs committee, ileana ros-lehtinen, for sponsoring this resolution. i agree with every word she just said. she has been a good friend to the state and people of israel, and this measure, which i am happy to cosponsor, shows once again that support for israel in congress is not a partisan issue. israel has much bipartisan support in this congress, and we intend to keep it this way. as the congresswoman has mentioned, the violence in israel has gone from bad to worse in recent days. day after day, we hear new reports of innocent israeli victims of stabbings or shootings at the hands of palestinian terrorists. i use the word ``terrorist,'' mr. speaker, because what they are doing are acts of terrorism. if random people, average citizens, have nothing to do with policy, have nothing to do with politics--they are just civilians that are walking in the street--if they are attacked by a knife or something else that harms them, that is a terrorist attack. imagine if we had such things going on in the united states. it would have a chilling effect on what people can do, and whether they can move around or can't move around as a result of it. so this is not something that is random. it is not something that is confined. it can strike anybody at any time, any place, and it is terrorism. i have often said that while i support a two-state solution, if the palestinians continue to use terrorism because they think it will get them closer to their state, they are wrong. it will prevent them from ever having a state if they don't renounce terrorism. that is what this is all about. it is the incitement. it is the encouraging of hatred for israelis and the jews and for the united states as well. this goes on time and time and time again, and then we wonder why we have these acts of violence, because you cannot fan the fires and be a leader in it and then suddenly look the other way and say, ``well, you know, we are not encouraging it.'' the palestinian authority has been irresponsible, and they have been irresponsible for many, many years. so, as it has every right to do, israel has defended itself against these attacks, these stabbings and shootings. but this bloodshed must be brought to an end. i have no doubt, mr. speaker, that it could be in a hurry if palestinian leaders would do the right thing: repudiate the violence and, most importantly, the ceaseless campaign of incitement that demonizes jews and israelis and glorifies terrorists. chairman royce and i will soon send a bipartisan letter signed by more than 350 of our colleagues in both parties. i am very, very happy with the overwhelming support we have gotten from our colleagues on both sides of the aisle for this letter. that is why chairman royce and i try to do things in a bipartisan manner: because something like this is bipartisan; support for israel is bipartisan; support against terror is bipartisan. we have to stand together as americans, regardless of party affiliation, and say: we will not countenance terror. and we are going to point fingers at the palestinian authority, who has been utterly irresponsible in this whole thing. so if palestinian leaders would do the right thing and repudiate the violence and, most importantly, end the ceaseless campaign of incitement that demonizes jews and israelis and glorifies terrorists, this could stop. this letter that chairman royce and i have done, signed by more than 350 of our colleagues, to palestinian president abbas urges him to take that course, but i cannot say that i have high hopes. after all, this type of rhetoric by palestinians against jews and israelis and even just americans, in general, is nothing new. in palestinian books and newspapers, on the television and radio, we see and hear a constant message of hatred and incitement. from a young age, palestinians are taught that the people of israel are their enemies and those who use violence are heroes, and this is very, very infuriating. it is the fuel that fires the violence we are seeing today, and it is a roadblock, as i said before, on the path towards a two-state solution. palestinians will never build their own state on the backs of terrorists. it is a dead end for them, and it is counterproductive. they ought to know it. they are doing their people a tremendous disservice. this resolution calls on palestinian leaders to show real responsibility to reject the violence and end incitement and to return to the negotiating table with no preconditions, sit down and negotiate. it reaffirms our commitment to our israeli allies and our desire to see [[page h7362]] peace for both israelis and palestinians. i urge my colleagues to support this measure. i reserve the balance of my time. ms. ros-lehtinen. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from texas (mr. poe), who is the chairman of the foreign affairs subcommittee on terrorism, nonproliferation, and trade. mr. poe of texas. mr. speaker, i thank the gentlewoman from florida for yielding on this important resolution. mr. speaker, the conflict between the israelis and the palestinians has reached new levels of terror. over the past month, palestinians have stabbed, shot, or run over innocent israelis almost every day. the cause of these tragedies is simple: the incitement by palestinian leaders. of course, our government is on the wrong side of this issue. our government stands by while palestinian authority president abbas praises violent riots on the temple mount. but the problem is bigger than speeches. palestinian leaders have turned their schools into terrorist breeding grounds that teach hate. {time} 1700 israel reacted to this violence how any other country should react; but the united states state department callously calls israel's self- defense executive force. like i said, the state department has got it wrong. the palestinians should be called out for what they are doing: inciting violence and committing violence. they are responsible for their criminal acts, not the israelis. we can stand side by side with israel by condemning these terrorist acts, and the palestinian leaders should be held personally accountable for inciting violence in the palestinian community. the state department and the world need to quit making excuses for palestinian terrorists and hold them accountable for the crimes that they commit. i am glad to be an original cosponsor of house resolution 293. i urge its passage so that america and the rest of the world understand that we stand by israel and not by the terrorists. and that is just the way it is. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from florida (mr. deutch), the ranking member of the foreign affairs subcommittee on the middle east and north africa. mr. deutch. i thank my friend, mr. engel. mr. speaker, i want to thank chairman royce and ranking member engel and their staffs for working to bring this bipartisan resolution to the floor. i want to thank my friend and colleague and neighbor, congresswoman ileana ros-lehtinen, for partnering with me on this effort. in the month of october, there have been more than 50 stabbings in israel, there have been attempted stabbings, there have been shootings, there have been cars rammed into civilians. terrorists have killed 11 and have wounded more than 10 times that number. in a span of just 12 hours today, there were 4 separate terror attacks. this resolution is important because these attacks aren't a protest or a political statement about holy sites or politics. it is terrorism, and it flows from incitement at the highest levels of the palestinian government. now, i have said many times that all attacks on innocent civilians should be condemned and that they should be condemned regardless of who commits them. yet i have to point out that, when a revenge attack occurs, committed by israelis, the prime minister of israel himself condemns that action on national television; but when there are attempted stabbings every single day for nearly 8 weeks, palestinian leadership does not condemn even one single attack. instead, we continue to see officials trying to justify acts of terror as an expected part of a religious conflict. false accusations about changes at the temple mount, when they have been repeatedly denied by israeli leadership, send a very dangerous message that violence is necessary to preserve muslim holy sites when, in fact, those holy sites are not threatened at all. unfortunately, incitement from officials within the palestinian authority is not new. despite statements from president abbas that he is committed and has been committed for years to nonviolence, there are still countless examples in official textbooks, on social media pages, and in television speeches that call for an armed conflict and that depict jews as dirty pigs. mr. speaker, secretary kerry was right when he recently said, ``president abbas has been committed to nonviolence. he needs to be condemning this loudly and clearly, and he needs to not engage in the incitement that his voice has sometimes been heard to encourage; so that has to stop.'' if president abbas remains committed to his stated vision of a peaceful, stable palestinian state, living side by side with a safe and secure israel, then now is the time for real leadership. now is the time to go on national television and condemn these attacks. now is the time to accept the jordanian plan for surveillance at the temple mount to ensure that religious freedom is, in fact, being protected. now is the time to stop dangerous rhetoric, like when he said that he would ``welcome every drop of blood spilled in jerusalem'' or when he accused israel of the ``summary execution of children'' when, in fact, the 13-year-old whom he referenced was receiving medical care in an israeli hospital after he stabbed two israeli teenagers. even before these recent terror attacks, incitement within the palestinian authority has been well documented. if these are the messages that are sent to palestinian youth, if they never see the state of israel on a map in their textbooks or if they watch television programs that glorify attacks on israelis and jews, how can we ever expect him to be committed to peace? by passing today's resolution, the united states house of representatives is sending a message. it is a very simple message to the world, that we stand with the people of israel as they face this onslaught of terror and that incitement spurred by inflammatory, violent rhetoric will not be tolerated. we won't tolerate officials using religion as a means to spur violence, and we won't tolerate actions like the recent palestinian- backed resolution at unesco that attempted to rewrite history and inflame tension on the ground. our resolution also expresses support for individuals and organizations that are working to encourage cooperation between israelis and palestinians. unfortunately, president abbas and his government are doing just the opposite. mr. speaker, there must be an end to this wave of terrorism. it is time to stop the spread of incitement. this resolution puts the house on record that incitement leads to violence, and it must end if there is to be a chance for peace. i urge my colleagues to support this resolution. ms. ros-lehtinen. mr. speaker, i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from new york (mr. zeldin), who is a member of our committee on foreign affairs. mr. zeldin. i thank ms. ileana ros-lehtinen for her inspiring leadership in bringing forth this bipartisan resolution. i am inspired as i listen to the words of mr. deutch and mr. engel as this is something that allows americans to unite for a cause of strengthening our relationships with our friends, like israel, ensuring that we treat our enemies as our enemies. mr. speaker, according to the maariv daily, palestinian authority president abbas said in a ramallah address: we will not forsake our country, and we will keep every inch of our land. every drop of blood spilled in jerusalem is pure. every shahid will reach paradise, and every injured person will be rewarded by god. the palestinian authority president said he would insist that a future palestinian state include east jerusalem as its capital. he said: the al-aqsa mosque is ours. the church is ours as well. they have no right to desecrate the mosque with their dirty feet. we won't allow them to do that. a top hamas official in the gaza strip called on all of the palestinians to turn their weapons against the israelis, saying that allah created man only to wage jihad and to plunge knives into the chests of the enemies. we hear a lot of talk about the pursuit of a viable two-state solution. it is not just about israel and its recognizing the palestinians' right to exist. [[page h7363]] it is also about the palestinians and its recognizing israel's right to exist. yet the palestinian authority, by the day, is under more and more influence of an element that will not rest until the other side is wiped off the map. i was disturbed when the secretary of state's spokesperson, john kirby, said: individuals on both sides of this divide are, have been proven capable of, and, in our view, are guilty of acts of terrorism. last month the state department claimed that the temple mount status quo was violated. i was just there a couple of months back. i was at a place called decks restaurant in tiberias. it is right on the sea of galilee. the owner of the restaurant got on the microphone--the place was crowded with locals--and she started preaching about her love of america, about her appreciation of the strength of that bond between the u.s. and israel. as she is saying this, a boat pulls in off the sea of galilee and starts setting off fireworks. as the fireworks start blowing off, they start playing ``god bless america'' over the loud speaker. all the locals stood up and were singing along, and if they didn't know the words, they were lip-syncing it. it was such a proud moment. where else in the world can you go where you will find a restaurant at which the owner will get on the microphone and start talking about her love of america? i value the relationship that we have with our friends, such as israel. we didn't see the israeli prime minister going on international tv trying to embarrass the president of the united states after there was a hospital strike, which the president took responsibility for. it is important that we don't embarrass our allies and that we stand with them in tough times. right now we stand with innocent victims in israel, who are being targeted by terrorist attacks through the incitement of violence by the leadership of the palestinian authority. that is why i am so proud to stand here today with ms. ileana ros- lehtinen for, again, her consistent and strong dedication and leadership and for her determination in ensuring that this body stands united with israel every single day. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. in closing, as you have heard from everyone who has spoken, the recent surge of palestinian violence against israel must stop. it must stop to save innocent lives. it must stop so that negotiations can go forward. it must stop because acts of terrorism are not to be tolerated. any way you look at it, these are terrorist acts, and the only way we can have peace and the only way we can have a two-state solution is if both parties sit opposite each other, with no preconditions, and start negotiating. i do support a two-state solution--a palestinian arab state and an israeli jewish state--living together in peace and harmony; but it is not going to happen if the palestinian leadership, which is bankrupt in more ways than one, refuses to teach its people the right thing, if it refuses to repudiate acts of terror. mahmoud abbas, or abu mazen--the leader of the palestinians--is, i think, on the eighth year of his 4-year term. he is not really legitimate anymore. the more he talks with rhetoric and incitement, the less relevant he becomes. it is really a shame because i do think that the palestinians deserve better and i do think that, ultimately, they deserve their own state; but they will not have their own state if they resort to terror. it is bankrupt, and it is a dead end for them. instead of encouraging these kinds of acts of terror against innocent civilians, the leadership of the palestinians ought to be dismissing it, ought to be condemning it, ought to be taking strong stands against it. we have yet to hear, and that is why this resolution is so important. this resolution sends the signal that palestinian leaders have a responsibility to repudiate this violence and put an end to the horrific campaign of incitement against jews and israelis. everyone who spoke today is saying the same thing. we are saying the same thing because it is clear as night and day what is going on over there. so i urge all of my colleagues to support this measure. the united states will always stand with the people of israel, and the united states will always stand against violence and terrorism wherever it rears its head around the world. i again thank my good friend, ileana ros-lehtinen, for her leadership and mr. deutch for his leadership as well. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. ms. ros-lehtinen. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. i want to thank the chairman of our committee, mr. royce, for his help in bringing this resolution to the floor after the markup in the subcommittee and the full committee. i want to thank mr. engel for his steadfast support of doing everything that is humanly possible to support efforts in getting peace in the middle east and his support for the democratic jewish state of israel. i want to thank mr. deutch, who is my partner on the middle east and north africa subcommittee. he has been a person who understands the many obstacles to peace that the palestinians encounter because of their failed leadership, and the responsibility lies in that leadership. i have had the opportunity to travel to israel with mr. deutch, and i am very thankful for his friendship and for his guidance. i also want to thank mr. poe and mr. zeldin--valued members of our committee on foreign affairs--for their perspectives on how to reach peace, because, when all is said and done, this is what this resolution is all about. we are condemning the anti-israel and anti-semitic incitement to violence by the palestinian authority, but we do so because this is antithetical to the cause of peace, which is what this body is all about and what the united states' foreign policy is based on in the middle east. mr. speaker, i yield back the balance of my time. mr. ellison. mr. speaker, securing a lasting peace between israel and palestine requires a commitment to humanizing the experiences of both peoples. divisive rhetoric dehumanizes people and undermines the prospect of long-term peace. this resolution is divisive. incitement by either party, including palestinian authority leaders, is a serious issue and deserves to be condemned. but when we denounce the palestinians and leave no mention of divisive rhetoric by the israeli government, we do a disservice to palestinians and israelis. just two weeks ago, israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said ``hitler didn't want to exterminate the jews at the time, he wanted to expel the jews.'' he laid the blame for the shoa at the feet of a palestinian grand mufti of jerusalem, haj amin al-husseini. al-husseini was a virulent anti-semite. but prime minister netanyahu's blaming the idea of the holocaust on a palestinian, and by implication palestinians, deserves to be condemned by this body just as palestinian incitement does. i oppose this resolution, not because the palestinians are not inciting, and not because i believe this incitement should not be condemned. i oppose this resolution because any resolution that attacks one side while ignoring the other can only further tension and violence. if congress wants to be considered a legitimate arbiter of peace between israel and palestine we must pursue a balanced approach that calls for an end to incitement on both sides and both leaders to live up to their obligations under the oslo accords. the speaker pro tempore (mr. harris). the question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from florida (ms. ros-lehtinen) that the house suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, h. res. 293, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution, as amended, was agreed to. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",31816

CREC-2015-11-02-pt1-PgH7367,CREC-2015-11-02,114,GLOBAL ANTI-POACHING ACT,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H7367-H7372] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GLOBAL ANTI-POACHING ACT Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2494) to support global anti-poaching efforts, strengthen the capacity of partner countries to counter wildlife trafficking, designate major wildlife trafficking countries, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 2494 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Global Anti-Poaching Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Poaching and the illicit trade in endangered and threatened wildlife are among the most lucrative criminal activities worldwide, worth an estimated $7 to $10 billion annually. (2) Poaching and wildlife trafficking have escalated in scale, sophistication and violence, risking the potential extinction of some of the world's most iconic species. (3) Wildlife poaching and trafficking threaten elephants, rhinoceros, and tigers greatly, but also have devastating impact on a number of other species, including sharks, great apes, and turtles. (4) The high demand for rare wildlife products has driven prices to historically high levels. (5) Much of the demand for wildlife products comes from Asia and is fueled by the perceived medicinal value and social status associated with these products. (6) Reporting indicates that a number of rebel groups and terrorist organizations, including Sudan's Janjaweed militia, the Lord's Resistance Army, the Seleka rebel movement in the Central African Republic, and Somalia's al-Shabaab, either participate in or draw funding from illicit wildlife trafficking networks. (7) Analyses suggest the high demand for illegal wildlife products, combined with weak law enforcement and security measures and corruption and governance failures, has led to the increased involvement of transnational organized crime in wildlife trafficking. (8) The United Nations Security Council has authorized multilateral sanctions against individuals and entities supporting armed groups through the illicit trade in wildlife, in addition to other natural resources, in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic. (9) A National Intelligence Council analysis of wildlife poaching threats found that certain African government officials facilitated the movement of wildlife products, and that these governments' ability to reduce poaching and trafficking was hindered by corruption and weak rule of law. (10) On November 13, 2013, the Secretary of State announced the first reward under the Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program for information leading to the dismantling of the Xaysavang Network, a large wildlife trafficking syndicate that is based in Laos and spans Africa and Asia. SEC. 3. EXPANSION OF WILDLIFE ENFORCEMENT NETWORKS. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) Wildlife enforcement networks are government-led, regionally-focused mechanisms that increase capacity and coordination efforts between law enforcement, environmental agencies, and other entities focused on countering wildlife trafficking of member countries. (2) Currently there are active wildlife enforcement networks in Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Central America. The more mature wildlife enforcement networks, such as the Southeast Asia wildlife enforcement network, have proven effective in dismantling transnational wildlife trafficking networks and bringing to justice those individuals involved in the illegal trade of endangered and threatened species. (3) Efforts are underway to establish additional wildlife enforcement networks in Central Africa, the Horn of Africa, South America, and Central and West Asia, among other regions. (b) Statement of Policy.--The Secretary of State, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and heads of other appropriate agencies should, in an effort to address regional threats to biodiversity and conservation, support strengthening existing wildlife enforcement networks and the establishment of new networks in other appropriate regions. (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that in the process of strengthening and expanding wildlife enforcement networks, the appropriate agencies should-- (1) assess the existing capacity of wildlife enforcement network member countries to gather baseline data that may be used for developing program activities for the wildlife enforcement network; (2) establish a central secretariat within each wildlife enforcement network that will coordinate the operational mechanisms of each such network; (3) establish a focal mechanism in each member country of a wildlife enforcement network, that includes representatives from environmental and wildlife protection agencies, law enforcement agencies, financial intelligence units, customs and border protection agencies, and the judiciary system, that will serve as a conduit to the larger wildlife enforcement network and the central secretariat; (4) strengthen cooperation and the capacity of law enforcement agencies of the wildlife enforcement network; (5) facilitate the sharing of intelligence and relevant case information within the agencies of a wildlife enforcement network; (6) support the cooperation and coordination between different regional wildlife enforcement networks; (7) incorporate and utilize expertise from international bodies and civil society organizations that have appropriate subject matter expertise; (8) eventually create an institutionalized, sustainable, and self-sufficient platform; and (9) recognize that lawful, well regulated hunting can contribute to sustainability and economic development, and that enforcement policies should not discourage or impede this activity. SEC. 4. SUPPORTING THE PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THE WILDLIFE LAW ENFORCEMENT SECTOR. The Secretary of State, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, the Director of the [[Page H7368]] United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and heads of other appropriate agencies, including the National Park Service and the United States Forest Service, should, in an effort to address local and regional threats to biodiversity and conservation and support the rule of law and good governance, promote the professionalization of the wildlife law enforcement sector and professional ranger training in partner countries through support and technical assistance for the following: (1) The creation and adoption of standards for professional ranger training and qualifications, including in relevant international fora and multilateral agreements. (2) Training and accreditation systems based on the standards described in paragraph (1) that produce professionally trained and qualified rangers and promote the overall professionalization of ranger forces, whether through existing United States institutions, such as International Law Enforcement Academies, or through partnerships with national or regional training institutions. (3) Legal reforms, where necessary, to provide rangers with authority to detain and arrest suspects, process crime scenes, present evidence in court, and defend themselves in life threatening situations. (4) The development and institutionalization of reward and promotion systems for rangers based on performance and set competencies. (5) The development and institutionalization of national systems to provide insurance to rangers and their families and compensation for those rangers killed in the line of duty. (6) Cooperation and coordination between local law enforcement tasked with wildlife or park protection and local defense forces, where appropriate, including training opportunities, logistical support, or provision of equipment. SEC. 5. DESIGNATION OF MAJOR WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING COUNTRIES AND AUTHORITY TO WITHHOLD CERTAIN ASSISTANCE. (a) Report.--Not later than September 15 of each year, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce, shall submit to Congress a report that lists each foreign country determined to be a major source of wildlife trafficking products or their derivatives, a major transit point of wildlife trafficking products or their derivatives, or a major consumer of wildlife trafficking products or their derivatives. (b) Special Designation.--In each report required under subsection (a), the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Interior and the Secretary of Commerce, shall-- (1) designate each country listed in the report that has failed demonstrably, during the previous 12-month period, to make substantial efforts to adhere to its obligations under international agreements relating to endangered or threatened species; and (2) include a short justification for each determination made under paragraph (1). (c) Withholding of Assistance.--The Secretary of State may withhold assistance described in subsection (d) with respect to each foreign country that is specially designated under subsection (b). (d) Assistance Described.--The assistance described in this subsection are sections 516, 524, and 541 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2321j, 2344, or 2347), chapter 6 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2348 et seq.), and section 23 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2763). (e) Notification.--The Secretary of State shall notify-- (1) the government of each foreign country that is listed in the report required under subsection (a) that the country has been so listed; and (2) the government of each foreign country that is specially designated under subsection (b) and is subject to the withholding of assistance described in subsection (c). (f) Reporting Cost Offset.--Section 8 of Public Law 107-245 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note) is repealed. (g) Sunset.--This section shall terminate on the date that is 5 years after the date of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 6. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING SECURITY ASSISTANCE TO COUNTER WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING AND POACHING IN AFRICA. It is the sense of Congress that the United States should continue to provide defense articles (not including significant military equipment), defense services, and related training to appropriate security forces of countries of Africa for the purposes of countering wildlife trafficking and poaching. SEC. 7. UPDATES TO THE FISHERMEN'S PROTECTIVE ACT OF 1967. Section 8 of the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 (22 U.S.C. 1978) is amended-- (1) in subsection (a)-- (A) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``, in consultation with the Secretary of State,'' after ``Secretary of Commerce''; (B) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``, in consultation with the Secretary of State,'' before ``finds''; (C) in paragraph (3), by inserting ``in consultation with the Secretary of State,'' after ``, as appropriate,''; (D) by redesignating paragraph (4) as paragraph (5), and by inserting after paragraph (3) the following: ``(4) The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior shall each report to the Congress each certification to the President made by such Secretary under this subsection, within 15 days after making such certification.''; and (2) in subsection (d), by inserting ``in consultation with the Secretary of State,'' after ``as the case may be,''.

[[Page H7369]] SEC. 9. OTHER ACTIONS RELATING TO WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING PROGRAMS. It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of State should dedicate sufficient program resources to-- (1) conduct monitoring and evaluation, with a special emphasis where feasible on impact evaluations, of wildlife trafficking programs consistent with the Department of State's January 2015 Evaluation Policy; (2) publish program information on wildlife trafficking programs on the Department of State's Internet website, ``ForeignAssistance.gov'' in a digital format consistent with the United States commitment to the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI); and (3) develop and implement a learning agenda to improve the performance and impact of wildlife trafficking programs and to share best practices among relevant executive branch agencies. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. {time} 1745 General Leave Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an exchange of letters between myself and the chairmen of the Natural Resources and Judiciary Committees. Mr. Speaker, the very disturbing reality is that some of the world's most majestic animals have become ``blood currency'' for terrorist organizations and rebel groups. Some of the same radical organizations that carry out terror for political purposes get their resources by the sale of rhino horns and ivory through the slaughter of these animals in order to fund their terrorist operations. Poachers are taking advantage of under-equipped and undermanned park rangers. As we watch this play out across the sub-Saharan continent, they are decimating elephant and rhino populations and trading their tusks. In the 1980s, over 1 million African elephants roamed the continent's forests and savannahs. That is not that long ago. Today, there are less than 500,000 left. With this explosion in poaching, at these current rates, in about two decades, they will vanish. The rhino would vanish. In South Africa, home of the one of the largest rhino populations, poachers killed an average of 14 rhinos per year in the 1990s and 2000s. Last year, they killed 1,200--the top year on record. This is bigger than security. This, frankly, is a security issue for the entire planet. As we watch what is developing with these organizations, wildlife trafficking is now the most lucrative criminal activity--certainly, one of the most lucrative--around the world. I saw an estimate that poaching in Africa is worth $10 billion in annual income for these radical organizations. The Foreign Affairs Committee has held several hearings and briefings in which we learned how nefarious groups like al Shabaab, the Janjaweed, and Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army benefit from trafficking in wildlife and trading the ivory for guns. An average-size tusk is worth 25 cases of fresh ammunition in central Africa. Twenty- five cases will enable rebel groups to continue to rampage and terrorize civilian populations. The U.S. has invested a great deal of resources in trying to bring stability to the countries where these armed groups operate: Somalia, Sudan, and the Congo. All of that effort and investment are undermined when these terrorist organizations and rebel groups find these new financial lifelines. We remember the situation with blood diamonds. Well, for the last decade and a half, it has been ivory and rhino horns. Mr. Speaker, to address this crisis, the Global Anti-Poaching Act tackles wildlife trafficking in several ways. This legislation designates those countries that are ignoring wildlife trafficking and allows the Secretary of State to withhold security assistance from the worst offenders. In some wildlife trafficking cases, foreign governments have been found complicit. A ``naming and shaming'' of these countries is the minimum we can do if we are to contend with the poaching explosion. We know from some of our antitrafficking legislation how much pressure this does, in fact, put on foreign governments. Countries in Asia that are driving the demand for wildlife products also come under the spotlight in this bill. In the same tactic of naming and shaming that this legislation establishes, it has been used, as I mentioned, not just with traffickers, but also in drug trafficking cases. It is a way to force other countries to become part of the solution, rather than part of the problem. To make this big business riskier for those who are involved in it, the legislation makes wildlife trafficking an offense under racketeering and money laundering statutes, going after the international networks that are taking profits out of this. It is the terrorist organizations on the ground doing the work, but it is the international criminal syndicates that then move the ivory around the world. We also have to stop that demand for the ivory. The legislation directs that any seized assets from these new penalties go toward the conservation of the very species that were trafficked. So when moneys are obtained from those involved in the pipeline, it can be employed for that purpose. Mr. Speaker, tackling poaching can protect exotic wildlife, increase security, and help Africa's development. One of the fastest growing sectors in Africa is ecotourism. In 2014, the industry contributed $70 billion to the African economy and directly employed 8 million people. These majestic animals drive tourism in Africa. They drive sustainable development there. But if we don't bring the slaughter to an end, there might not be any of these animals to see in a few years. The park rangers on the front lines trying to stop the slaughter at the hands of poachers are outmaneuvered and outgunned. This bipartisan legislation will help even out the fight by pressuring the administration to provide vital security assistance, including vehicles as well as intelligence and surveillance tools, to these park rangers. We know the security and economic consequences if today's poaching rates go on unchecked: terrorist and rebels fund their dangerous activities, and the African economy takes a major hit. The legislation before us today is a chance to change this course and to reverse this course back toward one of sustainable development; back toward one where, in the future, people from around the globe can go to Africa and see these magnificent animals and participate in building the economy through ecotourism in Africa. I reserve the balance of my time. House of Representatives, Committee on the Judiciary. Washington, DC, October 15, 2015. Hon. Ed Royce, Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, Washington, DC.

Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for consulting with the Committee on Foreign Affairs on H.R. 2494, the Global Anti- Poaching Act, and for agreeing to be discharged from further consideration of that bill. I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Natural Resources, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the future. I would support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this legislation. I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 2494 into the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work with your Committee as this measure moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, Edward R. Royce, Chairman. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure. I want to, first of all, thank my friend, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ed Royce, for authoring the Global Anti-Poaching Act. I am very proud to be an original cosponsor. This bill, again, is a good example of our committee working across the aisle to get real results. On average, one elephant is killed every 20 minutes. That is just a shocking statistic. So in the 40 minutes we have to debate this bill, two elephants will be killed. Last year, the toll was 20,000. It is just disgusting. And make no mistake, these animals aren't being killed for sport. No matter how you feel about big game hunting, the real reason elephants and other iconic animals are being wiped out is far more sinister, and it is why this issue deserves the attention of Congress and the administration. Those responsible for poaching are profiting from their crimes by selling ivory or rhinoceros horns or cheetah pelts. Where do these profits go? These profits go to buy weapons for violent, armed militias, to bribe government officials and law enforcement, and to fuel criminal networks. In short, poaching pumps resources into groups that threaten security and stability, groups that want to do harm to innocent people and want to do harm to the United States of America. That is why Chairman Royce and I view wildlife trafficking as a security issue, and that is why we introduced the Global Anti-Poaching Act. Our bill would bring wildlife trafficking under money laundering and racketeering statutes that are already part of our law. It would support the professionalization of wildlife law enforcement units on the ground and allow us to provide them nonlethal assistance. It would strengthen regional Wildlife Enforcement Networks designed to combat poaching, and it would name and shame governments that aren't taking this problem seriously. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to highlight the excellent work of the Wildlife Conservation Society from my hometown, Bronx, New York. The Wildlife Conservation Society runs the Bronx Zoo and many other cultural institutions in New York City. They have been actively fighting poaching and trafficking for many years. They have been on the forefront of the American fight against poaching and trafficking. It is a pleasure to work with them on this and so many other issues. I, of course, have longstanding ties with one of their leaders, John Calvelli, who used to be my chief of staff in Washington--he ran my Washington office--so I know how dedicated this group is. We need to crack down on wildlife trafficking, both to deny resources to dangerous organizations and to protect some of the world's most iconic creatures. People may feel: Well, if I just buy a little ivory doll or I buy something made out of ivory, how can that hurt? After all, it is there. It may be cute. It may be trendy. What is wrong with it? I will tell you what is wrong with it. It funnels and aids and abets terrorism, because these groups that sell the tusks and sell the ivory are, by and large, groups that get the money back and use it to force terror. People who are buying these things are not buying some innocent things; they are buying things that help terrorist organizations. Just like we have the fight with the artifacts that are coming in from Syria that ISIS takes and loots and then sells abroad to help finance their terrorist activities, the same thing is true for ivory and the same reasons are being used: It is being done to funnel this money towards helping sinister groups, many of whom are terrorist organizations. So I urge my colleagues to support this bill. This is a very important bill. I thank my friend and partner, Chairman Royce. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I just want to recognize Mr. Engel's commitment to conservation on this planet and to his work on this legislation as well. I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade. He is an original cosponsor of this bill. Mr. POE of Texas. I thank the chairman for yielding. I also thank the chairman and ranking member for their work on this very important piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, around the world, big game like elephant and rhinos are getting slaughtered. Ivory-seeking poachers have killed 100,000 elephants in 3 years. The black rhino population has dropped 95 percent since the early 20th century. In 2007, there were 12 rhinos killed in South Africa; but in 2013 and 2014, over 1,000 were killed each year. Regarding elephants, this is a photograph of one of the oldest elephants in existence. Satao was his name. He was in his forties. He was killed for his tusks. They were so long, they drug on the ground. That is what is happening to the elephant population in Africa. They are killed not for their meat; they are killed for their tusks. Most of the people doing the poaching are really not the locals who poach for an animal to eat. That is not most of the poaching, although that does occur. Most of those doing the poaching are transnational criminal organizations. [[Page H7371]] The criminal groups come from places like China and Vietnam. China is the number one destination for elephant tusks. Vietnam is the number one world destination for rhino horns. Criminal cartels that are involved in this trafficking don't just traffic wildlife. They traffic drugs, weapons, and people. It is all the same group of criminals that are trafficking. They traffic anything for money. The wildlife trafficking trade has exploded in recent years because the criminals understand that profits they get from trafficking wildlife are bigger than what they get for trafficking drugs. {time} 1800 Also, the chances of getting caught are less and, if caught, the punishment is less. So that is why wildlife trafficking is on the increase. A rhino horn is now worth about $27,000 per pound. That is twice the value of gold and platinum and more than cocaine and diamonds. It should come as no surprise that terrorist groups are involved in this as well. I held a hearing in my subcommittee in February on the connection between wildlife trafficking and terrorist groups. The witnesses testified that terrorists are one of several groups involved in wildlife trafficking. And, of course, they do it all for the money. They use the money, as Mr. Engel said, to buy bullets and guns to cause terror in Africa and other places in the world. Just over the weekend, al Qaeda's Somali affiliate, Al-Shabaab, released photographs of its fighters hunting and killing a giraffe. Here is a photograph of that giraffe that was killed in Africa. It is a recruiting poster for jihad. Al-Shabaab put this on its recruiting poster. This recent video says: Terrorism is in my nation, and we do it for tourism. Therefore, come and help us in jihad. That is a recruiting poster, the killing of wildlife in Africa. Killing of elephants is a main revenue source for the Lord's Resistance Army, led by the infamous Joseph Kony. By going after wildlife traffickers, we are going after transnational criminal organizations and terrorists. But we also must call out, as this legislation does, corrupt government officials that give a wink and a nod for allowing the poaching, in their countries, of rhinos, elephants, and others. This isn't just a wildlife problem. It is a national security problem. This bill will give our law enforcement the authority it needs to be able to go after criminals and terrorists and help foreign governments save rhinos and elephants from extinction. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, if we don't stop wildlife trafficking of rhinos, elephants, and other animals by terrorist groups, for organized criminal activities, the only places our kids and grandkids are going to see rhinos and elephants are at the zoo or in a Disney cartoon. And that is just the way it is. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Again, let me thank Chairman Royce for his leadership on this issue, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), and all of the people that have worked so hard on this. We need to be creative in the way we go after financing for violent groups. If nothing is done, I believe the statistic is that, in 11 years, elephants will be extinct in the wild. Isn't that a tragedy? Who would have thought? So we need to be creative in the way we go after the financing for violent groups. Mr. Poe pointed out some very, very important things about terrorism and criminal activities. So, again, I want to say that, when people buy these things, it is not innocent. They are aiding terrorism, and they are aiding criminality. We need to use every tool at our disposal, so this legislation does that by going after a critical source of funding for criminals and terrorists. At the same time, it will help to preserve some of the world's most imperiled animals. Again, I urge all my colleagues to support this measure. I thank Chairman Royce for his hard work on this and so many other things. This is something that everyone needs to support. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, part of the tragedy of this can be seen in what happened in Garissa National Park in Africa. The jihadists hit that park in order to take those tusks, in order to get that hard currency and trade those tusks for weapons and for bullets, and then used that weaponry to turn on Garissa University. Now, remember, these are jihadists. The one thing that Al-Shabaab has in common with the Janjaweed and with these other jihadi organizations is a hatred--just as Boko Haram has this hatred--a hatred of those who study. So what did they do? What did they do when they had their hands on those weapons? They then went to Garissa University and slaughtered 145 students after slaughtering the elephants in the parks. There is a direct link when jihadi organizations, as Judge Ted Poe shared with you, carried out these attacks to recruit, to show that they have got the power to kill, that they have got the power to exterminate, to annihilate not just these animal species but human beings as well. Mr. Speaker, time is not on our side. Each day of inaction means more animals poached, and the coffers of terrorist organizations and rebels grow full because the criminal syndicates that buy the ivory give them the weapons and give them the money. That has to come to an end. Since the time we started this debate, as Mr. Engel pointed out, two elephants have already been poached, have been slaughtered, because one is killed every 15 minutes in Africa. It is quite possible, as Mr. Engel said and as Mr. Poe alluded, that our children could grow up in a world without rhinoceros, without elephants, and it is no exaggeration. Certainly the forest elephant is going to be wiped out; the black rhino is going to be wiped out. Do we want to live in that kind of a world? Do we want to allow that to happen on our watch? The Global Anti-Poaching Act combats today's unprecedented levels of poaching and wildlife trafficking by holding foreign governments accountable, by adding greater consequences for traffickers in this illicit trade, while also assisting those park rangers on the ground who, frankly, need our help, need the help of our intelligence services, need our satellites and other capabilities, and need a better way in which to defend themselves and those parklands across Africa. Some years ago, myself and another Member of this body authored legislation to help set up these national parks across Africa, the Congo Basin Forest Partnership Act, which Clay Shaw and I authored. But today these terrorist organizations are in the parklands themselves, slaughtering these species. I would like to thank the Members that have been involved in putting this together and, also, some from the other committees that assisted us, like Chairman Goodlatte of the Judiciary Committee and Chairman Bishop of the Natural Resources Committee, for their constructive input and assistance in getting this legislation to the floor. And, of course, I would like, in closing, to recognize, again, Ranking Member Engel and Representatives Poe, Smith, and Bass for their valuable contributions. I urge all my colleagues to seize this opportunity and vote for H.R. 2494 and then help us bring a little pressure to bear to get this bill out of the Senate. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reiterate a point I made during the Foreign Affairs Committee markup of the Global Anti-Poaching Act, H.R. 2494, which is being considered on the House floor today. At the markup in June, I offered a very specific amendment to this bill that would simply ensure that nothing in Section 6 of this Act shall be construed to authorize the use of the United States Armed Forces in combat activities. Since that time, I am happy to see that the Chairman has amended the text of this legislation to reflect my concerns. I think it is important to state, once again, that this bill does not authorize the use of U.S. forces in combat activities as a result of fighting poaching. At markup the Chairman assured me that nothing in this bill could be construed to authorize such a combat activity, and the amended text of this bill does more to ensure that is the case. We all know that poaching is a very serious problem and I believe this bill is a constructive [[Page H7372]] step toward combating that evil. I applaud Chairman Royce for his work on this important legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2494, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H7367-H7372] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GLOBAL ANTI-POACHING ACT Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2494) to support global anti-poaching efforts, strengthen the capacity of partner countries to counter wildlife trafficking, designate major wildlife trafficking countries, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 2494 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Global Anti-Poaching Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Poaching and the illicit trade in endangered and threatened wildlife are among the most lucrative criminal activities worldwide, worth an estimated $7 to $10 billion annually. (2) Poaching and wildlife trafficking have escalated in scale, sophistication and violence, risking the potential extinction of some of the world's most iconic species. (3) Wildlife poaching and trafficking threaten elephants, rhinoceros, and tigers greatly, but also have devastating impact on a number of other species, including sharks, great apes, and turtles. (4) The high demand for rare wildlife products has driven prices to historically high levels. (5) Much of the demand for wildlife products comes from Asia and is fueled by the perceived medicinal value and social status associated with these products. (6) Reporting indicates that a number of rebel groups and terrorist organizations, including Sudan's Janjaweed militia, the Lord's Resistance Army, the Seleka rebel movement in the Central African Republic, and Somalia's al-Shabaab, either participate in or draw funding from illicit wildlife trafficking networks. (7) Analyses suggest the high demand for illegal wildlife products, combined with weak law enforcement and security measures and corruption and governance failures, has led to the increased involvement of transnational organized crime in wildlife trafficking. (8) The United Nations Security Council has authorized multilateral sanctions against individuals and entities supporting armed groups through the illicit trade in wildlife, in addition to other natural resources, in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic. (9) A National Intelligence Council analysis of wildlife poaching threats found that certain African government officials facilitated the movement of wildlife products, and that these governments' ability to reduce poaching and trafficking was hindered by corruption and weak rule of law. (10) On November 13, 2013, the Secretary of State announced the first reward under the Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program for information leading to the dismantling of the Xaysavang Network, a large wildlife trafficking syndicate that is based in Laos and spans Africa and Asia. SEC. 3. EXPANSION OF WILDLIFE ENFORCEMENT NETWORKS. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) Wildlife enforcement networks are government-led, regionally-focused mechanisms that increase capacity and coordination efforts between law enforcement, environmental agencies, and other entities focused on countering wildlife trafficking of member countries. (2) Currently there are active wildlife enforcement networks in Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Central America. The more mature wildlife enforcement networks, such as the Southeast Asia wildlife enforcement network, have proven effective in dismantling transnational wildlife trafficking networks and bringing to justice those individuals involved in the illegal trade of endangered and threatened species. (3) Efforts are underway to establish additional wildlife enforcement networks in Central Africa, the Horn of Africa, South America, and Central and West Asia, among other regions. (b) Statement of Policy.--The Secretary of State, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and heads of other appropriate agencies should, in an effort to address regional threats to biodiversity and conservation, support strengthening existing wildlife enforcement networks and the establishment of new networks in other appropriate regions. (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that in the process of strengthening and expanding wildlife enforcement networks, the appropriate agencies should-- (1) assess the existing capacity of wildlife enforcement network member countries to gather baseline data that may be used for developing program activities for the wildlife enforcement network; (2) establish a central secretariat within each wildlife enforcement network that will coordinate the operational mechanisms of each such network; (3) establish a focal mechanism in each member country of a wildlife enforcement network, that includes representatives from environmental and wildlife protection agencies, law enforcement agencies, financial intelligence units, customs and border protection agencies, and the judiciary system, that will serve as a conduit to the larger wildlife enforcement network and the central secretariat; (4) strengthen cooperation and the capacity of law enforcement agencies of the wildlife enforcement network; (5) facilitate the sharing of intelligence and relevant case information within the agencies of a wildlife enforcement network; (6) support the cooperation and coordination between different regional wildlife enforcement networks; (7) incorporate and utilize expertise from international bodies and civil society organizations that have appropriate subject matter expertise; (8) eventually create an institutionalized, sustainable, and self-sufficient platform; and (9) recognize that lawful, well regulated hunting can contribute to sustainability and economic development, and that enforcement policies should not discourage or impede this activity. SEC. 4. SUPPORTING THE PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THE WILDLIFE LAW ENFORCEMENT SECTOR. The Secretary of State, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, the Director of the [[Page H7368]] United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and heads of other appropriate agencies, including the National Park Service and the United States Forest Service, should, in an effort to address local and regional threats to biodiversity and conservation and support the rule of law and good governance, promote the professionalization of the wildlife law enforcement sector and professional ranger training in partner countries through support and technical assistance for the following: (1) The creation and adoption of standards for professional ranger training and qualifications, including in relevant international fora and multilateral agreements. (2) Training and accreditation systems based on the standards described in paragraph (1) that produce professionally trained and qualified rangers and promote the overall professionalization of ranger forces, whether through existing United States institutions, such as International Law Enforcement Academies, or through partnerships with national or regional training institutions. (3) Legal reforms, where necessary, to provide rangers with authority to detain and arrest suspects, process crime scenes, present evidence in court, and defend themselves in life threatening situations. (4) The development and institutionalization of reward and promotion systems for rangers based on performance and set competencies. (5) The development and institutionalization of national systems to provide insurance to rangers and their families and compensation for those rangers killed in the line of duty. (6) Cooperation and coordination between local law enforcement tasked with wildlife or park protection and local defense forces, where appropriate, including training opportunities, logistical support, or provision of equipment. SEC. 5. DESIGNATION OF MAJOR WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING COUNTRIES AND AUTHORITY TO WITHHOLD CERTAIN ASSISTANCE. (a) Report.--Not later than September 15 of each year, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce, shall submit to Congress a report that lists each foreign country determined to be a major source of wildlife trafficking products or their derivatives, a major transit point of wildlife trafficking products or their derivatives, or a major consumer of wildlife trafficking products or their derivatives. (b) Special Designation.--In each report required under subsection (a), the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Interior and the Secretary of Commerce, shall-- (1) designate each country listed in the report that has failed demonstrably, during the previous 12-month period, to make substantial efforts to adhere to its obligations under international agreements relating to endangered or threatened species; and (2) include a short justification for each determination made under paragraph (1). (c) Withholding of Assistance.--The Secretary of State may withhold assistance described in subsection (d) with respect to each foreign country that is specially designated under subsection (b). (d) Assistance Described.--The assistance described in this subsection are sections 516, 524, and 541 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2321j, 2344, or 2347), chapter 6 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2348 et seq.), and section 23 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2763). (e) Notification.--The Secretary of State shall notify-- (1) the government of each foreign country that is listed in the report required under subsection (a) that the country has been so listed; and (2) the government of each foreign country that is specially designated under subsection (b) and is subject to the withholding of assistance described in subsection (c). (f) Reporting Cost Offset.--Section 8 of Public Law 107-245 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note) is repealed. (g) Sunset.--This section shall terminate on the date that is 5 years after the date of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 6. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING SECURITY ASSISTANCE TO COUNTER WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING AND POACHING IN AFRICA. It is the sense of Congress that the United States should continue to provide defense articles (not including significant military equipment), defense services, and related training to appropriate security forces of countries of Africa for the purposes of countering wildlife trafficking and poaching. SEC. 7. UPDATES TO THE FISHERMEN'S PROTECTIVE ACT OF 1967. Section 8 of the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 (22 U.S.C. 1978) is amended-- (1) in subsection (a)-- (A) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``, in consultation with the Secretary of State,'' after ``Secretary of Commerce''; (B) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``, in consultation with the Secretary of State,'' before ``finds''; (C) in paragraph (3), by inserting ``in consultation with the Secretary of State,'' after ``, as appropriate,''; (D) by redesignating paragraph (4) as paragraph (5), and by inserting after paragraph (3) the following: ``(4) The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior shall each report to the Congress each certification to the President made by such Secretary under this subsection, within 15 days after making such certification.''; and (2) in subsection (d), by inserting ``in consultation with the Secretary of State,'' after ``as the case may be,''.

[[Page H7369]] SEC. 9. OTHER ACTIONS RELATING TO WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING PROGRAMS. It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of State should dedicate sufficient program resources to-- (1) conduct monitoring and evaluation, with a special emphasis where feasible on impact evaluations, of wildlife trafficking programs consistent with the Department of State's January 2015 Evaluation Policy; (2) publish program information on wildlife trafficking programs on the Department of State's Internet website, ``ForeignAssistance.gov'' in a digital format consistent with the United States commitment to the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI); and (3) develop and implement a learning agenda to improve the performance and impact of wildlife trafficking programs and to share best practices among relevant executive branch agencies. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. {time} 1745 General Leave Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an exchange of letters between myself and the chairmen of the Natural Resources and Judiciary Committees. Mr. Speaker, the very disturbing reality is that some of the world's most majestic animals have become ``blood currency'' for terrorist organizations and rebel groups. Some of the same radical organizations that carry out terror for political purposes get their resources by the sale of rhino horns and ivory through the slaughter of these animals in order to fund their terrorist operations. Poachers are taking advantage of under-equipped and undermanned park rangers. As we watch this play out across the sub-Saharan continent, they are decimating elephant and rhino populations and trading their tusks. In the 1980s, over 1 million African elephants roamed the continent's forests and savannahs. That is not that long ago. Today, there are less than 500,000 left. With this explosion in poaching, at these current rates, in about two decades, they will vanish. The rhino would vanish. In South Africa, home of the one of the largest rhino populations, poachers killed an average of 14 rhinos per year in the 1990s and 2000s. Last year, they killed 1,200--the top year on record. This is bigger than security. This, frankly, is a security issue for the entire planet. As we watch what is developing with these organizations, wildlife trafficking is now the most lucrative criminal activity--certainly, one of the most lucrative--around the world. I saw an estimate that poaching in Africa is worth $10 billion in annual income for these radical organizations. The Foreign Affairs Committee has held several hearings and briefings in which we learned how nefarious groups like al Shabaab, the Janjaweed, and Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army benefit from trafficking in wildlife and trading the ivory for guns. An average-size tusk is worth 25 cases of fresh ammunition in central Africa. Twenty- five cases will enable rebel groups to continue to rampage and terrorize civilian populations. The U.S. has invested a great deal of resources in trying to bring stability to the countries where these armed groups operate: Somalia, Sudan, and the Congo. All of that effort and investment are undermined when these terrorist organizations and rebel groups find these new financial lifelines. We remember the situation with blood diamonds. Well, for the last decade and a half, it has been ivory and rhino horns. Mr. Speaker, to address this crisis, the Global Anti-Poaching Act tackles wildlife trafficking in several ways. This legislation designates those countries that are ignoring wildlife trafficking and allows the Secretary of State to withhold security assistance from the worst offenders. In some wildlife trafficking cases, foreign governments have been found complicit. A ``naming and shaming'' of these countries is the minimum we can do if we are to contend with the poaching explosion. We know from some of our antitrafficking legislation how much pressure this does, in fact, put on foreign governments. Countries in Asia that are driving the demand for wildlife products also come under the spotlight in this bill. In the same tactic of naming and shaming that this legislation establishes, it has been used, as I mentioned, not just with traffickers, but also in drug trafficking cases. It is a way to force other countries to become part of the solution, rather than part of the problem. To make this big business riskier for those who are involved in it, the legislation makes wildlife trafficking an offense under racketeering and money laundering statutes, going after the international networks that are taking profits out of this. It is the terrorist organizations on the ground doing the work, but it is the international criminal syndicates that then move the ivory around the world. We also have to stop that demand for the ivory. The legislation directs that any seized assets from these new penalties go toward the conservation of the very species that were trafficked. So when moneys are obtained from those involved in the pipeline, it can be employed for that purpose. Mr. Speaker, tackling poaching can protect exotic wildlife, increase security, and help Africa's development. One of the fastest growing sectors in Africa is ecotourism. In 2014, the industry contributed $70 billion to the African economy and directly employed 8 million people. These majestic animals drive tourism in Africa. They drive sustainable development there. But if we don't bring the slaughter to an end, there might not be any of these animals to see in a few years. The park rangers on the front lines trying to stop the slaughter at the hands of poachers are outmaneuvered and outgunned. This bipartisan legislation will help even out the fight by pressuring the administration to provide vital security assistance, including vehicles as well as intelligence and surveillance tools, to these park rangers. We know the security and economic consequences if today's poaching rates go on unchecked: terrorist and rebels fund their dangerous activities, and the African economy takes a major hit. The legislation before us today is a chance to change this course and to reverse this course back toward one of sustainable development; back toward one where, in the future, people from around the globe can go to Africa and see these magnificent animals and participate in building the economy through ecotourism in Africa.

I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work with your Committee as this measure moves through the legislative process. Sincerely, Edward R. Royce, Chairman. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure. I want to, first of all, thank my friend, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ed Royce, for authoring the Global Anti-Poaching Act. I am very proud to be an original cosponsor. This bill, again, is a good example of our committee working across the aisle to get real results. On average, one elephant is killed every 20 minutes. That is just a shocking statistic. So in the 40 minutes we have to debate this bill, two elephants will be killed. Last year, the toll was 20,000. It is just disgusting. And make no mistake, these animals aren't being killed for sport. No matter how you feel about big game hunting, the real reason elephants and other iconic animals are being wiped out is far more sinister, and it is why this issue deserves the attention of Congress and the administration. Those responsible for poaching are profiting from their crimes by selling ivory or rhinoceros horns or cheetah pelts. Where do these profits go? These profits go to buy weapons for violent, armed militias, to bribe government officials and law enforcement, and to fuel criminal networks. In short, poaching pumps resources into groups that threaten security and stability, groups that want to do harm to innocent people and want to do harm to the United States of America. That is why Chairman Royce and I view wildlife trafficking as a security issue, and that is why we introduced the Global Anti-Poaching Act. Our bill would bring wildlife trafficking under money laundering and racketeering statutes that are already part of our law. It would support the professionalization of wildlife law enforcement units on the ground and allow us to provide them nonlethal assistance. It would strengthen regional Wildlife Enforcement Networks designed to combat poaching, and it would name and shame governments that aren't taking this problem seriously. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to highlight the excellent work of the Wildlife Conservation Society from my hometown, Bronx, New York. The Wildlife Conservation Society runs the Bronx Zoo and many other cultural institutions in New York City. They have been actively fighting poaching and trafficking for many years. They have been on the forefront of the American fight against poaching and trafficking. It is a pleasure to work with them on this and so many other issues. I, of course, have longstanding ties with one of their leaders, John Calvelli, who used to be my chief of staff in Washington--he ran my Washington office--so I know how dedicated this group is. We need to crack down on wildlife trafficking, both to deny resources to dangerous organizations and to protect some of the world's most iconic creatures. People may feel: Well, if I just buy a little ivory doll or I buy something made out of ivory, how can that hurt? After all, it is there. It may be cute. It may be trendy. What is wrong with it? I will tell you what is wrong with it. It funnels and aids and abets terrorism, because these groups that sell the tusks and sell the ivory are, by and large, groups that get the money back and use it to force terror. People who are buying these things are not buying some innocent things; they are buying things that help terrorist organizations. Just like we have the fight with the artifacts that are coming in from Syria that ISIS takes and loots and then sells abroad to help finance their terrorist activities, the same thing is true for ivory and the same reasons are being used: It is being done to funnel this money towards helping sinister groups, many of whom are terrorist organizations. So I urge my colleagues to support this bill. This is a very important bill. I thank my friend and partner, Chairman Royce. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I just want to recognize Mr. Engel's commitment to conservation on this planet and to his work on this legislation as well. I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade. He is an original cosponsor of this bill. Mr. POE of Texas. I thank the chairman for yielding. I also thank the chairman and ranking member for their work on this very important piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, around the world, big game like elephant and rhinos are getting slaughtered. Ivory-seeking poachers have killed 100,000 elephants in 3 years. The black rhino population has dropped 95 percent since the early 20th century. In 2007, there were 12 rhinos killed in South Africa; but in 2013 and 2014, over 1,000 were killed each year. Regarding elephants, this is a photograph of one of the oldest elephants in existence. Satao was his name. He was in his forties. He was killed for his tusks. They were so long, they drug on the ground. That is what is happening to the elephant population in Africa. They are killed not for their meat; they are killed for their tusks. Most of the people doing the poaching are really not the locals who poach for an animal to eat. That is not most of the poaching, although that does occur. Most of those doing the poaching are transnational criminal organizations. [[Page H7371]] The criminal groups come from places like China and Vietnam. China is the number one destination for elephant tusks. Vietnam is the number one world destination for rhino horns. Criminal cartels that are involved in this trafficking don't just traffic wildlife. They traffic drugs, weapons, and people. It is all the same group of criminals that are trafficking. They traffic anything for money. The wildlife trafficking trade has exploded in recent years because the criminals understand that profits they get from trafficking wildlife are bigger than what they get for trafficking drugs. {time} 1800 Also, the chances of getting caught are less and, if caught, the punishment is less. So that is why wildlife trafficking is on the increase. A rhino horn is now worth about $27,000 per pound. That is twice the value of gold and platinum and more than cocaine and diamonds. It should come as no surprise that terrorist groups are involved in this as well. I held a hearing in my subcommittee in February on the connection between wildlife trafficking and terrorist groups. The witnesses testified that terrorists are one of several groups involved in wildlife trafficking. And, of course, they do it all for the money. They use the money, as Mr. Engel said, to buy bullets and guns to cause terror in Africa and other places in the world. Just over the weekend, al Qaeda's Somali affiliate, Al-Shabaab, released photographs of its fighters hunting and killing a giraffe. Here is a photograph of that giraffe that was killed in Africa. It is a recruiting poster for jihad. Al-Shabaab put this on its recruiting poster. This recent video says: Terrorism is in my nation, and we do it for tourism. Therefore, come and help us in jihad. That is a recruiting poster, the killing of wildlife in Africa. Killing of elephants is a main revenue source for the Lord's Resistance Army, led by the infamous Joseph Kony. By going after wildlife traffickers, we are going after transnational criminal organizations and terrorists. But we also must call out, as this legislation does, corrupt government officials that give a wink and a nod for allowing the poaching, in their countries, of rhinos, elephants, and others. This isn't just a wildlife problem. It is a national security problem. This bill will give our law enforcement the authority it needs to be able to go after criminals and terrorists and help foreign governments save rhinos and elephants from extinction. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, if we don't stop wildlife trafficking of rhinos, elephants, and other animals by terrorist groups, for organized criminal activities, the only places our kids and grandkids are going to see rhinos and elephants are at the zoo or in a Disney cartoon. And that is just the way it is. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Again, let me thank Chairman Royce for his leadership on this issue, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), and all of the people that have worked so hard on this. We need to be creative in the way we go after financing for violent groups. If nothing is done, I believe the statistic is that, in 11 years, elephants will be extinct in the wild. Isn't that a tragedy? Who would have thought? So we need to be creative in the way we go after the financing for violent groups. Mr. Poe pointed out some very, very important things about terrorism and criminal activities. So, again, I want to say that, when people buy these things, it is not innocent. They are aiding terrorism, and they are aiding criminality. We need to use every tool at our disposal, so this legislation does that by going after a critical source of funding for criminals and terrorists. At the same time, it will help to preserve some of the world's most imperiled animals. Again, I urge all my colleagues to support this measure. I thank Chairman Royce for his hard work on this and so many other things. This is something that everyone needs to support. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, part of the tragedy of this can be seen in what happened in Garissa National Park in Africa. The jihadists hit that park in order to take those tusks, in order to get that hard currency and trade those tusks for weapons and for bullets, and then used that weaponry to turn on Garissa University. Now, remember, these are jihadists. The one thing that Al-Shabaab has in common with the Janjaweed and with these other jihadi organizations is a hatred--just as Boko Haram has this hatred--a hatred of those who study. So what did they do? What did they do when they had their hands on those weapons? They then went to Garissa University and slaughtered 145 students after slaughtering the elephants in the parks. There is a direct link when jihadi organizations, as Judge Ted Poe shared with you, carried out these attacks to recruit, to show that they have got the power to kill, that they have got the power to exterminate, to annihilate not just these animal species but human beings as well. Mr. Speaker, time is not on our side. Each day of inaction means more animals poached, and the coffers of terrorist organizations and rebels grow full because the criminal syndicates that buy the ivory give them the weapons and give them the money. That has to come to an end. Since the time we started this debate, as Mr. Engel pointed out, two elephants have already been poached, have been slaughtered, because one is killed every 15 minutes in Africa. It is quite possible, as Mr. Engel said and as Mr. Poe alluded, that our children could grow up in a world without rhinoceros, without elephants, and it is no exaggeration. Certainly the forest elephant is going to be wiped out; the black rhino is going to be wiped out. Do we want to live in that kind of a world? Do we want to allow that to happen on our watch? The Global Anti-Poaching Act combats today's unprecedented levels of poaching and wildlife trafficking by holding foreign governments accountable, by adding greater consequences for traffickers in this illicit trade, while also assisting those park rangers on the ground who, frankly, need our help, need the help of our intelligence services, need our satellites and other capabilities, and need a better way in which to defend themselves and those parklands across Africa. Some years ago, myself and another Member of this body authored legislation to help set up these national parks across Africa, the Congo Basin Forest Partnership Act, which Clay Shaw and I authored. But today these terrorist organizations are in the parklands themselves, slaughtering these species. I would like to thank the Members that have been involved in putting this together and, also, some from the other committees that assisted us, like Chairman Goodlatte of the Judiciary Committee and Chairman Bishop of the Natural Resources Committee, for their constructive input and assistance in getting this legislation to the floor. And, of course, I would like, in closing, to recognize, again, Ranking Member Engel and Representatives Poe, Smith, and Bass for their valuable contributions. I urge all my colleagues to seize this opportunity and vote for H.R. 2494 and then help us bring a little pressure to bear to get this bill out of the Senate. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reiterate a point I made during the Foreign Affairs Committee markup of the Global Anti-Poaching Act, H.R. 2494, which is being considered on the House floor today. At the markup in June, I offered a very specific amendment to this bill that would simply ensure that nothing in Section 6 of this Act shall be construed to authorize the use of the United States Armed Forces in combat activities. Since that time, I am happy to see that the Chairman has amended the text of this legislation to reflect my concerns. I think it is important to state, once again, that this bill does not authorize the use of U.S. forces in combat activities as a result of fighting poaching. At markup the Chairman assured me that nothing in this bill could be construed to authorize such a combat activity, and the amended text of this bill does more to ensure that is the case. We all know that poaching is a very serious problem and I believe this bill is a constructive [[Page H7372]] step toward combating that evil. I applaud Chairman Royce for his work on this important legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2494, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H7367-H7372] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] GLOBAL ANTI-POACHING ACT Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2494) to support global anti-poaching efforts, strengthen the capacity of partner countries to counter wildlife trafficking, designate major wildlife trafficking countries, and for other purposes, as amended. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The text of the bill is as follows: H.R. 2494 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Global Anti-Poaching Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Poaching and the illicit trade in endangered and threatened wildlife are among the most lucrative criminal activities worldwide, worth an estimated $7 to $10 billion annually. (2) Poaching and wildlife trafficking have escalated in scale, sophistication and violence, risking the potential extinction of some of the world's most iconic species. (3) Wildlife poaching and trafficking threaten elephants, rhinoceros, and tigers greatly, but also have devastating impact on a number of other species, including sharks, great apes, and turtles. (4) The high demand for rare wildlife products has driven prices to historically high levels. (5) Much of the demand for wildlife products comes from Asia and is fueled by the perceived medicinal value and social status associated with these products. (6) Reporting indicates that a number of rebel groups and terrorist organizations, including Sudan's Janjaweed militia, the Lord's Resistance Army, the Seleka rebel movement in the Central African Republic, and Somalia's al-Shabaab, either participate in or draw funding from illicit wildlife trafficking networks. (7) Analyses suggest the high demand for illegal wildlife products, combined with weak law enforcement and security measures and corruption and governance failures, has led to the increased involvement of transnational organized crime in wildlife trafficking. (8) The United Nations Security Council has authorized multilateral sanctions against individuals and entities supporting armed groups through the illicit trade in wildlife, in addition to other natural resources, in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic. (9) A National Intelligence Council analysis of wildlife poaching threats found that certain African government officials facilitated the movement of wildlife products, and that these governments' ability to reduce poaching and trafficking was hindered by corruption and weak rule of law. (10) On November 13, 2013, the Secretary of State announced the first reward under the Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program for information leading to the dismantling of the Xaysavang Network, a large wildlife trafficking syndicate that is based in Laos and spans Africa and Asia. SEC. 3. EXPANSION OF WILDLIFE ENFORCEMENT NETWORKS. (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following: (1) Wildlife enforcement networks are government-led, regionally-focused mechanisms that increase capacity and coordination efforts between law enforcement, environmental agencies, and other entities focused on countering wildlife trafficking of member countries. (2) Currently there are active wildlife enforcement networks in Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Central America. The more mature wildlife enforcement networks, such as the Southeast Asia wildlife enforcement network, have proven effective in dismantling transnational wildlife trafficking networks and bringing to justice those individuals involved in the illegal trade of endangered and threatened species. (3) Efforts are underway to establish additional wildlife enforcement networks in Central Africa, the Horn of Africa, South America, and Central and West Asia, among other regions. (b) Statement of Policy.--The Secretary of State, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and heads of other appropriate agencies should, in an effort to address regional threats to biodiversity and conservation, support strengthening existing wildlife enforcement networks and the establishment of new networks in other appropriate regions. (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that in the process of strengthening and expanding wildlife enforcement networks, the appropriate agencies should-- (1) assess the existing capacity of wildlife enforcement network member countries to gather baseline data that may be used for developing program activities for the wildlife enforcement network; (2) establish a central secretariat within each wildlife enforcement network that will coordinate the operational mechanisms of each such network; (3) establish a focal mechanism in each member country of a wildlife enforcement network, that includes representatives from environmental and wildlife protection agencies, law enforcement agencies, financial intelligence units, customs and border protection agencies, and the judiciary system, that will serve as a conduit to the larger wildlife enforcement network and the central secretariat; (4) strengthen cooperation and the capacity of law enforcement agencies of the wildlife enforcement network; (5) facilitate the sharing of intelligence and relevant case information within the agencies of a wildlife enforcement network; (6) support the cooperation and coordination between different regional wildlife enforcement networks; (7) incorporate and utilize expertise from international bodies and civil society organizations that have appropriate subject matter expertise; (8) eventually create an institutionalized, sustainable, and self-sufficient platform; and (9) recognize that lawful, well regulated hunting can contribute to sustainability and economic development, and that enforcement policies should not discourage or impede this activity. SEC. 4. SUPPORTING THE PROFESSIONALIZATION OF THE WILDLIFE LAW ENFORCEMENT SECTOR. The Secretary of State, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, the Director of the [[Page H7368]] United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and heads of other appropriate agencies, including the National Park Service and the United States Forest Service, should, in an effort to address local and regional threats to biodiversity and conservation and support the rule of law and good governance, promote the professionalization of the wildlife law enforcement sector and professional ranger training in partner countries through support and technical assistance for the following: (1) The creation and adoption of standards for professional ranger training and qualifications, including in relevant international fora and multilateral agreements. (2) Training and accreditation systems based on the standards described in paragraph (1) that produce professionally trained and qualified rangers and promote the overall professionalization of ranger forces, whether through existing United States institutions, such as International Law Enforcement Academies, or through partnerships with national or regional training institutions. (3) Legal reforms, where necessary, to provide rangers with authority to detain and arrest suspects, process crime scenes, present evidence in court, and defend themselves in life threatening situations. (4) The development and institutionalization of reward and promotion systems for rangers based on performance and set competencies. (5) The development and institutionalization of national systems to provide insurance to rangers and their families and compensation for those rangers killed in the line of duty. (6) Cooperation and coordination between local law enforcement tasked with wildlife or park protection and local defense forces, where appropriate, including training opportunities, logistical support, or provision of equipment. SEC. 5. DESIGNATION OF MAJOR WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING COUNTRIES AND AUTHORITY TO WITHHOLD CERTAIN ASSISTANCE. (a) Report.--Not later than September 15 of each year, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce, shall submit to Congress a report that lists each foreign country determined to be a major source of wildlife trafficking products or their derivatives, a major transit point of wildlife trafficking products or their derivatives, or a major consumer of wildlife trafficking products or their derivatives. (b) Special Designation.--In each report required under subsection (a), the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Interior and the Secretary of Commerce, shall-- (1) designate each country listed in the report that has failed demonstrably, during the previous 12-month period, to make substantial efforts to adhere to its obligations under international agreements relating to endangered or threatened species; and (2) include a short justification for each determination made under paragraph (1). (c) Withholding of Assistance.--The Secretary of State may withhold assistance described in subsection (d) with respect to each foreign country that is specially designated under subsection (b). (d) Assistance Described.--The assistance described in this subsection are sections 516, 524, and 541 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2321j, 2344, or 2347), chapter 6 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2348 et seq.), and section 23 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2763). (e) Notification.--The Secretary of State shall notify-- (1) the government of each foreign country that is listed in the report required under subsection (a) that the country has been so listed; and (2) the government of each foreign country that is specially designated under subsection (b) and is subject to the withholding of assistance described in subsection (c). (f) Reporting Cost Offset.--Section 8 of Public Law 107-245 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note) is repealed. (g) Sunset.--This section shall terminate on the date that is 5 years after the date of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 6. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING SECURITY ASSISTANCE TO COUNTER WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING AND POACHING IN AFRICA. It is the sense of Congress that the United States should continue to provide defense articles (not including significant military equipment), defense services, and related training to appropriate security forces of countries of Africa for the purposes of countering wildlife trafficking and poaching. SEC. 7. UPDATES TO THE FISHERMEN'S PROTECTIVE ACT OF 1967. Section 8 of the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 (22 U.S.C. 1978) is amended-- (1) in subsection (a)-- (A) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``, in consultation with the Secretary of State,'' after ``Secretary of Commerce''; (B) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``, in consultation with the Secretary of State,'' before ``finds''; (C) in paragraph (3), by inserting ``in consultation with the Secretary of State,'' after ``, as appropriate,''; (D) by redesignating paragraph (4) as paragraph (5), and by inserting after paragraph (3) the following: ``(4) The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Interior shall each report to the Congress each certification to the President made by such Secretary under this subsection, within 15 days after making such certification.''; and (2) in subsection (d), by inserting ``in consultation with the Secretary of State,'' after ``as the case may be,''. SEC. 8. WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING VIOLATIONS AS PREDICATE OFFENSES UNDER RACKETEERING AND MONEY LAUNDERING STATUTES.

[[Page H7369]] SEC. 9. OTHER ACTIONS RELATING TO WILDLIFE TRAFFICKING PROGRAMS. It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of State should dedicate sufficient program resources to-- (1) conduct monitoring and evaluation, with a special emphasis where feasible on impact evaluations, of wildlife trafficking programs consistent with the Department of State's January 2015 Evaluation Policy; (2) publish program information on wildlife trafficking programs on the Department of State's Internet website, ``ForeignAssistance.gov'' in a digital format consistent with the United States commitment to the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI); and (3) develop and implement a learning agenda to improve the performance and impact of wildlife trafficking programs and to share best practices among relevant executive branch agencies. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. {time} 1745 General Leave Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an exchange of letters between myself and the chairmen of the Natural Resources and Judiciary Committees. Mr. Speaker, the very disturbing reality is that some of the world's most majestic animals have become ``blood currency'' for terrorist organizations and rebel groups. Some of the same radical organizations that carry out terror for political purposes get their resources by the sale of rhino horns and ivory through the slaughter of these animals in order to fund their terrorist operations. Poachers are taking advantage of under-equipped and undermanned park rangers. As we watch this play out across the sub-Saharan continent, they are decimating elephant and rhino populations and trading their tusks. In the 1980s, over 1 million African elephants roamed the continent's forests and savannahs. That is not that long ago. Today, there are less than 500,000 left. With this explosion in poaching, at these current rates, in about two decades, they will vanish. The rhino would vanish. In South Africa, home of the one of the largest rhino populations, poachers killed an average of 14 rhinos per year in the 1990s and 2000s. Last year, they killed 1,200--the top year on record. This is bigger than security. This, frankly, is a security issue for the entire planet. As we watch what is developing with these organizations, wildlife trafficking is now the most lucrative criminal activity--certainly, one of the most lucrative--around the world. I saw an estimate that poaching in Africa is worth $10 billion in annual income for these radical organizations. The Foreign Affairs Committee has held several hearings and briefings in which we learned how nefarious groups like al Shabaab, the Janjaweed, and Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army benefit from trafficking in wildlife and trading the ivory for guns. An average-size tusk is worth 25 cases of fresh ammunition in central Africa. Twenty- five cases will enable rebel groups to continue to rampage and terrorize civilian populations. The U.S. has invested a great deal of resources in trying to bring stability to the countries where these armed groups operate: Somalia, Sudan, and the Congo. All of that effort and investment are undermined when these terrorist organizations and rebel groups find these new financial lifelines. We remember the situation with blood diamonds. Well, for the last decade and a half, it has been ivory and rhino horns. Mr. Speaker, to address this crisis, the Global Anti-Poaching Act tackles wildlife trafficking in several ways. This legislation designates those countries that are ignoring wildlife trafficking and allows the Secretary of State to withhold security assistance from the worst offenders. In some wildlife trafficking cases, foreign governments have been found complicit. A ``naming and shaming'' of these countries is the minimum we can do if we are to contend with the poaching explosion. We know from some of our antitrafficking legislation how much pressure this does, in fact, put on foreign governments. Countries in Asia that are driving the demand for wildlife products also come under the spotlight in this bill. In the same tactic of naming and shaming that this legislation establishes, it has been used, as I mentioned, not just with traffickers, but also in drug trafficking cases. It is a way to force other countries to become part of the solution, rather than part of the problem. To make this big business riskier for those who are involved in it, the legislation makes wildlife trafficking an offense under racketeering and money laundering statutes, going after the international networks that are taking profits out of this. It is the terrorist organizations on the ground doing the work, but it is the international criminal syndicates that then move the ivory around the world. We also have to stop that demand for the ivory. The legislation directs that any seized assets from these new penalties go toward the conservation of the very species that were trafficked. So when moneys are obtained from those involved in the pipeline, it can be employed for that purpose. Mr. Speaker, tackling poaching can protect exotic wildlife, increase security, and help Africa's development. One of the fastest growing sectors in Africa is ecotourism. In 2014, the industry contributed $70 billion to the African economy and directly employed 8 million people. These majestic animals drive tourism in Africa. They drive sustainable development there. But if we don't bring the slaughter to an end, there might not be any of these animals to see in a few years. The park rangers on the front lines trying to stop the slaughter at the hands of poachers are outmaneuvered and outgunned. This bipartisan legislation will help even out the fight by pressuring the administration to provide vital security assistance, including vehicles as well as intelligence and surveillance tools, to these park rangers. We know the security and economic consequences if today's poaching rates go on unchecked: terrorist and rebels fund their dangerous activities, and the African economy takes a major hit. The legislation before us today is a chance to change this course and to reverse this course back toward one of sustainable development; back toward one where, in the future, people from around the globe can go to Africa and see these magnificent animals and participate in building the economy through ecotourism in Africa.

Royce, Chairman. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure. I want to, first of all, thank my friend, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ed Royce, for authoring the Global Anti-Poaching Act. I am very proud to be an original cosponsor. This bill, again, is a good example of our committee working across the aisle to get real results. On average, one elephant is killed every 20 minutes. That is just a shocking statistic. So in the 40 minutes we have to debate this bill, two elephants will be killed. Last year, the toll was 20,000. It is just disgusting. And make no mistake, these animals aren't being killed for sport. No matter how you feel about big game hunting, the real reason elephants and other iconic animals are being wiped out is far more sinister, and it is why this issue deserves the attention of Congress and the administration. Those responsible for poaching are profiting from their crimes by selling ivory or rhinoceros horns or cheetah pelts. Where do these profits go? These profits go to buy weapons for violent, armed militias, to bribe government officials and law enforcement, and to fuel criminal networks. In short, poaching pumps resources into groups that threaten security and stability, groups that want to do harm to innocent people and want to do harm to the United States of America. That is why Chairman Royce and I view wildlife trafficking as a security issue, and that is why we introduced the Global Anti-Poaching Act. Our bill would bring wildlife trafficking under money laundering and racketeering statutes that are already part of our law. It would support the professionalization of wildlife law enforcement units on the ground and allow us to provide them nonlethal assistance. It would strengthen regional Wildlife Enforcement Networks designed to combat poaching, and it would name and shame governments that aren't taking this problem seriously. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to highlight the excellent work of the Wildlife Conservation Society from my hometown, Bronx, New York. The Wildlife Conservation Society runs the Bronx Zoo and many other cultural institutions in New York City. They have been actively fighting poaching and trafficking for many years. They have been on the forefront of the American fight against poaching and trafficking. It is a pleasure to work with them on this and so many other issues. I, of course, have longstanding ties with one of their leaders, John Calvelli, who used to be my chief of staff in Washington--he ran my Washington office--so I know how dedicated this group is. We need to crack down on wildlife trafficking, both to deny resources to dangerous organizations and to protect some of the world's most iconic creatures. People may feel: Well, if I just buy a little ivory doll or I buy something made out of ivory, how can that hurt? After all, it is there. It may be cute. It may be trendy. What is wrong with it? I will tell you what is wrong with it. It funnels and aids and abets terrorism, because these groups that sell the tusks and sell the ivory are, by and large, groups that get the money back and use it to force terror. People who are buying these things are not buying some innocent things; they are buying things that help terrorist organizations. Just like we have the fight with the artifacts that are coming in from Syria that ISIS takes and loots and then sells abroad to help finance their terrorist activities, the same thing is true for ivory and the same reasons are being used: It is being done to funnel this money towards helping sinister groups, many of whom are terrorist organizations. So I urge my colleagues to support this bill. This is a very important bill. I thank my friend and partner, Chairman Royce. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I just want to recognize Mr. Engel's commitment to conservation on this planet and to his work on this legislation as well. I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade. He is an original cosponsor of this bill. Mr. POE of Texas. I thank the chairman for yielding. I also thank the chairman and ranking member for their work on this very important piece of legislation. Mr. Speaker, around the world, big game like elephant and rhinos are getting slaughtered. Ivory-seeking poachers have killed 100,000 elephants in 3 years. The black rhino population has dropped 95 percent since the early 20th century. In 2007, there were 12 rhinos killed in South Africa; but in 2013 and 2014, over 1,000 were killed each year. Regarding elephants, this is a photograph of one of the oldest elephants in existence. Satao was his name. He was in his forties. He was killed for his tusks. They were so long, they drug on the ground. That is what is happening to the elephant population in Africa. They are killed not for their meat; they are killed for their tusks. Most of the people doing the poaching are really not the locals who poach for an animal to eat. That is not most of the poaching, although that does occur. Most of those doing the poaching are transnational criminal organizations. [[Page H7371]] The criminal groups come from places like China and Vietnam. China is the number one destination for elephant tusks. Vietnam is the number one world destination for rhino horns. Criminal cartels that are involved in this trafficking don't just traffic wildlife. They traffic drugs, weapons, and people. It is all the same group of criminals that are trafficking. They traffic anything for money. The wildlife trafficking trade has exploded in recent years because the criminals understand that profits they get from trafficking wildlife are bigger than what they get for trafficking drugs. {time} 1800 Also, the chances of getting caught are less and, if caught, the punishment is less. So that is why wildlife trafficking is on the increase. A rhino horn is now worth about $27,000 per pound. That is twice the value of gold and platinum and more than cocaine and diamonds. It should come as no surprise that terrorist groups are involved in this as well. I held a hearing in my subcommittee in February on the connection between wildlife trafficking and terrorist groups. The witnesses testified that terrorists are one of several groups involved in wildlife trafficking. And, of course, they do it all for the money. They use the money, as Mr. Engel said, to buy bullets and guns to cause terror in Africa and other places in the world. Just over the weekend, al Qaeda's Somali affiliate, Al-Shabaab, released photographs of its fighters hunting and killing a giraffe. Here is a photograph of that giraffe that was killed in Africa. It is a recruiting poster for jihad. Al-Shabaab put this on its recruiting poster. This recent video says: Terrorism is in my nation, and we do it for tourism. Therefore, come and help us in jihad. That is a recruiting poster, the killing of wildlife in Africa. Killing of elephants is a main revenue source for the Lord's Resistance Army, led by the infamous Joseph Kony. By going after wildlife traffickers, we are going after transnational criminal organizations and terrorists. But we also must call out, as this legislation does, corrupt government officials that give a wink and a nod for allowing the poaching, in their countries, of rhinos, elephants, and others. This isn't just a wildlife problem. It is a national security problem. This bill will give our law enforcement the authority it needs to be able to go after criminals and terrorists and help foreign governments save rhinos and elephants from extinction. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, if we don't stop wildlife trafficking of rhinos, elephants, and other animals by terrorist groups, for organized criminal activities, the only places our kids and grandkids are going to see rhinos and elephants are at the zoo or in a Disney cartoon. And that is just the way it is. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Again, let me thank Chairman Royce for his leadership on this issue, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), and all of the people that have worked so hard on this. We need to be creative in the way we go after financing for violent groups. If nothing is done, I believe the statistic is that, in 11 years, elephants will be extinct in the wild. Isn't that a tragedy? Who would have thought? So we need to be creative in the way we go after the financing for violent groups. Mr. Poe pointed out some very, very important things about terrorism and criminal activities. So, again, I want to say that, when people buy these things, it is not innocent. They are aiding terrorism, and they are aiding criminality. We need to use every tool at our disposal, so this legislation does that by going after a critical source of funding for criminals and terrorists. At the same time, it will help to preserve some of the world's most imperiled animals. Again, I urge all my colleagues to support this measure. I thank Chairman Royce for his hard work on this and so many other things. This is something that everyone needs to support. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, part of the tragedy of this can be seen in what happened in Garissa National Park in Africa. The jihadists hit that park in order to take those tusks, in order to get that hard currency and trade those tusks for weapons and for bullets, and then used that weaponry to turn on Garissa University. Now, remember, these are jihadists. The one thing that Al-Shabaab has in common with the Janjaweed and with these other jihadi organizations is a hatred--just as Boko Haram has this hatred--a hatred of those who study. So what did they do? What did they do when they had their hands on those weapons? They then went to Garissa University and slaughtered 145 students after slaughtering the elephants in the parks. There is a direct link when jihadi organizations, as Judge Ted Poe shared with you, carried out these attacks to recruit, to show that they have got the power to kill, that they have got the power to exterminate, to annihilate not just these animal species but human beings as well. Mr. Speaker, time is not on our side. Each day of inaction means more animals poached, and the coffers of terrorist organizations and rebels grow full because the criminal syndicates that buy the ivory give them the weapons and give them the money. That has to come to an end. Since the time we started this debate, as Mr. Engel pointed out, two elephants have already been poached, have been slaughtered, because one is killed every 15 minutes in Africa. It is quite possible, as Mr. Engel said and as Mr. Poe alluded, that our children could grow up in a world without rhinoceros, without elephants, and it is no exaggeration. Certainly the forest elephant is going to be wiped out; the black rhino is going to be wiped out. Do we want to live in that kind of a world? Do we want to allow that to happen on our watch? The Global Anti-Poaching Act combats today's unprecedented levels of poaching and wildlife trafficking by holding foreign governments accountable, by adding greater consequences for traffickers in this illicit trade, while also assisting those park rangers on the ground who, frankly, need our help, need the help of our intelligence services, need our satellites and other capabilities, and need a better way in which to defend themselves and those parklands across Africa. Some years ago, myself and another Member of this body authored legislation to help set up these national parks across Africa, the Congo Basin Forest Partnership Act, which Clay Shaw and I authored. But today these terrorist organizations are in the parklands themselves, slaughtering these species. I would like to thank the Members that have been involved in putting this together and, also, some from the other committees that assisted us, like Chairman Goodlatte of the Judiciary Committee and Chairman Bishop of the Natural Resources Committee, for their constructive input and assistance in getting this legislation to the floor. And, of course, I would like, in closing, to recognize, again, Ranking Member Engel and Representatives Poe, Smith, and Bass for their valuable contributions. I urge all my colleagues to seize this opportunity and vote for H.R. 2494 and then help us bring a little pressure to bear to get this bill out of the Senate. I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reiterate a point I made during the Foreign Affairs Committee markup of the Global Anti-Poaching Act, H.R. 2494, which is being considered on the House floor today. At the markup in June, I offered a very specific amendment to this bill that would simply ensure that nothing in Section 6 of this Act shall be construed to authorize the use of the United States Armed Forces in combat activities. Since that time, I am happy to see that the Chairman has amended the text of this legislation to reflect my concerns. I think it is important to state, once again, that this bill does not authorize the use of U.S. forces in combat activities as a result of fighting poaching. At markup the Chairman assured me that nothing in this bill could be construed to authorize such a combat activity, and the amended text of this bill does more to ensure that is the case. We all know that poaching is a very serious problem and I believe this bill is a constructive [[Page H7372]] step toward combating that evil. I applaud Chairman Royce for his work on this important legislation. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2494, as amended. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",package_114_271.csv,42619,42619,42689,"[congressional record volume 161, number 162 (monday, november 2, 2015)] [house] [pages h7367-h7372] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] global anti-poaching act mr. royce. mr. speaker, i move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (h.r. 2494) to support global anti-poaching efforts, strengthen the capacity of partner countries to counter wildlife trafficking, designate major wildlife trafficking countries, and for other purposes, as amended. the clerk read the title of the bill. the text of the bill is as follows: h.r. 2494 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``global anti-poaching act''. sec. 2. findings. congress finds the following: (1) poaching and the illicit trade in endangered and threatened wildlife are among the most lucrative criminal activities worldwide, worth an estimated $7 to $10 billion annually. (2) poaching and wildlife trafficking have escalated in scale, sophistication and violence, risking the potential extinction of some of the world's most iconic species. (3) wildlife poaching and trafficking threaten elephants, rhinoceros, and tigers greatly, but also have devastating impact on a number of other species, including sharks, great apes, and turtles. (4) the high demand for rare wildlife products has driven prices to historically high levels. (5) much of the demand for wildlife products comes from asia and is fueled by the perceived medicinal value and social status associated with these products. (6) reporting indicates that a number of rebel groups and terrorist organizations, including sudan's janjaweed militia, the lord's resistance army, the seleka rebel movement in the central african republic, and somalia's al-shabaab, either participate in or draw funding from illicit wildlife trafficking networks. (7) analyses suggest the high demand for illegal wildlife products, combined with weak law enforcement and security measures and corruption and governance failures, has led to the increased involvement of transnational organized crime in wildlife trafficking. (8) the united nations security council has authorized multilateral sanctions against individuals and entities supporting armed groups through the illicit trade in wildlife, in addition to other natural resources, in the democratic republic of congo and the central african republic. (9) a national intelligence council analysis of wildlife poaching threats found that certain african government officials facilitated the movement of wildlife products, and that these governments' ability to reduce poaching and trafficking was hindered by corruption and weak rule of law. (10) on november 13, 2013, the secretary of state announced the first reward under the transnational organized crime rewards program for information leading to the dismantling of the xaysavang network, a large wildlife trafficking syndicate that is based in laos and spans africa and asia. sec. 3. expansion of wildlife enforcement networks. (a) findings.--congress finds the following: (1) wildlife enforcement networks are government-led, regionally-focused mechanisms that increase capacity and coordination efforts between law enforcement, environmental agencies, and other entities focused on countering wildlife trafficking of member countries. (2) currently there are active wildlife enforcement networks in southeast asia, south asia, and central america. the more mature wildlife enforcement networks, such as the southeast asia wildlife enforcement network, have proven effective in dismantling transnational wildlife trafficking networks and bringing to justice those individuals involved in the illegal trade of endangered and threatened species.

(b) statement of policy.--the secretary of state, the administrator of the united states agency for international development, the director of the united states fish and wildlife service, and heads of other appropriate agencies should, in an effort to address regional threats to biodiversity and conservation, support strengthening existing wildlife enforcement networks and the establishment of new networks in other appropriate regions.

to the international aid transparency initiative (iati); and (3) develop and implement a learning agenda to improve the performance and impact of wildlife trafficking programs and to share best practices among relevant executive branch agencies. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from california (mr. royce) and the gentleman from new york (mr. engel) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from california. {time} 1745 general leave mr. royce. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous material. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from california? there was no objection. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i include in the record an exchange of letters between myself and the chairmen of the natural resources and judiciary committees. mr. speaker, the very disturbing reality is that some of the world's most majestic animals have become ``blood currency'' for terrorist organizations and rebel groups. some of the same radical organizations that carry out terror for political purposes get their resources by the sale of rhino horns and ivory through the slaughter of these animals in order to fund their terrorist operations. poachers are taking advantage of under-equipped and undermanned park rangers. as we watch this play out across the sub-saharan continent, they are decimating elephant and rhino populations and trading their tusks. in the 1980s, over 1 million african elephants roamed the continent's forests and savannahs. that is not that long ago. today, there are less than 500,000 left. with this explosion in poaching, at these current rates, in about two decades, they will vanish. the rhino would vanish. in south africa, home of the one of the largest rhino populations, poachers killed an average of 14 rhinos per year in the 1990s and 2000s. last year, they killed 1,200--the top year on record. this is bigger than security. this, frankly, is a security issue for the entire planet. as we watch what is developing with these organizations, wildlife trafficking is now the most lucrative criminal activity--certainly, one of the most lucrative--around the world. i saw an estimate that poaching in africa is worth $10 billion in annual income for these radical organizations. the foreign affairs committee has held several hearings and briefings in which we learned how nefarious groups like al shabaab, the janjaweed, and joseph kony's lord's resistance army benefit from trafficking in wildlife and trading the ivory for guns. an average-size tusk is worth 25 cases of fresh ammunition in central africa. twenty- five cases will enable rebel groups to continue to rampage and terrorize civilian populations. the u.s. has invested a great deal of resources in trying to bring stability to the countries where these armed groups operate: somalia, sudan, and the congo. all of that effort and investment are undermined when these terrorist organizations and rebel groups find these new financial lifelines. we remember the situation with blood diamonds. well, for the last decade and a half, it has been ivory and rhino horns. mr. speaker, to address this crisis, the global anti-poaching act tackles wildlife trafficking in several ways. this legislation designates those countries that are ignoring wildlife trafficking and allows the secretary of state to withhold security assistance from the worst offenders. in some wildlife trafficking cases, foreign governments have been found complicit. a ``naming and shaming'' of these countries is the minimum we can do if we are to contend with the poaching explosion. we know from some of our antitrafficking legislation how much pressure this does, in fact, put on foreign governments. countries in asia that are driving the demand for wildlife products also come under the spotlight in this bill. in the same tactic of naming and shaming that this legislation establishes, it has been used, as i mentioned, not just with traffickers, but also in drug trafficking cases. it is a way to force other countries to become part of the solution, rather than part of the problem. to make this big business riskier for those who are involved in it, the legislation makes wildlife trafficking an offense under racketeering and money laundering statutes, going after the international networks that are taking profits out of this. it is the terrorist organizations on the ground doing the work, but it is the international criminal syndicates that then move the ivory around the world. we also have to stop that demand for the ivory. the legislation directs that any seized assets from these new penalties go toward the conservation of the very species that were trafficked. so when moneys are obtained from those involved in the pipeline, it can be employed for that purpose. mr. speaker, tackling poaching can protect exotic wildlife, increase security, and help africa's development. one of the fastest growing sectors in africa is ecotourism. in 2014, the industry contributed $70 billion to the african economy and directly employed 8 million people. these majestic animals drive tourism in africa. they drive sustainable development there. but if we don't bring the slaughter to an end, there might not be any of these animals to see in a few years. the park rangers on the front lines trying to stop the slaughter at the hands of poachers are outmaneuvered and outgunned. this bipartisan legislation will help even out the fight by pressuring the administration to provide vital security assistance, including vehicles as well as intelligence and surveillance tools, to these park rangers. we know the security and economic consequences if today's poaching rates go on unchecked: terrorist and rebels fund their dangerous activities, and the african economy takes a major hit. the legislation before us today is a chance to change this course and to reverse this course back toward one of sustainable development; back toward one where, in the future, people from around the globe can go to africa and see these magnificent animals and participate in building the economy through ecotourism in africa. i reserve the balance of my time. house of representatives, committee on the judiciary. washington, dc, october 15, 2015. hon. ed royce, chairman, committee on foreign affairs, washington, dc. dear chairman royce: i am writing with respect to h.r. 2494, the ``global anti-poaching act,'' which was referred to the committee on foreign affairs and in addition to the committee on the judiciary. as a result of your having consulted with us on provisions in h.r. 2494 that fall within the rule x jurisdiction of the committee on the judiciary, i agree to discharge our committee from further consideration of this bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the house floor for consideration. the judiciary committee takes this action with our mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of h.r. 2494 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that our committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. our committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any house-senate conference involving this or similar legislation, and asks that you support any such request. i would appreciate a response to this letter confirming this understanding with respect to h.r. 2494 and would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the congressional record during floor consideration of h.r. 2494. sincerely, bob goodlatte, chairman. [[page h7370]] ____ house of representatives, committee on foreign affairs, washington, dc, october 15, 2015. hon. bob goodlatte, chairman, house committee on the judiciary, washington, dc. dear mr. chairman: thank you for consulting with the committee on foreign affairs on h.r. 2494, the global anti- poaching act, and for agreeing to be discharged from further consideration of that bill. i agree that your forgoing further action on this measure does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the committee on the judiciary, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the future. i would support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any house-senate conference involving this legislation. i will seek to place our letters on h.r. 2494 into the congressional record during floor consideration of the bill. i appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work with your committee as this measure moves through the legislative process. sincerely, edward r. royce, chairman. ____ house of representatives, committee on natural resources, washington, dc, october 15, 2015. hon. edward r. royce, chairman, house committee on foreign affairs, washington, dc. dear mr. chairman: i write regarding h.r. 2494, the global anti-poaching act. this bill contains provisions under the jurisdiction of the committee on natural resources. i recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this bill before the house of representatives in an expeditious manner, and accordingly, i will agree that the committee on natural resources be discharged from further consideration of the bill. i do so with the understanding that this action does not affect the jurisdiction of the committee on natural resources, and that the committee expressly reserves its authority to seek conferees on any provision within its jurisdiction during any house-senate conference that may be convened on this, or any similar legislation. i ask that you support any such request. finally, i also ask that a copy of this letter and your response be included in the congressional record during consideration of h.r. 2494 on the house floor. thank you for your work on this bill and i look forward to its enactment. sincerely, rob bishop, chairman, committee on natural resources. ____ house of representatives, committee on foreign affairs, washington, dc, october 15, 2015. hon. rob bishop, chairman, house committee on natural resources, washington, dc. dear mr. chairman: thank you for consulting with the committee on foreign affairs on h.r. 2494, the global anti- poaching act, and for agreeing to be discharged from further consideration of that bill. i agree that your forgoing further action on this measure does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the committee on natural resources, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the future. i would support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any house-senate conference involving this legislation. i will seek to place our letters on h.r. 2494 into the congressional record during floor consideration of the bill. i appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work with your committee as this measure moves through the legislative process. sincerely, edward r. royce, chairman. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of this measure. i want to, first of all, thank my friend, the chairman of the foreign affairs committee, ed royce, for authoring the global anti-poaching act. i am very proud to be an original cosponsor. this bill, again, is a good example of our committee working across the aisle to get real results. on average, one elephant is killed every 20 minutes. that is just a shocking statistic. so in the 40 minutes we have to debate this bill, two elephants will be killed. last year, the toll was 20,000. it is just disgusting. and make no mistake, these animals aren't being killed for sport. no matter how you feel about big game hunting, the real reason elephants and other iconic animals are being wiped out is far more sinister, and it is why this issue deserves the attention of congress and the administration. those responsible for poaching are profiting from their crimes by selling ivory or rhinoceros horns or cheetah pelts. where do these profits go? these profits go to buy weapons for violent, armed militias, to bribe government officials and law enforcement, and to fuel criminal networks. in short, poaching pumps resources into groups that threaten security and stability, groups that want to do harm to innocent people and want to do harm to the united states of america. that is why chairman royce and i view wildlife trafficking as a security issue, and that is why we introduced the global anti-poaching act. our bill would bring wildlife trafficking under money laundering and racketeering statutes that are already part of our law. it would support the professionalization of wildlife law enforcement units on the ground and allow us to provide them nonlethal assistance. it would strengthen regional wildlife enforcement networks designed to combat poaching, and it would name and shame governments that aren't taking this problem seriously. mr. speaker, i would also like to highlight the excellent work of the wildlife conservation society from my hometown, bronx, new york. the wildlife conservation society runs the bronx zoo and many other cultural institutions in new york city. they have been actively fighting poaching and trafficking for many years. they have been on the forefront of the american fight against poaching and trafficking. it is a pleasure to work with them on this and so many other issues. i, of course, have longstanding ties with one of their leaders, john calvelli, who used to be my chief of staff in washington--he ran my washington office--so i know how dedicated this group is. we need to crack down on wildlife trafficking, both to deny resources to dangerous organizations and to protect some of the world's most iconic creatures. people may feel: well, if i just buy a little ivory doll or i buy something made out of ivory, how can that hurt? after all, it is there. it may be cute. it may be trendy. what is wrong with it? i will tell you what is wrong with it. it funnels and aids and abets terrorism, because these groups that sell the tusks and sell the ivory are, by and large, groups that get the money back and use it to force terror. people who are buying these things are not buying some innocent things; they are buying things that help terrorist organizations. just like we have the fight with the artifacts that are coming in from syria that isis takes and loots and then sells abroad to help finance their terrorist activities, the same thing is true for ivory and the same reasons are being used: it is being done to funnel this money towards helping sinister groups, many of whom are terrorist organizations. so i urge my colleagues to support this bill. this is a very important bill. i thank my friend and partner, chairman royce. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i just want to recognize mr. engel's commitment to conservation on this planet and to his work on this legislation as well. i yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from texas (mr. poe), chairman of the foreign affairs subcommittee on terrorism, nonproliferation, and trade. he is an original cosponsor of this bill. mr. poe of texas. i thank the chairman for yielding. i also thank the chairman and ranking member for their work on this very important piece of legislation. mr. speaker, around the world, big game like elephant and rhinos are getting slaughtered. ivory-seeking poachers have killed 100,000 elephants in 3 years. the black rhino population has dropped 95 percent since the early 20th century. in 2007, there were 12 rhinos killed in south africa; but in 2013 and 2014, over 1,000 were killed each year. regarding elephants, this is a photograph of one of the oldest elephants in existence. satao was his name. he was in his forties. he was killed for his tusks. they were so long, they drug on the ground. that is what is happening to the elephant population in africa. they are killed not for their meat; they are killed for their tusks. most of the people doing the poaching are really not the locals who poach for an animal to eat. that is not most of the poaching, although that does occur. most of those doing the poaching are transnational criminal organizations. [[page h7371]] the criminal groups come from places like china and vietnam. china is the number one destination for elephant tusks. vietnam is the number one world destination for rhino horns. criminal cartels that are involved in this trafficking don't just traffic wildlife. they traffic drugs, weapons, and people. it is all the same group of criminals that are trafficking. they traffic anything for money. the wildlife trafficking trade has exploded in recent years because the criminals understand that profits they get from trafficking wildlife are bigger than what they get for trafficking drugs. {time} 1800 also, the chances of getting caught are less and, if caught, the punishment is less. so that is why wildlife trafficking is on the increase. a rhino horn is now worth about $27,000 per pound. that is twice the value of gold and platinum and more than cocaine and diamonds. it should come as no surprise that terrorist groups are involved in this as well. i held a hearing in my subcommittee in february on the connection between wildlife trafficking and terrorist groups. the witnesses testified that terrorists are one of several groups involved in wildlife trafficking. and, of course, they do it all for the money. they use the money, as mr. engel said, to buy bullets and guns to cause terror in africa and other places in the world. just over the weekend, al qaeda's somali affiliate, al-shabaab, released photographs of its fighters hunting and killing a giraffe. here is a photograph of that giraffe that was killed in africa. it is a recruiting poster for jihad. al-shabaab put this on its recruiting poster. this recent video says: terrorism is in my nation, and we do it for tourism. therefore, come and help us in jihad. that is a recruiting poster, the killing of wildlife in africa. killing of elephants is a main revenue source for the lord's resistance army, led by the infamous joseph kony. by going after wildlife traffickers, we are going after transnational criminal organizations and terrorists. but we also must call out, as this legislation does, corrupt government officials that give a wink and a nod for allowing the poaching, in their countries, of rhinos, elephants, and others. this isn't just a wildlife problem. it is a national security problem. this bill will give our law enforcement the authority it needs to be able to go after criminals and terrorists and help foreign governments save rhinos and elephants from extinction. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentleman has expired. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute. mr. poe of texas. mr. speaker, if we don't stop wildlife trafficking of rhinos, elephants, and other animals by terrorist groups, for organized criminal activities, the only places our kids and grandkids are going to see rhinos and elephants are at the zoo or in a disney cartoon. and that is just the way it is. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. again, let me thank chairman royce for his leadership on this issue, the gentleman from texas (mr. poe), and all of the people that have worked so hard on this. we need to be creative in the way we go after financing for violent groups. if nothing is done, i believe the statistic is that, in 11 years, elephants will be extinct in the wild. isn't that a tragedy? who would have thought? so we need to be creative in the way we go after the financing for violent groups. mr. poe pointed out some very, very important things about terrorism and criminal activities. so, again, i want to say that, when people buy these things, it is not innocent. they are aiding terrorism, and they are aiding criminality. we need to use every tool at our disposal, so this legislation does that by going after a critical source of funding for criminals and terrorists. at the same time, it will help to preserve some of the world's most imperiled animals. again, i urge all my colleagues to support this measure. i thank chairman royce for his hard work on this and so many other things. this is something that everyone needs to support. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. royce. mr. speaker, part of the tragedy of this can be seen in what happened in garissa national park in africa. the jihadists hit that park in order to take those tusks, in order to get that hard currency and trade those tusks for weapons and for bullets, and then used that weaponry to turn on garissa university. now, remember, these are jihadists. the one thing that al-shabaab has in common with the janjaweed and with these other jihadi organizations is a hatred--just as boko haram has this hatred--a hatred of those who study. so what did they do? what did they do when they had their hands on those weapons? they then went to garissa university and slaughtered 145 students after slaughtering the elephants in the parks. there is a direct link when jihadi organizations, as judge ted poe shared with you, carried out these attacks to recruit, to show that they have got the power to kill, that they have got the power to exterminate, to annihilate not just these animal species but human beings as well. mr. speaker, time is not on our side. each day of inaction means more animals poached, and the coffers of terrorist organizations and rebels grow full because the criminal syndicates that buy the ivory give them the weapons and give them the money. that has to come to an end. since the time we started this debate, as mr. engel pointed out, two elephants have already been poached, have been slaughtered, because one is killed every 15 minutes in africa. it is quite possible, as mr. engel said and as mr. poe alluded, that our children could grow up in a world without rhinoceros, without elephants, and it is no exaggeration. certainly the forest elephant is going to be wiped out; the black rhino is going to be wiped out. do we want to live in that kind of a world? do we want to allow that to happen on our watch? the global anti-poaching act combats today's unprecedented levels of poaching and wildlife trafficking by holding foreign governments accountable, by adding greater consequences for traffickers in this illicit trade, while also assisting those park rangers on the ground who, frankly, need our help, need the help of our intelligence services, need our satellites and other capabilities, and need a better way in which to defend themselves and those parklands across africa. some years ago, myself and another member of this body authored legislation to help set up these national parks across africa, the congo basin forest partnership act, which clay shaw and i authored. but today these terrorist organizations are in the parklands themselves, slaughtering these species. i would like to thank the members that have been involved in putting this together and, also, some from the other committees that assisted us, like chairman goodlatte of the judiciary committee and chairman bishop of the natural resources committee, for their constructive input and assistance in getting this legislation to the floor. and, of course, i would like, in closing, to recognize, again, ranking member engel and representatives poe, smith, and bass for their valuable contributions. i urge all my colleagues to seize this opportunity and vote for h.r. 2494 and then help us bring a little pressure to bear to get this bill out of the senate. i yield back the balance of my time. mr. grayson. mr. speaker, i rise today to reiterate a point i made during the foreign affairs committee markup of the global anti-poaching act, h.r. 2494, which is being considered on the house floor today. at the markup in june, i offered a very specific amendment to this bill that would simply ensure that nothing in section 6 of this act shall be construed to authorize the use of the united states armed forces in combat activities. since that time, i am happy to see that the chairman has amended the text of this legislation to reflect my concerns. i think it is important to state, once again, that this bill does not authorize the use of u.s. forces in combat activities as a result of fighting poaching. at markup the chairman assured me that nothing in this bill could be construed to authorize such a combat activity, and the amended text of this bill does more to ensure that is the case. we all know that poaching is a very serious problem and i believe this bill is a constructive [[page h7372]] step toward combating that evil. i applaud chairman royce for his work on this important legislation. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from california (mr. royce) that the house suspend the rules and pass the bill, h.r. 2494, as amended. the question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed. a motion to reconsider was laid on the table. ____________________",42619

CREC-2015-11-02-pt1-PgH7372-5,CREC-2015-11-02,114,EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING SAFETY AND SECURITY OF EUROPEAN JEWISH COMMUNITIES,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H7372-H7378] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1900 EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING SAFETY AND SECURITY OF EUROPEAN JEWISH COMMUNITIES Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 354) expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the safety and security of Jewish communities in Europe. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: H. Res. 354 Whereas anti-Semitic rhetoric and acts, including violent attacks on people and places of faith, have increased in frequency, variety, and severity in many countries in Europe; Whereas the French Service de Protection de la Communaute Juive (Jewish Community Security Service) reported an increase in anti-Semitic acts in France between 2013 to 2014 (from 423 acts to 851), including an increase in violent ones (from 105 acts to 241); Whereas the Community Security Trust reported an increase in anti-Semitic acts in [[Page H7373]] the United Kingdom between 2013 to 2014 (from 535 acts to 1,168), including an increase in violent ones (from 69 to 81); and the Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary European Jewry reported an increase in anti-Semitic acts between 2013 and 2014 in Germany (from 788 acts to 1076, including 36 violent acts to 76), Belgium (from 64 acts to 109, including 11 violent acts to 30), Austria (from 137 acts to 255, including 4 violent acts to 9), and Italy (from 45 to 90, including 12 violent acts to 23); Whereas the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported, in its latest available statistics, 870 incidents in 2012 with anti-Jewish bias motivation, including 13 violent incidents, and 625 incidents in 2013 with anti-Jewish bias motivation, including four violent incidents; Whereas anti-Semitic attacks have been increasingly directed at places of ordinary daily life and places of worship, including-- (1) the violent extremist who pledged his loyalty to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) and attacked a kosher supermarket in Paris, France, January 9, 2015, murdering four Jewish patrons; and (2) the violent extremist who pledged his loyalty to ISIS and attacked the Great Synagogue in Copenhagen, Denmark, during a bat mitzvah celebration, February 15, 2015, murdering a member of the Jewish community on security duty, and wounding two members of the Danish Police Service; Whereas anti-Semitic attacks are threats to the fundamental freedoms, rights, security, and diversity of all citizens, societies, and countries in which they occur; Whereas governments have primary responsibility for the security and safety of all of their citizens and therefore primary responsibility for monitoring, preventing, and responding to anti-Semitic violence; Whereas Jewish community groups that focus on strengthening safety awareness, crisis management, and preparedness are essential to keeping members of the Jewish community safe, and complement efforts of government and inter-governmental entities; Whereas keeping members of Jewish communities safe requires government agencies, intergovernmental institutions and agencies, and law enforcement associations, formally recognizing and partnering with Jewish community groups that focus on safety awareness and crisis management and preparedness; Whereas in the United States, United Kingdom, and France, there are examples of formal recognition, partnership, training, and information-sharing between government entities and Jewish community security groups that have strengthened these countries and contributed to the safety and security of Jewish communities; Whereas Jewish community groups, consortia, and initiatives, have formed and are forming to focus on safety awareness, crisis management, and preparedness, and partner with law enforcement entities and thought leaders; Whereas information-sharing and action-focused campaigns, including the national ``If You See Something, Say Something'' campaign of the Department of Homeland Security, which rely on members of the public reporting suspicious activity to law enforcement personnel, are critical to preventing violent attacks on individuals and communities; Whereas relevant information, research, and analysis is vital to strengthening the preparedness, prevention, mitigation, and response of Jewish communities and law enforcement agencies; Whereas broader efforts to counter violent extremism, and efforts to counter anti-Semitism, should be integrated with each other as appropriate and share best practices; Whereas in the Berlin Declaration of April 29, 2004, participating States of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) condemned anti-Semitism and committed themselves to specific actions to combat it, and to collect and maintain reliable information and statistics about anti-Semitic crimes; Whereas, on December 6, 2013, the Ministerial Council of the OSCE, which is composed of the Foreign Ministers of participating States, adopted Decision number 3/13 entitled ``Freedom of Thought, Conscience, Religion, or Belief'', emphasizing ``the link between security and full respect for the freedom of thought'', and committing member governments to adopt ``policies to promote respect and protection for places of worship and religious sites, religious monuments, cemeteries and shrines against vandalism and destruction'', among other specific actions; Whereas, on December 5, 2014, the Ministerial Council of the OSCE adopted Declaration number 8, the Basel Declaration, on ``Enhancing Efforts to Combat Anti-Semitism'', in which members of the Council stated, ``We express our concern at the disconcerting number of anti-Semitic incidents that continue to take place in the OSCE area and remain a challenge to stability and security'' and ``We stress the importance of States collaborating with civil society through effective partnerships and strengthened dialogue and co- operation on combating anti-Semitism''; and Whereas in 2004, Congress passed the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act, which established an Office to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism, headed by a Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives-- (1) urges the United States Government to work closely with European governments and their law enforcement agencies, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the European Union, Europol, and Interpol, encouraging them to-- (A) formally recognize, partner, train, and share information with Jewish community security groups to strengthen preparedness, prevention, mitigation, and response related to anti-Semitic attacks and to support related research initiatives; (B) consider the formal partnerships in the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, between government entities and Jewish community security groups, as examples of partnership, training, and information-sharing; (C) support assessments of the-- (i) general environment in which anti-Semitic attacks occur; (ii) data on types of crimes committed and the response from law enforcement; (iii) relationships of Jewish community groups with local law enforcement agencies, including joint training opportunities and information sharing; (iv) preparedness, including emergency response plans, of Jewish community groups; and (v) response of local law enforcement systems to anti- Semitic attacks, including incident reporting, initial response, and the prioritization and prosecution of those crimes; (D) utilize these assessments to help make adjustments to their strategies and efforts to combat anti-Semitism as needed; (E) help Jewish communities develop common, baseline safety standards; (F) consider developing a standardized pan-European information-sharing and alerting system that can include governmental and non-governmental agencies, as well as Jewish communities; (G) develop safety-awareness and suspicious activity reporting campaigns; (H) integrate, as appropriate, efforts to combat violent extremism and efforts to combat anti-Semitism; (I) ensure law enforcement personnel are effectively trained to monitor, prevent, and respond to anti-Semitic violence, and to partner with Jewish communities; (J) reaffirm and work for the implementation of the OSCE declarations, decisions, and other commitments focusing on anti-Semitism; and (K) ensure senior officials, with commensurate authority and resources, have been appointed or designated to combat anti-Semitism and collaborate with governmental and inter- governmental agencies, law enforcement agencies, Jewish community groups, and other civil society groups; (2) reaffirms its support for the mandate of the United States Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism as part of the broader policy priority of fostering international religious freedom; and (3) urges the Secretary of State to continue robust United States reporting on anti-Semitism by the Department of State and the Special Envoy to Combat and Monitor Anti-Semitism. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. General Leave Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous materials in the Record. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, anti-Semitism in Europe is on the rise. Jewish communities there are on the edge. Fearing this rise in hatred toward them may signal a return to Europe's darkest days. This sad reality is well documented by authoritative reports from the Pew Foundation, the Anti-Defamation League, and others. In 2015, a survey by the Anti-Defamation League showed that over 25 percent of European respondents said that they harbored anti-Semitic feelings; and that number had significantly increased from the year before in a few countries, such as in the Netherlands and in the United Kingdom. It is a phenomenon clearly felt on the streets, seen scrawled across synagogues and in desecrated burial sites, and even demonstrated in deadly acts of terror. We all recall the horrific attacks on the Charlie Hebdo offices and [[Page H7374]] the grocery in Paris and the later attacks at a synagogue and a cafe in Copenhagen. Just last month in Manchester, four Jewish youths were attacked by thugs who shouted their hatred of Jews. One of the victims, a 17-year-old boy, had to be hospitalized. The rise of such attacks and hate-filled rhetoric is causing Europe's Jews to look over their shoulders and even consider fleeing communities that they have been a part of for over 20 generations, to seek safety elsewhere. Targeted violence against the Jewish people or any other religious or minority group is repugnant. Sadly, the Jewish people have been among the most persecuted in the world. When you think of the consequences of the Holocaust, when you think of the consequences of the Inquisition, the magnitude of it comes home when you realize that there are as many Jews left alive on this planet today as there were during the early days of the Roman Empire. The slaughter of these people, their persecution, leaves for humanity the thought: Have we learned nothing from the Holocaust? European leaders must unequivocally send this message to their people and act to provide greater protection for their Jewish citizens. This important resolution proposes several commonsense steps for our European allies to consider to improve the safety of their Jewish communities: It calls for establishing partnerships between law enforcement and Jewish community groups in order to improve the security plans, training, and enhanced law enforcement response to these anti-Semitic attacks. Improved sharing of information between government agencies, law enforcement, and Jewish community groups is another key recommendation. Finally, this measure encourages European nations to improve communication between themselves and with the United States to analyze trends in anti-Semitic crimes and to share best practices in combating extremism. As we learned from the Holocaust, anti-Semitic sentiment can lay the foundation for persecution of Jewish communities under the guise of political protest or under the guise of nationalistic pride. That is why leaders of free societies everywhere must expose these prejudices for the dangers they pose to their communities. I want to recognize Congressman Chris Smith of New Jersey for authoring this important measure. And, as always, I thank Ranking Member Engel for his help on this measure and in getting this bill to the floor. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this timely resolution. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in support of this measure. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Royce, again, for being on top of all these very important issues. Under his leadership, the Foreign Affairs Committee has really taken the lead on important issues such as this. I want to also thank Mr. Smith from New Jersey for sponsoring this resolution. As the chair of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations, Chris Smith has been focused on the disturbing surge of anti-Semitism in Europe. He is always there. He always speaks out forcefully about anti-Semitism and other things that are important to him. I am grateful for his leadership. It is disappointing that we still need to take up this sort of measure. As we all know, anti-Semitism, that ancient hatred, has continued smoldering through the centuries. Week after week, we hear reports of new anti-Semitic attacks: the vandalism of the Babi Yar Holocaust site in Kiev--I have been there a number of times. It is very disheartening that that would be desecrated--the targeting of the Great Synagogue in Copenhagen; and, of course, the unfathomable attack, as Chairman Royce mentioned, in Paris last January. We would be foolish to dismiss this surge in anti-Semitism as the work of violent, fringe individuals. In countries like Hungary and Greece, shamefully, we see explicitly anti-Semitic political parties winning seats and elections. It is deeply troubling, very disturbing. It wasn't even a century ago that we heard this canary in the coal mine. You can draw a straight line from early indifference and inaction to the darkest chapter in human history. The lessons of the Holocaust are seared in our collective consciousness. Those lessons are telling us to throw water on this fire before it burns out of control. I was born after World War II in New York, and I remember hearing family members talking about anti-Semitism. The general prevailing thought was, well, this is something that will never happen again, that the Holocaust was so horrific that world humanity would understand that something like this could never happen again. When I say ``never happen again,'' I mean to any group--not just to Jewish groups, to any group. This cannot be tolerated, and one has to just look around the world to see all the hatred and all the people who are being slaughtered because of who they are or what tribe they are from or what people they are from. It is particularly galling in Europe, where so many people--6 million Jewish people--perished during the Holocaust, that anti-Semitism would rear its ugly head again. One would think that people would be ashamed and would not want to go down the anti-Semitic path again. Here it is, barely 70 years after the end of World War II, and we see an alarming rise. And it is an alarming rise from a lot of different communities. There are skinheads and people who have always uttered anti-Semitic remarks. We also, unfortunately, have a number of people living in Europe of Middle Eastern descent who also are using the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians to, again, fan the fires of anti-Semitic hatred. As the numbers of people from Arab lands go to Europe, some, unfortunately, are fanning the fires of anti-Semitism. That has to be condemned and stopped as well. Anti-Semitism needs to be condemned no matter who is espousing it, no matter where it is coming from, and no matter what they are saying. It is really time to call it the way it is. So we need greater vigilance by law enforcement when Jewish communities in Europe are under threat. But it is not that simple. We also need greater leadership from officials by speaking out against anti-Semitism. We had a bill just a couple of hours ago--maybe not even a couple of hours ago--which talked about the Palestinian leadership not condemning anti-Semitism and having incitement of things that result in anti-Semitic attacks. So this is the same thing. It is the same thing, whether it is in Europe or the Middle East. It is rearing its ugly head, and it is time for us to continue to speak out against it. The United States of America has always been the bastion of society, and the world looks to us for leadership. I think it is very important that the United States Congress is doing this now. So we need greater vigilance by law enforcement when Jewish communities in Europe are under threat, but it is not that simple. We also need greater leadership from officials by speaking out against anti-Semitism. We need stronger partnerships with Jewish communities to help them develop their own safety responses, community policing techniques, and information sharing with government agencies. We need to foster cultures that respect diversity and don't ostracize minority groups. I condemn any kind of ostracizing of any minority group in this country or around the world. We need to step in and say that we will not tolerate it. So this resolution encourages these efforts, and I encourage my colleagues to support it. Anti-Semitism is rearing its ugly head, but it can be defeated. I think what the Congress is doing today is a very good step in that direction. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the author of this measure, and I ask unanimous consent that he be allowed to control the time. Mr. Smith, as U.S. chairman of the Helsinki Commission, works with our European allies to improve the security and improve the safety of these Jewish communities in Europe. We appreciate his authorship of this resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? [[Page H7375]] There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce for his leadership on this very important human rights issue, as he has done so ably and effectively on all of these issues, particularly his leadership on Iran; and that, of course, would be echoed with Eliot Engel's excellent work there as well. This is a group of leaders that have made a huge difference. So thank you, Chairman Royce, for that. H. Res. 354, Mr. Speaker, prescribes specific, effective actions that government should take in response to the deadly threats to the Jewish communities in Europe. As we all know, the number of violent anti- Semitic attacks have increased from 100 to 400 percent in some European countries since 2013 alone. Murders in Paris and Copenhagen and elsewhere remind us that there are those who are motivated by anti- Semitic hate and have the will and the means to kill. I would just note parenthetically that my work in combating anti- Semitism began back in 1981, in my first term, from this very podium, speaking out in favor of Jewish refuseniks. I joined Mark Levin and the NCSJ 1 year later in 1982 on a trip to the Soviet Union where we met with men and women who were targeted by the KGB and the Soviet evil empire simply because they were Jewish. Sadly, anti-Semitism has not abated, and in recent years, it has actually worsened. {time} 1915 This resolution calls for the United States Government to work with our European allies on specific actions that are essential to keep European Jewish communities safe and secure. It is based on consultations with the leading experts who are working directly with these communities. The resolution focuses on the formal partnerships between European law enforcement agencies and Jewish community security groups. Here in the United States, Mr. Speaker, the collaboration between the Department of Homeland Security and Security Community Network--an initiative of the Jewish Federation of North America and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations--has been essential to protecting Jewish communities here. The formal partnerships between the Community Security Trust in the United Kingdom and the Jewish Community Security Service in France and their respective governments are also excellent models that need to be emulated. The resolution emphasizes the importance of consistent, two-way communication and information sharing between law enforcement agencies and Jewish community groups. It encourages the development of a pan- European information sharing, communication, and alerting system, and envisions governments, intergovernmental agencies, and Jewish communities working together on it. Such a system should function day- round and year-round and include training for personnel who are implementing it. The resolution also calls for European governments to support assessments in several key areas and accordingly adjust their actions and strategies. Details matter. The assessments should gather and analyze data on crimes committed, response from law enforcement, types of attacks or incidents that are most prevalent, and the types of targets that are most at risk. It is essential to understand how law enforcement agencies usually receive reports of anti-Semitic crimes and what initial actions they take when a report is filed. I remember years ago, when I offered a resolution at the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, we heard that it was just hooliganism and other kinds of acts done by young people when you spray-paint a swastika on a tombstone in a Jewish cemetery, when you deface a synagogue, and you attack a man simply because he is wearing a yarmulke. Clearly, these are acts of anti-Semitic hate; yet, they were being dismissed as something that was other. Assessments are also needed on Jewish community security groups, particularly of their capabilities, resources, relationships with local law enforcement agencies, preparedness, including emergency response plans, and the extent to which their decisionmaking is based on the best available information, analysis, and practices. The resolution calls for governments to use these assessments to help these community groups develop common baseline safety standards. These standards should include, as I said before, training, controlling access to physical facilities, physical security measures, including cameras, and crisis communications. Emergency exercises and simulations, mapping access to facilities, and sharing information with law enforcement agencies should also be part of the standards. These assessments, Mr. Speaker, will help achieve the resolution's call for law enforcement personnel to be well trained to monitor, prevent, and respond to anti-Semitic violence and to partner with Jewish communities. For all of these assessments, governments should draw information from sources that include Jewish groups, law enforcement agencies, independent human rights NGOs, research initiatives, and other civil society groups and leaders. H. Res. 354 calls for safety awareness and suspicious activity reporting campaigns, like ``If you see something, say something'' here in the United States. Other aspects of the resolution include appropriately integrating initiatives to counter violent extremism and those to combat anti-Semitism and the urgency of implementing the declarations, decisions, and other commitments of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that focus on anti-Semitism. To accomplish these goals, the resolution calls for European governments to ensure that they appoint or designate senior officials with the necessary authority and resources to combat anti-Semitism and collaborate with governmental and intergovernmental agencies, law enforcement, and Jewish community groups. Finally, the resolution reaffirms support for the mandate of the United States Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism as part of the broader policy of fostering international religious freedom and urges the Secretary of State to continue robust U.S. reporting on anti- Semitism by the Department of State and the Special Envoy to Combat and Monitor Anti-Semitism. I would note parenthetically that I authored the amendment to the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act of 2004, introduced and sponsored by Senator Voinovich. My amendment created the Office to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism within the State Department. That has proven to be a key tool in this fight. Mr. Speaker, the resolution has the support of leading organizations, and it has 89 cosponsors, including all eight of the co-chairs of the Bipartisan Taskforce for Combating Anti-Semitism. I would like to acknowledge, Mr. Speaker, John Farmer, Jr., and Paul Goldenberg for their tireless efforts and dedication and leadership in fighting anti-Semitism and terrorism over the years. John is a former attorney general of New Jersey and is now on the steering committee of the Institute for Emergency Preparedness and Homeland Security and is the codirector of the Faith-Based Communities Security Program at Rutgers University. Paul is the executive director of the Secure Community Network and a senior adviser to the Institute and the program. Several major Jewish communities in Europe have relied on their counsel, and both have spent time on the ground within these communities. Finally, I would like to acknowledge and single out for very, very special thanks and recognition Rabbi Andy Baker, personal representative of the OSCE chair in the Office on Combating Anti- Semitism and director of the International Jewish Affairs for the American Jewish Committee. He has been critical--critical--to American leadership in Europe and in the United States in the fight against anti-Semitism. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), my good friend and the ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to particularly thank Chairman Ed Royce [[Page H7376]] and my good friend, our ranking member of the committee, Eliot Engel, and all those who were so involved in putting this important resolution together. I rise in support of House Resolution 354. It was introduced by the co-chairs of the Bipartisan Taskforce for Combating Anti-Semitism. In the aftermath of appalling anti-Semitic incidents throughout Europe, including the devastating terrorist attacks at the Paris kosher supermarket and the Great Synagogue of Copenhagen, this important resolution urges the United States Government to help improve the safety and security of Jewish communities in Europe. From Austria to Belgium, Germany to the United Kingdom, Ukraine to France, there has been a sharp rise in assaults on Jewish individuals and acts of vandalism on Jewish places of worship, cemeteries, and memorials. Such destruction and desecration is unacceptable and must be stopped. That is why this resolution is so critical. It highlights specific ways the administration can work with European governments, especially law enforcement agencies, to formally recognize and partner with Jewish organizations to develop common safety standards, alert systems, information-sharing mechanisms, and ensure that local law enforcement personnel are effectively trained to monitor, prevent, and respond to anti-Semitic violence. I want to express my appreciation to my fellow co-chairs of the Anti- Semitism Taskforce, Representatives Smith, Engel, Granger, Israel, Ros- Lehtinen, Deutch, and Roskam. The task force remains committed to working across regions, religions, and party lines to condemn all anti- Semitism and fight for the right of Jews to live freely as Jews without fear. Before closing, I also want to express my strong support for H. Res. 293, which condemns anti-Israel and anti-Semitic incitement within the Palestinian Authority and calls on President Abbas to discourage such despicable behavior. The latest cycle of terrorism against Israel must end. The only way it will end is if Palestinian leaders take genuine and immediate steps to denounce all violence and promote security cooperation, coexistence, and peace with Israel. As the ranking member of the Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs of the Committee on Appropriations, I will continue to do everything in my power to bolster Israel's security to combat incitement and to promote stability and peaceful coexistence throughout the world. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), the chair of the Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the former chair of the full committee. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of Mr. Smith's bill, House Resolution 354, expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the safety and security of Jewish communities in Europe. I was an original cosponsor of this resolution. I want to highlight the work of my good friend and colleague, Chris Smith, for his leadership on this issue and, indeed, for his tireless efforts to fight anti-Semitism and support international religious freedom. I would also like to thank our fellow co-chairs of the congressional Bipartisan Taskforce for Combating Anti-Semitism for demonstrating their leadership on this issue in Congress and for raising the level of awareness and dialogue within our body related to global anti-Semitism. In recent years, Mr. Speaker, the protection and the promotion of these values have moved from being part and parcel of our foreign policy objective to not even ranking as one of our top priorities. It is time. It is way past time that we make respect for human rights and the protection of religious and ethnic minorities a top priority for our foreign policy objectives and show real leadership and show that we have the will and the moral imperative to promote our values across the world. The terror group ISIL is rising in the Middle East. It is seeking to establish an Islamic caliphate. It wants to wipe out the region's religious minorities of all kinds and anyone who does not adhere to its radical brand of Islam. This, along with an alarming rise in anti-Semitism in Europe and other attacks on religious freedom across the globe, underscores why Mr. Smith's measure before us today is so timely, is so important. It urges our government to work with European governments and law enforcement agencies in order to help them fight the rise of anti- Semitism across the continent and to make combating anti-Semitism part of our government's broader policy of promoting international religious freedom. Europe is at the dawn of a lamentably repeated and dangerous era, one of anti-Semitism, often masked through a political anti-Israel stance. If we don't move to act now, Mr. Speaker, we may see more deadly attacks, like the murder of four Jews in a kosher supermarket in Paris earlier this year. We in the United States must be at the forefront, leading the effort, helping other nations develop a more comprehensive approach to confronting the rising anti-Semitism problem. This measure before us today establishes a good framework in moving forward. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the task force members, of which I am humbled to be just a small part, Congresspersons Chris Smith, Kay Granger, Peter Roskam, Eliot Engel, Nita Lowey, Ted Deutch, and Steve Israel, all of us working together to highlight the spread of anti-Semitism and steps we must take to stem this tide. I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution brought forth by the gentleman from New Jersey. I thank all of the Members who have worked on the task force to bring this forward. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on both sides? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York has 11 minutes remaining. The gentleman from New Jersey has 3 minutes remaining. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch), who is the ranking member of the Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and a good friend. {time} 1930 Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, for yielding and for his tireless work to address the threat of anti-Semitism around the world. Mr. Speaker, this resolution was a collaborative effort among my fellow co-chairs of the Bipartisan Taskforce for Combating Anti- Semitism, and I thank each of them for their commitment to bringing attention and responding to the proliferation of anti-Semitism globally. I especially want to thank and acknowledge Congressman Smith of New Jersey for his commitment to human rights and his ongoing fight against anti-Semitism. This resolution is a strong statement by Congress that, in the face of rising global anti-Semitism, countries, including ours, must prioritize the security and the protection of their Jewish communities. The anti-Semitism we are witnessing around the world today is both unique and longstanding. It is amorphous and it is very direct. It is complex. But in many ways, it is straightforward hatred. Not every case of anti-Semitism will garner international attention like the attack on the Paris supermarket earlier this year. However, Jewish communities around the world experience attacks and intimidation on a regular basis. Just weeks ago, in Marseille, France, an armed man attacked three Jews near a synagogue, including a rabbi and his 19-year-old son. A third man suffered serious injuries from the stabbing. Earlier this year, in Argentina, the phrase ``death to the Jews'' and a swastika were spray painted. In Ukraine, there have been at least three incidents of Holocaust memorials desecrated with swastikas. And in many [[Page H7377]] cities, Jews are simply afraid to walk the streets as Jews. Tragically, these cases are far too commonplace for Jewish communities. No one, Jewish or otherwise, should ever have to accept they will feel targeted, that they will not feel safe, and that their lives are always somewhat at risk. Governments must take a hard look at the trends of bigotry developing in their countries. They must be sufficiently prepared to react preemptively and respond swiftly to cases of violence and intimidation against Jewish communities. This resolution, among other things, calls on countries to build partnerships between communities and law enforcement agencies and to establish standard procedures for responding to threats and attacks by outlining steps to take and the responsibilities for each party. I welcome the historic and continued bipartisan and overwhelming support in Congress for combating anti-Semitism. Tonight, we stand against anti-Semitism, it is true; but where anti-Semitism grows, it is a symptom of the growth of hatred, of bigotry, and of the violation of human rights. I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution and, in turn, to support a world where hatred of any type, anti-Semitism and all hatred, will not be tolerated. That is the world that we envision on the floor of the United States House of Representatives this evening. Again, I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), a very valued member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. CONNOLLY. I thank my friend from New York for his leadership. I also thank Mr. Chris Smith of New Jersey, of course, for his leadership, and that of the taskforce. Mr. Speaker, anti-Semitism and the safety of Jewish communities in Europe are issues with overwhelmingly powerful historical context. The Continent has more than intimate knowledge of the devastation wrought by the purveyors of anti-Semitism. When we say ``never again,'' our threshold for action shouldn't be the impending threat of violence, let alone genocide. Instead, we must marshal the will and resources to stamp out even the conditions or precursors to an environment that allows for such anti-Semitism to flourish. In fact, when we face anti-Semitism today, whether it be here, in Europe, or in any part of the world, we ought to say to those purveyors, ``We are all Jews.'' That is the protection we ought to seek. The proactive measures and collaboration encouraged by this resolution are in keeping with what should be our highest standard for vigilance with respect to anti-Semitism. ``Never again'' isn't about words. It is a pledge that is sacred and must be kept. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen). Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want to thank everybody who has put effort into bringing this resolution to the floor. It is not difficult to stand up--or it shouldn't be difficult, and I don't think it is--to speak against anti-Semitism, but it is a little more difficult to have carved a niche in the United States Government and governments around the world as being a leader in fighting for human rights and against anti-Semitism; and that is what I have seen Congressman Chris Smith do. Congressman Smith is the chair of the Helsinki Commission, of which I am a proud member. I got to know Mr. Smith during the hearings we have had and the travels on the Helsinki Commission. Chris Smith is a super leader in looking out for people and minorities all over the world. So I thank him particularly for his efforts at spearheading this and being vigilant. It is so important. It is hard to fathom that we still have anti-Semitism in this world. It wasn't that long ago that the Holocaust occurred. We have got Holocaust museums and programs throughout different countries. We have had a lot of Holocaust museums and an understanding in Germany as well, but you have got skinheads and disciples of ISIL who continue to spread hate and venom. I know Elie Wiesel, a survivor of the Holocaust, said that people who hate, hate everyone; and I know Elie Wiesel, who was a genius and a prophet, was right. So it is important that we stand up and that we share resources with our European allies to fight anti-Semitism and that this country remains a bulwark in fighting against anti-Semitism. We haven't always been that. We are today, and we will continue to be. I am proud to support this resolution. I thank the Members for bringing it, and I urge all Members to vote for it and pass it. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. I just want to thank my dear colleague, Mr. Cohen, and the other members of the taskforce. This is truly a bipartisan resolution. We all contributed to it. We all care deeply about it. I want him and my other colleagues to know how deeply I respect their efforts, which have been Herculean, to try to end this cruelty that is on the rise in Europe, in the United States, and in other parts. We know in the Middle East it is perhaps as bad as it has ever been; and the diaspora that makes its way into Europe is carrying that hatred with them--not all of them, of course, but a sizable number--presenting more and more challenges. This is truly a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank Mr. Cohen for his comments. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman), who is a newer Member, but she has certainly made her mark. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I want to thank Mr. Engel for giving me this opportunity to speak, and I want to thank my colleague and neighbor, Congressman Chris Smith, for introducing this resolution. I stand in proud support of the resolution, and I urge its passage. Mr. Speaker, more than 70 years removed from the Holocaust, Jewish residents in Europe face renewed waves of anti-Semitic violence. The Pew Research Center reported that global harassment of Jews has reached a 7-year high. This violence is pronounced in Europe, where the desecration of synagogues, cemeteries, schools, and other violent incidents have spiked over the past few years. The Jewish Community Security Trust reported more than 1,100 anti- Jewish incidents in the United Kingdom in 2014, including 81 violent assaults. That same year, according to the French Jewish advocacy group CRIF, anti-Semitic incidents doubled in that nation. Troubling, violent, and even deadly anti-Semitic attacks have also occurred in countries such as Denmark, Belgium, and Germany. As the leader in the international community, the United States plays a very vital role in denouncing anti-Semitism and hate. The national director of the Anti-Defamation League has attributed U.S. public figures speaking out against hate as contributing to steady decreases in anti-Semitic attitudes domestically. As a nation founded on equality and religious freedom, we share a responsibility to stand against anti-Semitism and against hate in all its manifestations, whether it is the hate that manifested as four people were killed at the HyperCacher Jewish supermarket outside of Paris this past January, or the hate that manifested as the nine Americans killed in the massacre at Mother Emmanuel AME in Charleston, or the hate manifested as six killed at the Sikh Temple in Oak Creek, or the hate that manifested in the flames that have recently burned countless Black churches to the ground. We must join together as a nation and a global community to denounce hate wherever it may appear and uproot weeds of hate wherever they may sprout. With that, I urge my colleagues to support this. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel), a very valued member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. [[Page H7378]] Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. I thank Mr. Engel, Mr. Smith, and my colleagues on the anti-Semitism Taskforce. Mr. Speaker, Susanne Winter, a member of the Austrian Parliament from the extreme rightwing Freedom Party of Austria, received the following post on her Facebook: ``The Zionist money Jews are the global problem. Europe, and in particular Germany, are now getting what they deserve from Zionist Jews, particularly rich Zionist Jews in the USA.'' Winter responded to the post on Saturday. She said: ``It is great. You took the words right out of my mouth.'' Mr. Speaker, this resolution condemning anti-Semitism in Europe takes the words right out of my mouth, and I support it emphatically. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. History has shown us the tragedy of what can happen when this sort of hatred goes on unchecked. It is past time for governments and communities to focus on the rising tide of anti-Semitism in Europe and do whatever it takes to turn it back. This resolution sends a message that we are keeping a close eye on the problem and that action is needed now to meet this challenge. I encourage my colleagues to support this measure. I want to also compliment my good friend Chris Smith. We all worked hard on this, but no one works harder than he in combating anti- Semitism. If you know Chris Smith, you know that, when he gets obsessed with something, he follows it to the end; and it, as always, has a great conclusion. He is obsessed against hatred. He is obsessed against bad things happening to any group of people. I am very proud of the work that he has done through the years, and I want to thank him for his leadership in combating anti-Semitism. I urge my colleagues to support this measure. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Again, I want to thank Mr. Engel for his leadership and his kind words. Again, this is truly a collaborative effort, and I want to thank him for it. Mr. Speaker, at a congressional hearing I chaired in 2002--and I chaired about 18 such hearings on combating anti-Semitism--Dr. Shimon Samuels of the Wiesenthal Center said: ``The Holocaust for 30 years after the war acted as a protective Teflon against blatant anti-Semitic expression, especially in Europe. That Teflon has eroded, and what was considered distasteful and politically incorrect is becoming simply an opinion.'' He warned ominously, saying, ``cocktail chatter at fine English dinners can end as Molotov cocktails against synagogues.'' Mr. Speaker, Abraham Lincoln once said that ``to sin by silence when they should protest makes cowards of men.'' Silence is not an option. And, I would equally say, nor is inaction. If our fight is to succeed, we need government officials at all levels to not just denounce but to act without hesitation or delay whenever and wherever anti-Semitic acts occur. There are no exceptions. The purveyors of hate never take a holiday or grow weary, nor should we. H. Res. 354 is a best practices resolution designed to seriously inspire and challenge the governments of Europe, especially law enforcement and their homeland security agencies, to partner with their respective Jewish communities to mitigate and hopefully end and eradicate anti-Semitism in all of its ugly manifestations. {time} 1945 United States law enforcement, Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department, the FBI, as well as State Homeland Security agencies, including in my own State of New Jersey, have been robust and aggressive in combating anti-Semitism here. We need to replicate this and encourage others to follow our lead and that of the UK, and I do hope we will do that. This resolution is broadly bipartisan. I want to thank Nathaniel Hurd, on our staff, for his tremendous work on this resolution, working with all of his respective staffers and Members, of course, to bring this about. And I want to thank the leadership for bringing it to the floor this evening. I urge a ``yea'' vote. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 354, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H7372-H7378] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1900 EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING SAFETY AND SECURITY OF EUROPEAN JEWISH COMMUNITIES Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 354) expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the safety and security of Jewish communities in Europe. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: H. Res. 354 Whereas anti-Semitic rhetoric and acts, including violent attacks on people and places of faith, have increased in frequency, variety, and severity in many countries in Europe; Whereas the French Service de Protection de la Communaute Juive (Jewish Community Security Service) reported an increase in anti-Semitic acts in France between 2013 to 2014 (from 423 acts to 851), including an increase in violent ones (from 105 acts to 241); Whereas the Community Security Trust reported an increase in anti-Semitic acts in [[Page H7373]] the United Kingdom between 2013 to 2014 (from 535 acts to 1,168), including an increase in violent ones (from 69 to 81); and the Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary European Jewry reported an increase in anti-Semitic acts between 2013 and 2014 in Germany (from 788 acts to 1076, including 36 violent acts to 76), Belgium (from 64 acts to 109, including 11 violent acts to 30), Austria (from 137 acts to 255, including 4 violent acts to 9), and Italy (from 45 to 90, including 12 violent acts to 23); Whereas the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported, in its latest available statistics, 870 incidents in 2012 with anti-Jewish bias motivation, including 13 violent incidents, and 625 incidents in 2013 with anti-Jewish bias motivation, including four violent incidents; Whereas anti-Semitic attacks have been increasingly directed at places of ordinary daily life and places of worship, including-- (1) the violent extremist who pledged his loyalty to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) and attacked a kosher supermarket in Paris, France, January 9, 2015, murdering four Jewish patrons; and (2) the violent extremist who pledged his loyalty to ISIS and attacked the Great Synagogue in Copenhagen, Denmark, during a bat mitzvah celebration, February 15, 2015, murdering a member of the Jewish community on security duty, and wounding two members of the Danish Police Service; Whereas anti-Semitic attacks are threats to the fundamental freedoms, rights, security, and diversity of all citizens, societies, and countries in which they occur; Whereas governments have primary responsibility for the security and safety of all of their citizens and therefore primary responsibility for monitoring, preventing, and responding to anti-Semitic violence; Whereas Jewish community groups that focus on strengthening safety awareness, crisis management, and preparedness are essential to keeping members of the Jewish community safe, and complement efforts of government and inter-governmental entities; Whereas keeping members of Jewish communities safe requires government agencies, intergovernmental institutions and agencies, and law enforcement associations, formally recognizing and partnering with Jewish community groups that focus on safety awareness and crisis management and preparedness; Whereas in the United States, United Kingdom, and France, there are examples of formal recognition, partnership, training, and information-sharing between government entities and Jewish community security groups that have strengthened these countries and contributed to the safety and security of Jewish communities; Whereas Jewish community groups, consortia, and initiatives, have formed and are forming to focus on safety awareness, crisis management, and preparedness, and partner with law enforcement entities and thought leaders; Whereas information-sharing and action-focused campaigns, including the national ``If You See Something, Say Something'' campaign of the Department of Homeland Security, which rely on members of the public reporting suspicious activity to law enforcement personnel, are critical to preventing violent attacks on individuals and communities; Whereas relevant information, research, and analysis is vital to strengthening the preparedness, prevention, mitigation, and response of Jewish communities and law enforcement agencies; Whereas broader efforts to counter violent extremism, and efforts to counter anti-Semitism, should be integrated with each other as appropriate and share best practices; Whereas in the Berlin Declaration of April 29, 2004, participating States of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) condemned anti-Semitism and committed themselves to specific actions to combat it, and to collect and maintain reliable information and statistics about anti-Semitic crimes; Whereas, on December 6, 2013, the Ministerial Council of the OSCE, which is composed of the Foreign Ministers of participating States, adopted Decision number 3/13 entitled ``Freedom of Thought, Conscience, Religion, or Belief'', emphasizing ``the link between security and full respect for the freedom of thought'', and committing member governments to adopt ``policies to promote respect and protection for places of worship and religious sites, religious monuments, cemeteries and shrines against vandalism and destruction'', among other specific actions; Whereas, on December 5, 2014, the Ministerial Council of the OSCE adopted Declaration number 8, the Basel Declaration, on ``Enhancing Efforts to Combat Anti-Semitism'', in which members of the Council stated, ``We express our concern at the disconcerting number of anti-Semitic incidents that continue to take place in the OSCE area and remain a challenge to stability and security'' and ``We stress the importance of States collaborating with civil society through effective partnerships and strengthened dialogue and co- operation on combating anti-Semitism''; and Whereas in 2004, Congress passed the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act, which established an Office to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism, headed by a Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives-- (1) urges the United States Government to work closely with European governments and their law enforcement agencies, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the European Union, Europol, and Interpol, encouraging them to-- (A) formally recognize, partner, train, and share information with Jewish community security groups to strengthen preparedness, prevention, mitigation, and response related to anti-Semitic attacks and to support related research initiatives; (B) consider the formal partnerships in the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, between government entities and Jewish community security groups, as examples of partnership, training, and information-sharing; (C) support assessments of the-- (i) general environment in which anti-Semitic attacks occur; (ii) data on types of crimes committed and the response from law enforcement; (iii) relationships of Jewish community groups with local law enforcement agencies, including joint training opportunities and information sharing; (iv) preparedness, including emergency response plans, of Jewish community groups; and (v) response of local law enforcement systems to anti- Semitic attacks, including incident reporting, initial response, and the prioritization and prosecution of those crimes; (D) utilize these assessments to help make adjustments to their strategies and efforts to combat anti-Semitism as needed; (E) help Jewish communities develop common, baseline safety standards; (F) consider developing a standardized pan-European information-sharing and alerting system that can include governmental and non-governmental agencies, as well as Jewish communities; (G) develop safety-awareness and suspicious activity reporting campaigns; (H) integrate, as appropriate, efforts to combat violent extremism and efforts to combat anti-Semitism; (I) ensure law enforcement personnel are effectively trained to monitor, prevent, and respond to anti-Semitic violence, and to partner with Jewish communities; (J) reaffirm and work for the implementation of the OSCE declarations, decisions, and other commitments focusing on anti-Semitism; and (K) ensure senior officials, with commensurate authority and resources, have been appointed or designated to combat anti-Semitism and collaborate with governmental and inter- governmental agencies, law enforcement agencies, Jewish community groups, and other civil society groups; (2) reaffirms its support for the mandate of the United States Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism as part of the broader policy priority of fostering international religious freedom; and (3) urges the Secretary of State to continue robust United States reporting on anti-Semitism by the Department of State and the Special Envoy to Combat and Monitor Anti-Semitism. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. General Leave Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous materials in the Record. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, anti-Semitism in Europe is on the rise. Jewish communities there are on the edge. Fearing this rise in hatred toward them may signal a return to Europe's darkest days. This sad reality is well documented by authoritative reports from the Pew Foundation, the Anti-Defamation League, and others. In 2015, a survey by the Anti-Defamation League showed that over 25 percent of European respondents said that they harbored anti-Semitic feelings; and that number had significantly increased from the year before in a few countries, such as in the Netherlands and in the United Kingdom. It is a phenomenon clearly felt on the streets, seen scrawled across synagogues and in desecrated burial sites, and even demonstrated in deadly acts of terror. We all recall the horrific attacks on the Charlie Hebdo offices and [[Page H7374]] the grocery in Paris and the later attacks at a synagogue and a cafe in Copenhagen. Just last month in Manchester, four Jewish youths were attacked by thugs who shouted their hatred of Jews. One of the victims, a 17-year-old boy, had to be hospitalized. The rise of such attacks and hate-filled rhetoric is causing Europe's Jews to look over their shoulders and even consider fleeing communities that they have been a part of for over 20 generations, to seek safety elsewhere. Targeted violence against the Jewish people or any other religious or minority group is repugnant. Sadly, the Jewish people have been among the most persecuted in the world. When you think of the consequences of the Holocaust, when you think of the consequences of the Inquisition, the magnitude of it comes home when you realize that there are as many Jews left alive on this planet today as there were during the early days of the Roman Empire. The slaughter of these people, their persecution, leaves for humanity the thought: Have we learned nothing from the Holocaust? European leaders must unequivocally send this message to their people and act to provide greater protection for their Jewish citizens. This important resolution proposes several commonsense steps for our European allies to consider to improve the safety of their Jewish communities: It calls for establishing partnerships between law enforcement and Jewish community groups in order to improve the security plans, training, and enhanced law enforcement response to these anti-Semitic attacks. Improved sharing of information between government agencies, law enforcement, and Jewish community groups is another key recommendation. Finally, this measure encourages European nations to improve communication between themselves and with the United States to analyze trends in anti-Semitic crimes and to share best practices in combating extremism. As we learned from the Holocaust, anti-Semitic sentiment can lay the foundation for persecution of Jewish communities under the guise of political protest or under the guise of nationalistic pride. That is why leaders of free societies everywhere must expose these prejudices for the dangers they pose to their communities. I want to recognize Congressman Chris Smith of New Jersey for authoring this important measure. And, as always, I thank Ranking Member Engel for his help on this measure and in getting this bill to the floor. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this timely resolution. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in support of this measure. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Royce, again, for being on top of all these very important issues. Under his leadership, the Foreign Affairs Committee has really taken the lead on important issues such as this. I want to also thank Mr. Smith from New Jersey for sponsoring this resolution. As the chair of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations, Chris Smith has been focused on the disturbing surge of anti-Semitism in Europe. He is always there. He always speaks out forcefully about anti-Semitism and other things that are important to him. I am grateful for his leadership. It is disappointing that we still need to take up this sort of measure. As we all know, anti-Semitism, that ancient hatred, has continued smoldering through the centuries. Week after week, we hear reports of new anti-Semitic attacks: the vandalism of the Babi Yar Holocaust site in Kiev--I have been there a number of times. It is very disheartening that that would be desecrated--the targeting of the Great Synagogue in Copenhagen; and, of course, the unfathomable attack, as Chairman Royce mentioned, in Paris last January. We would be foolish to dismiss this surge in anti-Semitism as the work of violent, fringe individuals. In countries like Hungary and Greece, shamefully, we see explicitly anti-Semitic political parties winning seats and elections. It is deeply troubling, very disturbing. It wasn't even a century ago that we heard this canary in the coal mine. You can draw a straight line from early indifference and inaction to the darkest chapter in human history. The lessons of the Holocaust are seared in our collective consciousness. Those lessons are telling us to throw water on this fire before it burns out of control. I was born after World War II in New York, and I remember hearing family members talking about anti-Semitism. The general prevailing thought was, well, this is something that will never happen again, that the Holocaust was so horrific that world humanity would understand that something like this could never happen again. When I say ``never happen again,'' I mean to any group--not just to Jewish groups, to any group. This cannot be tolerated, and one has to just look around the world to see all the hatred and all the people who are being slaughtered because of who they are or what tribe they are from or what people they are from. It is particularly galling in Europe, where so many people--6 million Jewish people--perished during the Holocaust, that anti-Semitism would rear its ugly head again. One would think that people would be ashamed and would not want to go down the anti-Semitic path again. Here it is, barely 70 years after the end of World War II, and we see an alarming rise. And it is an alarming rise from a lot of different communities. There are skinheads and people who have always uttered anti-Semitic remarks. We also, unfortunately, have a number of people living in Europe of Middle Eastern descent who also are using the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians to, again, fan the fires of anti-Semitic hatred. As the numbers of people from Arab lands go to Europe, some, unfortunately, are fanning the fires of anti-Semitism. That has to be condemned and stopped as well. Anti-Semitism needs to be condemned no matter who is espousing it, no matter where it is coming from, and no matter what they are saying. It is really time to call it the way it is. So we need greater vigilance by law enforcement when Jewish communities in Europe are under threat. But it is not that simple. We also need greater leadership from officials by speaking out against anti-Semitism. We had a bill just a couple of hours ago--maybe not even a couple of hours ago--which talked about the Palestinian leadership not condemning anti-Semitism and having incitement of things that result in anti-Semitic attacks. So this is the same thing. It is the same thing, whether it is in Europe or the Middle East. It is rearing its ugly head, and it is time for us to continue to speak out against it. The United States of America has always been the bastion of society, and the world looks to us for leadership. I think it is very important that the United States Congress is doing this now. So we need greater vigilance by law enforcement when Jewish communities in Europe are under threat, but it is not that simple. We also need greater leadership from officials by speaking out against anti-Semitism. We need stronger partnerships with Jewish communities to help them develop their own safety responses, community policing techniques, and information sharing with government agencies. We need to foster cultures that respect diversity and don't ostracize minority groups. I condemn any kind of ostracizing of any minority group in this country or around the world. We need to step in and say that we will not tolerate it. So this resolution encourages these efforts, and I encourage my colleagues to support it. Anti-Semitism is rearing its ugly head, but it can be defeated. I think what the Congress is doing today is a very good step in that direction. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the author of this measure, and I ask unanimous consent that he be allowed to control the time. Mr. Smith, as U.S. chairman of the Helsinki Commission, works with our European allies to improve the security and improve the safety of these Jewish communities in Europe. We appreciate his authorship of this resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? [[Page H7375]] There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce for his leadership on this very important human rights issue, as he has done so ably and effectively on all of these issues, particularly his leadership on Iran; and that, of course, would be echoed with Eliot Engel's excellent work there as well. This is a group of leaders that have made a huge difference. So thank you, Chairman Royce, for that. H. Res. 354, Mr. Speaker, prescribes specific, effective actions that government should take in response to the deadly threats to the Jewish communities in Europe. As we all know, the number of violent anti- Semitic attacks have increased from 100 to 400 percent in some European countries since 2013 alone. Murders in Paris and Copenhagen and elsewhere remind us that there are those who are motivated by anti- Semitic hate and have the will and the means to kill. I would just note parenthetically that my work in combating anti- Semitism began back in 1981, in my first term, from this very podium, speaking out in favor of Jewish refuseniks. I joined Mark Levin and the NCSJ 1 year later in 1982 on a trip to the Soviet Union where we met with men and women who were targeted by the KGB and the Soviet evil empire simply because they were Jewish. Sadly, anti-Semitism has not abated, and in recent years, it has actually worsened. {time} 1915 This resolution calls for the United States Government to work with our European allies on specific actions that are essential to keep European Jewish communities safe and secure. It is based on consultations with the leading experts who are working directly with these communities. The resolution focuses on the formal partnerships between European law enforcement agencies and Jewish community security groups. Here in the United States, Mr. Speaker, the collaboration between the Department of Homeland Security and Security Community Network--an initiative of the Jewish Federation of North America and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations--has been essential to protecting Jewish communities here. The formal partnerships between the Community Security Trust in the United Kingdom and the Jewish Community Security Service in France and their respective governments are also excellent models that need to be emulated. The resolution emphasizes the importance of consistent, two-way communication and information sharing between law enforcement agencies and Jewish community groups. It encourages the development of a pan- European information sharing, communication, and alerting system, and envisions governments, intergovernmental agencies, and Jewish communities working together on it. Such a system should function day- round and year-round and include training for personnel who are implementing it. The resolution also calls for European governments to support assessments in several key areas and accordingly adjust their actions and strategies. Details matter. The assessments should gather and analyze data on crimes committed, response from law enforcement, types of attacks or incidents that are most prevalent, and the types of targets that are most at risk. It is essential to understand how law enforcement agencies usually receive reports of anti-Semitic crimes and what initial actions they take when a report is filed. I remember years ago, when I offered a resolution at the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, we heard that it was just hooliganism and other kinds of acts done by young people when you spray-paint a swastika on a tombstone in a Jewish cemetery, when you deface a synagogue, and you attack a man simply because he is wearing a yarmulke. Clearly, these are acts of anti-Semitic hate; yet, they were being dismissed as something that was other. Assessments are also needed on Jewish community security groups, particularly of their capabilities, resources, relationships with local law enforcement agencies, preparedness, including emergency response plans, and the extent to which their decisionmaking is based on the best available information, analysis, and practices. The resolution calls for governments to use these assessments to help these community groups develop common baseline safety standards. These standards should include, as I said before, training, controlling access to physical facilities, physical security measures, including cameras, and crisis communications. Emergency exercises and simulations, mapping access to facilities, and sharing information with law enforcement agencies should also be part of the standards. These assessments, Mr. Speaker, will help achieve the resolution's call for law enforcement personnel to be well trained to monitor, prevent, and respond to anti-Semitic violence and to partner with Jewish communities. For all of these assessments, governments should draw information from sources that include Jewish groups, law enforcement agencies, independent human rights NGOs, research initiatives, and other civil society groups and leaders. H. Res. 354 calls for safety awareness and suspicious activity reporting campaigns, like ``If you see something, say something'' here in the United States. Other aspects of the resolution include appropriately integrating initiatives to counter violent extremism and those to combat anti-Semitism and the urgency of implementing the declarations, decisions, and other commitments of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that focus on anti-Semitism. To accomplish these goals, the resolution calls for European governments to ensure that they appoint or designate senior officials with the necessary authority and resources to combat anti-Semitism and collaborate with governmental and intergovernmental agencies, law enforcement, and Jewish community groups. Finally, the resolution reaffirms support for the mandate of the United States Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism as part of the broader policy of fostering international religious freedom and urges the Secretary of State to continue robust U.S. reporting on anti- Semitism by the Department of State and the Special Envoy to Combat and Monitor Anti-Semitism. I would note parenthetically that I authored the amendment to the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act of 2004, introduced and sponsored by Senator Voinovich. My amendment created the Office to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism within the State Department. That has proven to be a key tool in this fight. Mr. Speaker, the resolution has the support of leading organizations, and it has 89 cosponsors, including all eight of the co-chairs of the Bipartisan Taskforce for Combating Anti-Semitism. I would like to acknowledge, Mr. Speaker, John Farmer, Jr., and Paul Goldenberg for their tireless efforts and dedication and leadership in fighting anti-Semitism and terrorism over the years. John is a former attorney general of New Jersey and is now on the steering committee of the Institute for Emergency Preparedness and Homeland Security and is the codirector of the Faith-Based Communities Security Program at Rutgers University. Paul is the executive director of the Secure Community Network and a senior adviser to the Institute and the program. Several major Jewish communities in Europe have relied on their counsel, and both have spent time on the ground within these communities. Finally, I would like to acknowledge and single out for very, very special thanks and recognition Rabbi Andy Baker, personal representative of the OSCE chair in the Office on Combating Anti- Semitism and director of the International Jewish Affairs for the American Jewish Committee. He has been critical--critical--to American leadership in Europe and in the United States in the fight against anti-Semitism. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), my good friend and the ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to particularly thank Chairman Ed Royce [[Page H7376]] and my good friend, our ranking member of the committee, Eliot Engel, and all those who were so involved in putting this important resolution together. I rise in support of House Resolution 354. It was introduced by the co-chairs of the Bipartisan Taskforce for Combating Anti-Semitism. In the aftermath of appalling anti-Semitic incidents throughout Europe, including the devastating terrorist attacks at the Paris kosher supermarket and the Great Synagogue of Copenhagen, this important resolution urges the United States Government to help improve the safety and security of Jewish communities in Europe. From Austria to Belgium, Germany to the United Kingdom, Ukraine to France, there has been a sharp rise in assaults on Jewish individuals and acts of vandalism on Jewish places of worship, cemeteries, and memorials. Such destruction and desecration is unacceptable and must be stopped. That is why this resolution is so critical. It highlights specific ways the administration can work with European governments, especially law enforcement agencies, to formally recognize and partner with Jewish organizations to develop common safety standards, alert systems, information-sharing mechanisms, and ensure that local law enforcement personnel are effectively trained to monitor, prevent, and respond to anti-Semitic violence. I want to express my appreciation to my fellow co-chairs of the Anti- Semitism Taskforce, Representatives Smith, Engel, Granger, Israel, Ros- Lehtinen, Deutch, and Roskam. The task force remains committed to working across regions, religions, and party lines to condemn all anti- Semitism and fight for the right of Jews to live freely as Jews without fear. Before closing, I also want to express my strong support for H. Res. 293, which condemns anti-Israel and anti-Semitic incitement within the Palestinian Authority and calls on President Abbas to discourage such despicable behavior. The latest cycle of terrorism against Israel must end. The only way it will end is if Palestinian leaders take genuine and immediate steps to denounce all violence and promote security cooperation, coexistence, and peace with Israel. As the ranking member of the Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs of the Committee on Appropriations, I will continue to do everything in my power to bolster Israel's security to combat incitement and to promote stability and peaceful coexistence throughout the world. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), the chair of the Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the former chair of the full committee. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of Mr. Smith's bill, House Resolution 354, expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the safety and security of Jewish communities in Europe. I was an original cosponsor of this resolution. I want to highlight the work of my good friend and colleague, Chris Smith, for his leadership on this issue and, indeed, for his tireless efforts to fight anti-Semitism and support international religious freedom. I would also like to thank our fellow co-chairs of the congressional Bipartisan Taskforce for Combating Anti-Semitism for demonstrating their leadership on this issue in Congress and for raising the level of awareness and dialogue within our body related to global anti-Semitism. In recent years, Mr. Speaker, the protection and the promotion of these values have moved from being part and parcel of our foreign policy objective to not even ranking as one of our top priorities. It is time. It is way past time that we make respect for human rights and the protection of religious and ethnic minorities a top priority for our foreign policy objectives and show real leadership and show that we have the will and the moral imperative to promote our values across the world. The terror group ISIL is rising in the Middle East. It is seeking to establish an Islamic caliphate. It wants to wipe out the region's religious minorities of all kinds and anyone who does not adhere to its radical brand of Islam. This, along with an alarming rise in anti-Semitism in Europe and other attacks on religious freedom across the globe, underscores why Mr. Smith's measure before us today is so timely, is so important. It urges our government to work with European governments and law enforcement agencies in order to help them fight the rise of anti- Semitism across the continent and to make combating anti-Semitism part of our government's broader policy of promoting international religious freedom. Europe is at the dawn of a lamentably repeated and dangerous era, one of anti-Semitism, often masked through a political anti-Israel stance. If we don't move to act now, Mr. Speaker, we may see more deadly attacks, like the murder of four Jews in a kosher supermarket in Paris earlier this year. We in the United States must be at the forefront, leading the effort, helping other nations develop a more comprehensive approach to confronting the rising anti-Semitism problem. This measure before us today establishes a good framework in moving forward. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the task force members, of which I am humbled to be just a small part, Congresspersons Chris Smith, Kay Granger, Peter Roskam, Eliot Engel, Nita Lowey, Ted Deutch, and Steve Israel, all of us working together to highlight the spread of anti-Semitism and steps we must take to stem this tide. I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution brought forth by the gentleman from New Jersey. I thank all of the Members who have worked on the task force to bring this forward. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on both sides? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York has 11 minutes remaining. The gentleman from New Jersey has 3 minutes remaining. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch), who is the ranking member of the Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and a good friend. {time} 1930 Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, for yielding and for his tireless work to address the threat of anti-Semitism around the world. Mr. Speaker, this resolution was a collaborative effort among my fellow co-chairs of the Bipartisan Taskforce for Combating Anti- Semitism, and I thank each of them for their commitment to bringing attention and responding to the proliferation of anti-Semitism globally. I especially want to thank and acknowledge Congressman Smith of New Jersey for his commitment to human rights and his ongoing fight against anti-Semitism. This resolution is a strong statement by Congress that, in the face of rising global anti-Semitism, countries, including ours, must prioritize the security and the protection of their Jewish communities. The anti-Semitism we are witnessing around the world today is both unique and longstanding. It is amorphous and it is very direct. It is complex. But in many ways, it is straightforward hatred. Not every case of anti-Semitism will garner international attention like the attack on the Paris supermarket earlier this year. However, Jewish communities around the world experience attacks and intimidation on a regular basis. Just weeks ago, in Marseille, France, an armed man attacked three Jews near a synagogue, including a rabbi and his 19-year-old son. A third man suffered serious injuries from the stabbing. Earlier this year, in Argentina, the phrase ``death to the Jews'' and a swastika were spray painted. In Ukraine, there have been at least three incidents of Holocaust memorials desecrated with swastikas. And in many [[Page H7377]] cities, Jews are simply afraid to walk the streets as Jews. Tragically, these cases are far too commonplace for Jewish communities. No one, Jewish or otherwise, should ever have to accept they will feel targeted, that they will not feel safe, and that their lives are always somewhat at risk. Governments must take a hard look at the trends of bigotry developing in their countries. They must be sufficiently prepared to react preemptively and respond swiftly to cases of violence and intimidation against Jewish communities. This resolution, among other things, calls on countries to build partnerships between communities and law enforcement agencies and to establish standard procedures for responding to threats and attacks by outlining steps to take and the responsibilities for each party. I welcome the historic and continued bipartisan and overwhelming support in Congress for combating anti-Semitism. Tonight, we stand against anti-Semitism, it is true; but where anti-Semitism grows, it is a symptom of the growth of hatred, of bigotry, and of the violation of human rights. I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution and, in turn, to support a world where hatred of any type, anti-Semitism and all hatred, will not be tolerated. That is the world that we envision on the floor of the United States House of Representatives this evening. Again, I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), a very valued member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. CONNOLLY. I thank my friend from New York for his leadership. I also thank Mr. Chris Smith of New Jersey, of course, for his leadership, and that of the taskforce. Mr. Speaker, anti-Semitism and the safety of Jewish communities in Europe are issues with overwhelmingly powerful historical context. The Continent has more than intimate knowledge of the devastation wrought by the purveyors of anti-Semitism. When we say ``never again,'' our threshold for action shouldn't be the impending threat of violence, let alone genocide. Instead, we must marshal the will and resources to stamp out even the conditions or precursors to an environment that allows for such anti-Semitism to flourish. In fact, when we face anti-Semitism today, whether it be here, in Europe, or in any part of the world, we ought to say to those purveyors, ``We are all Jews.'' That is the protection we ought to seek. The proactive measures and collaboration encouraged by this resolution are in keeping with what should be our highest standard for vigilance with respect to anti-Semitism. ``Never again'' isn't about words. It is a pledge that is sacred and must be kept. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen). Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want to thank everybody who has put effort into bringing this resolution to the floor. It is not difficult to stand up--or it shouldn't be difficult, and I don't think it is--to speak against anti-Semitism, but it is a little more difficult to have carved a niche in the United States Government and governments around the world as being a leader in fighting for human rights and against anti-Semitism; and that is what I have seen Congressman Chris Smith do. Congressman Smith is the chair of the Helsinki Commission, of which I am a proud member. I got to know Mr. Smith during the hearings we have had and the travels on the Helsinki Commission. Chris Smith is a super leader in looking out for people and minorities all over the world. So I thank him particularly for his efforts at spearheading this and being vigilant. It is so important. It is hard to fathom that we still have anti-Semitism in this world. It wasn't that long ago that the Holocaust occurred. We have got Holocaust museums and programs throughout different countries. We have had a lot of Holocaust museums and an understanding in Germany as well, but you have got skinheads and disciples of ISIL who continue to spread hate and venom. I know Elie Wiesel, a survivor of the Holocaust, said that people who hate, hate everyone; and I know Elie Wiesel, who was a genius and a prophet, was right. So it is important that we stand up and that we share resources with our European allies to fight anti-Semitism and that this country remains a bulwark in fighting against anti-Semitism. We haven't always been that. We are today, and we will continue to be. I am proud to support this resolution. I thank the Members for bringing it, and I urge all Members to vote for it and pass it. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. I just want to thank my dear colleague, Mr. Cohen, and the other members of the taskforce. This is truly a bipartisan resolution. We all contributed to it. We all care deeply about it. I want him and my other colleagues to know how deeply I respect their efforts, which have been Herculean, to try to end this cruelty that is on the rise in Europe, in the United States, and in other parts. We know in the Middle East it is perhaps as bad as it has ever been; and the diaspora that makes its way into Europe is carrying that hatred with them--not all of them, of course, but a sizable number--presenting more and more challenges. This is truly a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank Mr. Cohen for his comments. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman), who is a newer Member, but she has certainly made her mark. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I want to thank Mr. Engel for giving me this opportunity to speak, and I want to thank my colleague and neighbor, Congressman Chris Smith, for introducing this resolution. I stand in proud support of the resolution, and I urge its passage. Mr. Speaker, more than 70 years removed from the Holocaust, Jewish residents in Europe face renewed waves of anti-Semitic violence. The Pew Research Center reported that global harassment of Jews has reached a 7-year high. This violence is pronounced in Europe, where the desecration of synagogues, cemeteries, schools, and other violent incidents have spiked over the past few years. The Jewish Community Security Trust reported more than 1,100 anti- Jewish incidents in the United Kingdom in 2014, including 81 violent assaults. That same year, according to the French Jewish advocacy group CRIF, anti-Semitic incidents doubled in that nation. Troubling, violent, and even deadly anti-Semitic attacks have also occurred in countries such as Denmark, Belgium, and Germany. As the leader in the international community, the United States plays a very vital role in denouncing anti-Semitism and hate. The national director of the Anti-Defamation League has attributed U.S. public figures speaking out against hate as contributing to steady decreases in anti-Semitic attitudes domestically. As a nation founded on equality and religious freedom, we share a responsibility to stand against anti-Semitism and against hate in all its manifestations, whether it is the hate that manifested as four people were killed at the HyperCacher Jewish supermarket outside of Paris this past January, or the hate that manifested as the nine Americans killed in the massacre at Mother Emmanuel AME in Charleston, or the hate manifested as six killed at the Sikh Temple in Oak Creek, or the hate that manifested in the flames that have recently burned countless Black churches to the ground. We must join together as a nation and a global community to denounce hate wherever it may appear and uproot weeds of hate wherever they may sprout. With that, I urge my colleagues to support this. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel), a very valued member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. [[Page H7378]] Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. I thank Mr. Engel, Mr. Smith, and my colleagues on the anti-Semitism Taskforce. Mr. Speaker, Susanne Winter, a member of the Austrian Parliament from the extreme rightwing Freedom Party of Austria, received the following post on her Facebook: ``The Zionist money Jews are the global problem. Europe, and in particular Germany, are now getting what they deserve from Zionist Jews, particularly rich Zionist Jews in the USA.'' Winter responded to the post on Saturday. She said: ``It is great. You took the words right out of my mouth.'' Mr. Speaker, this resolution condemning anti-Semitism in Europe takes the words right out of my mouth, and I support it emphatically. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. History has shown us the tragedy of what can happen when this sort of hatred goes on unchecked. It is past time for governments and communities to focus on the rising tide of anti-Semitism in Europe and do whatever it takes to turn it back. This resolution sends a message that we are keeping a close eye on the problem and that action is needed now to meet this challenge. I encourage my colleagues to support this measure. I want to also compliment my good friend Chris Smith. We all worked hard on this, but no one works harder than he in combating anti- Semitism. If you know Chris Smith, you know that, when he gets obsessed with something, he follows it to the end; and it, as always, has a great conclusion. He is obsessed against hatred. He is obsessed against bad things happening to any group of people. I am very proud of the work that he has done through the years, and I want to thank him for his leadership in combating anti-Semitism. I urge my colleagues to support this measure. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Again, I want to thank Mr. Engel for his leadership and his kind words. Again, this is truly a collaborative effort, and I want to thank him for it. Mr. Speaker, at a congressional hearing I chaired in 2002--and I chaired about 18 such hearings on combating anti-Semitism--Dr. Shimon Samuels of the Wiesenthal Center said: ``The Holocaust for 30 years after the war acted as a protective Teflon against blatant anti-Semitic expression, especially in Europe. That Teflon has eroded, and what was considered distasteful and politically incorrect is becoming simply an opinion.'' He warned ominously, saying, ``cocktail chatter at fine English dinners can end as Molotov cocktails against synagogues.'' Mr. Speaker, Abraham Lincoln once said that ``to sin by silence when they should protest makes cowards of men.'' Silence is not an option. And, I would equally say, nor is inaction. If our fight is to succeed, we need government officials at all levels to not just denounce but to act without hesitation or delay whenever and wherever anti-Semitic acts occur. There are no exceptions. The purveyors of hate never take a holiday or grow weary, nor should we. H. Res. 354 is a best practices resolution designed to seriously inspire and challenge the governments of Europe, especially law enforcement and their homeland security agencies, to partner with their respective Jewish communities to mitigate and hopefully end and eradicate anti-Semitism in all of its ugly manifestations. {time} 1945 United States law enforcement, Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department, the FBI, as well as State Homeland Security agencies, including in my own State of New Jersey, have been robust and aggressive in combating anti-Semitism here. We need to replicate this and encourage others to follow our lead and that of the UK, and I do hope we will do that. This resolution is broadly bipartisan. I want to thank Nathaniel Hurd, on our staff, for his tremendous work on this resolution, working with all of his respective staffers and Members, of course, to bring this about. And I want to thank the leadership for bringing it to the floor this evening. I urge a ``yea'' vote. I yield back the balance of my time. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 354, as amended. The question was taken. The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The yeas and nays were ordered. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H7372-H7378] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] {time} 1900 EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING SAFETY AND SECURITY OF EUROPEAN JEWISH COMMUNITIES Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 354) expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the safety and security of Jewish communities in Europe. The Clerk read the title of the resolution. The text of the resolution is as follows: H. Res. 354 Whereas anti-Semitic rhetoric and acts, including violent attacks on people and places of faith, have increased in frequency, variety, and severity in many countries in Europe; Whereas the French Service de Protection de la Communaute Juive (Jewish Community Security Service) reported an increase in anti-Semitic acts in France between 2013 to 2014 (from 423 acts to 851), including an increase in violent ones (from 105 acts to 241); Whereas the Community Security Trust reported an increase in anti-Semitic acts in [[Page H7373]] the United Kingdom between 2013 to 2014 (from 535 acts to 1,168), including an increase in violent ones (from 69 to 81); and the Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary European Jewry reported an increase in anti-Semitic acts between 2013 and 2014 in Germany (from 788 acts to 1076, including 36 violent acts to 76), Belgium (from 64 acts to 109, including 11 violent acts to 30), Austria (from 137 acts to 255, including 4 violent acts to 9), and Italy (from 45 to 90, including 12 violent acts to 23); Whereas the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported, in its latest available statistics, 870 incidents in 2012 with anti-Jewish bias motivation, including 13 violent incidents, and 625 incidents in 2013 with anti-Jewish bias motivation, including four violent incidents; Whereas anti-Semitic attacks have been increasingly directed at places of ordinary daily life and places of worship, including-- (1) the violent extremist who pledged his loyalty to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) and attacked a kosher supermarket in Paris, France, January 9, 2015, murdering four Jewish patrons; and (2) the violent extremist who pledged his loyalty to ISIS and attacked the Great Synagogue in Copenhagen, Denmark, during a bat mitzvah celebration, February 15, 2015, murdering a member of the Jewish community on security duty, and wounding two members of the Danish Police Service; Whereas anti-Semitic attacks are threats to the fundamental freedoms, rights, security, and diversity of all citizens, societies, and countries in which they occur; Whereas governments have primary responsibility for the security and safety of all of their citizens and therefore primary responsibility for monitoring, preventing, and responding to anti-Semitic violence; Whereas Jewish community groups that focus on strengthening safety awareness, crisis management, and preparedness are essential to keeping members of the Jewish community safe, and complement efforts of government and inter-governmental entities; Whereas keeping members of Jewish communities safe requires government agencies, intergovernmental institutions and agencies, and law enforcement associations, formally recognizing and partnering with Jewish community groups that focus on safety awareness and crisis management and preparedness; Whereas in the United States, United Kingdom, and France, there are examples of formal recognition, partnership, training, and information-sharing between government entities and Jewish community security groups that have strengthened these countries and contributed to the safety and security of Jewish communities; Whereas Jewish community groups, consortia, and initiatives, have formed and are forming to focus on safety awareness, crisis management, and preparedness, and partner with law enforcement entities and thought leaders; Whereas information-sharing and action-focused campaigns, including the national ``If You See Something, Say Something'' campaign of the Department of Homeland Security, which rely on members of the public reporting suspicious activity to law enforcement personnel, are critical to preventing violent attacks on individuals and communities; Whereas relevant information, research, and analysis is vital to strengthening the preparedness, prevention, mitigation, and response of Jewish communities and law enforcement agencies; Whereas broader efforts to counter violent extremism, and efforts to counter anti-Semitism, should be integrated with each other as appropriate and share best practices; Whereas in the Berlin Declaration of April 29, 2004, participating States of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) condemned anti-Semitism and committed themselves to specific actions to combat it, and to collect and maintain reliable information and statistics about anti-Semitic crimes; Whereas, on December 6, 2013, the Ministerial Council of the OSCE, which is composed of the Foreign Ministers of participating States, adopted Decision number 3/13 entitled ``Freedom of Thought, Conscience, Religion, or Belief'', emphasizing ``the link between security and full respect for the freedom of thought'', and committing member governments to adopt ``policies to promote respect and protection for places of worship and religious sites, religious monuments, cemeteries and shrines against vandalism and destruction'', among other specific actions; Whereas, on December 5, 2014, the Ministerial Council of the OSCE adopted Declaration number 8, the Basel Declaration, on ``Enhancing Efforts to Combat Anti-Semitism'', in which members of the Council stated, ``We express our concern at the disconcerting number of anti-Semitic incidents that continue to take place in the OSCE area and remain a challenge to stability and security'' and ``We stress the importance of States collaborating with civil society through effective partnerships and strengthened dialogue and co- operation on combating anti-Semitism''; and Whereas in 2004, Congress passed the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act, which established an Office to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism, headed by a Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives-- (1) urges the United States Government to work closely with European governments and their law enforcement agencies, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the European Union, Europol, and Interpol, encouraging them to-- (A) formally recognize, partner, train, and share information with Jewish community security groups to strengthen preparedness, prevention, mitigation, and response related to anti-Semitic attacks and to support related research initiatives; (B) consider the formal partnerships in the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, between government entities and Jewish community security groups, as examples of partnership, training, and information-sharing; (C) support assessments of the-- (i) general environment in which anti-Semitic attacks occur; (ii) data on types of crimes committed and the response from law enforcement; (iii) relationships of Jewish community groups with local law enforcement agencies, including joint training opportunities and information sharing; (iv) preparedness, including emergency response plans, of Jewish community groups; and (v) response of local law enforcement systems to anti- Semitic attacks, including incident reporting, initial response, and the prioritization and prosecution of those crimes; (D) utilize these assessments to help make adjustments to their strategies and efforts to combat anti-Semitism as needed; (E) help Jewish communities develop common, baseline safety standards; (F) consider developing a standardized pan-European information-sharing and alerting system that can include governmental and non-governmental agencies, as well as Jewish communities; (G) develop safety-awareness and suspicious activity reporting campaigns; (H) integrate, as appropriate, efforts to combat violent extremism and efforts to combat anti-Semitism; (I) ensure law enforcement personnel are effectively trained to monitor, prevent, and respond to anti-Semitic violence, and to partner with Jewish communities; (J) reaffirm and work for the implementation of the OSCE declarations, decisions, and other commitments focusing on anti-Semitism; and (K) ensure senior officials, with commensurate authority and resources, have been appointed or designated to combat anti-Semitism and collaborate with governmental and inter- governmental agencies, law enforcement agencies, Jewish community groups, and other civil society groups; (2) reaffirms its support for the mandate of the United States Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism as part of the broader policy priority of fostering international religious freedom; and (3) urges the Secretary of State to continue robust United States reporting on anti-Semitism by the Department of State and the Special Envoy to Combat and Monitor Anti-Semitism. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California. General Leave Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous materials in the Record. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, anti-Semitism in Europe is on the rise. Jewish communities there are on the edge. Fearing this rise in hatred toward them may signal a return to Europe's darkest days. This sad reality is well documented by authoritative reports from the Pew Foundation, the Anti-Defamation League, and others. In 2015, a survey by the Anti-Defamation League showed that over 25 percent of European respondents said that they harbored anti-Semitic feelings; and that number had significantly increased from the year before in a few countries, such as in the Netherlands and in the United Kingdom. It is a phenomenon clearly felt on the streets, seen scrawled across synagogues and in desecrated burial sites, and even demonstrated in deadly acts of terror. We all recall the horrific attacks on the Charlie Hebdo offices and [[Page H7374]] the grocery in Paris and the later attacks at a synagogue and a cafe in Copenhagen. Just last month in Manchester, four Jewish youths were attacked by thugs who shouted their hatred of Jews. One of the victims, a 17-year-old boy, had to be hospitalized. The rise of such attacks and hate-filled rhetoric is causing Europe's Jews to look over their shoulders and even consider fleeing communities that they have been a part of for over 20 generations, to seek safety elsewhere. Targeted violence against the Jewish people or any other religious or minority group is repugnant. Sadly, the Jewish people have been among the most persecuted in the world. When you think of the consequences of the Holocaust, when you think of the consequences of the Inquisition, the magnitude of it comes home when you realize that there are as many Jews left alive on this planet today as there were during the early days of the Roman Empire. The slaughter of these people, their persecution, leaves for humanity the thought: Have we learned nothing from the Holocaust? European leaders must unequivocally send this message to their people and act to provide greater protection for their Jewish citizens. This important resolution proposes several commonsense steps for our European allies to consider to improve the safety of their Jewish communities: It calls for establishing partnerships between law enforcement and Jewish community groups in order to improve the security plans, training, and enhanced law enforcement response to these anti-Semitic attacks. Improved sharing of information between government agencies, law enforcement, and Jewish community groups is another key recommendation. Finally, this measure encourages European nations to improve communication between themselves and with the United States to analyze trends in anti-Semitic crimes and to share best practices in combating extremism. As we learned from the Holocaust, anti-Semitic sentiment can lay the foundation for persecution of Jewish communities under the guise of political protest or under the guise of nationalistic pride. That is why leaders of free societies everywhere must expose these prejudices for the dangers they pose to their communities. I want to recognize Congressman Chris Smith of New Jersey for authoring this important measure. And, as always, I thank Ranking Member Engel for his help on this measure and in getting this bill to the floor. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this timely resolution. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in support of this measure. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Royce, again, for being on top of all these very important issues. Under his leadership, the Foreign Affairs Committee has really taken the lead on important issues such as this. I want to also thank Mr. Smith from New Jersey for sponsoring this resolution. As the chair of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations, Chris Smith has been focused on the disturbing surge of anti-Semitism in Europe. He is always there. He always speaks out forcefully about anti-Semitism and other things that are important to him. I am grateful for his leadership. It is disappointing that we still need to take up this sort of measure. As we all know, anti-Semitism, that ancient hatred, has continued smoldering through the centuries. Week after week, we hear reports of new anti-Semitic attacks: the vandalism of the Babi Yar Holocaust site in Kiev--I have been there a number of times. It is very disheartening that that would be desecrated--the targeting of the Great Synagogue in Copenhagen; and, of course, the unfathomable attack, as Chairman Royce mentioned, in Paris last January. We would be foolish to dismiss this surge in anti-Semitism as the work of violent, fringe individuals. In countries like Hungary and Greece, shamefully, we see explicitly anti-Semitic political parties winning seats and elections. It is deeply troubling, very disturbing. It wasn't even a century ago that we heard this canary in the coal mine. You can draw a straight line from early indifference and inaction to the darkest chapter in human history. The lessons of the Holocaust are seared in our collective consciousness. Those lessons are telling us to throw water on this fire before it burns out of control. I was born after World War II in New York, and I remember hearing family members talking about anti-Semitism. The general prevailing thought was, well, this is something that will never happen again, that the Holocaust was so horrific that world humanity would understand that something like this could never happen again. When I say ``never happen again,'' I mean to any group--not just to Jewish groups, to any group. This cannot be tolerated, and one has to just look around the world to see all the hatred and all the people who are being slaughtered because of who they are or what tribe they are from or what people they are from. It is particularly galling in Europe, where so many people--6 million Jewish people--perished during the Holocaust, that anti-Semitism would rear its ugly head again. One would think that people would be ashamed and would not want to go down the anti-Semitic path again. Here it is, barely 70 years after the end of World War II, and we see an alarming rise. And it is an alarming rise from a lot of different communities. There are skinheads and people who have always uttered anti-Semitic remarks. We also, unfortunately, have a number of people living in Europe of Middle Eastern descent who also are using the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians to, again, fan the fires of anti-Semitic hatred. As the numbers of people from Arab lands go to Europe, some, unfortunately, are fanning the fires of anti-Semitism. That has to be condemned and stopped as well. Anti-Semitism needs to be condemned no matter who is espousing it, no matter where it is coming from, and no matter what they are saying. It is really time to call it the way it is. So we need greater vigilance by law enforcement when Jewish communities in Europe are under threat. But it is not that simple. We also need greater leadership from officials by speaking out against anti-Semitism. We had a bill just a couple of hours ago--maybe not even a couple of hours ago--which talked about the Palestinian leadership not condemning anti-Semitism and having incitement of things that result in anti-Semitic attacks. So this is the same thing. It is the same thing, whether it is in Europe or the Middle East. It is rearing its ugly head, and it is time for us to continue to speak out against it. The United States of America has always been the bastion of society, and the world looks to us for leadership. I think it is very important that the United States Congress is doing this now. So we need greater vigilance by law enforcement when Jewish communities in Europe are under threat, but it is not that simple. We also need greater leadership from officials by speaking out against anti-Semitism. We need stronger partnerships with Jewish communities to help them develop their own safety responses, community policing techniques, and information sharing with government agencies. We need to foster cultures that respect diversity and don't ostracize minority groups. I condemn any kind of ostracizing of any minority group in this country or around the world. We need to step in and say that we will not tolerate it. So this resolution encourages these efforts, and I encourage my colleagues to support it. Anti-Semitism is rearing its ugly head, but it can be defeated. I think what the Congress is doing today is a very good step in that direction. I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the author of this measure, and I ask unanimous consent that he be allowed to control the time. Mr. Smith, as U.S. chairman of the Helsinki Commission, works with our European allies to improve the security and improve the safety of these Jewish communities in Europe. We appreciate his authorship of this resolution. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? [[Page H7375]] There was no objection. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce for his leadership on this very important human rights issue, as he has done so ably and effectively on all of these issues, particularly his leadership on Iran; and that, of course, would be echoed with Eliot Engel's excellent work there as well. This is a group of leaders that have made a huge difference. So thank you, Chairman Royce, for that. H. Res. 354, Mr. Speaker, prescribes specific, effective actions that government should take in response to the deadly threats to the Jewish communities in Europe. As we all know, the number of violent anti- Semitic attacks have increased from 100 to 400 percent in some European countries since 2013 alone. Murders in Paris and Copenhagen and elsewhere remind us that there are those who are motivated by anti- Semitic hate and have the will and the means to kill. I would just note parenthetically that my work in combating anti- Semitism began back in 1981, in my first term, from this very podium, speaking out in favor of Jewish refuseniks. I joined Mark Levin and the NCSJ 1 year later in 1982 on a trip to the Soviet Union where we met with men and women who were targeted by the KGB and the Soviet evil empire simply because they were Jewish. Sadly, anti-Semitism has not abated, and in recent years, it has actually worsened. {time} 1915 This resolution calls for the United States Government to work with our European allies on specific actions that are essential to keep European Jewish communities safe and secure. It is based on consultations with the leading experts who are working directly with these communities. The resolution focuses on the formal partnerships between European law enforcement agencies and Jewish community security groups. Here in the United States, Mr. Speaker, the collaboration between the Department of Homeland Security and Security Community Network--an initiative of the Jewish Federation of North America and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations--has been essential to protecting Jewish communities here. The formal partnerships between the Community Security Trust in the United Kingdom and the Jewish Community Security Service in France and their respective governments are also excellent models that need to be emulated. The resolution emphasizes the importance of consistent, two-way communication and information sharing between law enforcement agencies and Jewish community groups. It encourages the development of a pan- European information sharing, communication, and alerting system, and envisions governments, intergovernmental agencies, and Jewish communities working together on it. Such a system should function day- round and year-round and include training for personnel who are implementing it. The resolution also calls for European governments to support assessments in several key areas and accordingly adjust their actions and strategies. Details matter. The assessments should gather and analyze data on crimes committed, response from law enforcement, types of attacks or incidents that are most prevalent, and the types of targets that are most at risk. It is essential to understand how law enforcement agencies usually receive reports of anti-Semitic crimes and what initial actions they take when a report is filed. I remember years ago, when I offered a resolution at the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, we heard that it was just hooliganism and other kinds of acts done by young people when you spray-paint a swastika on a tombstone in a Jewish cemetery, when you deface a synagogue, and you attack a man simply because he is wearing a yarmulke. Clearly, these are acts of anti-Semitic hate; yet, they were being dismissed as something that was other. Assessments are also needed on Jewish community security groups, particularly of their capabilities, resources, relationships with local law enforcement agencies, preparedness, including emergency response plans, and the extent to which their decisionmaking is based on the best available information, analysis, and practices. The resolution calls for governments to use these assessments to help these community groups develop common baseline safety standards. These standards should include, as I said before, training, controlling access to physical facilities, physical security measures, including cameras, and crisis communications. Emergency exercises and simulations, mapping access to facilities, and sharing information with law enforcement agencies should also be part of the standards. These assessments, Mr. Speaker, will help achieve the resolution's call for law enforcement personnel to be well trained to monitor, prevent, and respond to anti-Semitic violence and to partner with Jewish communities. For all of these assessments, governments should draw information from sources that include Jewish groups, law enforcement agencies, independent human rights NGOs, research initiatives, and other civil society groups and leaders. H. Res. 354 calls for safety awareness and suspicious activity reporting campaigns, like ``If you see something, say something'' here in the United States. Other aspects of the resolution include appropriately integrating initiatives to counter violent extremism and those to combat anti-Semitism and the urgency of implementing the declarations, decisions, and other commitments of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that focus on anti-Semitism. To accomplish these goals, the resolution calls for European governments to ensure that they appoint or designate senior officials with the necessary authority and resources to combat anti-Semitism and collaborate with governmental and intergovernmental agencies, law enforcement, and Jewish community groups. Finally, the resolution reaffirms support for the mandate of the United States Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism as part of the broader policy of fostering international religious freedom and urges the Secretary of State to continue robust U.S. reporting on anti- Semitism by the Department of State and the Special Envoy to Combat and Monitor Anti-Semitism. I would note parenthetically that I authored the amendment to the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act of 2004, introduced and sponsored by Senator Voinovich. My amendment created the Office to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism within the State Department. That has proven to be a key tool in this fight. Mr. Speaker, the resolution has the support of leading organizations, and it has 89 cosponsors, including all eight of the co-chairs of the Bipartisan Taskforce for Combating Anti-Semitism. I would like to acknowledge, Mr. Speaker, John Farmer, Jr., and Paul Goldenberg for their tireless efforts and dedication and leadership in fighting anti-Semitism and terrorism over the years. John is a former attorney general of New Jersey and is now on the steering committee of the Institute for Emergency Preparedness and Homeland Security and is the codirector of the Faith-Based Communities Security Program at Rutgers University. Paul is the executive director of the Secure Community Network and a senior adviser to the Institute and the program. Several major Jewish communities in Europe have relied on their counsel, and both have spent time on the ground within these communities. Finally, I would like to acknowledge and single out for very, very special thanks and recognition Rabbi Andy Baker, personal representative of the OSCE chair in the Office on Combating Anti- Semitism and director of the International Jewish Affairs for the American Jewish Committee. He has been critical--critical--to American leadership in Europe and in the United States in the fight against anti-Semitism. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), my good friend and the ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations. Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I want to particularly thank Chairman Ed Royce [[Page H7376]] and my good friend, our ranking member of the committee, Eliot Engel, and all those who were so involved in putting this important resolution together. I rise in support of House Resolution 354. It was introduced by the co-chairs of the Bipartisan Taskforce for Combating Anti-Semitism. In the aftermath of appalling anti-Semitic incidents throughout Europe, including the devastating terrorist attacks at the Paris kosher supermarket and the Great Synagogue of Copenhagen, this important resolution urges the United States Government to help improve the safety and security of Jewish communities in Europe. From Austria to Belgium, Germany to the United Kingdom, Ukraine to France, there has been a sharp rise in assaults on Jewish individuals and acts of vandalism on Jewish places of worship, cemeteries, and memorials. Such destruction and desecration is unacceptable and must be stopped. That is why this resolution is so critical. It highlights specific ways the administration can work with European governments, especially law enforcement agencies, to formally recognize and partner with Jewish organizations to develop common safety standards, alert systems, information-sharing mechanisms, and ensure that local law enforcement personnel are effectively trained to monitor, prevent, and respond to anti-Semitic violence. I want to express my appreciation to my fellow co-chairs of the Anti- Semitism Taskforce, Representatives Smith, Engel, Granger, Israel, Ros- Lehtinen, Deutch, and Roskam. The task force remains committed to working across regions, religions, and party lines to condemn all anti- Semitism and fight for the right of Jews to live freely as Jews without fear. Before closing, I also want to express my strong support for H. Res. 293, which condemns anti-Israel and anti-Semitic incitement within the Palestinian Authority and calls on President Abbas to discourage such despicable behavior. The latest cycle of terrorism against Israel must end. The only way it will end is if Palestinian leaders take genuine and immediate steps to denounce all violence and promote security cooperation, coexistence, and peace with Israel. As the ranking member of the Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs of the Committee on Appropriations, I will continue to do everything in my power to bolster Israel's security to combat incitement and to promote stability and peaceful coexistence throughout the world. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), the chair of the Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the former chair of the full committee. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of Mr. Smith's bill, House Resolution 354, expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the safety and security of Jewish communities in Europe. I was an original cosponsor of this resolution. I want to highlight the work of my good friend and colleague, Chris Smith, for his leadership on this issue and, indeed, for his tireless efforts to fight anti-Semitism and support international religious freedom. I would also like to thank our fellow co-chairs of the congressional Bipartisan Taskforce for Combating Anti-Semitism for demonstrating their leadership on this issue in Congress and for raising the level of awareness and dialogue within our body related to global anti-Semitism. In recent years, Mr. Speaker, the protection and the promotion of these values have moved from being part and parcel of our foreign policy objective to not even ranking as one of our top priorities. It is time. It is way past time that we make respect for human rights and the protection of religious and ethnic minorities a top priority for our foreign policy objectives and show real leadership and show that we have the will and the moral imperative to promote our values across the world. The terror group ISIL is rising in the Middle East. It is seeking to establish an Islamic caliphate. It wants to wipe out the region's religious minorities of all kinds and anyone who does not adhere to its radical brand of Islam. This, along with an alarming rise in anti-Semitism in Europe and other attacks on religious freedom across the globe, underscores why Mr. Smith's measure before us today is so timely, is so important. It urges our government to work with European governments and law enforcement agencies in order to help them fight the rise of anti- Semitism across the continent and to make combating anti-Semitism part of our government's broader policy of promoting international religious freedom. Europe is at the dawn of a lamentably repeated and dangerous era, one of anti-Semitism, often masked through a political anti-Israel stance. If we don't move to act now, Mr. Speaker, we may see more deadly attacks, like the murder of four Jews in a kosher supermarket in Paris earlier this year. We in the United States must be at the forefront, leading the effort, helping other nations develop a more comprehensive approach to confronting the rising anti-Semitism problem. This measure before us today establishes a good framework in moving forward. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman. Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the task force members, of which I am humbled to be just a small part, Congresspersons Chris Smith, Kay Granger, Peter Roskam, Eliot Engel, Nita Lowey, Ted Deutch, and Steve Israel, all of us working together to highlight the spread of anti-Semitism and steps we must take to stem this tide. I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution brought forth by the gentleman from New Jersey. I thank all of the Members who have worked on the task force to bring this forward. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on both sides? The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York has 11 minutes remaining. The gentleman from New Jersey has 3 minutes remaining. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch), who is the ranking member of the Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and a good friend. {time} 1930 Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, for yielding and for his tireless work to address the threat of anti-Semitism around the world. Mr. Speaker, this resolution was a collaborative effort among my fellow co-chairs of the Bipartisan Taskforce for Combating Anti- Semitism, and I thank each of them for their commitment to bringing attention and responding to the proliferation of anti-Semitism globally. I especially want to thank and acknowledge Congressman Smith of New Jersey for his commitment to human rights and his ongoing fight against anti-Semitism. This resolution is a strong statement by Congress that, in the face of rising global anti-Semitism, countries, including ours, must prioritize the security and the protection of their Jewish communities. The anti-Semitism we are witnessing around the world today is both unique and longstanding. It is amorphous and it is very direct. It is complex. But in many ways, it is straightforward hatred. Not every case of anti-Semitism will garner international attention like the attack on the Paris supermarket earlier this year. However, Jewish communities around the world experience attacks and intimidation on a regular basis. Just weeks ago, in Marseille, France, an armed man attacked three Jews near a synagogue, including a rabbi and his 19-year-old son. A third man suffered serious injuries from the stabbing. Earlier this year, in Argentina, the phrase ``death to the Jews'' and a swastika were spray painted. In Ukraine, there have been at least three incidents of Holocaust memorials desecrated with swastikas. And in many [[Page H7377]] cities, Jews are simply afraid to walk the streets as Jews. Tragically, these cases are far too commonplace for Jewish communities. No one, Jewish or otherwise, should ever have to accept they will feel targeted, that they will not feel safe, and that their lives are always somewhat at risk. Governments must take a hard look at the trends of bigotry developing in their countries. They must be sufficiently prepared to react preemptively and respond swiftly to cases of violence and intimidation against Jewish communities. This resolution, among other things, calls on countries to build partnerships between communities and law enforcement agencies and to establish standard procedures for responding to threats and attacks by outlining steps to take and the responsibilities for each party. I welcome the historic and continued bipartisan and overwhelming support in Congress for combating anti-Semitism. Tonight, we stand against anti-Semitism, it is true; but where anti-Semitism grows, it is a symptom of the growth of hatred, of bigotry, and of the violation of human rights. I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution and, in turn, to support a world where hatred of any type, anti-Semitism and all hatred, will not be tolerated. That is the world that we envision on the floor of the United States House of Representatives this evening. Again, I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), a very valued member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Mr. CONNOLLY. I thank my friend from New York for his leadership. I also thank Mr. Chris Smith of New Jersey, of course, for his leadership, and that of the taskforce. Mr. Speaker, anti-Semitism and the safety of Jewish communities in Europe are issues with overwhelmingly powerful historical context. The Continent has more than intimate knowledge of the devastation wrought by the purveyors of anti-Semitism. When we say ``never again,'' our threshold for action shouldn't be the impending threat of violence, let alone genocide. Instead, we must marshal the will and resources to stamp out even the conditions or precursors to an environment that allows for such anti-Semitism to flourish. In fact, when we face anti-Semitism today, whether it be here, in Europe, or in any part of the world, we ought to say to those purveyors, ``We are all Jews.'' That is the protection we ought to seek. The proactive measures and collaboration encouraged by this resolution are in keeping with what should be our highest standard for vigilance with respect to anti-Semitism. ``Never again'' isn't about words. It is a pledge that is sacred and must be kept. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen). Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want to thank everybody who has put effort into bringing this resolution to the floor. It is not difficult to stand up--or it shouldn't be difficult, and I don't think it is--to speak against anti-Semitism, but it is a little more difficult to have carved a niche in the United States Government and governments around the world as being a leader in fighting for human rights and against anti-Semitism; and that is what I have seen Congressman Chris Smith do. Congressman Smith is the chair of the Helsinki Commission, of which I am a proud member. I got to know Mr. Smith during the hearings we have had and the travels on the Helsinki Commission. Chris Smith is a super leader in looking out for people and minorities all over the world. So I thank him particularly for his efforts at spearheading this and being vigilant. It is so important. It is hard to fathom that we still have anti-Semitism in this world. It wasn't that long ago that the Holocaust occurred. We have got Holocaust museums and programs throughout different countries. We have had a lot of Holocaust museums and an understanding in Germany as well, but you have got skinheads and disciples of ISIL who continue to spread hate and venom. I know Elie Wiesel, a survivor of the Holocaust, said that people who hate, hate everyone; and I know Elie Wiesel, who was a genius and a prophet, was right. So it is important that we stand up and that we share resources with our European allies to fight anti-Semitism and that this country remains a bulwark in fighting against anti-Semitism. We haven't always been that. We are today, and we will continue to be. I am proud to support this resolution. I thank the Members for bringing it, and I urge all Members to vote for it and pass it. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds. I just want to thank my dear colleague, Mr. Cohen, and the other members of the taskforce. This is truly a bipartisan resolution. We all contributed to it. We all care deeply about it. I want him and my other colleagues to know how deeply I respect their efforts, which have been Herculean, to try to end this cruelty that is on the rise in Europe, in the United States, and in other parts. We know in the Middle East it is perhaps as bad as it has ever been; and the diaspora that makes its way into Europe is carrying that hatred with them--not all of them, of course, but a sizable number--presenting more and more challenges. This is truly a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank Mr. Cohen for his comments. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman), who is a newer Member, but she has certainly made her mark. Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I want to thank Mr. Engel for giving me this opportunity to speak, and I want to thank my colleague and neighbor, Congressman Chris Smith, for introducing this resolution. I stand in proud support of the resolution, and I urge its passage. Mr. Speaker, more than 70 years removed from the Holocaust, Jewish residents in Europe face renewed waves of anti-Semitic violence. The Pew Research Center reported that global harassment of Jews has reached a 7-year high. This violence is pronounced in Europe, where the desecration of synagogues, cemeteries, schools, and other violent incidents have spiked over the past few years. The Jewish Community Security Trust reported more than 1,100 anti- Jewish incidents in the United Kingdom in 2014, including 81 violent assaults. That same year, according to the French Jewish advocacy group CRIF, anti-Semitic incidents doubled in that nation. Troubling, violent, and even deadly anti-Semitic attacks have also occurred in countries such as Denmark, Belgium, and Germany. As the leader in the international community, the United States plays a very vital role in denouncing anti-Semitism and hate. The national director of the Anti-Defamation League has attributed U.S. public figures speaking out against hate as contributing to steady decreases in anti-Semitic attitudes domestically. As a nation founded on equality and religious freedom, we share a responsibility to stand against anti-Semitism and against hate in all its manifestations, whether it is the hate that manifested as four people were killed at the HyperCacher Jewish supermarket outside of Paris this past January, or the hate that manifested as the nine Americans killed in the massacre at Mother Emmanuel AME in Charleston, or the hate manifested as six killed at the Sikh Temple in Oak Creek, or the hate that manifested in the flames that have recently burned countless Black churches to the ground. We must join together as a nation and a global community to denounce hate wherever it may appear and uproot weeds of hate wherever they may sprout. With that, I urge my colleagues to support this. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel), a very valued member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. [[Page H7378]] Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. I thank Mr. Engel, Mr. Smith, and my colleagues on the anti-Semitism Taskforce. Mr. Speaker, Susanne Winter, a member of the Austrian Parliament from the extreme rightwing Freedom Party of Austria, received the following post on her Facebook: ``The Zionist money Jews are the global problem. Europe, and in particular Germany, are now getting what they deserve from Zionist Jews, particularly rich Zionist Jews in the USA.'' Winter responded to the post on Saturday. She said: ``It is great. You took the words right out of my mouth.'' Mr. Speaker, this resolution condemning anti-Semitism in Europe takes the words right out of my mouth, and I support it emphatically. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time. Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. History has shown us the tragedy of what can happen when this sort of hatred goes on unchecked. It is past time for governments and communities to focus on the rising tide of anti-Semitism in Europe and do whatever it takes to turn it back. This resolution sends a message that we are keeping a close eye on the problem and that action is needed now to meet this challenge. I encourage my colleagues to support this measure. I want to also compliment my good friend Chris Smith. We all worked hard on this, but no one works harder than he in combating anti- Semitism. If you know Chris Smith, you know that, when he gets obsessed with something, he follows it to the end; and it, as always, has a great conclusion. He is obsessed against hatred. He is obsessed against bad things happening to any group of people. I am very proud of the work that he has done through the years, and I want to thank him for his leadership in combating anti-Semitism. I urge my colleagues to support this measure. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Again, I want to thank Mr. Engel for his leadership and his kind words. Again, this is truly a collaborative effort, and I want to thank him for it. Mr. Speaker, at a congressional hearing I chaired in 2002--and I chaired about 18 such hearings on combating anti-Semitism--Dr. Shimon Samuels of the Wiesenthal Center said: ``The Holocaust for 30 years after the war acted as a protective Teflon against blatant anti-Semitic expression, especially in Europe. That Teflon has eroded, and what was considered distasteful and politically incorrect is becoming simply an opinion.'' He warned ominously, saying, ``cocktail chatter at fine English dinners can end as Molotov cocktails against synagogues.'' Mr. Speaker, Abraham Lincoln once said that ``to sin by silence when they should protest makes cowards of men.'' Silence is not an option. And, I would equally say, nor is inaction. If our fight is to succeed, we need government officials at all levels to not just denounce but to act without hesitation or delay whenever and wherever anti-Semitic acts occur. There are no exceptions. The purveyors of hate never take a holiday or grow weary, nor should we. H. Res. 354 is a best practices resolution designed to seriously inspire and challenge the governments of Europe, especially law enforcement and their homeland security agencies, to partner with their respective Jewish communities to mitigate and hopefully end and eradicate anti-Semitism in all of its ugly manifestations. {time} 1945 United States law enforcement, Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department, the FBI, as well as State Homeland Security agencies, including in my own State of New Jersey, have been robust and aggressive in combating anti-Semitism here. We need to replicate this and encourage others to follow our lead and that of the UK, and I do hope we will do that. This resolution is broadly bipartisan. I want to thank Nathaniel Hurd, on our staff, for his tremendous work on this resolution, working with all of his respective staffers and Members, of course, to bring this about.

whereas the french service de protection de la communaute juive (jewish community security service) reported an increase in anti-semitic acts in france between 2013 to 2014 (from 423 acts to 851), including an increase in violent ones (from 105 acts to 241); whereas the community security trust reported an increase in anti-semitic acts in [[page h7373]] the united kingdom between 2013 to 2014 (from 535 acts to 1,168), including an increase in violent ones (from 69 to 81); and the kantor center for the study of contemporary european jewry reported an increase in anti-semitic acts between 2013 and 2014 in germany (from 788 acts to 1076, including 36 violent acts to 76), belgium (from 64 acts to 109, including 11 violent acts to 30), austria (from 137 acts to 255, including 4 violent acts to 9), and italy (from 45 to 90, including 12 violent acts to 23); whereas the federal bureau of investigation reported, in its latest available statistics, 870 incidents in 2012 with anti-jewish bias motivation, including 13 violent incidents, and 625 incidents in 2013 with anti-jewish bias motivation, including four violent incidents; whereas anti-semitic attacks have been increasingly directed at places of ordinary daily life and places of worship, including-- (1) the violent extremist who pledged his loyalty to the islamic state of iraq and al-sham (isis) and attacked a kosher supermarket in paris, france, january 9, 2015, murdering four jewish patrons; and (2) the violent extremist who pledged his loyalty to isis and attacked the great synagogue in copenhagen, denmark, during a bat mitzvah celebration, february 15, 2015, murdering a member of the jewish community on security duty, and wounding two members of the danish police service; whereas anti-semitic attacks are threats to the fundamental freedoms, rights, security, and diversity of all citizens, societies, and countries in which they occur; whereas governments have primary responsibility for the security and safety of all of their citizens and therefore primary responsibility for monitoring, preventing, and responding to anti-semitic violence; whereas jewish community groups that focus on strengthening safety awareness, crisis management, and preparedness are essential to keeping members of the jewish community safe, and complement efforts of government and inter-governmental entities; whereas keeping members of jewish communities safe requires government agencies, intergovernmental institutions and agencies, and law enforcement associations, formally recognizing and partnering with jewish community groups that focus on safety awareness and crisis management and preparedness; whereas in the united states, united kingdom, and france, there are examples of formal recognition, partnership, training, and information-sharing between government entities and jewish community security groups that have strengthened these countries and contributed to the safety and security of jewish communities; whereas jewish community groups, consortia, and initiatives, have formed and are forming to focus on safety awareness, crisis management, and preparedness, and partner with law enforcement entities and thought leaders; whereas information-sharing and action-focused campaigns, including the national ``if you see something, say something'' campaign of the department of homeland security, which rely on members of the public reporting suspicious activity to law enforcement personnel, are critical to preventing violent attacks on individuals and communities; whereas relevant information, research, and analysis is vital to strengthening the preparedness, prevention, mitigation, and response of jewish communities and law enforcement agencies; whereas broader efforts to counter violent extremism, and efforts to counter anti-semitism, should be integrated with each other as appropriate and share best practices; whereas in the berlin declaration of april 29, 2004, participating states of the organization for security and cooperation in europe (osce) condemned anti-semitism and committed themselves to specific actions to combat it, and to collect and maintain reliable information and statistics about anti-semitic crimes; whereas, on december 6, 2013, the ministerial council of the osce, which is composed of the foreign ministers of participating states, adopted decision number 3/13 entitled ``freedom of thought, conscience, religion, or belief'', emphasizing ``the link between security and full respect for the freedom of thought'', and committing member governments to adopt ``policies to promote respect and protection for places of worship and religious sites, religious monuments, cemeteries and shrines against vandalism and destruction'', among other specific actions; whereas, on december 5, 2014, the ministerial council of the osce adopted declaration number 8, the basel declaration, on ``enhancing efforts to combat anti-semitism'', in which members of the council stated, ``we express our concern at the disconcerting number of anti-semitic incidents that continue to take place in the osce area and remain a challenge to stability and security'' and ``we stress the importance of states collaborating with civil society through effective partnerships and strengthened dialogue and co- operation on combating anti-semitism''; and whereas in 2004, congress passed the global anti-semitism review act, which established an office to monitor and combat anti-semitism, headed by a special envoy to monitor and combat anti-semitism: now, therefore, be it resolved, that the house of representatives-- (1) urges the united states government to work closely with european governments and their law enforcement agencies, the organization for security and cooperation in europe (osce), the european union, europol, and interpol, encouraging them to-- (a) formally recognize, partner, train, and share information with jewish community security groups to strengthen preparedness, prevention, mitigation, and response related to anti-semitic attacks and to support related research initiatives; (b) consider the formal partnerships in the united states, the united kingdom, and france, between government entities and jewish community security groups, as examples of partnership, training, and information-sharing; (c) support assessments of the-- (i) general environment in which anti-semitic attacks occur; (ii) data on types of crimes committed and the response from law enforcement; (iii) relationships of jewish community groups with local law enforcement agencies, including joint training opportunities and information sharing; (iv) preparedness, including emergency response plans, of jewish community groups; and (v) response of local law enforcement systems to anti- semitic attacks, including incident reporting, initial response, and the prioritization and prosecution of those crimes; (d) utilize these assessments to help make adjustments to their strategies and efforts to combat anti-semitism as needed; (e) help jewish communities develop common, baseline safety standards; (f) consider developing a standardized pan-european information-sharing and alerting system that can include governmental and non-governmental agencies, as well as jewish communities; (g) develop safety-awareness and suspicious activity reporting campaigns; (h) integrate, as appropriate, efforts to combat violent extremism and efforts to combat anti-semitism; (i) ensure law enforcement personnel are effectively trained to monitor, prevent, and respond to anti-semitic violence, and to partner with jewish communities; (j) reaffirm and work for the implementation of the osce declarations, decisions, and other commitments focusing on anti-semitism; and (k) ensure senior officials, with commensurate authority and resources, have been appointed or designated to combat anti-semitism and collaborate with governmental and inter- governmental agencies, law enforcement agencies, jewish community groups, and other civil society groups; (2) reaffirms its support for the mandate of the united states special envoy to monitor and combat anti-semitism as part of the broader policy priority of fostering international religious freedom; and (3) urges the secretary of state to continue robust united states reporting on anti-semitism by the department of state and the special envoy to combat and monitor anti-semitism. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from california (mr. royce) and the gentleman from new york (mr. engel) each will control 20 minutes. the chair recognizes the gentleman from california. general leave mr. royce. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include any extraneous materials in the record. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from california? there was no objection. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, anti-semitism in europe is on the rise. jewish communities there are on the edge. fearing this rise in hatred toward them may signal a return to europe's darkest days. this sad reality is well documented by authoritative reports from the pew foundation, the anti-defamation league, and others. in 2015, a survey by the anti-defamation league showed that over 25 percent of european respondents said that they harbored anti-semitic feelings; and that number had significantly increased from the year before in a few countries, such as in the netherlands and in the united kingdom. it is a phenomenon clearly felt on the streets, seen scrawled across synagogues and in desecrated burial sites, and even demonstrated in deadly acts of terror. we all recall the horrific attacks on the charlie hebdo offices and [[page h7374]] the grocery in paris and the later attacks at a synagogue and a cafe in copenhagen. just last month in manchester, four jewish youths were attacked by thugs who shouted their hatred of jews. one of the victims, a 17-year-old boy, had to be hospitalized. the rise of such attacks and hate-filled rhetoric is causing europe's jews to look over their shoulders and even consider fleeing communities that they have been a part of for over 20 generations, to seek safety elsewhere. targeted violence against the jewish people or any other religious or minority group is repugnant. sadly, the jewish people have been among the most persecuted in the world. when you think of the consequences of the holocaust, when you think of the consequences of the inquisition, the magnitude of it comes home when you realize that there are as many jews left alive on this planet today as there were during the early days of the roman empire. the slaughter of these people, their persecution, leaves for humanity the thought: have we learned nothing from the holocaust? european leaders must unequivocally send this message to their people and act to provide greater protection for their jewish citizens. this important resolution proposes several commonsense steps for our european allies to consider to improve the safety of their jewish communities: it calls for establishing partnerships between law enforcement and jewish community groups in order to improve the security plans, training, and enhanced law enforcement response to these anti-semitic attacks. improved sharing of information between government agencies, law enforcement, and jewish community groups is another key recommendation. finally, this measure encourages european nations to improve communication between themselves and with the united states to analyze trends in anti-semitic crimes and to share best practices in combating extremism. as we learned from the holocaust, anti-semitic sentiment can lay the foundation for persecution of jewish communities under the guise of political protest or under the guise of nationalistic pride. that is why leaders of free societies everywhere must expose these prejudices for the dangers they pose to their communities. i want to recognize congressman chris smith of new jersey for authoring this important measure. and, as always, i thank ranking member engel for his help on this measure and in getting this bill to the floor. i urge my colleagues to join me in support of this timely resolution. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume, and i rise in support of this measure. mr. speaker, i want to thank chairman royce, again, for being on top of all these very important issues. under his leadership, the foreign affairs committee has really taken the lead on important issues such as this. i want to also thank mr. smith from new jersey for sponsoring this resolution. as the chair of the foreign affairs subcommittee on africa, global human rights, and international organizations, chris smith has been focused on the disturbing surge of anti-semitism in europe. he is always there. he always speaks out forcefully about anti-semitism and other things that are important to him. i am grateful for his leadership. it is disappointing that we still need to take up this sort of measure. as we all know, anti-semitism, that ancient hatred, has continued smoldering through the centuries. week after week, we hear reports of new anti-semitic attacks: the vandalism of the babi yar holocaust site in kiev--i have been there a number of times. it is very disheartening that that would be desecrated--the targeting of the great synagogue in copenhagen; and, of course, the unfathomable attack, as chairman royce mentioned, in paris last january. we would be foolish to dismiss this surge in anti-semitism as the work of violent, fringe individuals. in countries like hungary and greece, shamefully, we see explicitly anti-semitic political parties winning seats and elections. it is deeply troubling, very disturbing. it wasn't even a century ago that we heard this canary in the coal mine. you can draw a straight line from early indifference and inaction to the darkest chapter in human history. the lessons of the holocaust are seared in our collective consciousness. those lessons are telling us to throw water on this fire before it burns out of control. i was born after world war ii in new york, and i remember hearing family members talking about anti-semitism. the general prevailing thought was, well, this is something that will never happen again, that the holocaust was so horrific that world humanity would understand that something like this could never happen again. when i say ``never happen again,'' i mean to any group--not just to jewish groups, to any group. this cannot be tolerated, and one has to just look around the world to see all the hatred and all the people who are being slaughtered because of who they are or what tribe they are from or what people they are from. it is particularly galling in europe, where so many people--6 million jewish people--perished during the holocaust, that anti-semitism would rear its ugly head again. one would think that people would be ashamed and would not want to go down the anti-semitic path again. here it is, barely 70 years after the end of world war ii, and we see an alarming rise. and it is an alarming rise from a lot of different communities. there are skinheads and people who have always uttered anti-semitic remarks. we also, unfortunately, have a number of people living in europe of middle eastern descent who also are using the conflict between israel and the palestinians to, again, fan the fires of anti-semitic hatred. as the numbers of people from arab lands go to europe, some, unfortunately, are fanning the fires of anti-semitism. that has to be condemned and stopped as well. anti-semitism needs to be condemned no matter who is espousing it, no matter where it is coming from, and no matter what they are saying. it is really time to call it the way it is. so we need greater vigilance by law enforcement when jewish communities in europe are under threat. but it is not that simple. we also need greater leadership from officials by speaking out against anti-semitism. we had a bill just a couple of hours ago--maybe not even a couple of hours ago--which talked about the palestinian leadership not condemning anti-semitism and having incitement of things that result in anti-semitic attacks. so this is the same thing. it is the same thing, whether it is in europe or the middle east. it is rearing its ugly head, and it is time for us to continue to speak out against it. the united states of america has always been the bastion of society, and the world looks to us for leadership. i think it is very important that the united states congress is doing this now. so we need greater vigilance by law enforcement when jewish communities in europe are under threat, but it is not that simple. we also need greater leadership from officials by speaking out against anti-semitism. we need stronger partnerships with jewish communities to help them develop their own safety responses, community policing techniques, and information sharing with government agencies. we need to foster cultures that respect diversity and don't ostracize minority groups. i condemn any kind of ostracizing of any minority group in this country or around the world. we need to step in and say that we will not tolerate it. so this resolution encourages these efforts, and i encourage my colleagues to support it. anti-semitism is rearing its ugly head, but it can be defeated. i think what the congress is doing today is a very good step in that direction. i reserve the balance of my time. mr. royce. mr. speaker, i yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from new jersey (mr. smith), the author of this measure, and i ask unanimous consent that he be allowed to control the time. mr. smith, as u.s. chairman of the helsinki commission, works with our european allies to improve the security and improve the safety of these jewish communities in europe. we appreciate his authorship of this resolution. the speaker pro tempore. is there objection to the request of the gentleman from california? [[page h7375]] there was no objection. mr. smith of new jersey. mr. speaker, i thank chairman royce for his leadership on this very important human rights issue, as he has done so ably and effectively on all of these issues, particularly his leadership on iran; and that, of course, would be echoed with eliot engel's excellent work there as well. this is a group of leaders that have made a huge difference. so thank you, chairman royce, for that. h. res. 354, mr. speaker, prescribes specific, effective actions that government should take in response to the deadly threats to the jewish communities in europe. as we all know, the number of violent anti- semitic attacks have increased from 100 to 400 percent in some european countries since 2013 alone. murders in paris and copenhagen and elsewhere remind us that there are those who are motivated by anti- semitic hate and have the will and the means to kill. i would just note parenthetically that my work in combating anti- semitism began back in 1981, in my first term, from this very podium, speaking out in favor of jewish refuseniks. i joined mark levin and the ncsj 1 year later in 1982 on a trip to the soviet union where we met with men and women who were targeted by the kgb and the soviet evil empire simply because they were jewish. sadly, anti-semitism has not abated, and in recent years, it has actually worsened. {time} 1915 this resolution calls for the united states government to work with our european allies on specific actions that are essential to keep european jewish communities safe and secure. it is based on consultations with the leading experts who are working directly with these communities. the resolution focuses on the formal partnerships between european law enforcement agencies and jewish community security groups. here in the united states, mr. speaker, the collaboration between the department of homeland security and security community network--an initiative of the jewish federation of north america and the conference of presidents of major american jewish organizations--has been essential to protecting jewish communities here. the formal partnerships between the community security trust in the united kingdom and the jewish community security service in france and their respective governments are also excellent models that need to be emulated. the resolution emphasizes the importance of consistent, two-way communication and information sharing between law enforcement agencies and jewish community groups. it encourages the development of a pan- european information sharing, communication, and alerting system, and envisions governments, intergovernmental agencies, and jewish communities working together on it. such a system should function day- round and year-round and include training for personnel who are implementing it. the resolution also calls for european governments to support assessments in several key areas and accordingly adjust their actions and strategies. details matter. the assessments should gather and analyze data on crimes committed, response from law enforcement, types of attacks or incidents that are most prevalent, and the types of targets that are most at risk. it is essential to understand how law enforcement agencies usually receive reports of anti-semitic crimes and what initial actions they take when a report is filed. i remember years ago, when i offered a resolution at the osce parliamentary assembly, we heard that it was just hooliganism and other kinds of acts done by young people when you spray-paint a swastika on a tombstone in a jewish cemetery, when you deface a synagogue, and you attack a man simply because he is wearing a yarmulke. clearly, these are acts of anti-semitic hate; yet, they were being dismissed as something that was other. assessments are also needed on jewish community security groups, particularly of their capabilities, resources, relationships with local law enforcement agencies, preparedness, including emergency response plans, and the extent to which their decisionmaking is based on the best available information, analysis, and practices. the resolution calls for governments to use these assessments to help these community groups develop common baseline safety standards. these standards should include, as i said before, training, controlling access to physical facilities, physical security measures, including cameras, and crisis communications. emergency exercises and simulations, mapping access to facilities, and sharing information with law enforcement agencies should also be part of the standards. these assessments, mr. speaker, will help achieve the resolution's call for law enforcement personnel to be well trained to monitor, prevent, and respond to anti-semitic violence and to partner with jewish communities. for all of these assessments, governments should draw information from sources that include jewish groups, law enforcement agencies, independent human rights ngos, research initiatives, and other civil society groups and leaders. h. res. 354 calls for safety awareness and suspicious activity reporting campaigns, like ``if you see something, say something'' here in the united states. other aspects of the resolution include appropriately integrating initiatives to counter violent extremism and those to combat anti-semitism and the urgency of implementing the declarations, decisions, and other commitments of the organization for security and cooperation in europe that focus on anti-semitism. to accomplish these goals, the resolution calls for european governments to ensure that they appoint or designate senior officials with the necessary authority and resources to combat anti-semitism and collaborate with governmental and intergovernmental agencies, law enforcement, and jewish community groups. finally, the resolution reaffirms support for the mandate of the united states special envoy to monitor and combat anti-semitism as part of the broader policy of fostering international religious freedom and urges the secretary of state to continue robust u.s. reporting on anti- semitism by the department of state and the special envoy to combat and monitor anti-semitism. i would note parenthetically that i authored the amendment to the global anti-semitism review act of 2004, introduced and sponsored by senator voinovich. my amendment created the office to monitor and combat anti-semitism within the state department. that has proven to be a key tool in this fight. mr. speaker, the resolution has the support of leading organizations, and it has 89 cosponsors, including all eight of the co-chairs of the bipartisan taskforce for combating anti-semitism. i would like to acknowledge, mr. speaker, john farmer, jr., and paul goldenberg for their tireless efforts and dedication and leadership in fighting anti-semitism and terrorism over the years. john is a former attorney general of new jersey and is now on the steering committee of the institute for emergency preparedness and homeland security and is the codirector of the faith-based communities security program at rutgers university. paul is the executive director of the secure community network and a senior adviser to the institute and the program. several major jewish communities in europe have relied on their counsel, and both have spent time on the ground within these communities. finally, i would like to acknowledge and single out for very, very special thanks and recognition rabbi andy baker, personal representative of the osce chair in the office on combating anti- semitism and director of the international jewish affairs for the american jewish committee. he has been critical--critical--to american leadership in europe and in the united states in the fight against anti-semitism. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from new york (mrs. lowey), my good friend and the ranking member of the committee on appropriations. mrs. lowey. mr. speaker, i want to particularly thank chairman ed royce [[page h7376]] and my good friend, our ranking member of the committee, eliot engel, and all those who were so involved in putting this important resolution together. i rise in support of house resolution 354. it was introduced by the co-chairs of the bipartisan taskforce for combating anti-semitism. in the aftermath of appalling anti-semitic incidents throughout europe, including the devastating terrorist attacks at the paris kosher supermarket and the great synagogue of copenhagen, this important resolution urges the united states government to help improve the safety and security of jewish communities in europe. from austria to belgium, germany to the united kingdom, ukraine to france, there has been a sharp rise in assaults on jewish individuals and acts of vandalism on jewish places of worship, cemeteries, and memorials. such destruction and desecration is unacceptable and must be stopped. that is why this resolution is so critical. it highlights specific ways the administration can work with european governments, especially law enforcement agencies, to formally recognize and partner with jewish organizations to develop common safety standards, alert systems, information-sharing mechanisms, and ensure that local law enforcement personnel are effectively trained to monitor, prevent, and respond to anti-semitic violence. i want to express my appreciation to my fellow co-chairs of the anti- semitism taskforce, representatives smith, engel, granger, israel, ros- lehtinen, deutch, and roskam. the task force remains committed to working across regions, religions, and party lines to condemn all anti- semitism and fight for the right of jews to live freely as jews without fear. before closing, i also want to express my strong support for h. res. 293, which condemns anti-israel and anti-semitic incitement within the palestinian authority and calls on president abbas to discourage such despicable behavior. the latest cycle of terrorism against israel must end. the only way it will end is if palestinian leaders take genuine and immediate steps to denounce all violence and promote security cooperation, coexistence, and peace with israel. as the ranking member of the subcommittee on state, foreign operations, and related programs of the committee on appropriations, i will continue to do everything in my power to bolster israel's security to combat incitement and to promote stability and peaceful coexistence throughout the world. mr. smith of new jersey. mr. speaker, i yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from florida (ms. ros-lehtinen), the chair of the subcommittee on the middle east and north africa of the committee on foreign affairs, and the former chair of the full committee. ms. ros-lehtinen. mr. speaker, i rise in strong support of mr. smith's bill, house resolution 354, expressing the sense of the house of representatives regarding the safety and security of jewish communities in europe. i was an original cosponsor of this resolution. i want to highlight the work of my good friend and colleague, chris smith, for his leadership on this issue and, indeed, for his tireless efforts to fight anti-semitism and support international religious freedom. i would also like to thank our fellow co-chairs of the congressional bipartisan taskforce for combating anti-semitism for demonstrating their leadership on this issue in congress and for raising the level of awareness and dialogue within our body related to global anti-semitism. in recent years, mr. speaker, the protection and the promotion of these values have moved from being part and parcel of our foreign policy objective to not even ranking as one of our top priorities. it is time. it is way past time that we make respect for human rights and the protection of religious and ethnic minorities a top priority for our foreign policy objectives and show real leadership and show that we have the will and the moral imperative to promote our values across the world. the terror group isil is rising in the middle east. it is seeking to establish an islamic caliphate. it wants to wipe out the region's religious minorities of all kinds and anyone who does not adhere to its radical brand of islam. this, along with an alarming rise in anti-semitism in europe and other attacks on religious freedom across the globe, underscores why mr. smith's measure before us today is so timely, is so important. it urges our government to work with european governments and law enforcement agencies in order to help them fight the rise of anti- semitism across the continent and to make combating anti-semitism part of our government's broader policy of promoting international religious freedom. europe is at the dawn of a lamentably repeated and dangerous era, one of anti-semitism, often masked through a political anti-israel stance. if we don't move to act now, mr. speaker, we may see more deadly attacks, like the murder of four jews in a kosher supermarket in paris earlier this year. we in the united states must be at the forefront, leading the effort, helping other nations develop a more comprehensive approach to confronting the rising anti-semitism problem. this measure before us today establishes a good framework in moving forward. the speaker pro tempore. the time of the gentlewoman has expired. mr. smith of new jersey. mr. speaker, i yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman. ms. ros-lehtinen. mr. speaker, i want to thank the task force members, of which i am humbled to be just a small part, congresspersons chris smith, kay granger, peter roskam, eliot engel, nita lowey, ted deutch, and steve israel, all of us working together to highlight the spread of anti-semitism and steps we must take to stem this tide. i urge my colleagues to support this important resolution brought forth by the gentleman from new jersey. i thank all of the members who have worked on the task force to bring this forward. mr. engel. mr. speaker, may i inquire how much time remains on both sides? the speaker pro tempore. the gentleman from new york has 11 minutes remaining. the gentleman from new jersey has 3 minutes remaining. mr. engel. mr. speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from florida (mr. deutch), who is the ranking member of the subcommittee on the middle east and north africa of the committee on foreign affairs and a good friend. {time} 1930 mr. deutch. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman, the ranking member of the foreign affairs committee, for yielding and for his tireless work to address the threat of anti-semitism around the world. mr. speaker, this resolution was a collaborative effort among my fellow co-chairs of the bipartisan taskforce for combating anti- semitism, and i thank each of them for their commitment to bringing attention and responding to the proliferation of anti-semitism globally. i especially want to thank and acknowledge congressman smith of new jersey for his commitment to human rights and his ongoing fight against anti-semitism. this resolution is a strong statement by congress that, in the face of rising global anti-semitism, countries, including ours, must prioritize the security and the protection of their jewish communities. the anti-semitism we are witnessing around the world today is both unique and longstanding. it is amorphous and it is very direct. it is complex. but in many ways, it is straightforward hatred. not every case of anti-semitism will garner international attention like the attack on the paris supermarket earlier this year. however, jewish communities around the world experience attacks and intimidation on a regular basis. just weeks ago, in marseille, france, an armed man attacked three jews near a synagogue, including a rabbi and his 19-year-old son. a third man suffered serious injuries from the stabbing. earlier this year, in argentina, the phrase ``death to the jews'' and a swastika were spray painted. in ukraine, there have been at least three incidents of holocaust memorials desecrated with swastikas. and in many [[page h7377]] cities, jews are simply afraid to walk the streets as jews. tragically, these cases are far too commonplace for jewish communities. no one, jewish or otherwise, should ever have to accept they will feel targeted, that they will not feel safe, and that their lives are always somewhat at risk. governments must take a hard look at the trends of bigotry developing in their countries. they must be sufficiently prepared to react preemptively and respond swiftly to cases of violence and intimidation against jewish communities. this resolution, among other things, calls on countries to build partnerships between communities and law enforcement agencies and to establish standard procedures for responding to threats and attacks by outlining steps to take and the responsibilities for each party. i welcome the historic and continued bipartisan and overwhelming support in congress for combating anti-semitism. tonight, we stand against anti-semitism, it is true; but where anti-semitism grows, it is a symptom of the growth of hatred, of bigotry, and of the violation of human rights. i encourage my colleagues to support this resolution and, in turn, to support a world where hatred of any type, anti-semitism and all hatred, will not be tolerated. that is the world that we envision on the floor of the united states house of representatives this evening. again, i encourage my colleagues to support this resolution. mr. smith of new jersey. mr. speaker, i reserve the balance of my time. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from virginia (mr. connolly), a very valued member of the foreign affairs committee. mr. connolly. i thank my friend from new york for his leadership. i also thank mr. chris smith of new jersey, of course, for his leadership, and that of the taskforce. mr. speaker, anti-semitism and the safety of jewish communities in europe are issues with overwhelmingly powerful historical context. the continent has more than intimate knowledge of the devastation wrought by the purveyors of anti-semitism. when we say ``never again,'' our threshold for action shouldn't be the impending threat of violence, let alone genocide. instead, we must marshal the will and resources to stamp out even the conditions or precursors to an environment that allows for such anti-semitism to flourish. in fact, when we face anti-semitism today, whether it be here, in europe, or in any part of the world, we ought to say to those purveyors, ``we are all jews.'' that is the protection we ought to seek. the proactive measures and collaboration encouraged by this resolution are in keeping with what should be our highest standard for vigilance with respect to anti-semitism. ``never again'' isn't about words. it is a pledge that is sacred and must be kept. mr. smith of new jersey. mr. speaker, i continue to reserve the balance of my time. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from tennessee (mr. cohen). mr. cohen. mr. speaker, i thank the gentleman for yielding. i want to thank everybody who has put effort into bringing this resolution to the floor. it is not difficult to stand up--or it shouldn't be difficult, and i don't think it is--to speak against anti-semitism, but it is a little more difficult to have carved a niche in the united states government and governments around the world as being a leader in fighting for human rights and against anti-semitism; and that is what i have seen congressman chris smith do. congressman smith is the chair of the helsinki commission, of which i am a proud member. i got to know mr. smith during the hearings we have had and the travels on the helsinki commission. chris smith is a super leader in looking out for people and minorities all over the world. so i thank him particularly for his efforts at spearheading this and being vigilant. it is so important. it is hard to fathom that we still have anti-semitism in this world. it wasn't that long ago that the holocaust occurred. we have got holocaust museums and programs throughout different countries. we have had a lot of holocaust museums and an understanding in germany as well, but you have got skinheads and disciples of isil who continue to spread hate and venom. i know elie wiesel, a survivor of the holocaust, said that people who hate, hate everyone; and i know elie wiesel, who was a genius and a prophet, was right. so it is important that we stand up and that we share resources with our european allies to fight anti-semitism and that this country remains a bulwark in fighting against anti-semitism. we haven't always been that. we are today, and we will continue to be. i am proud to support this resolution. i thank the members for bringing it, and i urge all members to vote for it and pass it. mr. smith of new jersey. mr. speaker, i yield myself 30 seconds. i just want to thank my dear colleague, mr. cohen, and the other members of the taskforce. this is truly a bipartisan resolution. we all contributed to it. we all care deeply about it. i want him and my other colleagues to know how deeply i respect their efforts, which have been herculean, to try to end this cruelty that is on the rise in europe, in the united states, and in other parts. we know in the middle east it is perhaps as bad as it has ever been; and the diaspora that makes its way into europe is carrying that hatred with them--not all of them, of course, but a sizable number--presenting more and more challenges. this is truly a bipartisan effort, and i want to thank mr. cohen for his comments. mr. engel. mr. speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from new jersey (mrs. watson coleman), who is a newer member, but she has certainly made her mark. mrs. watson coleman. i want to thank mr. engel for giving me this opportunity to speak, and i want to thank my colleague and neighbor, congressman chris smith, for introducing this resolution. i stand in proud support of the resolution, and i urge its passage. mr. speaker, more than 70 years removed from the holocaust, jewish residents in europe face renewed waves of anti-semitic violence. the pew research center reported that global harassment of jews has reached a 7-year high. this violence is pronounced in europe, where the desecration of synagogues, cemeteries, schools, and other violent incidents have spiked over the past few years. the jewish community security trust reported more than 1,100 anti- jewish incidents in the united kingdom in 2014, including 81 violent assaults. that same year, according to the french jewish advocacy group crif, anti-semitic incidents doubled in that nation. troubling, violent, and even deadly anti-semitic attacks have also occurred in countries such as denmark, belgium, and germany. as the leader in the international community, the united states plays a very vital role in denouncing anti-semitism and hate. the national director of the anti-defamation league has attributed u.s. public figures speaking out against hate as contributing to steady decreases in anti-semitic attitudes domestically. as a nation founded on equality and religious freedom, we share a responsibility to stand against anti-semitism and against hate in all its manifestations, whether it is the hate that manifested as four people were killed at the hypercacher jewish supermarket outside of paris this past january, or the hate that manifested as the nine americans killed in the massacre at mother emmanuel ame in charleston, or the hate manifested as six killed at the sikh temple in oak creek, or the hate that manifested in the flames that have recently burned countless black churches to the ground. we must join together as a nation and a global community to denounce hate wherever it may appear and uproot weeds of hate wherever they may sprout. with that, i urge my colleagues to support this. mr. smith of new jersey. mr. speaker, i continue to reserve the balance of my time. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from florida (ms. frankel), a very valued member of the foreign affairs committee. [[page h7378]] ms. frankel of florida. i thank mr. engel, mr. smith, and my colleagues on the anti-semitism taskforce. mr. speaker, susanne winter, a member of the austrian parliament from the extreme rightwing freedom party of austria, received the following post on her facebook: ``the zionist money jews are the global problem. europe, and in particular germany, are now getting what they deserve from zionist jews, particularly rich zionist jews in the usa.'' winter responded to the post on saturday. she said: ``it is great. you took the words right out of my mouth.'' mr. speaker, this resolution condemning anti-semitism in europe takes the words right out of my mouth, and i support it emphatically. mr. smith of new jersey. mr. speaker, i continue to reserve the balance of my time. mr. engel. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. history has shown us the tragedy of what can happen when this sort of hatred goes on unchecked. it is past time for governments and communities to focus on the rising tide of anti-semitism in europe and do whatever it takes to turn it back. this resolution sends a message that we are keeping a close eye on the problem and that action is needed now to meet this challenge. i encourage my colleagues to support this measure. i want to also compliment my good friend chris smith. we all worked hard on this, but no one works harder than he in combating anti- semitism. if you know chris smith, you know that, when he gets obsessed with something, he follows it to the end; and it, as always, has a great conclusion. he is obsessed against hatred. he is obsessed against bad things happening to any group of people. i am very proud of the work that he has done through the years, and i want to thank him for his leadership in combating anti-semitism. i urge my colleagues to support this measure. mr. smith of new jersey. i yield myself such time as i may consume. again, i want to thank mr. engel for his leadership and his kind words. again, this is truly a collaborative effort, and i want to thank him for it. mr. speaker, at a congressional hearing i chaired in 2002--and i chaired about 18 such hearings on combating anti-semitism--dr. shimon samuels of the wiesenthal center said: ``the holocaust for 30 years after the war acted as a protective teflon against blatant anti-semitic expression, especially in europe. that teflon has eroded, and what was considered distasteful and politically incorrect is becoming simply an opinion.'' he warned ominously, saying, ``cocktail chatter at fine english dinners can end as molotov cocktails against synagogues.'' mr. speaker, abraham lincoln once said that ``to sin by silence when they should protest makes cowards of men.'' silence is not an option. and, i would equally say, nor is inaction. if our fight is to succeed, we need government officials at all levels to not just denounce but to act without hesitation or delay whenever and wherever anti-semitic acts occur. there are no exceptions. the purveyors of hate never take a holiday or grow weary, nor should we. h. res. 354 is a best practices resolution designed to seriously inspire and challenge the governments of europe, especially law enforcement and their homeland security agencies, to partner with their respective jewish communities to mitigate and hopefully end and eradicate anti-semitism in all of its ugly manifestations. {time} 1945 united states law enforcement, department of homeland security, the justice department, the fbi, as well as state homeland security agencies, including in my own state of new jersey, have been robust and aggressive in combating anti-semitism here. we need to replicate this and encourage others to follow our lead and that of the uk, and i do hope we will do that. this resolution is broadly bipartisan. i want to thank nathaniel hurd, on our staff, for his tremendous work on this resolution, working with all of his respective staffers and members, of course, to bring this about. and i want to thank the leadership for bringing it to the floor this evening. i urge a ``yea'' vote. i yield back the balance of my time. the speaker pro tempore. the question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from new jersey (mr. smith) that the house suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, h. res. 354, as amended. the question was taken. the speaker pro tempore. in the opinion of the chair, two-thirds being in the affirmative, the ayes have it. mr. smith of new jersey. mr. speaker, on that i demand the yeas and nays. the yeas and nays were ordered. the speaker pro tempore. pursuant to clause 8 of rule xx, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed. ____________________",47894

For women impacted by the medical device Essure and its documented damaging side effects, this unimaginable situation is a stark reality. Since it appeared on the market in 2002, Essure, a permanent sterilization device for women, has triggered over 5,000 formal complaints to the FDA, including reported symptoms of pelvic and abdominal pain, internal bleeding, autoimmune reactions, loss of teeth and hair, and even metal breaking and migrating throughout the body. On top of that, Essure has been proven responsible for the deaths of four women and five unborn children. Yet, in the face of all these facts, today Essure remains on the market, certified with FDA's stamp of approval. That is unacceptable to me and the tens of thousands of women who are living with this device's effects. That is why this week I will introduce the E-Free Act, legislation to remove this device from the market before it can hurt any other women.

Fred Thompson represented the State of Tennessee in the United States Senate from 1995 until 2003. He had been a staffer on the Watergate Committee and kind of made a name for himself there when he asked such good, probing questions and did such a marvelous job. He later went on to be an outstanding attorney before he became a United States Senator and an actor and a leader in our country who crossed party aisles and was known to sometimes deviate from everybody to do what he thought was right. I was a State senator and a Democrat. Fred Thompson, a Republican, encouraged me to get involved, stay involved, and shoot for the top in politics. He worked with Democrats in the Senate, and he was awarded the National Conference of State Legislators Keeping Federalism Alive Award because of his lone vote, a single bill that has kept the policy of federalism. It wasn't politics for Fred Thompson. It was philosophy. He was a great leader. He will be missed. I send my condolences to his family. I thank him for his service to my State and our country. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015)] [House] [Page H7378] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF THE LATE SENATOR FRED THOMPSON (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)

Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and privilege to lead tonight's Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour, where we will have the opportunity to speak directly to the American people. But before we get to business, I do want to take a second, even though it feels like an eternity, to congratulate my dear friend and colleague, our CBC chairman for the 112th Congress, the Honorable Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City, for his hometown Kansas City Royals victory in last night's World Series game. I am an Illinoisan by way of New York. So I had a little stake in this one. But, again, my congratulations to the city of Kansas City and to Congressman Cleaver. Mr. Speaker, I truly do believe that it is an honor and a privilege to host the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour. So I speak to you this evening very much concerned and severely disappointed that we are even having tonight's topic under such circumstances. Tonight we are here to address saving our communities, where our focus for this hour will be on key legislative priorities that this Congress, this year's Congressional Black Caucus, and our Nation must confront in order to help make this union more perfect for our next generation. Mr. Speaker, this year there have been a lot of tragic episodes that may make one shake their head and ask what is going on. We have covered a number of these topics in the course of this year, whether it be the issue of criminal justice reform, gun violence, economic investment as a antidote to violence, community policing, or the value of Black lives in America. Mr. Speaker, the issues that I will cover this evening aren't Black Caucus issues. I know that most in this Congress and most across this great country would acknowledge that they are American issues. Falling short as a Nation on these fronts only divides us and only serves as a barrier to our boundless possibilities as an American people. Over the past few weeks, we heard a lot about the need to clean out the barn before the baton was passed from Speaker to Speaker. I think we made some progress in clearing out the barn last week as we passed a bipartisan budget agreement, which President Obama signed into law earlier today. But, Mr. Speaker, as the baton has been passed from Speaker Boehner to Speaker Ryan, we must keep in mind that there is still much that needs to be cleaned out of the barn when it comes to criminal justice reform, creating opportunity in vulnerable communities, addressing inequities in the justice system, valuing all lives, regardless of race, religion or sexual orientation, making sure that good cops can do their job in keeping communities safe, and making sure that bad cops don't get to be the Nation's norm. We must have a culture where bad cops don't have a safe haven, where they can't get away with violations of the public trust in communities they were sworn to protect, and where they aren't in a position to spoil the whole bunch of good cops we have protecting American communities. Mr. Speaker, tonight we will have a long and overdue conversation about saving our communities. At this time, I yield to the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, my colleague from North Carolina, Representative G.K. Butterfield. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Let me first thank you, Congresswoman Robin Kelly, for yielding time to me tonight. Thank you for your willingness to stay on the floor tonight, even though this suspension bill was placed in front of us tonight. We certainly understand that has that happen from time to time. But thank you so very much for staying on the floor to manage the time this evening. I also want to thank you, Ms. Kelly, for your extraordinary leadership. Thank you for what you do for the Congressional Black Caucus. Thank you for what you do for your constituents in Illinois. Most importantly, thank you for what you do for our country. It is certainly appreciated. I will certainly join you, Ms. Kelly, in congratulating the Kansas City Royals on their well-deserved victory. I did not watch the entire World Series, but I watched enough of it to know that this team was much deserving of this victory. And so congratulations not only to Mr. Cleaver, who is so proud of Kansas City and talks about his hometown all of the time, but congratulations to all of those fans of that great team. Tonight we are talking about the urgent need to save our communities. What an appropriate topic, Ms. Kelly, because communities all across the country are in crisis. I travel quite a bit across the country and visit many different communities not only in my State, but in many other States. I can tell you firsthand that communities all across our country are facing crises. They are facing crises in so many different respects. They are facing the whole issue of pervasive poverty. Poverty in America is real. We have more than 400 counties in the United States of America that have poverty rates that exceed 20 percent, and all of these have had poverty rates for more than 30 years greater than 20 percent. So poverty is a critical issue in our country, and communities are feeling the effect of it in a significant way. Joblessness. Joblessness. I continue to say that the unemployment rate is [[Page H7380]] unacceptably high. Even though we have made a great improvement in the unemployment rate since the recession, it is still too high. For African American workers, it is hovering somewhere around 10 percent. That is unacceptable. We all talk from time to time and we see it all over the news today about police misconduct. Police misconduct is continuing to be a pervasive problem in so many communities. I'm sure tonight Mr. Bobby Scott from Virginia, who is very passionate about the whole issue of criminal justice reform, is going to talk about mass incarceration in the United States of America. Certainly that is a real problem, and there are many Members in this body who are working every day to try to craft together legislation to try to address the whole question of mass incarceration. Also, we have crumbling schools and infrastructure and highways and tunnels and ports. Our whole infrastructure in this country needs to be addressed. Hopefully, we will be able to pass a transportation bill before the end of the year. Hopefully, my friends on the other side of the aisle will not try to load up the transportation bill with any Ex-Im Bank riders that will be a poison pill that would slow down or even defeat the transportation bill. {time} 2000 So the point is, Ms. Kelly, that we do have an urgent need to save our communities. We need all hands on deck as we take on this challenge. We consistently see, Ms. Kelly, an over-criminalization of African Americans, specifically our youth. We see, for example, minor infractions that occur in the context of a classroom--yes, we have seen that on television over the last few days--a minor infraction in a classroom that escalates into an arrestable offense. Students, particularly those who are African American and Hispanic, are too frequently funneled into the justice system as a result of overly punitive school discipline policies and poorly defined roles for law enforcement in educational settings. Unfortunately, the school-to-prison pipeline is still a reality. When I first came to Congress 11 years ago, we were talking about the school-to-prison pipeline, and we continue to talk about it today. It is a reality. So we must work together to remedy this problem. We, as members of the Congressional Black Caucus, do not at all endorse what some people over the last few days have started to call the ``Ferguson Effect.'' Let me just elaborate on that for a moment. We have heard some high-ranking officials in our country refer to the ``Ferguson Effect.'' They are suggesting in some way that an uptick in crime can be attributable to police inaction because of their fears of the ``Ferguson Effect.'' That is so erroneous. That is so disingenuous. I wish we would concentrate on the problem and not try to get sidetracked on the so- called ``Ferguson Effect.'' The deaths of so many unarmed Black men like Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and Freddie Gray are all a result of a number of issues, including the overcriminalization of minorities and a lack of effective community policing practices. Let us seize this opportunity that we have before us to gain significant ground on several legislative areas which are not only CBC priorities, but are also in the strategic interests of our Nation. Criminal justice reform is one such area. Mr. Speaker and Ms. Kelly, any criminal justice reform, any legislation that we consider, must guarantee a substantial reduction in the prison population for Federal prisoners. We are, as a country, 5 percent of the world's population; yet, we incarcerate 25 percent of those who are incarcerated in the world. There is something is wrong with that, Mr. Speaker. We must make sure that our laws and our criminal laws in this country are fair and that they are not disproportionate and overburdensome in some areas. We have Members of this body on both sides of the aisle who acknowledge the inadequacies in our criminal justice system and see reform as a key priority. The political will--the political will--for criminal justice reform is here today. The President was in Newark, New Jersey, today talking about criminal justice reform. Some of my Republican colleagues are talking about it, and my Democratic colleagues are talking about it. The leadership on both sides of the aisle have had meaningful conversations on this issue. We believe that a bipartisan legislative accomplishment can be achieved in this session. I know that there are several bills that are pending, and I hope Mr. Scott will talk extensively about it when he makes his remarks in just a moment. But criminal justice reform can take place in the 114th Congress, and I believe we can reach a bipartisan compromise that can get this bill to the President's desk by the end of this term. Thank you, Ms. Kelly, for yielding time. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, my colleague from North Carolina, for your outstanding remarks on this topic of saving our community. I really, really appreciate it, and so do the American people. At this time, I would like to introduce my other colleague, Representative Bobby Scott from the great State of Virginia. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentlewoman for organizing this Special Order so that we can talk about many aspects of the criminal justice system. You have asked us to talk about the militarization of communities, also what we can do to improve policing and the problem of mass incarceration. On the term of militarizing the communities, there was an amendment offered a few months ago that would have prevented the Department of Defense from giving local police departments certain military equipment. I think it is important to read what was actually in the legislation because some thought that handguns and ammunition was what we were talking about. Actually, the amendment goes into great length specifically about what would be prohibited if that amendment passed to help reduce the militarization of our communities. The Department of Defense has a program where they will give surplus equipment to local communities, and the limitation was that none of these transfers could include aircraft, including drones; armored vehicles; grenade launchers; silencers; toxicological agents, including chemical agents and biological agents; launch vehicles; guided missiles; ballistic missiles; rockets; torpedoes; bombs; mines; or nuclear weapons. Those are the only things that would be barred if this amendment had passed, not handguns and ammunition or other things that local police departments could actually use. But what local police department needs nuclear weapons or torpedoes? We are not talking about the large, sophisticated police forces. This is the kind of stuff that was being given to police departments that you might think of when you think of Andy Griffith and Barney Fife. What do they need with a tank? In one of the local incidents when they had a tank come out, it was pointed out that the people trying to drive the tank hadn't been trained on the tank. Can you just imagine hearing from inside, ``Where are the brakes? Where are the brakes?'' If you need a military response, the appropriate thing to do would be to call in the National Guard. Then you have the military performing the military functions. I think there is a lot that we can do to restrict this kind of equipment going to our local police departments. A lot has been said about policing. We can discuss the problem of policing. We all know that the vast, overwhelming majority of police officers risk their lives on our behalf and do an excellent job. But whenever you get to describe what the problem is, we know what the solution is going to be, and that is to make sure that there is a consensus growing that we need body cameras so we can know exactly what happened and police training so that police can be properly trained on things like how to avoid profiling, how to avoid discrimination, and treating one group different from the other. Implicit bias is what it is called. There is a lot you [[Page H7381]] can do in training, and we need to make sure we have funding for that training. But in terms of mass incarceration, that is where we really need a lot of work. As the chairman mentioned, we have 5 percent of the world's population and 25 percent of the world's prisoners. In most countries, for every 100,000 population, they lock up 50 to 200 people per 100,000. The United States locks up over 700 per 100,000. We are well into the first place. There is nobody close. That number is particularly egregious because there have been recent studies that have suggested that anything over 500 per 100,000 is actually counterproductive. You have got so many people in jail. You have so many families being raised with their parents in prison. Young people are being raised without their parents. You have so many people with felony records having trouble finding jobs. You are wasting so much money that anything over about 500 per 100,000 is counterproductive. We are at 700 and some per 100,000. The African American incarceration rate is in the thousands. That is just wasted money. That is what Texas found when they were looking a few years ago at an appropriations request of $2 billion needed to keep up with all the slogans and sound bites that they had codified in terms of keeping up with the mass incarceration in Texas, $2 billion in construction. And somebody said, ``Well, if you actually make a better choice, if you invested some of that money in prevention, early intervention, and rehabilitation, you might not have to spend all $2 billion.'' That is what they did. They intelligently invested in evidence-based programs, programs studied and known to reduce crime, not just sound like they reduce crime, but actually known to reduce crime, evidence- based policies of prevention, early intervention, and rehabilitation, and they found that they didn't need to build any new prisons. In fact, they were able to close some of the prisons that they had. Over 30 States have figured out that they can reduce crime and save money by reducing mass incarceration. On the other hand, Mr. Speaker, there are people that think slogans and sound bites are good, and that is how we got in the mess we are in now. The chairman mentioned the school-to-prison pipeline. I like to refer to it as the Children's Defense Fund does, as the cradle-to-prison pipeline, because that suggests that there are things all the way along the line that we are not doing that help construct this pipeline that ends up with--at present estimates, one out of three African American boys born today will end up in prison. We can do better than that if we make the appropriate investments all the way through from early childhood education to after-school programs, a continuum of services, to make sure that they create the cradle-to-college-and-career pipeline and not the cradle-to-prison pipeline. That includes investments that have been studied, evidence based, and we know they work. There is a lot you can do in terms of criminal justice reform, but if you do it right, it has to be comprehensive. That means you start with prevention and early intervention, make sure you are making those investments so fewer young people are getting in trouble. Then you have to do police training. We know that good police training can improve policing and, also, reduce crime. Body cameras can eliminate a lot of problems. Last year we passed the Death in Custody Reporting Act, which requires reporting from local police of anybody that dies in their custody in prison, in jail, or in the process of arrest, so we know what is going on around the country. As you have the debate, you can debate from a point of view of facts, not just in allegations when people don't know exactly what the facts are. We can make sure that the police training is there. You can have diversion to make sure that people who are arrested might not have to spend--the only people you need pretrial in jail are those that need to be in jail. You don't want to have unnecessary people serving time and losing their jobs in the process. You need a continuum of services, drug courts which can address the underlying problem rather than just convict them, lock them up, they come back, same thing, come back, back and forth. If you deal with the underlying problem in a drug court, you can have a situation where they are diverted from prison and, also, much less likely to commit a crime in the future. One of the major factors in over-incarceration are the mandatory minimums. We need to have significant reductions in mandatory minimum sentencing to make sure they only apply to a small portion of real, legitimate kingpins, not to girlfriends and people on the periphery that may have gotten caught up in a conspiracy. Once you get into prison, make sure that it is for rehabilitation, not for just warehousing, so you are much less likely to commit a crime when you come out. You have to fund the second chance programs. All of this is part of the SAFE Justice Act, which has the added benefit that, because of the significant reductions in mandatory minimums, there will be savings. The Department of Justice is able to redirect the savings into the prevention, early intervention programs, the drug courts, the body cameras and everything else. So everything in the program is paid for by reducing incarceration. This legislation has the support of a lot of different organizations, liberal and conservative, because everybody knows that, if it is enacted, we will reduce crime and save money. So we know what to do. It is just a matter of making sure we have the political will to do the right thing, to deal with mass incarceration by making the right choice, not the slogans and sound bites, but the evidence-based approach that will actually reduce crime and save money. We can do it. There is legislation pending. There are a lot of different bills, but we need to make sure that the comprehensive approach is reflected in whatever comes to the floor. So I want to thank the gentlewoman from Illinois for bringing us together so we can discuss the militarization of our communities, the solutions for policing, which would include training and body cameras and how we can effectively reduce mass incarceration. We know what to do, and the solutions save more money than they cost. So thank you very much for the opportunity to present that. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you so much for your important remarks. I know this topic is one that you have been researching and studying, trying to come up with solutions for a long time. One thing that is a little disconcerting is you say that the SAFE Justice Act is widely supported, but it still doesn't move. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Well, it doesn't matter which bill moves. The question is whatever moves ought to have the elements of prevention and early intervention, ought to have diversion, and if you only deal with sentencing in the Federal system, you are not dealing with mass incarceration in the United States. The Federal system only has 10 percent of the prisoners. So if you just eliminated the Federal system, you are only talking about 10 percent reduction in incarceration. You have to do something about mass incarceration at the State level. {time} 2015 So when you just talk about sentencing reform, if you reduce a mandatory minimum for 25 to 15 years, the first 15 years, that has no effect, because they will serve the first 15 years, then gradually you will have an effect. If you want an effect, you need to have prevention programs so fewer people are coming into prison, diversion programs so those who are arrested can be diverted from prison, dealt with effectively in drug court so they are much less likely to commit a crime again so that you can reduce crime and save money. You have to make sure you have meaningful mandatory minimum reforms because that is one of the major drivers of the overincarceration. When people are in prison, you have to make sure you have the funding for the programs to make sure they don't come back. And once in the community, the [[Page H7382]] second chance programs that have been very effective need to be funded. We know what to do; it is just a matter of getting it done. It doesn't matter whose bill passes; it is just whatever passes ought to have those elements. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Is there any particular State that you think does a better job that we can hold up as a role model? Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. There are 30 States that have reduced crime and saved money. Texas was one of the first because they were looking at a $2 billion appropriation request to keep up with the slogans and sound bites that they had enacted in mass incarceration. At the rate they were going, they needed $2 billion in prison construction. They decided instead to invest it in prevention programs so fewer kids were getting in trouble; early intervention programs so that once people got in a little trouble, they wouldn't get in worse trouble; and rehabilitation in prisons so that as people got out, they were less likely to come back. They found that they not only didn't have to spend any of the $2 billion building prisons, they were able to close some of the prisons they had. Texas is a red State, and they called their initiative ``Right on Crime.'' Using the word ``right'' in both words is correct, and from the political right. So you had conservatives investing their money appropriately, reducing crime, and saving money. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. That is fantastic. I know in my district, we have held some roundtables, and some of my employers, manufacturers, they shared that they did hire people who were in prison and were some of their best employees because they are so grateful that someone gave them a chance. We really need to promote that and highlight those things. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. The second chance idea is that people who get out of prison ought to be supported. The little money you spend on support pales in consideration to what usually happens. They get out, they can't find a job, they can't do anything, and they are right back into prison at $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 a year. If you spend a little bit of money supporting them, they might not come back. One of the elements the President talked about today is the ``ban the box.'' When you fill out an application, there is a little box, ``Have you ever been convicted of a felony?'' If you check the box, that is the end of the interview. What the ban the box is suggesting is don't talk about the criminal record at first. Go through the process so you can present your credentials. Then, at the end of the process, they can discuss criminal record, but not at the beginning. You will find that many people, the conviction is so far past. Studies have shown that after a few years, if you have got a clean record, the chance of you committing a crime isn't any higher than the general population. So if it is a 15-year-old nonviolent offense, well, maybe it is not relevant; and maybe your credentials are so much better than everybody else's that you are the right person for the job, but you never would have had the opportunity to present your credentials if you had to check the box. So all around the country, cities, States, and businesses are eliminating that box to check, talking to people and seeing if they are actually qualified for the job, and those that are qualified can get the job. Obviously, some violations, if you have got an embezzlement charge and you are trying to get a job in a bank, or child molestation at a daycare center, you know, but a lot of them, if it is a 20-year- old marijuana possession charge or something like that, compared to your credentials, compared to everybody else head and shoulders, well, people can overlook a 20-year-old conviction. You never would have gotten to that point if you had to check the box. That is why the ban the box campaign is so important. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. That is a good idea we have now in Illinois. Thank you, Representative. I really appreciate you taking the time and sharing your vast knowledge about this topic. Mr. Speaker, many of the families that we represent believe that the only and right way to save our communities and secure our better future is to enact laws that actually understand the needs of American families, regardless of circumstance, and invest in their future. This Congress must have a frank conversation about what those investments are and vote for policies that will truly save our communities. And this conversation has to be a bipartisan conversation, not just a Congressional Black Caucus or Democratic conversation. Mr. Speaker, I am reminded that today our colleague, the Honorable Donald Payne, Jr., of New Jersey could not be here because he was asked to be with the President. President Obama visited Congressman Payne's district to discuss criminal justice reform, as you heard a little bit about already. As many of you know, earlier today, President Obama spoke of his intent to make significant reforms in the criminal justice space; and in keeping with the message of ``saving our communities,'' the reforms the President is championing are necessary. I thank the President for his efforts. I want to take just a moment to say that I appreciate the fact that over on the other side of the Hill, a bipartisan coalition of Senators, led by my Congressional Black Caucus colleague, Senator Cory Booker, as well as my home State Senator, the Honorable Dick Durbin, and men willing to cross the aisle, like Senator Mike Lee of Utah, were able to come together to introduce comprehensive legislation aimed at recalibrating prison sentences for certain drug offenders, targeting violent criminals, and granting judges greater discretion at sentencing for low-level drug crimes. Their sentencing reform legislation helps to curve recidivism by helping prisoners successfully reenter society. These are just small components of an overall strategy to help save communities, but they are critical ones nonetheless. Here are the facts. More than half a million people leave U.S. prisons each year with jobs, housing, and mental health services scarce. Many are soon to be back behind bars. Like the President said, many of us in the Congressional Black Caucus are calling on community stakeholders to break the cycle of incarceration by helping former inmates successfully reenter society. So tonight's Special Order hour is an opportunity that comes on the heels of the President's New Jersey visit, a visit where he toured a drug treatment center called the Integrity House, and recognized its work in helping former inmates secure housing, jobs, and skills needed to transition to life outside of prison. I have a place like that in Illinois called the Safer Foundation that does much of the same work. As the President noted, everyone has a role to play in criminal justice reform and reintegrating those who have served time in prison back into society. From businesses that are hiring ex-offenders to philanthropies that are supporting education and training programs, we have to get to work getting ex-offenders back on their feet so they can help build up their communities. Mr. Speaker, this Congress has to have the astuteness and manpower in its ranks to recognize that we must do more, that it will take a village, and it takes real leadership to improve the plight of America's communities. This means we need jobs legislation that offers opportunity. This means we need safe streets free of violence. This means we need community policing that brings us peace of mind and comfort. I feel compelled in this conversation about communities to say that, as a representative of the Chicagoland area and as a co-chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, Congress must get over its fear of talking about violence in America. We have to do more than hold moments of silence when tragedies occur. We have to stop being silent and start acting. We don't have to be enemies on this subject. The issues of gun violence and police violence in our communities are real. It is how we respond to the problems that exist in these areas that will show our strength as a country. Right now, the tragic occurrences that exist with respect to these issues only serve as barriers to our growth as a nation. [[Page H7383]] When I talk about gun violence, I always start out by reminding folks of a few things. First, it is important to realize that gun violence isn't just an urban problem; it is an American problem. In the last 50 years, more than 1 million people have been killed by guns in America. Since 1968, more Americans have died from gunfire than died in all the wars of this country's history. A young Black man is nearly 5 times more likely to be killed by a gun than a young White man, and 13 times more than an Asian American man. If a Black person is killed by a gun, it is judged a homicide 82 percent of the time. And keep in mind, from metal detectors in buildings to shooting safety drills at schools and movie theaters, gun violence has affected all of our communities, not only in terms of how we live, but whether we live at all. And the irony is that, even with all this death and tragedy, this Congress can't even put a background check bill on the House floor, even with an NRA membership that is in 80 percent agreement that we need expanded background checks. Last Congress, even with about 190 cosponsors, the bill never came to the floor. When I talk about saving our communities and discussing the actions of the police, I often remind people of this: the police are not our enemy. I won't ever say that because that simply is not the case. To make our communities safer, we need the support of families, leaders, and our local law enforcement. I come from a family of law enforcement officers and know that our police ranks are filled with brave, well-intentioned, civic-minded heroes. Sadly, too many in the Black community don't have the same family experience that I have had with law enforcement and fear the police. I have a 31-year-old son, and even though the same police are in his family, he hasn't had the same experiences. And, unfortunately, there are still too many police officers who harbor a level of fear when it comes to dealing with the Black community. Mr. Speaker, we have discussed the aftermath of a few high-profile police events. I will repeat what I often say: we must hold our law enforcement officials to the highest professional standards and provide them with the training they need to effectively police diverse communities. This training must address the biases and stereotypes that influence decisions in the field and that create obstacles to mutual understanding. In working to achieve that understanding, we can strive toward a justice system that treats all Americans fairly and values all American lives equally. Before I end, I just want to give my colleague the opportunity to share a few more words. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Illinois for all of her strong work in criminal justice. She has been fighting since she first got here. That is certainly appreciated and has made quite a difference. As you have indicated, this is a moment when adversarial groups and Members of Congress, liberal and conservative, have come to a consensus that we need to reform the criminal justice system. The Safe Justice Act that I mentioned is led by Jim Sensenbrenner from Wisconsin, a Republican, and has Republican and Democratic support. There are bills in the House and the Senate with bipartisan support. If we are going to have this moment where everyone is in agreement, we need to make sure that we do everything we possibly can. I thank you for organizing this Special Order so that we can make criminal justice reform a reality. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you. I thank my colleagues for lending their voices for this important conversation about saving our communities, and I will be submitting some other work from other colleagues not here tonight. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues from the Congressional Black Caucus because last week our nation was reminded, yet again, Black lives have no value. But this time, the reminder was different. It did not come from law enforcement in response to a shooting, traffic stop, or 911 call. Nor did it come from inside a jail cell or a court room. This time, the reminder came from the use of excessive force in a place where most of us would expect it never to happen: our schools. Schools should be safe havens for our nation's children. Unfortunately, actions of Spring Valley school resource officer, Ben Fields, caught on video have proven that they are not. Instead of preparing young minds across the country to tackle our nation's most complex issues, some of our schools are fostering fear and mistrust. And, this is what my young constituents have told me. On October 16, I held a listening session with more than 400 high school students from Northeast Ohio. I was surprised to hear that nearly all of them felt there was no one they could talk to--in their schools or communities--if they felt unsafe. Today, I am not so shocked. With incidents like the one captured in the Spring Valley video, who could blame them? What messages are acts like these sending our youth? Are they to think this behavior is acceptable and that they matter less, if at all? The over criminalization of African-American youth and young adults is already a growing issue in our communities. The number of African- American men in jail continues to rise. African-American and Latino boys and men tend to receive harsher sentences than their peers of other races. Further, the school-to-prison pipeline is as strong as ever, with our African-American students suspended at three times the rate of their White peers. In this case, criminal charges were even filed against the young Spring Valley female student after she was subjected to egregious force by a ``resource officer.'' As a nation, we must stop this vicious cycle. It is time to change the narrative and save our communities for generations to come. I call on my colleagues in Congress to work together to pass policies that tell our children their lives have value. We must pass criminal justice reform and support policies that create a safe, nurturing environment in our schools. The future of our communities depends on it. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, as many of you know, the promotion of best practices and oversight of state and local law enforcement have been legislative priorities during my tenure as a Judiciary Committee member. My Pattern And Practice statute, passed as part of the 1994 crime bill, has served at the dominant tool used by the Department of Justice to address the myriad of policing controversies dating back the LAPD, New Orleans and most recently Seattle, Cleveland and Ferguson, Missouri police departments. Over the past two decades, tensions between police and communities of color have grown as allegations of bias-based policing by law enforcement agents, sometimes supported by data collection efforts and video evidence, have increased in number and frequency. Recent events in the wake of Ferguson, Missouri demonstrate that racial profiling and bias-based policing remain divisive issues in communities across the nation that strikes at the very foundation of our democracy. The deaths of Walter L. Scott--arising from a traffic stop--Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and Antonio Zambrano-Montes--all at the hands of police officers--highlight the links between the issues of race and reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct. Ultimately, these men are tragic examples of the risk of being victimized by a perception of criminality simply because of their race, ethnicity, religion or national origin. Despite the fact that the majority of law enforcement officers perform their duties professionally and without bias, the relationship between the police and some of minority communities has deteriorated to such a degree that federal action is required to begin addressing the issue. With recent Washington Post reports of almost 400 police- involved shooting fatalities in the first five months of 2015, all should agree that the time for bipartisan action is long overdue. In 2001, I welcomed President Bush's invitation to draft legislation that would end the practice of unlawful police profiling, with bipartisan Congressional support. In April, I reintroduced the End Racial Profiling Act in the hope that Congress and the Obama Administration can come together to pass legislation that sends the signal that the Federal government is committed to ensuring that its law enforcement agencies conduct their activities free from bias. In May, the Judiciary Committee, where I am former Chairman and current Ranking Member, held a hearing on Police accountability, where we heard from expert witnesses on police practices and discussed policy options to restoring the relationship between the police and communities of color. In June, I followed up on this effort to address fair policing practices by reintroducing the Law enforcement Trust and Integrity Act. That bill is designed to provide incentives for local police organizations to voluntarily adopt performance-based standards to ensure that incidents of deadly force or misconduct will be [[Page H7384]] minimized through appropriate management and training protocols and properly investigated, should they occur. The bill authorizes the Department of Justice to work cooperatively with independent accreditation, law enforcement and community-based organizations to further develop and refine accreditation standards, and further authorizes the Attorney General to make grants to law enforcement agencies for the purpose of obtaining accreditation from certified law enforcement accreditation organizations. Currently, there are no federally recognized minimum standards for operating a law enforcement agency. The ad hoc nature of police management has accordingly left many officers and agencies in the dark about how to cope with changes in their communities. That is the real reason police officers and department feel so adrift in the current post-Ferguson environment--not the Black Lives Matter Movement. There is a vacuum of leadership in policing that can only be filled by leadership at the federal level. Beyond the human toll created by law enforcement accountability issues, there remains the fiscal impact created by the high cost of litigation settlements for police abuse claims. While most cities fail to systematically track the cost of litigation, the cost reports for major cities have proven staggering. In New York City alone, during Mayor Michael Bloomberg's three term tenure, NYPD payouts were in excess of $1 billion dollars for policing claims. For small departments, the cost of a single high profile incident could prove crippling in its impact on public safety. While the Department of Justice has a range of criminal and civil authority to address policing issues, the Civil Rights Division will never have the resources necessary to investigate more than a small fraction of those departments engaged in unconstitutional conduct, even with the enhanced funding and task force authority granted by this legislation. Through the support of a robust accreditation regime, like that existing in healthcare, Congress can ensure that all communities have the best trained and managed police departments. Only by establishing acceptable police operations standards can we begin to preemptively address issues like use of force and heal the rifts within our communities. Media reports from Baltimore and other cities depicting confrontations between protestors and their police departments illustrate the current divide between law enforcement and the communities they police. In the past years, cities from New York to Cincinnati and Miami to Los Angeles have experienced unrest following controversial use of force incidents by their police. Absent a climate of trust and accountability, community needs are not served and the jobs of the police officers become more difficult and dangerous. The energies of Congress should be focused on the adoption of legislative priorities that address the substance of law enforcement management and strengthen the current battery of tools available to sanction misconduct. As a Congress we have been enthusiastic about supporting programs designed to get officers on the street. We must be just as willing to support programs designed to train and manage them after they get there. The current national climate requires decisive action to implement solutions. Out of respect for all who have lost their lives over the last nine months--both law enforcement and civilian--I hope you will join me in supporting legislation that initiates the reforms necessary to restore public trust and accountability to law enforcement. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my colleagues in speaking on the critically important issue of criminal- justice reform. Just last week, an African-American girl at Spring Valley High School in Columbia, South Carolina was violently arrested by the school's resource officer. This is a disturbing example of a law enforcement officer using excessive force when interacting with a person of color and a perfect illustration of an alarming trend in our schools. We need to have a substantive dialogue around how to empower administrators, teachers, and staff to deal with school disciplinary issues so that students aren't being criminalized for behavioral issues. According to the Department of Education, black females enrolled in New York City and Boston schools are disciplined 10.5 times more on average than their white counterparts. African Americans seem to face undue scrutiny by police officers throughout our communities. Black Americans are more than twice as likely to be unarmed when killed during encounters with police when compared to Caucasians. States and Congress must set higher standards for the use of deadly force and must hold police officers accountable if they violate these standards. This is the first of many steps to begin the process of mending the delicate relationship between law enforcement and people of color. This disparity is increasingly evident when looking at the composition of the U.S. prison population. The Coalition for Public Safety argues that more than 60 percent of our prison population is composed of racial and ethnic minorities. That is why I have supported H.R. 3713, a comprehensive sentencing reform effort with bipartisan support that aims to overhaul the current system which disproportionately affects minorities. I strongly believe that addressing the disparate treatment of people of color at the hands of police is a fundamental step toward creating an equitable society. As one of the first black women to be publically elected from Dallas, I spent my entire career championing equity for communities of color and fighting on behalf of African Americans for social justice. It is clear that there are fundamental problems in police and justice systems across the nation that needs to be addressed. As a former Chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, these issues are of the utmost importance to me and I am personally committed to finding long term solutions. We must act now to remedy the culture and system of violence against people of color. Our nation has endured this disparity for far too long and I encourage my colleagues to not only speak out on this issue, but also take swift and immediate action. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H7379-H7384] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and privilege to lead tonight's Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour, where we will have the opportunity to speak directly to the American people. But before we get to business, I do want to take a second, even though it feels like an eternity, to congratulate my dear friend and colleague, our CBC chairman for the 112th Congress, the Honorable Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City, for his hometown Kansas City Royals victory in last night's World Series game. I am an Illinoisan by way of New York. So I had a little stake in this one. But, again, my congratulations to the city of Kansas City and to Congressman Cleaver. Mr. Speaker, I truly do believe that it is an honor and a privilege to host the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour. So I speak to you this evening very much concerned and severely disappointed that we are even having tonight's topic under such circumstances. Tonight we are here to address saving our communities, where our focus for this hour will be on key legislative priorities that this Congress, this year's Congressional Black Caucus, and our Nation must confront in order to help make this union more perfect for our next generation. Mr. Speaker, this year there have been a lot of tragic episodes that may make one shake their head and ask what is going on. We have covered a number of these topics in the course of this year, whether it be the issue of criminal justice reform, gun violence, economic investment as a antidote to violence, community policing, or the value of Black lives in America. Mr. Speaker, the issues that I will cover this evening aren't Black Caucus issues. I know that most in this Congress and most across this great country would acknowledge that they are American issues. Falling short as a Nation on these fronts only divides us and only serves as a barrier to our boundless possibilities as an American people. Over the past few weeks, we heard a lot about the need to clean out the barn before the baton was passed from Speaker to Speaker. I think we made some progress in clearing out the barn last week as we passed a bipartisan budget agreement, which President Obama signed into law earlier today. But, Mr. Speaker, as the baton has been passed from Speaker Boehner to Speaker Ryan, we must keep in mind that there is still much that needs to be cleaned out of the barn when it comes to criminal justice reform, creating opportunity in vulnerable communities, addressing inequities in the justice system, valuing all lives, regardless of race, religion or sexual orientation, making sure that good cops can do their job in keeping communities safe, and making sure that bad cops don't get to be the Nation's norm. We must have a culture where bad cops don't have a safe haven, where they can't get away with violations of the public trust in communities they were sworn to protect, and where they aren't in a position to spoil the whole bunch of good cops we have protecting American communities. Mr. Speaker, tonight we will have a long and overdue conversation about saving our communities. At this time, I yield to the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, my colleague from North Carolina, Representative G.K. Butterfield. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Let me first thank you, Congresswoman Robin Kelly, for yielding time to me tonight. Thank you for your willingness to stay on the floor tonight, even though this suspension bill was placed in front of us tonight. We certainly understand that has that happen from time to time. But thank you so very much for staying on the floor to manage the time this evening. I also want to thank you, Ms. Kelly, for your extraordinary leadership. Thank you for what you do for the Congressional Black Caucus. Thank you for what you do for your constituents in Illinois. Most importantly, thank you for what you do for our country. It is certainly appreciated. I will certainly join you, Ms. Kelly, in congratulating the Kansas City Royals on their well-deserved victory. I did not watch the entire World Series, but I watched enough of it to know that this team was much deserving of this victory. And so congratulations not only to Mr. Cleaver, who is so proud of Kansas City and talks about his hometown all of the time, but congratulations to all of those fans of that great team. Tonight we are talking about the urgent need to save our communities. What an appropriate topic, Ms. Kelly, because communities all across the country are in crisis. I travel quite a bit across the country and visit many different communities not only in my State, but in many other States. I can tell you firsthand that communities all across our country are facing crises. They are facing crises in so many different respects. They are facing the whole issue of pervasive poverty. Poverty in America is real. We have more than 400 counties in the United States of America that have poverty rates that exceed 20 percent, and all of these have had poverty rates for more than 30 years greater than 20 percent. So poverty is a critical issue in our country, and communities are feeling the effect of it in a significant way. Joblessness. Joblessness. I continue to say that the unemployment rate is [[Page H7380]] unacceptably high. Even though we have made a great improvement in the unemployment rate since the recession, it is still too high. For African American workers, it is hovering somewhere around 10 percent. That is unacceptable. We all talk from time to time and we see it all over the news today about police misconduct. Police misconduct is continuing to be a pervasive problem in so many communities. I'm sure tonight Mr. Bobby Scott from Virginia, who is very passionate about the whole issue of criminal justice reform, is going to talk about mass incarceration in the United States of America. Certainly that is a real problem, and there are many Members in this body who are working every day to try to craft together legislation to try to address the whole question of mass incarceration. Also, we have crumbling schools and infrastructure and highways and tunnels and ports. Our whole infrastructure in this country needs to be addressed. Hopefully, we will be able to pass a transportation bill before the end of the year. Hopefully, my friends on the other side of the aisle will not try to load up the transportation bill with any Ex-Im Bank riders that will be a poison pill that would slow down or even defeat the transportation bill. {time} 2000 So the point is, Ms. Kelly, that we do have an urgent need to save our communities. We need all hands on deck as we take on this challenge. We consistently see, Ms. Kelly, an over-criminalization of African Americans, specifically our youth. We see, for example, minor infractions that occur in the context of a classroom--yes, we have seen that on television over the last few days--a minor infraction in a classroom that escalates into an arrestable offense. Students, particularly those who are African American and Hispanic, are too frequently funneled into the justice system as a result of overly punitive school discipline policies and poorly defined roles for law enforcement in educational settings. Unfortunately, the school-to-prison pipeline is still a reality. When I first came to Congress 11 years ago, we were talking about the school-to-prison pipeline, and we continue to talk about it today. It is a reality. So we must work together to remedy this problem. We, as members of the Congressional Black Caucus, do not at all endorse what some people over the last few days have started to call the ``Ferguson Effect.'' Let me just elaborate on that for a moment. We have heard some high-ranking officials in our country refer to the ``Ferguson Effect.'' They are suggesting in some way that an uptick in crime can be attributable to police inaction because of their fears of the ``Ferguson Effect.'' That is so erroneous. That is so disingenuous. I wish we would concentrate on the problem and not try to get sidetracked on the so- called ``Ferguson Effect.'' The deaths of so many unarmed Black men like Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and Freddie Gray are all a result of a number of issues, including the overcriminalization of minorities and a lack of effective community policing practices. Let us seize this opportunity that we have before us to gain significant ground on several legislative areas which are not only CBC priorities, but are also in the strategic interests of our Nation. Criminal justice reform is one such area. Mr. Speaker and Ms. Kelly, any criminal justice reform, any legislation that we consider, must guarantee a substantial reduction in the prison population for Federal prisoners. We are, as a country, 5 percent of the world's population; yet, we incarcerate 25 percent of those who are incarcerated in the world. There is something is wrong with that, Mr. Speaker. We must make sure that our laws and our criminal laws in this country are fair and that they are not disproportionate and overburdensome in some areas. We have Members of this body on both sides of the aisle who acknowledge the inadequacies in our criminal justice system and see reform as a key priority. The political will--the political will--for criminal justice reform is here today. The President was in Newark, New Jersey, today talking about criminal justice reform. Some of my Republican colleagues are talking about it, and my Democratic colleagues are talking about it. The leadership on both sides of the aisle have had meaningful conversations on this issue. We believe that a bipartisan legislative accomplishment can be achieved in this session. I know that there are several bills that are pending, and I hope Mr. Scott will talk extensively about it when he makes his remarks in just a moment. But criminal justice reform can take place in the 114th Congress, and I believe we can reach a bipartisan compromise that can get this bill to the President's desk by the end of this term. Thank you, Ms. Kelly, for yielding time. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, my colleague from North Carolina, for your outstanding remarks on this topic of saving our community. I really, really appreciate it, and so do the American people. At this time, I would like to introduce my other colleague, Representative Bobby Scott from the great State of Virginia. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentlewoman for organizing this Special Order so that we can talk about many aspects of the criminal justice system. You have asked us to talk about the militarization of communities, also what we can do to improve policing and the problem of mass incarceration. On the term of militarizing the communities, there was an amendment offered a few months ago that would have prevented the Department of Defense from giving local police departments certain military equipment. I think it is important to read what was actually in the legislation because some thought that handguns and ammunition was what we were talking about. Actually, the amendment goes into great length specifically about what would be prohibited if that amendment passed to help reduce the militarization of our communities. The Department of Defense has a program where they will give surplus equipment to local communities, and the limitation was that none of these transfers could include aircraft, including drones; armored vehicles; grenade launchers; silencers; toxicological agents, including chemical agents and biological agents; launch vehicles; guided missiles; ballistic missiles; rockets; torpedoes; bombs; mines; or nuclear weapons. Those are the only things that would be barred if this amendment had passed, not handguns and ammunition or other things that local police departments could actually use. But what local police department needs nuclear weapons or torpedoes? We are not talking about the large, sophisticated police forces. This is the kind of stuff that was being given to police departments that you might think of when you think of Andy Griffith and Barney Fife. What do they need with a tank? In one of the local incidents when they had a tank come out, it was pointed out that the people trying to drive the tank hadn't been trained on the tank. Can you just imagine hearing from inside, ``Where are the brakes? Where are the brakes?'' If you need a military response, the appropriate thing to do would be to call in the National Guard. Then you have the military performing the military functions. I think there is a lot that we can do to restrict this kind of equipment going to our local police departments. A lot has been said about policing. We can discuss the problem of policing. We all know that the vast, overwhelming majority of police officers risk their lives on our behalf and do an excellent job. But whenever you get to describe what the problem is, we know what the solution is going to be, and that is to make sure that there is a consensus growing that we need body cameras so we can know exactly what happened and police training so that police can be properly trained on things like how to avoid profiling, how to avoid discrimination, and treating one group different from the other. Implicit bias is what it is called. There is a lot you [[Page H7381]] can do in training, and we need to make sure we have funding for that training. But in terms of mass incarceration, that is where we really need a lot of work. As the chairman mentioned, we have 5 percent of the world's population and 25 percent of the world's prisoners. In most countries, for every 100,000 population, they lock up 50 to 200 people per 100,000. The United States locks up over 700 per 100,000. We are well into the first place. There is nobody close. That number is particularly egregious because there have been recent studies that have suggested that anything over 500 per 100,000 is actually counterproductive. You have got so many people in jail. You have so many families being raised with their parents in prison. Young people are being raised without their parents. You have so many people with felony records having trouble finding jobs. You are wasting so much money that anything over about 500 per 100,000 is counterproductive. We are at 700 and some per 100,000. The African American incarceration rate is in the thousands. That is just wasted money. That is what Texas found when they were looking a few years ago at an appropriations request of $2 billion needed to keep up with all the slogans and sound bites that they had codified in terms of keeping up with the mass incarceration in Texas, $2 billion in construction. And somebody said, ``Well, if you actually make a better choice, if you invested some of that money in prevention, early intervention, and rehabilitation, you might not have to spend all $2 billion.'' That is what they did. They intelligently invested in evidence-based programs, programs studied and known to reduce crime, not just sound like they reduce crime, but actually known to reduce crime, evidence- based policies of prevention, early intervention, and rehabilitation, and they found that they didn't need to build any new prisons. In fact, they were able to close some of the prisons that they had. Over 30 States have figured out that they can reduce crime and save money by reducing mass incarceration. On the other hand, Mr. Speaker, there are people that think slogans and sound bites are good, and that is how we got in the mess we are in now. The chairman mentioned the school-to-prison pipeline. I like to refer to it as the Children's Defense Fund does, as the cradle-to-prison pipeline, because that suggests that there are things all the way along the line that we are not doing that help construct this pipeline that ends up with--at present estimates, one out of three African American boys born today will end up in prison. We can do better than that if we make the appropriate investments all the way through from early childhood education to after-school programs, a continuum of services, to make sure that they create the cradle-to-college-and-career pipeline and not the cradle-to-prison pipeline. That includes investments that have been studied, evidence based, and we know they work. There is a lot you can do in terms of criminal justice reform, but if you do it right, it has to be comprehensive. That means you start with prevention and early intervention, make sure you are making those investments so fewer young people are getting in trouble. Then you have to do police training. We know that good police training can improve policing and, also, reduce crime. Body cameras can eliminate a lot of problems. Last year we passed the Death in Custody Reporting Act, which requires reporting from local police of anybody that dies in their custody in prison, in jail, or in the process of arrest, so we know what is going on around the country. As you have the debate, you can debate from a point of view of facts, not just in allegations when people don't know exactly what the facts are. We can make sure that the police training is there. You can have diversion to make sure that people who are arrested might not have to spend--the only people you need pretrial in jail are those that need to be in jail. You don't want to have unnecessary people serving time and losing their jobs in the process. You need a continuum of services, drug courts which can address the underlying problem rather than just convict them, lock them up, they come back, same thing, come back, back and forth. If you deal with the underlying problem in a drug court, you can have a situation where they are diverted from prison and, also, much less likely to commit a crime in the future. One of the major factors in over-incarceration are the mandatory minimums. We need to have significant reductions in mandatory minimum sentencing to make sure they only apply to a small portion of real, legitimate kingpins, not to girlfriends and people on the periphery that may have gotten caught up in a conspiracy. Once you get into prison, make sure that it is for rehabilitation, not for just warehousing, so you are much less likely to commit a crime when you come out. You have to fund the second chance programs. All of this is part of the SAFE Justice Act, which has the added benefit that, because of the significant reductions in mandatory minimums, there will be savings. The Department of Justice is able to redirect the savings into the prevention, early intervention programs, the drug courts, the body cameras and everything else. So everything in the program is paid for by reducing incarceration. This legislation has the support of a lot of different organizations, liberal and conservative, because everybody knows that, if it is enacted, we will reduce crime and save money. So we know what to do. It is just a matter of making sure we have the political will to do the right thing, to deal with mass incarceration by making the right choice, not the slogans and sound bites, but the evidence-based approach that will actually reduce crime and save money. We can do it. There is legislation pending. There are a lot of different bills, but we need to make sure that the comprehensive approach is reflected in whatever comes to the floor. So I want to thank the gentlewoman from Illinois for bringing us together so we can discuss the militarization of our communities, the solutions for policing, which would include training and body cameras and how we can effectively reduce mass incarceration. We know what to do, and the solutions save more money than they cost. So thank you very much for the opportunity to present that. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you so much for your important remarks. I know this topic is one that you have been researching and studying, trying to come up with solutions for a long time. One thing that is a little disconcerting is you say that the SAFE Justice Act is widely supported, but it still doesn't move. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Well, it doesn't matter which bill moves. The question is whatever moves ought to have the elements of prevention and early intervention, ought to have diversion, and if you only deal with sentencing in the Federal system, you are not dealing with mass incarceration in the United States. The Federal system only has 10 percent of the prisoners. So if you just eliminated the Federal system, you are only talking about 10 percent reduction in incarceration. You have to do something about mass incarceration at the State level. {time} 2015 So when you just talk about sentencing reform, if you reduce a mandatory minimum for 25 to 15 years, the first 15 years, that has no effect, because they will serve the first 15 years, then gradually you will have an effect. If you want an effect, you need to have prevention programs so fewer people are coming into prison, diversion programs so those who are arrested can be diverted from prison, dealt with effectively in drug court so they are much less likely to commit a crime again so that you can reduce crime and save money. You have to make sure you have meaningful mandatory minimum reforms because that is one of the major drivers of the overincarceration. When people are in prison, you have to make sure you have the funding for the programs to make sure they don't come back. And once in the community, the [[Page H7382]] second chance programs that have been very effective need to be funded. We know what to do; it is just a matter of getting it done. It doesn't matter whose bill passes; it is just whatever passes ought to have those elements. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Is there any particular State that you think does a better job that we can hold up as a role model? Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. There are 30 States that have reduced crime and saved money. Texas was one of the first because they were looking at a $2 billion appropriation request to keep up with the slogans and sound bites that they had enacted in mass incarceration. At the rate they were going, they needed $2 billion in prison construction. They decided instead to invest it in prevention programs so fewer kids were getting in trouble; early intervention programs so that once people got in a little trouble, they wouldn't get in worse trouble; and rehabilitation in prisons so that as people got out, they were less likely to come back. They found that they not only didn't have to spend any of the $2 billion building prisons, they were able to close some of the prisons they had. Texas is a red State, and they called their initiative ``Right on Crime.'' Using the word ``right'' in both words is correct, and from the political right. So you had conservatives investing their money appropriately, reducing crime, and saving money. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. That is fantastic. I know in my district, we have held some roundtables, and some of my employers, manufacturers, they shared that they did hire people who were in prison and were some of their best employees because they are so grateful that someone gave them a chance. We really need to promote that and highlight those things. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. The second chance idea is that people who get out of prison ought to be supported. The little money you spend on support pales in consideration to what usually happens. They get out, they can't find a job, they can't do anything, and they are right back into prison at $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 a year. If you spend a little bit of money supporting them, they might not come back. One of the elements the President talked about today is the ``ban the box.'' When you fill out an application, there is a little box, ``Have you ever been convicted of a felony?'' If you check the box, that is the end of the interview. What the ban the box is suggesting is don't talk about the criminal record at first. Go through the process so you can present your credentials. Then, at the end of the process, they can discuss criminal record, but not at the beginning. You will find that many people, the conviction is so far past. Studies have shown that after a few years, if you have got a clean record, the chance of you committing a crime isn't any higher than the general population. So if it is a 15-year-old nonviolent offense, well, maybe it is not relevant; and maybe your credentials are so much better than everybody else's that you are the right person for the job, but you never would have had the opportunity to present your credentials if you had to check the box. So all around the country, cities, States, and businesses are eliminating that box to check, talking to people and seeing if they are actually qualified for the job, and those that are qualified can get the job. Obviously, some violations, if you have got an embezzlement charge and you are trying to get a job in a bank, or child molestation at a daycare center, you know, but a lot of them, if it is a 20-year- old marijuana possession charge or something like that, compared to your credentials, compared to everybody else head and shoulders, well, people can overlook a 20-year-old conviction. You never would have gotten to that point if you had to check the box. That is why the ban the box campaign is so important. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. That is a good idea we have now in Illinois. Thank you, Representative. I really appreciate you taking the time and sharing your vast knowledge about this topic. Mr. Speaker, many of the families that we represent believe that the only and right way to save our communities and secure our better future is to enact laws that actually understand the needs of American families, regardless of circumstance, and invest in their future. This Congress must have a frank conversation about what those investments are and vote for policies that will truly save our communities. And this conversation has to be a bipartisan conversation, not just a Congressional Black Caucus or Democratic conversation. Mr. Speaker, I am reminded that today our colleague, the Honorable Donald Payne, Jr., of New Jersey could not be here because he was asked to be with the President. President Obama visited Congressman Payne's district to discuss criminal justice reform, as you heard a little bit about already. As many of you know, earlier today, President Obama spoke of his intent to make significant reforms in the criminal justice space; and in keeping with the message of ``saving our communities,'' the reforms the President is championing are necessary. I thank the President for his efforts. I want to take just a moment to say that I appreciate the fact that over on the other side of the Hill, a bipartisan coalition of Senators, led by my Congressional Black Caucus colleague, Senator Cory Booker, as well as my home State Senator, the Honorable Dick Durbin, and men willing to cross the aisle, like Senator Mike Lee of Utah, were able to come together to introduce comprehensive legislation aimed at recalibrating prison sentences for certain drug offenders, targeting violent criminals, and granting judges greater discretion at sentencing for low-level drug crimes. Their sentencing reform legislation helps to curve recidivism by helping prisoners successfully reenter society. These are just small components of an overall strategy to help save communities, but they are critical ones nonetheless. Here are the facts. More than half a million people leave U.S. prisons each year with jobs, housing, and mental health services scarce. Many are soon to be back behind bars. Like the President said, many of us in the Congressional Black Caucus are calling on community stakeholders to break the cycle of incarceration by helping former inmates successfully reenter society. So tonight's Special Order hour is an opportunity that comes on the heels of the President's New Jersey visit, a visit where he toured a drug treatment center called the Integrity House, and recognized its work in helping former inmates secure housing, jobs, and skills needed to transition to life outside of prison. I have a place like that in Illinois called the Safer Foundation that does much of the same work. As the President noted, everyone has a role to play in criminal justice reform and reintegrating those who have served time in prison back into society. From businesses that are hiring ex-offenders to philanthropies that are supporting education and training programs, we have to get to work getting ex-offenders back on their feet so they can help build up their communities. Mr. Speaker, this Congress has to have the astuteness and manpower in its ranks to recognize that we must do more, that it will take a village, and it takes real leadership to improve the plight of America's communities. This means we need jobs legislation that offers opportunity. This means we need safe streets free of violence. This means we need community policing that brings us peace of mind and comfort. I feel compelled in this conversation about communities to say that, as a representative of the Chicagoland area and as a co-chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, Congress must get over its fear of talking about violence in America. We have to do more than hold moments of silence when tragedies occur. We have to stop being silent and start acting. We don't have to be enemies on this subject. The issues of gun violence and police violence in our communities are real. It is how we respond to the problems that exist in these areas that will show our strength as a country. Right now, the tragic occurrences that exist with respect to these issues only serve as barriers to our growth as a nation. [[Page H7383]] When I talk about gun violence, I always start out by reminding folks of a few things. First, it is important to realize that gun violence isn't just an urban problem; it is an American problem. In the last 50 years, more than 1 million people have been killed by guns in America. Since 1968, more Americans have died from gunfire than died in all the wars of this country's history. A young Black man is nearly 5 times more likely to be killed by a gun than a young White man, and 13 times more than an Asian American man. If a Black person is killed by a gun, it is judged a homicide 82 percent of the time. And keep in mind, from metal detectors in buildings to shooting safety drills at schools and movie theaters, gun violence has affected all of our communities, not only in terms of how we live, but whether we live at all. And the irony is that, even with all this death and tragedy, this Congress can't even put a background check bill on the House floor, even with an NRA membership that is in 80 percent agreement that we need expanded background checks. Last Congress, even with about 190 cosponsors, the bill never came to the floor. When I talk about saving our communities and discussing the actions of the police, I often remind people of this: the police are not our enemy. I won't ever say that because that simply is not the case. To make our communities safer, we need the support of families, leaders, and our local law enforcement. I come from a family of law enforcement officers and know that our police ranks are filled with brave, well-intentioned, civic-minded heroes. Sadly, too many in the Black community don't have the same family experience that I have had with law enforcement and fear the police. I have a 31-year-old son, and even though the same police are in his family, he hasn't had the same experiences. And, unfortunately, there are still too many police officers who harbor a level of fear when it comes to dealing with the Black community. Mr. Speaker, we have discussed the aftermath of a few high-profile police events. I will repeat what I often say: we must hold our law enforcement officials to the highest professional standards and provide them with the training they need to effectively police diverse communities. This training must address the biases and stereotypes that influence decisions in the field and that create obstacles to mutual understanding. In working to achieve that understanding, we can strive toward a justice system that treats all Americans fairly and values all American lives equally. Before I end, I just want to give my colleague the opportunity to share a few more words. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Illinois for all of her strong work in criminal justice. She has been fighting since she first got here. That is certainly appreciated and has made quite a difference. As you have indicated, this is a moment when adversarial groups and Members of Congress, liberal and conservative, have come to a consensus that we need to reform the criminal justice system. The Safe Justice Act that I mentioned is led by Jim Sensenbrenner from Wisconsin, a Republican, and has Republican and Democratic support. There are bills in the House and the Senate with bipartisan support. If we are going to have this moment where everyone is in agreement, we need to make sure that we do everything we possibly can. I thank you for organizing this Special Order so that we can make criminal justice reform a reality. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you. I thank my colleagues for lending their voices for this important conversation about saving our communities, and I will be submitting some other work from other colleagues not here tonight. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues from the Congressional Black Caucus because last week our nation was reminded, yet again, Black lives have no value. But this time, the reminder was different. It did not come from law enforcement in response to a shooting, traffic stop, or 911 call. Nor did it come from inside a jail cell or a court room. This time, the reminder came from the use of excessive force in a place where most of us would expect it never to happen: our schools. Schools should be safe havens for our nation's children. Unfortunately, actions of Spring Valley school resource officer, Ben Fields, caught on video have proven that they are not. Instead of preparing young minds across the country to tackle our nation's most complex issues, some of our schools are fostering fear and mistrust. And, this is what my young constituents have told me. On October 16, I held a listening session with more than 400 high school students from Northeast Ohio. I was surprised to hear that nearly all of them felt there was no one they could talk to--in their schools or communities--if they felt unsafe. Today, I am not so shocked. With incidents like the one captured in the Spring Valley video, who could blame them? What messages are acts like these sending our youth? Are they to think this behavior is acceptable and that they matter less, if at all? The over criminalization of African-American youth and young adults is already a growing issue in our communities. The number of African- American men in jail continues to rise. African-American and Latino boys and men tend to receive harsher sentences than their peers of other races. Further, the school-to-prison pipeline is as strong as ever, with our African-American students suspended at three times the rate of their White peers. In this case, criminal charges were even filed against the young Spring Valley female student after she was subjected to egregious force by a ``resource officer.'' As a nation, we must stop this vicious cycle. It is time to change the narrative and save our communities for generations to come. I call on my colleagues in Congress to work together to pass policies that tell our children their lives have value. We must pass criminal justice reform and support policies that create a safe, nurturing environment in our schools. The future of our communities depends on it. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, as many of you know, the promotion of best practices and oversight of state and local law enforcement have been legislative priorities during my tenure as a Judiciary Committee member. My Pattern And Practice statute, passed as part of the 1994 crime bill, has served at the dominant tool used by the Department of Justice to address the myriad of policing controversies dating back the LAPD, New Orleans and most recently Seattle, Cleveland and Ferguson, Missouri police departments. Over the past two decades, tensions between police and communities of color have grown as allegations of bias-based policing by law enforcement agents, sometimes supported by data collection efforts and video evidence, have increased in number and frequency. Recent events in the wake of Ferguson, Missouri demonstrate that racial profiling and bias-based policing remain divisive issues in communities across the nation that strikes at the very foundation of our democracy. The deaths of Walter L. Scott--arising from a traffic stop--Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and Antonio Zambrano-Montes--all at the hands of police officers--highlight the links between the issues of race and reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct. Ultimately, these men are tragic examples of the risk of being victimized by a perception of criminality simply because of their race, ethnicity, religion or national origin. Despite the fact that the majority of law enforcement officers perform their duties professionally and without bias, the relationship between the police and some of minority communities has deteriorated to such a degree that federal action is required to begin addressing the issue. With recent Washington Post reports of almost 400 police- involved shooting fatalities in the first five months of 2015, all should agree that the time for bipartisan action is long overdue. In 2001, I welcomed President Bush's invitation to draft legislation that would end the practice of unlawful police profiling, with bipartisan Congressional support. In April, I reintroduced the End Racial Profiling Act in the hope that Congress and the Obama Administration can come together to pass legislation that sends the signal that the Federal government is committed to ensuring that its law enforcement agencies conduct their activities free from bias. In May, the Judiciary Committee, where I am former Chairman and current Ranking Member, held a hearing on Police accountability, where we heard from expert witnesses on police practices and discussed policy options to restoring the relationship between the police and communities of color. In June, I followed up on this effort to address fair policing practices by reintroducing the Law enforcement Trust and Integrity Act. That bill is designed to provide incentives for local police organizations to voluntarily adopt performance-based standards to ensure that incidents of deadly force or misconduct will be [[Page H7384]] minimized through appropriate management and training protocols and properly investigated, should they occur. The bill authorizes the Department of Justice to work cooperatively with independent accreditation, law enforcement and community-based organizations to further develop and refine accreditation standards, and further authorizes the Attorney General to make grants to law enforcement agencies for the purpose of obtaining accreditation from certified law enforcement accreditation organizations. Currently, there are no federally recognized minimum standards for operating a law enforcement agency. The ad hoc nature of police management has accordingly left many officers and agencies in the dark about how to cope with changes in their communities. That is the real reason police officers and department feel so adrift in the current post-Ferguson environment--not the Black Lives Matter Movement. There is a vacuum of leadership in policing that can only be filled by leadership at the federal level. Beyond the human toll created by law enforcement accountability issues, there remains the fiscal impact created by the high cost of litigation settlements for police abuse claims. While most cities fail to systematically track the cost of litigation, the cost reports for major cities have proven staggering. In New York City alone, during Mayor Michael Bloomberg's three term tenure, NYPD payouts were in excess of $1 billion dollars for policing claims. For small departments, the cost of a single high profile incident could prove crippling in its impact on public safety. While the Department of Justice has a range of criminal and civil authority to address policing issues, the Civil Rights Division will never have the resources necessary to investigate more than a small fraction of those departments engaged in unconstitutional conduct, even with the enhanced funding and task force authority granted by this legislation. Through the support of a robust accreditation regime, like that existing in healthcare, Congress can ensure that all communities have the best trained and managed police departments. Only by establishing acceptable police operations standards can we begin to preemptively address issues like use of force and heal the rifts within our communities. Media reports from Baltimore and other cities depicting confrontations between protestors and their police departments illustrate the current divide between law enforcement and the communities they police. In the past years, cities from New York to Cincinnati and Miami to Los Angeles have experienced unrest following controversial use of force incidents by their police. Absent a climate of trust and accountability, community needs are not served and the jobs of the police officers become more difficult and dangerous. The energies of Congress should be focused on the adoption of legislative priorities that address the substance of law enforcement management and strengthen the current battery of tools available to sanction misconduct. As a Congress we have been enthusiastic about supporting programs designed to get officers on the street. We must be just as willing to support programs designed to train and manage them after they get there. The current national climate requires decisive action to implement solutions. Out of respect for all who have lost their lives over the last nine months--both law enforcement and civilian--I hope you will join me in supporting legislation that initiates the reforms necessary to restore public trust and accountability to law enforcement. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my colleagues in speaking on the critically important issue of criminal- justice reform. Just last week, an African-American girl at Spring Valley High School in Columbia, South Carolina was violently arrested by the school's resource officer. This is a disturbing example of a law enforcement officer using excessive force when interacting with a person of color and a perfect illustration of an alarming trend in our schools. We need to have a substantive dialogue around how to empower administrators, teachers, and staff to deal with school disciplinary issues so that students aren't being criminalized for behavioral issues. According to the Department of Education, black females enrolled in New York City and Boston schools are disciplined 10.5 times more on average than their white counterparts. African Americans seem to face undue scrutiny by police officers throughout our communities. Black Americans are more than twice as likely to be unarmed when killed during encounters with police when compared to Caucasians. States and Congress must set higher standards for the use of deadly force and must hold police officers accountable if they violate these standards. This is the first of many steps to begin the process of mending the delicate relationship between law enforcement and people of color. This disparity is increasingly evident when looking at the composition of the U.S. prison population. The Coalition for Public Safety argues that more than 60 percent of our prison population is composed of racial and ethnic minorities. That is why I have supported H.R. 3713, a comprehensive sentencing reform effort with bipartisan support that aims to overhaul the current system which disproportionately affects minorities. I strongly believe that addressing the disparate treatment of people of color at the hands of police is a fundamental step toward creating an equitable society. As one of the first black women to be publically elected from Dallas, I spent my entire career championing equity for communities of color and fighting on behalf of African Americans for social justice. It is clear that there are fundamental problems in police and justice systems across the nation that needs to be addressed. As a former Chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, these issues are of the utmost importance to me and I am personally committed to finding long term solutions. We must act now to remedy the culture and system of violence against people of color. Our nation has endured this disparity for far too long and I encourage my colleagues to not only speak out on this issue, but also take swift and immediate action. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015)] [House] [Pages H7379-H7384] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. General Leave Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and privilege to lead tonight's Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour, where we will have the opportunity to speak directly to the American people. But before we get to business, I do want to take a second, even though it feels like an eternity, to congratulate my dear friend and colleague, our CBC chairman for the 112th Congress, the Honorable Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City, for his hometown Kansas City Royals victory in last night's World Series game. I am an Illinoisan by way of New York. So I had a little stake in this one. But, again, my congratulations to the city of Kansas City and to Congressman Cleaver. Mr. Speaker, I truly do believe that it is an honor and a privilege to host the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour. So I speak to you this evening very much concerned and severely disappointed that we are even having tonight's topic under such circumstances. Tonight we are here to address saving our communities, where our focus for this hour will be on key legislative priorities that this Congress, this year's Congressional Black Caucus, and our Nation must confront in order to help make this union more perfect for our next generation. Mr. Speaker, this year there have been a lot of tragic episodes that may make one shake their head and ask what is going on. We have covered a number of these topics in the course of this year, whether it be the issue of criminal justice reform, gun violence, economic investment as a antidote to violence, community policing, or the value of Black lives in America. Mr. Speaker, the issues that I will cover this evening aren't Black Caucus issues. I know that most in this Congress and most across this great country would acknowledge that they are American issues. Falling short as a Nation on these fronts only divides us and only serves as a barrier to our boundless possibilities as an American people. Over the past few weeks, we heard a lot about the need to clean out the barn before the baton was passed from Speaker to Speaker. I think we made some progress in clearing out the barn last week as we passed a bipartisan budget agreement, which President Obama signed into law earlier today. But, Mr. Speaker, as the baton has been passed from Speaker Boehner to Speaker Ryan, we must keep in mind that there is still much that needs to be cleaned out of the barn when it comes to criminal justice reform, creating opportunity in vulnerable communities, addressing inequities in the justice system, valuing all lives, regardless of race, religion or sexual orientation, making sure that good cops can do their job in keeping communities safe, and making sure that bad cops don't get to be the Nation's norm. We must have a culture where bad cops don't have a safe haven, where they can't get away with violations of the public trust in communities they were sworn to protect, and where they aren't in a position to spoil the whole bunch of good cops we have protecting American communities. Mr. Speaker, tonight we will have a long and overdue conversation about saving our communities. At this time, I yield to the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, my colleague from North Carolina, Representative G.K. Butterfield. Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Let me first thank you, Congresswoman Robin Kelly, for yielding time to me tonight. Thank you for your willingness to stay on the floor tonight, even though this suspension bill was placed in front of us tonight. We certainly understand that has that happen from time to time. But thank you so very much for staying on the floor to manage the time this evening. I also want to thank you, Ms. Kelly, for your extraordinary leadership. Thank you for what you do for the Congressional Black Caucus. Thank you for what you do for your constituents in Illinois. Most importantly, thank you for what you do for our country. It is certainly appreciated. I will certainly join you, Ms. Kelly, in congratulating the Kansas City Royals on their well-deserved victory. I did not watch the entire World Series, but I watched enough of it to know that this team was much deserving of this victory. And so congratulations not only to Mr. Cleaver, who is so proud of Kansas City and talks about his hometown all of the time, but congratulations to all of those fans of that great team. Tonight we are talking about the urgent need to save our communities. What an appropriate topic, Ms. Kelly, because communities all across the country are in crisis. I travel quite a bit across the country and visit many different communities not only in my State, but in many other States. I can tell you firsthand that communities all across our country are facing crises. They are facing crises in so many different respects. They are facing the whole issue of pervasive poverty. Poverty in America is real. We have more than 400 counties in the United States of America that have poverty rates that exceed 20 percent, and all of these have had poverty rates for more than 30 years greater than 20 percent. So poverty is a critical issue in our country, and communities are feeling the effect of it in a significant way. Joblessness. Joblessness. I continue to say that the unemployment rate is [[Page H7380]] unacceptably high. Even though we have made a great improvement in the unemployment rate since the recession, it is still too high. For African American workers, it is hovering somewhere around 10 percent. That is unacceptable. We all talk from time to time and we see it all over the news today about police misconduct. Police misconduct is continuing to be a pervasive problem in so many communities. I'm sure tonight Mr. Bobby Scott from Virginia, who is very passionate about the whole issue of criminal justice reform, is going to talk about mass incarceration in the United States of America. Certainly that is a real problem, and there are many Members in this body who are working every day to try to craft together legislation to try to address the whole question of mass incarceration. Also, we have crumbling schools and infrastructure and highways and tunnels and ports. Our whole infrastructure in this country needs to be addressed. Hopefully, we will be able to pass a transportation bill before the end of the year. Hopefully, my friends on the other side of the aisle will not try to load up the transportation bill with any Ex-Im Bank riders that will be a poison pill that would slow down or even defeat the transportation bill. {time} 2000 So the point is, Ms. Kelly, that we do have an urgent need to save our communities. We need all hands on deck as we take on this challenge. We consistently see, Ms. Kelly, an over-criminalization of African Americans, specifically our youth. We see, for example, minor infractions that occur in the context of a classroom--yes, we have seen that on television over the last few days--a minor infraction in a classroom that escalates into an arrestable offense. Students, particularly those who are African American and Hispanic, are too frequently funneled into the justice system as a result of overly punitive school discipline policies and poorly defined roles for law enforcement in educational settings. Unfortunately, the school-to-prison pipeline is still a reality. When I first came to Congress 11 years ago, we were talking about the school-to-prison pipeline, and we continue to talk about it today. It is a reality. So we must work together to remedy this problem. We, as members of the Congressional Black Caucus, do not at all endorse what some people over the last few days have started to call the ``Ferguson Effect.'' Let me just elaborate on that for a moment. We have heard some high-ranking officials in our country refer to the ``Ferguson Effect.'' They are suggesting in some way that an uptick in crime can be attributable to police inaction because of their fears of the ``Ferguson Effect.'' That is so erroneous. That is so disingenuous. I wish we would concentrate on the problem and not try to get sidetracked on the so- called ``Ferguson Effect.'' The deaths of so many unarmed Black men like Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and Freddie Gray are all a result of a number of issues, including the overcriminalization of minorities and a lack of effective community policing practices. Let us seize this opportunity that we have before us to gain significant ground on several legislative areas which are not only CBC priorities, but are also in the strategic interests of our Nation. Criminal justice reform is one such area. Mr. Speaker and Ms. Kelly, any criminal justice reform, any legislation that we consider, must guarantee a substantial reduction in the prison population for Federal prisoners. We are, as a country, 5 percent of the world's population; yet, we incarcerate 25 percent of those who are incarcerated in the world. There is something is wrong with that, Mr. Speaker. We must make sure that our laws and our criminal laws in this country are fair and that they are not disproportionate and overburdensome in some areas. We have Members of this body on both sides of the aisle who acknowledge the inadequacies in our criminal justice system and see reform as a key priority. The political will--the political will--for criminal justice reform is here today. The President was in Newark, New Jersey, today talking about criminal justice reform. Some of my Republican colleagues are talking about it, and my Democratic colleagues are talking about it. The leadership on both sides of the aisle have had meaningful conversations on this issue. We believe that a bipartisan legislative accomplishment can be achieved in this session. I know that there are several bills that are pending, and I hope Mr. Scott will talk extensively about it when he makes his remarks in just a moment. But criminal justice reform can take place in the 114th Congress, and I believe we can reach a bipartisan compromise that can get this bill to the President's desk by the end of this term. Thank you, Ms. Kelly, for yielding time. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you, my colleague from North Carolina, for your outstanding remarks on this topic of saving our community. I really, really appreciate it, and so do the American people. At this time, I would like to introduce my other colleague, Representative Bobby Scott from the great State of Virginia. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentlewoman for organizing this Special Order so that we can talk about many aspects of the criminal justice system. You have asked us to talk about the militarization of communities, also what we can do to improve policing and the problem of mass incarceration. On the term of militarizing the communities, there was an amendment offered a few months ago that would have prevented the Department of Defense from giving local police departments certain military equipment. I think it is important to read what was actually in the legislation because some thought that handguns and ammunition was what we were talking about. Actually, the amendment goes into great length specifically about what would be prohibited if that amendment passed to help reduce the militarization of our communities. The Department of Defense has a program where they will give surplus equipment to local communities, and the limitation was that none of these transfers could include aircraft, including drones; armored vehicles; grenade launchers; silencers; toxicological agents, including chemical agents and biological agents; launch vehicles; guided missiles; ballistic missiles; rockets; torpedoes; bombs; mines; or nuclear weapons. Those are the only things that would be barred if this amendment had passed, not handguns and ammunition or other things that local police departments could actually use. But what local police department needs nuclear weapons or torpedoes? We are not talking about the large, sophisticated police forces. This is the kind of stuff that was being given to police departments that you might think of when you think of Andy Griffith and Barney Fife. What do they need with a tank? In one of the local incidents when they had a tank come out, it was pointed out that the people trying to drive the tank hadn't been trained on the tank. Can you just imagine hearing from inside, ``Where are the brakes? Where are the brakes?'' If you need a military response, the appropriate thing to do would be to call in the National Guard. Then you have the military performing the military functions. I think there is a lot that we can do to restrict this kind of equipment going to our local police departments. A lot has been said about policing. We can discuss the problem of policing. We all know that the vast, overwhelming majority of police officers risk their lives on our behalf and do an excellent job. But whenever you get to describe what the problem is, we know what the solution is going to be, and that is to make sure that there is a consensus growing that we need body cameras so we can know exactly what happened and police training so that police can be properly trained on things like how to avoid profiling, how to avoid discrimination, and treating one group different from the other. Implicit bias is what it is called. There is a lot you [[Page H7381]] can do in training, and we need to make sure we have funding for that training. But in terms of mass incarceration, that is where we really need a lot of work. As the chairman mentioned, we have 5 percent of the world's population and 25 percent of the world's prisoners. In most countries, for every 100,000 population, they lock up 50 to 200 people per 100,000. The United States locks up over 700 per 100,000. We are well into the first place. There is nobody close. That number is particularly egregious because there have been recent studies that have suggested that anything over 500 per 100,000 is actually counterproductive. You have got so many people in jail. You have so many families being raised with their parents in prison. Young people are being raised without their parents. You have so many people with felony records having trouble finding jobs. You are wasting so much money that anything over about 500 per 100,000 is counterproductive. We are at 700 and some per 100,000. The African American incarceration rate is in the thousands. That is just wasted money. That is what Texas found when they were looking a few years ago at an appropriations request of $2 billion needed to keep up with all the slogans and sound bites that they had codified in terms of keeping up with the mass incarceration in Texas, $2 billion in construction. And somebody said, ``Well, if you actually make a better choice, if you invested some of that money in prevention, early intervention, and rehabilitation, you might not have to spend all $2 billion.'' That is what they did. They intelligently invested in evidence-based programs, programs studied and known to reduce crime, not just sound like they reduce crime, but actually known to reduce crime, evidence- based policies of prevention, early intervention, and rehabilitation, and they found that they didn't need to build any new prisons. In fact, they were able to close some of the prisons that they had. Over 30 States have figured out that they can reduce crime and save money by reducing mass incarceration. On the other hand, Mr. Speaker, there are people that think slogans and sound bites are good, and that is how we got in the mess we are in now. The chairman mentioned the school-to-prison pipeline. I like to refer to it as the Children's Defense Fund does, as the cradle-to-prison pipeline, because that suggests that there are things all the way along the line that we are not doing that help construct this pipeline that ends up with--at present estimates, one out of three African American boys born today will end up in prison. We can do better than that if we make the appropriate investments all the way through from early childhood education to after-school programs, a continuum of services, to make sure that they create the cradle-to-college-and-career pipeline and not the cradle-to-prison pipeline. That includes investments that have been studied, evidence based, and we know they work. There is a lot you can do in terms of criminal justice reform, but if you do it right, it has to be comprehensive. That means you start with prevention and early intervention, make sure you are making those investments so fewer young people are getting in trouble. Then you have to do police training. We know that good police training can improve policing and, also, reduce crime. Body cameras can eliminate a lot of problems. Last year we passed the Death in Custody Reporting Act, which requires reporting from local police of anybody that dies in their custody in prison, in jail, or in the process of arrest, so we know what is going on around the country. As you have the debate, you can debate from a point of view of facts, not just in allegations when people don't know exactly what the facts are. We can make sure that the police training is there. You can have diversion to make sure that people who are arrested might not have to spend--the only people you need pretrial in jail are those that need to be in jail. You don't want to have unnecessary people serving time and losing their jobs in the process. You need a continuum of services, drug courts which can address the underlying problem rather than just convict them, lock them up, they come back, same thing, come back, back and forth. If you deal with the underlying problem in a drug court, you can have a situation where they are diverted from prison and, also, much less likely to commit a crime in the future. One of the major factors in over-incarceration are the mandatory minimums. We need to have significant reductions in mandatory minimum sentencing to make sure they only apply to a small portion of real, legitimate kingpins, not to girlfriends and people on the periphery that may have gotten caught up in a conspiracy. Once you get into prison, make sure that it is for rehabilitation, not for just warehousing, so you are much less likely to commit a crime when you come out. You have to fund the second chance programs. All of this is part of the SAFE Justice Act, which has the added benefit that, because of the significant reductions in mandatory minimums, there will be savings. The Department of Justice is able to redirect the savings into the prevention, early intervention programs, the drug courts, the body cameras and everything else. So everything in the program is paid for by reducing incarceration. This legislation has the support of a lot of different organizations, liberal and conservative, because everybody knows that, if it is enacted, we will reduce crime and save money. So we know what to do. It is just a matter of making sure we have the political will to do the right thing, to deal with mass incarceration by making the right choice, not the slogans and sound bites, but the evidence-based approach that will actually reduce crime and save money. We can do it. There is legislation pending. There are a lot of different bills, but we need to make sure that the comprehensive approach is reflected in whatever comes to the floor. So I want to thank the gentlewoman from Illinois for bringing us together so we can discuss the militarization of our communities, the solutions for policing, which would include training and body cameras and how we can effectively reduce mass incarceration. We know what to do, and the solutions save more money than they cost. So thank you very much for the opportunity to present that. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you so much for your important remarks. I know this topic is one that you have been researching and studying, trying to come up with solutions for a long time. One thing that is a little disconcerting is you say that the SAFE Justice Act is widely supported, but it still doesn't move. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Well, it doesn't matter which bill moves. The question is whatever moves ought to have the elements of prevention and early intervention, ought to have diversion, and if you only deal with sentencing in the Federal system, you are not dealing with mass incarceration in the United States. The Federal system only has 10 percent of the prisoners. So if you just eliminated the Federal system, you are only talking about 10 percent reduction in incarceration. You have to do something about mass incarceration at the State level. {time} 2015 So when you just talk about sentencing reform, if you reduce a mandatory minimum for 25 to 15 years, the first 15 years, that has no effect, because they will serve the first 15 years, then gradually you will have an effect. If you want an effect, you need to have prevention programs so fewer people are coming into prison, diversion programs so those who are arrested can be diverted from prison, dealt with effectively in drug court so they are much less likely to commit a crime again so that you can reduce crime and save money. You have to make sure you have meaningful mandatory minimum reforms because that is one of the major drivers of the overincarceration. When people are in prison, you have to make sure you have the funding for the programs to make sure they don't come back. And once in the community, the [[Page H7382]] second chance programs that have been very effective need to be funded. We know what to do; it is just a matter of getting it done. It doesn't matter whose bill passes; it is just whatever passes ought to have those elements. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Is there any particular State that you think does a better job that we can hold up as a role model? Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. There are 30 States that have reduced crime and saved money. Texas was one of the first because they were looking at a $2 billion appropriation request to keep up with the slogans and sound bites that they had enacted in mass incarceration. At the rate they were going, they needed $2 billion in prison construction. They decided instead to invest it in prevention programs so fewer kids were getting in trouble; early intervention programs so that once people got in a little trouble, they wouldn't get in worse trouble; and rehabilitation in prisons so that as people got out, they were less likely to come back. They found that they not only didn't have to spend any of the $2 billion building prisons, they were able to close some of the prisons they had. Texas is a red State, and they called their initiative ``Right on Crime.'' Using the word ``right'' in both words is correct, and from the political right. So you had conservatives investing their money appropriately, reducing crime, and saving money. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. That is fantastic. I know in my district, we have held some roundtables, and some of my employers, manufacturers, they shared that they did hire people who were in prison and were some of their best employees because they are so grateful that someone gave them a chance. We really need to promote that and highlight those things. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. The second chance idea is that people who get out of prison ought to be supported. The little money you spend on support pales in consideration to what usually happens. They get out, they can't find a job, they can't do anything, and they are right back into prison at $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 a year. If you spend a little bit of money supporting them, they might not come back. One of the elements the President talked about today is the ``ban the box.'' When you fill out an application, there is a little box, ``Have you ever been convicted of a felony?'' If you check the box, that is the end of the interview. What the ban the box is suggesting is don't talk about the criminal record at first. Go through the process so you can present your credentials. Then, at the end of the process, they can discuss criminal record, but not at the beginning. You will find that many people, the conviction is so far past. Studies have shown that after a few years, if you have got a clean record, the chance of you committing a crime isn't any higher than the general population. So if it is a 15-year-old nonviolent offense, well, maybe it is not relevant; and maybe your credentials are so much better than everybody else's that you are the right person for the job, but you never would have had the opportunity to present your credentials if you had to check the box. So all around the country, cities, States, and businesses are eliminating that box to check, talking to people and seeing if they are actually qualified for the job, and those that are qualified can get the job. Obviously, some violations, if you have got an embezzlement charge and you are trying to get a job in a bank, or child molestation at a daycare center, you know, but a lot of them, if it is a 20-year- old marijuana possession charge or something like that, compared to your credentials, compared to everybody else head and shoulders, well, people can overlook a 20-year-old conviction. You never would have gotten to that point if you had to check the box. That is why the ban the box campaign is so important. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. That is a good idea we have now in Illinois. Thank you, Representative. I really appreciate you taking the time and sharing your vast knowledge about this topic. Mr. Speaker, many of the families that we represent believe that the only and right way to save our communities and secure our better future is to enact laws that actually understand the needs of American families, regardless of circumstance, and invest in their future. This Congress must have a frank conversation about what those investments are and vote for policies that will truly save our communities. And this conversation has to be a bipartisan conversation, not just a Congressional Black Caucus or Democratic conversation. Mr. Speaker, I am reminded that today our colleague, the Honorable Donald Payne, Jr., of New Jersey could not be here because he was asked to be with the President. President Obama visited Congressman Payne's district to discuss criminal justice reform, as you heard a little bit about already. As many of you know, earlier today, President Obama spoke of his intent to make significant reforms in the criminal justice space; and in keeping with the message of ``saving our communities,'' the reforms the President is championing are necessary. I thank the President for his efforts. I want to take just a moment to say that I appreciate the fact that over on the other side of the Hill, a bipartisan coalition of Senators, led by my Congressional Black Caucus colleague, Senator Cory Booker, as well as my home State Senator, the Honorable Dick Durbin, and men willing to cross the aisle, like Senator Mike Lee of Utah, were able to come together to introduce comprehensive legislation aimed at recalibrating prison sentences for certain drug offenders, targeting violent criminals, and granting judges greater discretion at sentencing for low-level drug crimes. Their sentencing reform legislation helps to curve recidivism by helping prisoners successfully reenter society. These are just small components of an overall strategy to help save communities, but they are critical ones nonetheless. Here are the facts. More than half a million people leave U.S. prisons each year with jobs, housing, and mental health services scarce. Many are soon to be back behind bars. Like the President said, many of us in the Congressional Black Caucus are calling on community stakeholders to break the cycle of incarceration by helping former inmates successfully reenter society. So tonight's Special Order hour is an opportunity that comes on the heels of the President's New Jersey visit, a visit where he toured a drug treatment center called the Integrity House, and recognized its work in helping former inmates secure housing, jobs, and skills needed to transition to life outside of prison. I have a place like that in Illinois called the Safer Foundation that does much of the same work. As the President noted, everyone has a role to play in criminal justice reform and reintegrating those who have served time in prison back into society. From businesses that are hiring ex-offenders to philanthropies that are supporting education and training programs, we have to get to work getting ex-offenders back on their feet so they can help build up their communities. Mr. Speaker, this Congress has to have the astuteness and manpower in its ranks to recognize that we must do more, that it will take a village, and it takes real leadership to improve the plight of America's communities. This means we need jobs legislation that offers opportunity. This means we need safe streets free of violence. This means we need community policing that brings us peace of mind and comfort. I feel compelled in this conversation about communities to say that, as a representative of the Chicagoland area and as a co-chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, Congress must get over its fear of talking about violence in America. We have to do more than hold moments of silence when tragedies occur. We have to stop being silent and start acting. We don't have to be enemies on this subject. The issues of gun violence and police violence in our communities are real. It is how we respond to the problems that exist in these areas that will show our strength as a country. Right now, the tragic occurrences that exist with respect to these issues only serve as barriers to our growth as a nation. [[Page H7383]] When I talk about gun violence, I always start out by reminding folks of a few things. First, it is important to realize that gun violence isn't just an urban problem; it is an American problem. In the last 50 years, more than 1 million people have been killed by guns in America. Since 1968, more Americans have died from gunfire than died in all the wars of this country's history. A young Black man is nearly 5 times more likely to be killed by a gun than a young White man, and 13 times more than an Asian American man. If a Black person is killed by a gun, it is judged a homicide 82 percent of the time. And keep in mind, from metal detectors in buildings to shooting safety drills at schools and movie theaters, gun violence has affected all of our communities, not only in terms of how we live, but whether we live at all. And the irony is that, even with all this death and tragedy, this Congress can't even put a background check bill on the House floor, even with an NRA membership that is in 80 percent agreement that we need expanded background checks. Last Congress, even with about 190 cosponsors, the bill never came to the floor. When I talk about saving our communities and discussing the actions of the police, I often remind people of this: the police are not our enemy. I won't ever say that because that simply is not the case. To make our communities safer, we need the support of families, leaders, and our local law enforcement. I come from a family of law enforcement officers and know that our police ranks are filled with brave, well-intentioned, civic-minded heroes. Sadly, too many in the Black community don't have the same family experience that I have had with law enforcement and fear the police. I have a 31-year-old son, and even though the same police are in his family, he hasn't had the same experiences. And, unfortunately, there are still too many police officers who harbor a level of fear when it comes to dealing with the Black community. Mr. Speaker, we have discussed the aftermath of a few high-profile police events. I will repeat what I often say: we must hold our law enforcement officials to the highest professional standards and provide them with the training they need to effectively police diverse communities. This training must address the biases and stereotypes that influence decisions in the field and that create obstacles to mutual understanding. In working to achieve that understanding, we can strive toward a justice system that treats all Americans fairly and values all American lives equally. Before I end, I just want to give my colleague the opportunity to share a few more words. Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Illinois for all of her strong work in criminal justice. She has been fighting since she first got here. That is certainly appreciated and has made quite a difference. As you have indicated, this is a moment when adversarial groups and Members of Congress, liberal and conservative, have come to a consensus that we need to reform the criminal justice system. The Safe Justice Act that I mentioned is led by Jim Sensenbrenner from Wisconsin, a Republican, and has Republican and Democratic support. There are bills in the House and the Senate with bipartisan support. If we are going to have this moment where everyone is in agreement, we need to make sure that we do everything we possibly can. I thank you for organizing this Special Order so that we can make criminal justice reform a reality. Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Thank you. I thank my colleagues for lending their voices for this important conversation about saving our communities, and I will be submitting some other work from other colleagues not here tonight. I yield back the balance of my time. Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues from the Congressional Black Caucus because last week our nation was reminded, yet again, Black lives have no value. But this time, the reminder was different. It did not come from law enforcement in response to a shooting, traffic stop, or 911 call. Nor did it come from inside a jail cell or a court room. This time, the reminder came from the use of excessive force in a place where most of us would expect it never to happen: our schools. Schools should be safe havens for our nation's children. Unfortunately, actions of Spring Valley school resource officer, Ben Fields, caught on video have proven that they are not. Instead of preparing young minds across the country to tackle our nation's most complex issues, some of our schools are fostering fear and mistrust. And, this is what my young constituents have told me. On October 16, I held a listening session with more than 400 high school students from Northeast Ohio. I was surprised to hear that nearly all of them felt there was no one they could talk to--in their schools or communities--if they felt unsafe. Today, I am not so shocked. With incidents like the one captured in the Spring Valley video, who could blame them? What messages are acts like these sending our youth? Are they to think this behavior is acceptable and that they matter less, if at all? The over criminalization of African-American youth and young adults is already a growing issue in our communities. The number of African- American men in jail continues to rise. African-American and Latino boys and men tend to receive harsher sentences than their peers of other races. Further, the school-to-prison pipeline is as strong as ever, with our African-American students suspended at three times the rate of their White peers. In this case, criminal charges were even filed against the young Spring Valley female student after she was subjected to egregious force by a ``resource officer.'' As a nation, we must stop this vicious cycle. It is time to change the narrative and save our communities for generations to come. I call on my colleagues in Congress to work together to pass policies that tell our children their lives have value. We must pass criminal justice reform and support policies that create a safe, nurturing environment in our schools. The future of our communities depends on it. Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, as many of you know, the promotion of best practices and oversight of state and local law enforcement have been legislative priorities during my tenure as a Judiciary Committee member. My Pattern And Practice statute, passed as part of the 1994 crime bill, has served at the dominant tool used by the Department of Justice to address the myriad of policing controversies dating back the LAPD, New Orleans and most recently Seattle, Cleveland and Ferguson, Missouri police departments. Over the past two decades, tensions between police and communities of color have grown as allegations of bias-based policing by law enforcement agents, sometimes supported by data collection efforts and video evidence, have increased in number and frequency. Recent events in the wake of Ferguson, Missouri demonstrate that racial profiling and bias-based policing remain divisive issues in communities across the nation that strikes at the very foundation of our democracy. The deaths of Walter L. Scott--arising from a traffic stop--Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and Antonio Zambrano-Montes--all at the hands of police officers--highlight the links between the issues of race and reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct. Ultimately, these men are tragic examples of the risk of being victimized by a perception of criminality simply because of their race, ethnicity, religion or national origin. Despite the fact that the majority of law enforcement officers perform their duties professionally and without bias, the relationship between the police and some of minority communities has deteriorated to such a degree that federal action is required to begin addressing the issue. With recent Washington Post reports of almost 400 police- involved shooting fatalities in the first five months of 2015, all should agree that the time for bipartisan action is long overdue. In 2001, I welcomed President Bush's invitation to draft legislation that would end the practice of unlawful police profiling, with bipartisan Congressional support. In April, I reintroduced the End Racial Profiling Act in the hope that Congress and the Obama Administration can come together to pass legislation that sends the signal that the Federal government is committed to ensuring that its law enforcement agencies conduct their activities free from bias. In May, the Judiciary Committee, where I am former Chairman and current Ranking Member, held a hearing on Police accountability, where we heard from expert witnesses on police practices and discussed policy options to restoring the relationship between the police and communities of color. In June, I followed up on this effort to address fair policing practices by reintroducing the Law enforcement Trust and Integrity Act. That bill is designed to provide incentives for local police organizations to voluntarily adopt performance-based standards to ensure that incidents of deadly force or misconduct will be [[Page H7384]] minimized through appropriate management and training protocols and properly investigated, should they occur. The bill authorizes the Department of Justice to work cooperatively with independent accreditation, law enforcement and community-based organizations to further develop and refine accreditation standards, and further authorizes the Attorney General to make grants to law enforcement agencies for the purpose of obtaining accreditation from certified law enforcement accreditation organizations. Currently, there are no federally recognized minimum standards for operating a law enforcement agency. The ad hoc nature of police management has accordingly left many officers and agencies in the dark about how to cope with changes in their communities. That is the real reason police officers and department feel so adrift in the current post-Ferguson environment--not the Black Lives Matter Movement. There is a vacuum of leadership in policing that can only be filled by leadership at the federal level. Beyond the human toll created by law enforcement accountability issues, there remains the fiscal impact created by the high cost of litigation settlements for police abuse claims. While most cities fail to systematically track the cost of litigation, the cost reports for major cities have proven staggering. In New York City alone, during Mayor Michael Bloomberg's three term tenure, NYPD payouts were in excess of $1 billion dollars for policing claims. For small departments, the cost of a single high profile incident could prove crippling in its impact on public safety. While the Department of Justice has a range of criminal and civil authority to address policing issues, the Civil Rights Division will never have the resources necessary to investigate more than a small fraction of those departments engaged in unconstitutional conduct, even with the enhanced funding and task force authority granted by this legislation. Through the support of a robust accreditation regime, like that existing in healthcare, Congress can ensure that all communities have the best trained and managed police departments. Only by establishing acceptable police operations standards can we begin to preemptively address issues like use of force and heal the rifts within our communities. Media reports from Baltimore and other cities depicting confrontations between protestors and their police departments illustrate the current divide between law enforcement and the communities they police. In the past years, cities from New York to Cincinnati and Miami to Los Angeles have experienced unrest following controversial use of force incidents by their police. Absent a climate of trust and accountability, community needs are not served and the jobs of the police officers become more difficult and dangerous. The energies of Congress should be focused on the adoption of legislative priorities that address the substance of law enforcement management and strengthen the current battery of tools available to sanction misconduct. As a Congress we have been enthusiastic about supporting programs designed to get officers on the street. We must be just as willing to support programs designed to train and manage them after they get there. The current national climate requires decisive action to implement solutions. Out of respect for all who have lost their lives over the last nine months--both law enforcement and civilian--I hope you will join me in supporting legislation that initiates the reforms necessary to restore public trust and accountability to law enforcement. Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my colleagues in speaking on the critically important issue of criminal- justice reform. Just last week, an African-American girl at Spring Valley High School in Columbia, South Carolina was violently arrested by the school's resource officer. This is a disturbing example of a law enforcement officer using excessive force when interacting with a person of color and a perfect illustration of an alarming trend in our schools. We need to have a substantive dialogue around how to empower administrators, teachers, and staff to deal with school disciplinary issues so that students aren't being criminalized for behavioral issues. According to the Department of Education, black females enrolled in New York City and Boston schools are disciplined 10.5 times more on average than their white counterparts. African Americans seem to face undue scrutiny by police officers throughout our communities. Black Americans are more than twice as likely to be unarmed when killed during encounters with police when compared to Caucasians. States and Congress must set higher standards for the use of deadly force and must hold police officers accountable if they violate these standards. This is the first of many steps to begin the process of mending the delicate relationship between law enforcement and people of color. This disparity is increasingly evident when looking at the composition of the U.S. prison population. The Coalition for Public Safety argues that more than 60 percent of our prison population is composed of racial and ethnic minorities. That is why I have supported H.R. 3713, a comprehensive sentencing reform effort with bipartisan support that aims to overhaul the current system which disproportionately affects minorities. I strongly believe that addressing the disparate treatment of people of color at the hands of police is a fundamental step toward creating an equitable society. As one of the first black women to be publically elected from Dallas, I spent my entire career championing equity for communities of color and fighting on behalf of African Americans for social justice. It is clear that there are fundamental problems in police and justice systems across the nation that needs to be addressed. As a former Chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, these issues are of the utmost importance to me and I am personally committed to finding long term solutions. We must act now to remedy the culture and system of violence against people of color. Our nation has endured this disparity for far too long and I encourage my colleagues to not only speak out on this issue, but also take swift and immediate action.

through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] congressional black caucus the speaker pro tempore. under the speaker's announced policy of january 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from illinois (ms. kelly) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader. general leave ms. kelly of illinois. mr. speaker, i ask unanimous consent that all members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks. mr. speaker, i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker, it is my honor and privilege to lead tonight's congressional black caucus special order hour, where we will have the opportunity to speak directly to the american people. but before we get to business, i do want to take a second, even though it feels like an eternity, to congratulate my dear friend and colleague, our cbc chairman for the 112th congress, the honorable emanuel cleaver of kansas city, for his hometown kansas city royals victory in last night's world series game. i am an illinoisan by way of new york. so i had a little stake in this one. but, again, my congratulations to the city of kansas city and to congressman cleaver. mr. speaker, i truly do believe that it is an honor and a privilege to host the congressional black caucus special order hour. so i speak to you this evening very much concerned and severely disappointed that we are even having tonight's topic under such circumstances. tonight we are here to address saving our communities, where our focus for this hour will be on key legislative priorities that this congress, this year's congressional black caucus, and our nation must confront in order to help make this union more perfect for our next generation. mr. speaker, this year there have been a lot of tragic episodes that may make one shake their head and ask what is going on. we have covered a number of these topics in the course of this year, whether it be the issue of criminal justice reform, gun violence, economic investment as a antidote to violence, community policing, or the value of black lives in america. mr. speaker, the issues that i will cover this evening aren't black caucus issues. i know that most in this congress and most across this great country would acknowledge that they are american issues. falling short as a nation on these fronts only divides us and only serves as a barrier to our boundless possibilities as an american people. over the past few weeks, we heard a lot about the need to clean out the barn before the baton was passed from speaker to speaker. i think we made some progress in clearing out the barn last week as we passed a bipartisan budget agreement, which president obama signed into law earlier today. but, mr. speaker, as the baton has been passed from speaker boehner to speaker ryan, we must keep in mind that there is still much that needs to be cleaned out of the barn when it comes to criminal justice reform, creating opportunity in vulnerable communities, addressing inequities in the justice system, valuing all lives, regardless of race, religion or sexual orientation, making sure that good cops can do their job in keeping communities safe, and making sure that bad cops don't get to be the nation's norm. we must have a culture where bad cops don't have a safe haven, where they can't get away with violations of the public trust in communities they were sworn to protect, and where they aren't in a position to spoil the whole bunch of good cops we have protecting american communities. mr. speaker, tonight we will have a long and overdue conversation about saving our communities. at this time, i yield to the chair of the congressional black caucus, my colleague from north carolina, representative g.k. butterfield. mr. butterfield. let me first thank you, congresswoman robin kelly, for yielding time to me tonight. thank you for your willingness to stay on the floor tonight, even though this suspension bill was placed in front of us tonight. we certainly understand that has that happen from time to time. but thank you so very much for staying on the floor to manage the time this evening. i also want to thank you, ms. kelly, for your extraordinary leadership. thank you for what you do for the congressional black caucus. thank you for what you do for your constituents in illinois. most importantly, thank you for what you do for our country. it is certainly appreciated. i will certainly join you, ms. kelly, in congratulating the kansas city royals on their well-deserved victory. i did not watch the entire world series, but i watched enough of it to know that this team was much deserving of this victory. and so congratulations not only to mr. cleaver, who is so proud of kansas city and talks about his hometown all of the time, but congratulations to all of those fans of that great team. tonight we are talking about the urgent need to save our communities. what an appropriate topic, ms. kelly, because communities all across the country are in crisis. i travel quite a bit across the country and visit many different communities not only in my state, but in many other states. i can tell you firsthand that communities all across our country are facing crises. they are facing crises in so many different respects. they are facing the whole issue of pervasive poverty. poverty in america is real. we have more than 400 counties in the united states of america that have poverty rates that exceed 20 percent, and all of these have had poverty rates for more than 30 years greater than 20 percent. so poverty is a critical issue in our country, and communities are feeling the effect of it in a significant way. joblessness. joblessness. i continue to say that the unemployment rate is [[page h7380]] unacceptably high. even though we have made a great improvement in the unemployment rate since the recession, it is still too high. for african american workers, it is hovering somewhere around 10 percent. that is unacceptable. we all talk from time to time and we see it all over the news today about police misconduct. police misconduct is continuing to be a pervasive problem in so many communities. i'm sure tonight mr. bobby scott from virginia, who is very passionate about the whole issue of criminal justice reform, is going to talk about mass incarceration in the united states of america. certainly that is a real problem, and there are many members in this body who are working every day to try to craft together legislation to try to address the whole question of mass incarceration. also, we have crumbling schools and infrastructure and highways and tunnels and ports. our whole infrastructure in this country needs to be addressed. hopefully, we will be able to pass a transportation bill before the end of the year. hopefully, my friends on the other side of the aisle will not try to load up the transportation bill with any ex-im bank riders that will be a poison pill that would slow down or even defeat the transportation bill. {time} 2000 so the point is, ms. kelly, that we do have an urgent need to save our communities. we need all hands on deck as we take on this challenge. we consistently see, ms. kelly, an over-criminalization of african americans, specifically our youth. we see, for example, minor infractions that occur in the context of a classroom--yes, we have seen that on television over the last few days--a minor infraction in a classroom that escalates into an arrestable offense. students, particularly those who are african american and hispanic, are too frequently funneled into the justice system as a result of overly punitive school discipline policies and poorly defined roles for law enforcement in educational settings. unfortunately, the school-to-prison pipeline is still a reality. when i first came to congress 11 years ago, we were talking about the school-to-prison pipeline, and we continue to talk about it today. it is a reality. so we must work together to remedy this problem. we, as members of the congressional black caucus, do not at all endorse what some people over the last few days have started to call the ``ferguson effect.'' let me just elaborate on that for a moment. we have heard some high-ranking officials in our country refer to the ``ferguson effect.'' they are suggesting in some way that an uptick in crime can be attributable to police inaction because of their fears of the ``ferguson effect.'' that is so erroneous. that is so disingenuous. i wish we would concentrate on the problem and not try to get sidetracked on the so- called ``ferguson effect.'' the deaths of so many unarmed black men like michael brown, eric garner, and freddie gray are all a result of a number of issues, including the overcriminalization of minorities and a lack of effective community policing practices. let us seize this opportunity that we have before us to gain significant ground on several legislative areas which are not only cbc priorities, but are also in the strategic interests of our nation. criminal justice reform is one such area. mr. speaker and ms. kelly, any criminal justice reform, any legislation that we consider, must guarantee a substantial reduction in the prison population for federal prisoners. we are, as a country, 5 percent of the world's population; yet, we incarcerate 25 percent of those who are incarcerated in the world. there is something is wrong with that, mr. speaker. we must make sure that our laws and our criminal laws in this country are fair and that they are not disproportionate and overburdensome in some areas. we have members of this body on both sides of the aisle who acknowledge the inadequacies in our criminal justice system and see reform as a key priority. the political will--the political will--for criminal justice reform is here today. the president was in newark, new jersey, today talking about criminal justice reform. some of my republican colleagues are talking about it, and my democratic colleagues are talking about it. the leadership on both sides of the aisle have had meaningful conversations on this issue. we believe that a bipartisan legislative accomplishment can be achieved in this session. i know that there are several bills that are pending, and i hope mr. scott will talk extensively about it when he makes his remarks in just a moment. but criminal justice reform can take place in the 114th congress, and i believe we can reach a bipartisan compromise that can get this bill to the president's desk by the end of this term. thank you, ms. kelly, for yielding time. ms. kelly of illinois. thank you, my colleague from north carolina, for your outstanding remarks on this topic of saving our community. i really, really appreciate it, and so do the american people. at this time, i would like to introduce my other colleague, representative bobby scott from the great state of virginia. mr. scott of virginia. i thank the gentlewoman for organizing this special order so that we can talk about many aspects of the criminal justice system. you have asked us to talk about the militarization of communities, also what we can do to improve policing and the problem of mass incarceration. on the term of militarizing the communities, there was an amendment offered a few months ago that would have prevented the department of defense from giving local police departments certain military equipment. i think it is important to read what was actually in the legislation because some thought that handguns and ammunition was what we were talking about. actually, the amendment goes into great length specifically about what would be prohibited if that amendment passed to help reduce the militarization of our communities. the department of defense has a program where they will give surplus equipment to local communities, and the limitation was that none of these transfers could include aircraft, including drones; armored vehicles; grenade launchers; silencers; toxicological agents, including chemical agents and biological agents; launch vehicles; guided missiles; ballistic missiles; rockets; torpedoes; bombs; mines; or nuclear weapons. those are the only things that would be barred if this amendment had passed, not handguns and ammunition or other things that local police departments could actually use. but what local police department needs nuclear weapons or torpedoes? we are not talking about the large, sophisticated police forces. this is the kind of stuff that was being given to police departments that you might think of when you think of andy griffith and barney fife. what do they need with a tank? in one of the local incidents when they had a tank come out, it was pointed out that the people trying to drive the tank hadn't been trained on the tank. can you just imagine hearing from inside, ``where are the brakes? where are the brakes?'' if you need a military response, the appropriate thing to do would be to call in the national guard. then you have the military performing the military functions. i think there is a lot that we can do to restrict this kind of equipment going to our local police departments. a lot has been said about policing. we can discuss the problem of policing. we all know that the vast, overwhelming majority of police officers risk their lives on our behalf and do an excellent job. but whenever you get to describe what the problem is, we know what the solution is going to be, and that is to make sure that there is a consensus growing that we need body cameras so we can know exactly what happened and police training so that police can be properly trained on things like how to avoid profiling, how to avoid discrimination, and treating one group different from the other. implicit bias is what it is called. there is a lot you [[page h7381]] can do in training, and we need to make sure we have funding for that training. but in terms of mass incarceration, that is where we really need a lot of work. as the chairman mentioned, we have 5 percent of the world's population and 25 percent of the world's prisoners. in most countries, for every 100,000 population, they lock up 50 to 200 people per 100,000. the united states locks up over 700 per 100,000. we are well into the first place. there is nobody close. that number is particularly egregious because there have been recent studies that have suggested that anything over 500 per 100,000 is actually counterproductive. you have got so many people in jail. you have so many families being raised with their parents in prison. young people are being raised without their parents. you have so many people with felony records having trouble finding jobs. you are wasting so much money that anything over about 500 per 100,000 is counterproductive. we are at 700 and some per 100,000. the african american incarceration rate is in the thousands. that is just wasted money. that is what texas found when they were looking a few years ago at an appropriations request of $2 billion needed to keep up with all the slogans and sound bites that they had codified in terms of keeping up with the mass incarceration in texas, $2 billion in construction. and somebody said, ``well, if you actually make a better choice, if you invested some of that money in prevention, early intervention, and rehabilitation, you might not have to spend all $2 billion.'' that is what they did. they intelligently invested in evidence-based programs, programs studied and known to reduce crime, not just sound like they reduce crime, but actually known to reduce crime, evidence- based policies of prevention, early intervention, and rehabilitation, and they found that they didn't need to build any new prisons. in fact, they were able to close some of the prisons that they had. over 30 states have figured out that they can reduce crime and save money by reducing mass incarceration. on the other hand, mr. speaker, there are people that think slogans and sound bites are good, and that is how we got in the mess we are in now. the chairman mentioned the school-to-prison pipeline. i like to refer to it as the children's defense fund does, as the cradle-to-prison pipeline, because that suggests that there are things all the way along the line that we are not doing that help construct this pipeline that ends up with--at present estimates, one out of three african american boys born today will end up in prison. we can do better than that if we make the appropriate investments all the way through from early childhood education to after-school programs, a continuum of services, to make sure that they create the cradle-to-college-and-career pipeline and not the cradle-to-prison pipeline. that includes investments that have been studied, evidence based, and we know they work. there is a lot you can do in terms of criminal justice reform, but if you do it right, it has to be comprehensive. that means you start with prevention and early intervention, make sure you are making those investments so fewer young people are getting in trouble. then you have to do police training. we know that good police training can improve policing and, also, reduce crime. body cameras can eliminate a lot of problems. last year we passed the death in custody reporting act, which requires reporting from local police of anybody that dies in their custody in prison, in jail, or in the process of arrest, so we know what is going on around the country. as you have the debate, you can debate from a point of view of facts, not just in allegations when people don't know exactly what the facts are. we can make sure that the police training is there. you can have diversion to make sure that people who are arrested might not have to spend--the only people you need pretrial in jail are those that need to be in jail. you don't want to have unnecessary people serving time and losing their jobs in the process. you need a continuum of services, drug courts which can address the underlying problem rather than just convict them, lock them up, they come back, same thing, come back, back and forth. if you deal with the underlying problem in a drug court, you can have a situation where they are diverted from prison and, also, much less likely to commit a crime in the future. one of the major factors in over-incarceration are the mandatory minimums. we need to have significant reductions in mandatory minimum sentencing to make sure they only apply to a small portion of real, legitimate kingpins, not to girlfriends and people on the periphery that may have gotten caught up in a conspiracy. once you get into prison, make sure that it is for rehabilitation, not for just warehousing, so you are much less likely to commit a crime when you come out. you have to fund the second chance programs. all of this is part of the safe justice act, which has the added benefit that, because of the significant reductions in mandatory minimums, there will be savings. the department of justice is able to redirect the savings into the prevention, early intervention programs, the drug courts, the body cameras and everything else. so everything in the program is paid for by reducing incarceration. this legislation has the support of a lot of different organizations, liberal and conservative, because everybody knows that, if it is enacted, we will reduce crime and save money. so we know what to do. it is just a matter of making sure we have the political will to do the right thing, to deal with mass incarceration by making the right choice, not the slogans and sound bites, but the evidence-based approach that will actually reduce crime and save money. we can do it. there is legislation pending. there are a lot of different bills, but we need to make sure that the comprehensive approach is reflected in whatever comes to the floor. so i want to thank the gentlewoman from illinois for bringing us together so we can discuss the militarization of our communities, the solutions for policing, which would include training and body cameras and how we can effectively reduce mass incarceration. we know what to do, and the solutions save more money than they cost. so thank you very much for the opportunity to present that. ms. kelly of illinois. thank you so much for your important remarks. i know this topic is one that you have been researching and studying, trying to come up with solutions for a long time. one thing that is a little disconcerting is you say that the safe justice act is widely supported, but it still doesn't move. mr. scott of virginia. well, it doesn't matter which bill moves. the question is whatever moves ought to have the elements of prevention and early intervention, ought to have diversion, and if you only deal with sentencing in the federal system, you are not dealing with mass incarceration in the united states. the federal system only has 10 percent of the prisoners. so if you just eliminated the federal system, you are only talking about 10 percent reduction in incarceration. you have to do something about mass incarceration at the state level. {time} 2015 so when you just talk about sentencing reform, if you reduce a mandatory minimum for 25 to 15 years, the first 15 years, that has no effect, because they will serve the first 15 years, then gradually you will have an effect. if you want an effect, you need to have prevention programs so fewer people are coming into prison, diversion programs so those who are arrested can be diverted from prison, dealt with effectively in drug court so they are much less likely to commit a crime again so that you can reduce crime and save money. you have to make sure you have meaningful mandatory minimum reforms because that is one of the major drivers of the overincarceration. when people are in prison, you have to make sure you have the funding for the programs to make sure they don't come back. and once in the community, the [[page h7382]] second chance programs that have been very effective need to be funded. we know what to do; it is just a matter of getting it done. it doesn't matter whose bill passes; it is just whatever passes ought to have those elements. ms. kelly of illinois. is there any particular state that you think does a better job that we can hold up as a role model? mr. scott of virginia. there are 30 states that have reduced crime and saved money. texas was one of the first because they were looking at a $2 billion appropriation request to keep up with the slogans and sound bites that they had enacted in mass incarceration. at the rate they were going, they needed $2 billion in prison construction. they decided instead to invest it in prevention programs so fewer kids were getting in trouble; early intervention programs so that once people got in a little trouble, they wouldn't get in worse trouble; and rehabilitation in prisons so that as people got out, they were less likely to come back. they found that they not only didn't have to spend any of the $2 billion building prisons, they were able to close some of the prisons they had. texas is a red state, and they called their initiative ``right on crime.'' using the word ``right'' in both words is correct, and from the political right. so you had conservatives investing their money appropriately, reducing crime, and saving money. ms. kelly of illinois. that is fantastic. i know in my district, we have held some roundtables, and some of my employers, manufacturers, they shared that they did hire people who were in prison and were some of their best employees because they are so grateful that someone gave them a chance. we really need to promote that and highlight those things. mr. scott of virginia. the second chance idea is that people who get out of prison ought to be supported. the little money you spend on support pales in consideration to what usually happens. they get out, they can't find a job, they can't do anything, and they are right back into prison at $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 a year. if you spend a little bit of money supporting them, they might not come back. one of the elements the president talked about today is the ``ban the box.'' when you fill out an application, there is a little box, ``have you ever been convicted of a felony?'' if you check the box, that is the end of the interview. what the ban the box is suggesting is don't talk about the criminal record at first. go through the process so you can present your credentials. then, at the end of the process, they can discuss criminal record, but not at the beginning. you will find that many people, the conviction is so far past. studies have shown that after a few years, if you have got a clean record, the chance of you committing a crime isn't any higher than the general population. so if it is a 15-year-old nonviolent offense, well, maybe it is not relevant; and maybe your credentials are so much better than everybody else's that you are the right person for the job, but you never would have had the opportunity to present your credentials if you had to check the box. so all around the country, cities, states, and businesses are eliminating that box to check, talking to people and seeing if they are actually qualified for the job, and those that are qualified can get the job. obviously, some violations, if you have got an embezzlement charge and you are trying to get a job in a bank, or child molestation at a daycare center, you know, but a lot of them, if it is a 20-year- old marijuana possession charge or something like that, compared to your credentials, compared to everybody else head and shoulders, well, people can overlook a 20-year-old conviction. you never would have gotten to that point if you had to check the box. that is why the ban the box campaign is so important. ms. kelly of illinois. that is a good idea we have now in illinois. thank you, representative. i really appreciate you taking the time and sharing your vast knowledge about this topic. mr. speaker, many of the families that we represent believe that the only and right way to save our communities and secure our better future is to enact laws that actually understand the needs of american families, regardless of circumstance, and invest in their future. this congress must have a frank conversation about what those investments are and vote for policies that will truly save our communities. and this conversation has to be a bipartisan conversation, not just a congressional black caucus or democratic conversation. mr. speaker, i am reminded that today our colleague, the honorable donald payne, jr., of new jersey could not be here because he was asked to be with the president. president obama visited congressman payne's district to discuss criminal justice reform, as you heard a little bit about already. as many of you know, earlier today, president obama spoke of his intent to make significant reforms in the criminal justice space; and in keeping with the message of ``saving our communities,'' the reforms the president is championing are necessary. i thank the president for his efforts. i want to take just a moment to say that i appreciate the fact that over on the other side of the hill, a bipartisan coalition of senators, led by my congressional black caucus colleague, senator cory booker, as well as my home state senator, the honorable dick durbin, and men willing to cross the aisle, like senator mike lee of utah, were able to come together to introduce comprehensive legislation aimed at recalibrating prison sentences for certain drug offenders, targeting violent criminals, and granting judges greater discretion at sentencing for low-level drug crimes. their sentencing reform legislation helps to curve recidivism by helping prisoners successfully reenter society. these are just small components of an overall strategy to help save communities, but they are critical ones nonetheless. here are the facts. more than half a million people leave u.s. prisons each year with jobs, housing, and mental health services scarce. many are soon to be back behind bars. like the president said, many of us in the congressional black caucus are calling on community stakeholders to break the cycle of incarceration by helping former inmates successfully reenter society. so tonight's special order hour is an opportunity that comes on the heels of the president's new jersey visit, a visit where he toured a drug treatment center called the integrity house, and recognized its work in helping former inmates secure housing, jobs, and skills needed to transition to life outside of prison. i have a place like that in illinois called the safer foundation that does much of the same work. as the president noted, everyone has a role to play in criminal justice reform and reintegrating those who have served time in prison back into society. from businesses that are hiring ex-offenders to philanthropies that are supporting education and training programs, we have to get to work getting ex-offenders back on their feet so they can help build up their communities. mr. speaker, this congress has to have the astuteness and manpower in its ranks to recognize that we must do more, that it will take a village, and it takes real leadership to improve the plight of america's communities. this means we need jobs legislation that offers opportunity. this means we need safe streets free of violence. this means we need community policing that brings us peace of mind and comfort. i feel compelled in this conversation about communities to say that, as a representative of the chicagoland area and as a co-chair of the house gun violence prevention task force, congress must get over its fear of talking about violence in america. we have to do more than hold moments of silence when tragedies occur. we have to stop being silent and start acting. we don't have to be enemies on this subject. the issues of gun violence and police violence in our communities are real. it is how we respond to the problems that exist in these areas that will show our strength as a country. right now, the tragic occurrences that exist with respect to these issues only serve as barriers to our growth as a nation. [[page h7383]] when i talk about gun violence, i always start out by reminding folks of a few things. first, it is important to realize that gun violence isn't just an urban problem; it is an american problem. in the last 50 years, more than 1 million people have been killed by guns in america. since 1968, more americans have died from gunfire than died in all the wars of this country's history. a young black man is nearly 5 times more likely to be killed by a gun than a young white man, and 13 times more than an asian american man. if a black person is killed by a gun, it is judged a homicide 82 percent of the time. and keep in mind, from metal detectors in buildings to shooting safety drills at schools and movie theaters, gun violence has affected all of our communities, not only in terms of how we live, but whether we live at all. and the irony is that, even with all this death and tragedy, this congress can't even put a background check bill on the house floor, even with an nra membership that is in 80 percent agreement that we need expanded background checks. last congress, even with about 190 cosponsors, the bill never came to the floor. when i talk about saving our communities and discussing the actions of the police, i often remind people of this: the police are not our enemy. i won't ever say that because that simply is not the case. to make our communities safer, we need the support of families, leaders, and our local law enforcement. i come from a family of law enforcement officers and know that our police ranks are filled with brave, well-intentioned, civic-minded heroes. sadly, too many in the black community don't have the same family experience that i have had with law enforcement and fear the police. i have a 31-year-old son, and even though the same police are in his family, he hasn't had the same experiences. and, unfortunately, there are still too many police officers who harbor a level of fear when it comes to dealing with the black community. mr. speaker, we have discussed the aftermath of a few high-profile police events. i will repeat what i often say: we must hold our law enforcement officials to the highest professional standards and provide them with the training they need to effectively police diverse communities. this training must address the biases and stereotypes that influence decisions in the field and that create obstacles to mutual understanding. in working to achieve that understanding, we can strive toward a justice system that treats all americans fairly and values all american lives equally. before i end, i just want to give my colleague the opportunity to share a few more words. mr. scott of virginia. mr. speaker, i would like to thank the gentlewoman from illinois for all of her strong work in criminal justice. she has been fighting since she first got here. that is certainly appreciated and has made quite a difference. as you have indicated, this is a moment when adversarial groups and members of congress, liberal and conservative, have come to a consensus that we need to reform the criminal justice system. the safe justice act that i mentioned is led by jim sensenbrenner from wisconsin, a republican, and has republican and democratic support. there are bills in the house and the senate with bipartisan support. if we are going to have this moment where everyone is in agreement, we need to make sure that we do everything we possibly can. i thank you for organizing this special order so that we can make criminal justice reform a reality. ms. kelly of illinois. thank you. i thank my colleagues for lending their voices for this important conversation about saving our communities, and i will be submitting some other work from other colleagues not here tonight. i yield back the balance of my time. ms. fudge. mr. speaker, i rise today with my colleagues from the congressional black caucus because last week our nation was reminded, yet again, black lives have no value. but this time, the reminder was different. it did not come from law enforcement in response to a shooting, traffic stop, or 911 call. nor did it come from inside a jail cell or a court room. this time, the reminder came from the use of excessive force in a place where most of us would expect it never to happen: our schools. schools should be safe havens for our nation's children. unfortunately, actions of spring valley school resource officer, ben fields, caught on video have proven that they are not. instead of preparing young minds across the country to tackle our nation's most complex issues, some of our schools are fostering fear and mistrust. and, this is what my young constituents have told me. on october 16, i held a listening session with more than 400 high school students from northeast ohio. i was surprised to hear that nearly all of them felt there was no one they could talk to--in their schools or communities--if they felt unsafe. today, i am not so shocked. with incidents like the one captured in the spring valley video, who could blame them? what messages are acts like these sending our youth? are they to think this behavior is acceptable and that they matter less, if at all? the over criminalization of african-american youth and young adults is already a growing issue in our communities. the number of african- american men in jail continues to rise. african-american and latino boys and men tend to receive harsher sentences than their peers of other races. further, the school-to-prison pipeline is as strong as ever, with our african-american students suspended at three times the rate of their white peers. in this case, criminal charges were even filed against the young spring valley female student after she was subjected to egregious force by a ``resource officer.'' as a nation, we must stop this vicious cycle. it is time to change the narrative and save our communities for generations to come. i call on my colleagues in congress to work together to pass policies that tell our children their lives have value. we must pass criminal justice reform and support policies that create a safe, nurturing environment in our schools. the future of our communities depends on it. mr. conyers. mr. speaker, as many of you know, the promotion of best practices and oversight of state and local law enforcement have been legislative priorities during my tenure as a judiciary committee member. my pattern and practice statute, passed as part of the 1994 crime bill, has served at the dominant tool used by the department of justice to address the myriad of policing controversies dating back the lapd, new orleans and most recently seattle, cleveland and ferguson, missouri police departments. over the past two decades, tensions between police and communities of color have grown as allegations of bias-based policing by law enforcement agents, sometimes supported by data collection efforts and video evidence, have increased in number and frequency. recent events in the wake of ferguson, missouri demonstrate that racial profiling and bias-based policing remain divisive issues in communities across the nation that strikes at the very foundation of our democracy. the deaths of walter l. scott--arising from a traffic stop--michael brown, eric garner, and antonio zambrano-montes--all at the hands of police officers--highlight the links between the issues of race and reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct. ultimately, these men are tragic examples of the risk of being victimized by a perception of criminality simply because of their race, ethnicity, religion or national origin. despite the fact that the majority of law enforcement officers perform their duties professionally and without bias, the relationship between the police and some of minority communities has deteriorated to such a degree that federal action is required to begin addressing the issue. with recent washington post reports of almost 400 police- involved shooting fatalities in the first five months of 2015, all should agree that the time for bipartisan action is long overdue. in 2001, i welcomed president bush's invitation to draft legislation that would end the practice of unlawful police profiling, with bipartisan congressional support. in april, i reintroduced the end racial profiling act in the hope that congress and the obama administration can come together to pass legislation that sends the signal that the federal government is committed to ensuring that its law enforcement agencies conduct their activities free from bias. in may, the judiciary committee, where i am former chairman and current ranking member, held a hearing on police accountability, where we heard from expert witnesses on police practices and discussed policy options to restoring the relationship between the police and communities of color. in june, i followed up on this effort to address fair policing practices by reintroducing the law enforcement trust and integrity act. that bill is designed to provide incentives for local police organizations to voluntarily adopt performance-based standards to ensure that incidents of deadly force or misconduct will be [[page h7384]] minimized through appropriate management and training protocols and properly investigated, should they occur. the bill authorizes the department of justice to work cooperatively with independent accreditation, law enforcement and community-based organizations to further develop and refine accreditation standards, and further authorizes the attorney general to make grants to law enforcement agencies for the purpose of obtaining accreditation from certified law enforcement accreditation organizations. currently, there are no federally recognized minimum standards for operating a law enforcement agency. the ad hoc nature of police management has accordingly left many officers and agencies in the dark about how to cope with changes in their communities. that is the real reason police officers and department feel so adrift in the current post-ferguson environment--not the black lives matter movement. there is a vacuum of leadership in policing that can only be filled by leadership at the federal level. beyond the human toll created by law enforcement accountability issues, there remains the fiscal impact created by the high cost of litigation settlements for police abuse claims. while most cities fail to systematically track the cost of litigation, the cost reports for major cities have proven staggering. in new york city alone, during mayor michael bloomberg's three term tenure, nypd payouts were in excess of $1 billion dollars for policing claims. for small departments, the cost of a single high profile incident could prove crippling in its impact on public safety. while the department of justice has a range of criminal and civil authority to address policing issues, the civil rights division will never have the resources necessary to investigate more than a small fraction of those departments engaged in unconstitutional conduct, even with the enhanced funding and task force authority granted by this legislation. through the support of a robust accreditation regime, like that existing in healthcare, congress can ensure that all communities have the best trained and managed police departments. only by establishing acceptable police operations standards can we begin to preemptively address issues like use of force and heal the rifts within our communities. media reports from baltimore and other cities depicting confrontations between protestors and their police departments illustrate the current divide between law enforcement and the communities they police. in the past years, cities from new york to cincinnati and miami to los angeles have experienced unrest following controversial use of force incidents by their police. absent a climate of trust and accountability, community needs are not served and the jobs of the police officers become more difficult and dangerous. the energies of congress should be focused on the adoption of legislative priorities that address the substance of law enforcement management and strengthen the current battery of tools available to sanction misconduct. as a congress we have been enthusiastic about supporting programs designed to get officers on the street. we must be just as willing to support programs designed to train and manage them after they get there. the current national climate requires decisive action to implement solutions. out of respect for all who have lost their lives over the last nine months--both law enforcement and civilian--i hope you will join me in supporting legislation that initiates the reforms necessary to restore public trust and accountability to law enforcement. ms. eddie bernice johnson of texas. mr. speaker, i rise to join my colleagues in speaking on the critically important issue of criminal- justice reform. just last week, an african-american girl at spring valley high school in columbia, south carolina was violently arrested by the school's resource officer. this is a disturbing example of a law enforcement officer using excessive force when interacting with a person of color and a perfect illustration of an alarming trend in our schools. we need to have a substantive dialogue around how to empower administrators, teachers, and staff to deal with school disciplinary issues so that students aren't being criminalized for behavioral issues. according to the department of education, black females enrolled in new york city and boston schools are disciplined 10.5 times more on average than their white counterparts. african americans seem to face undue scrutiny by police officers throughout our communities. black americans are more than twice as likely to be unarmed when killed during encounters with police when compared to caucasians. states and congress must set higher standards for the use of deadly force and must hold police officers accountable if they violate these standards. this is the first of many steps to begin the process of mending the delicate relationship between law enforcement and people of color. this disparity is increasingly evident when looking at the composition of the u.s. prison population. the coalition for public safety argues that more than 60 percent of our prison population is composed of racial and ethnic minorities. that is why i have supported h.r. 3713, a comprehensive sentencing reform effort with bipartisan support that aims to overhaul the current system which disproportionately affects minorities. i strongly believe that addressing the disparate treatment of people of color at the hands of police is a fundamental step toward creating an equitable society. as one of the first black women to be publically elected from dallas, i spent my entire career championing equity for communities of color and fighting on behalf of african americans for social justice. it is clear that there are fundamental problems in police and justice systems across the nation that needs to be addressed. as a former chairwoman of the congressional black caucus, these issues are of the utmost importance to me and i am personally committed to finding long term solutions. we must act now to remedy the culture and system of violence against people of color. our nation has endured this disparity for far too long and i encourage my colleagues to not only speak

KYRSTEN SINEMA of arizona in the house of representatives Tuesday, October 27, 2015 Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, on October 27, 2015 the House of Representatives considered H.R. 1090, the Retail Investor Protection Act. This legislation prohibits the Department of Labor (the Department) from issuing updated retirement investment advice rules until the Securities and Exchange Commission completes its rule governing standards of conduct for brokers and dealers. In light of the ongoing rulemaking at the Department and the fact that this legislation does not address any of my concerns regarding the Department's proposed rule, I oppose this bill. While I oppose this bill, I remain concerned by the multiple unanswered questions related to the proposed rule and the potential impact the rule will have on the affordability and accessibility of financial information for investors. For example, I am concerned that there may be practical problems for providers to implement the Best Interest Contract Exemption as proposed. The Department should implement the exemption using a less prescriptive and more principles-based approach. I am also concerned by the potential impact the proposed rule would have on consumers' access to important retirement education information. The Department should maintain flexibility for advisors to provide investment education, and take steps to clarify that the proposed rule does not disadvantage lifetime income options. Given the complexity of the proposed rule and the many outstanding questions regarding a final rule, the Department should consider options for convening a small working group of industry professionals and consumer advocates to aid with implementation, and provide a safe harbor for ``good faith implementation.'' In order to have a successfully implemented rule, it is vital that the proposal does not limit consumer choice and access to advice, disproportionately impact lower- or middle-income communities, or raise the costs of saving for retirement. I recently joined a number of my colleagues in sending a letter to the Department expressing concerns with specific provisions of the proposed rule that may cause market disruptions and limit the ability of segments of the market to reasonably access advice.

KYRSTEN SINEMA of arizona in the house of representatives Tuesday, October 27, 2015 Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, on October 27, 2015 the House of Representatives considered H.R. 1090, the Retail Investor Protection Act. This legislation prohibits the Department of Labor (the Department) from issuing updated retirement investment advice rules until the Securities and Exchange Commission completes its rule governing standards of conduct for brokers and dealers. In light of the ongoing rulemaking at the Department and the fact that this legislation does not address any of my concerns regarding the Department's proposed rule, I oppose this bill. While I oppose this bill, I remain concerned by the multiple unanswered questions related to the proposed rule and the potential impact the rule will have on the affordability and accessibility of financial information for investors. For example, I am concerned that there may be practical problems for providers to implement the Best Interest Contract Exemption as proposed. The Department should implement the exemption using a less prescriptive and more principles-based approach. I am also concerned by the potential impact the proposed rule would have on consumers' access to important retirement education information. The Department should maintain flexibility for advisors to provide investment education, and take steps to clarify that the proposed rule does not disadvantage lifetime income options. Given the complexity of the proposed rule and the many outstanding questions regarding a final rule, the Department should consider options for convening a small working group of industry professionals and consumer advocates to aid with implementation, and provide a safe harbor for ``good faith implementation.'' In order to have a successfully implemented rule, it is vital that the proposal does not limit consumer choice and access to advice, disproportionately impact lower- or middle-income communities, or raise the costs of saving for retirement. I recently joined a number of my colleagues in sending a letter to the Department expressing concerns with specific provisions of the proposed rule that may cause market disruptions and limit the ability of segments of the market to reasonably access advice. Unfortunately, H.R. 1090 is neither constructive nor relevant at this time, which is why I will vote against this bill.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 20th anniversary of the Eureka Main Library in Humboldt, which is a community centerpiece for learning. In 1988, then California 2nd District State Senator Barry Keene sponsored the Construction and Renovation Bond Act, which approved $75 million for library construction in the state. Between 1988 and 1991, the Library Construction Committee and the Friends of the Redwood Libraries raised more than $1.5 million locally to match state funds. The Humboldt County Board of Supervisors pledged funds in 1989 toward funding of a new library. In 1991, Humboldt County's project was one of only 16 grant applications chosen by the state for approval. From the bond act, the county received 65 percent of the funds needed to construct the Eureka Main Library. In September 2013, groundbreaking ceremonies were held for the Eureka Main Library at 1313 Third Street in Eureka. The Library Construction Advisory Committee has demonstrated to all Californians its dedication, perseverance and commitment to the greater good of the community.

Mr. Speaker, I will vote against H.R. 1090, which would gravely slow development of new rules designed to better protect individual investors. While I have been sympathetic to some industry concerns--in particular expressing an interest in further refinements with regard to exemptions relating to Best Interest Contracts, education, and lifetime income options--I have also made clear my strong support for rules barring the provision of advice subject to real or potential conflicts of interest. The Department of Labor has demonstrated an attempt to put forth a balanced rule that accommodates concerns from industry with protections for individual investors. The bill I will vote against, however, would bury this effort behind years of tertiary regulatory and congressional action. It is clear that Americans badly need to save more for their retirement. As savings policies have evolved to place the decision- making burden on the individual, our rules must be updated to ensure that information is adequately shared and presented. Under the present system, estimates of value lost to these investors as a result of conflicted advice are unconscionably high. While the proposed federal rule is not perfect, it marks an important step forward and I look forward to working with the administration to continue to improve their effort.

Every single day they are fighting to keep people in their homes, pushing back against unfair workforce practices, and working to ensure the safety for women and children across the state of Michigan. Each year they provide free representation for over ten thousand low income individuals that would not otherwise have been able to afford a lawyer and could have been denied access to the courts. Through their focus and dedication, the Michigan Advocacy Program has given a voice to low income families by providing free civil legal representation. Over the past 50 years, we have had the pleasure of watching the Michigan Advocacy Program grow from the Legal Services of South Central Michigan into a flourishing organization that works to support families across the state of Michigan. Equal access to our system of justice and the judicial system is a key tenet of our democracy. Courts and the legal system should not be reserved only for those who have the most resources.

CHRIS VAN HOLLEN of maryland in the house of representatives Monday, November 2, 2015 Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I proudly rise to salute my constituent, Thomas E. Harr, as he steps down as Executive Director of Family Services, Inc. Under Mr. Harr's visionary leadership, FSI, which is based in Gaithersburg, Maryland, has developed into an agency that cares for vulnerable clients from cradle to grave, becoming, in essence, a caring, secondary family--giving true meaning to the organization's name. FSI provides high-quality service to foster health and well-being in the home, school and community as it serves more than 25,000 residents in Montgomery and Prince George's Counties. Mr. Harr has overseen this organization through a period of extraordinary growth, enabling the organization to be an effective safety net for the most vulnerable members of our community. Mr. Harr's tenure has been distinguished by his tireless efforts to make Family Services treat the ``whole'' person throughout their entire lifespan. His vision encompasses a holistic philosophy of human services. Long an opponent of fragmented silos of care and the lack of coordination between them, he encouraged his mental health clinic to integrate mental health, substance abuse and primary care services, including the treatment and management of co-occurring conditions. He spearheaded the partnership of his organization with a primary care provider and a reproductive health specialty clinic to address the then-unappreciated somatic consequences of having a mental illness. He reached out to another historic provider, GUIDE, which later merged with Family Services and brought with it an impressive array of youth services. The Family Services of today encompasses 31 programs and touches every sector of vulnerable residents in Montgomery County. Its excellence has recently been recognized by its receiving the first CARF accreditation in the County. Under Mr. Harr's leadership, FSI has seen the addition of a new child development center in 2000, an outpatient mental health clinic in 2001, a family multi-service center in 2002, and a hospital neonatal screening program in 2004, to name a few major projects. In addition, Mr. Harr oversaw the doubling of the agency's Head Start program, the opening of an additional child care center in another region of the County, and the creation of one of the County's first integrated care clinics. Mr. Harr has also been deeply involved with the needs of our vulnerable elderly population. Under his leadership, FSI opened a medical day program, an outpatient substance abuse clinic, an adolescent recovery club house, expansion of the adult psychiatric day program, and a school mental health and social service program. And, finally, he facilitated FSI's assuming a major role in the County's implementation of the Affordable Care Act, accepting a contract to run our region's health insurance navigator program. Prior to joining FSI, Mr. Harr served as the Chief of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services in Montgomery County's Department of Health and Human Services and Deputy Director of the Department of Addiction, Victim and Mental Health Services. Mr. Harr also had distinguished service in the United States Air Force. Mr. Speaker, Thom Harr is an extraordinary and exceptional leader whose pioneering spirit, passion and drive led him to fight for those who are unable to fight for themselves. His influence in our region is profound. I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing our deepest gratitude and appreciation to him for his outstanding service to our community. He has truly made a difference in the lives of countless individuals and families, and his impact will be felt, with grateful appreciation, for many years to come. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1569] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO THOMAS HARR ______ HON.

General Tonini's career began as an enlisted member of the 123rd Tactical Reconnaissance Wing of the Kentucky Air National Guard. He received a direct commission as a Second Lieutenant in the Guard in 1970. He earned many awards and decorations for his service in the Air National Guard, including the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, Meritorious Service Medal (with 1 Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster), and an Air Force Commendation Medal. He rose through the ranks to become Chief of Staff of the Kentucky Air National Guard. In 2001, he went on [[Page E1569]] to serve as Director of Your Guardians of Freedom at the Pentagon and later served at the Air Force Personnel Center in Denver, Colorado. Tonini was appointed by Governor Steve Beshear as Adjutant General of the Commonwealth of Kentucky on December 11, 2007. As the Adjutant General, he serves as the Commanding General of both the Kentucky Army and Air National Guard and as the Executive Director of the Department of Military Affairs. He is responsible for Federal and State missions, including responding in times of emergency. He serves on the Governor's cabinet and is the Governor's advisor on all military matters. General Tonini has served the Commonwealth of Kentucky and this nation with honor. He is to be commended on his long and distinguished military career and his life of service and sacrifice. Major General Edward Tonini is an outstanding American, a true patriot, and a hero to us all. Along with a grateful nation, I honor him for his service. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1568-E1569] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE SERVICE OF MAJOR GENERAL EDWARD W.

JEFF MILLER of florida in the house of representatives Monday, November 2, 2015 Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it is with profound sadness that I rise to honor the life and legacy of Northwest Florida's beloved Dave Daughtry. For over thirty years, Dave dedicated his broadcasting career to serving the people of the Gulf Coast community, and Northwest Florida mourns his passing. From what began at a small radio station in Andalusia, Alabama, Dave's successful broadcasting career and love of writing would take him to Huntsville, Alabama; Nashville, Knoxville, and Memphis, Tennessee; and Washington, D.C. before making his way to Pensacola, Florida--a community that would welcome him with open arms, and remain his home until his passing. Dave quickly became a known figure over the local television airwaves as news anchor at WEAR-TV in Pensacola and then as reporter- anchor with WALA-TV in Mobile, Alabama. According to Denise, his bride of 26 years, radio was what he loved most, however, and it is radio where he dedicated his career for the last 14 years of his life. This love was demonstrated by the fact that he would arrive at 5 a.m. every morning to host the WEBY-AM morning show, ``Wake up with Dave.'' To many, Dave will be remembered and appreciated for his company and entertainment on their morning commute; however, to those closest to him, including his dogs Peaches and Pal, Dave will be remembered as a loving husband, father, and grandfather and will greatly be missed. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my constituents in Florida's First Congressional District, I am proud to honor and commemorate the life and legacy of Dave Daughtry. Vicki and I offer his entire family, especially his wife, Denise; children, Bonnie, Michael, and Patrick; seven grandchildren, Lindsey, Shannon, Evan, Patrick, Amanda, Shelby, and Benjamin; and the entire Daughtry family our deepest condolences and prayers. May God continue to bless them all during this difficult time. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1569] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF NORTHWEST FLORIDA'S BELOVED DAVE DAUGHTRY ______ HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life and service of Ms. Teola Sanders, and I commend her fifty years of impassioned leadership and unyielding volunteerism to the East Bay community. Ms. Sanders' dedication to Bay Area women's rights, horticulture, arts and humanities, reflects the lasting legacy of her service. Ms. Sanders was born in Mansfield, Louisiana in 1931 and was the oldest of four children. In 1938, the family relocated to Oakland, California. Ms. Sanders attended Oakland Public Schools and was a proud graduate of Oakland Technical High School. In 1951, she met Jeff Sanders and from this union three children were born: Tori, Andre, and Jay. Ms. Sanders completed community college courses before obtaining her Real Estate License. For 27 years, she worked for the Shorenstein Company (formerly Milton Meyer and Company), one of the country's oldest and most respected real estate organizations. Her tremendous leadership led to her appointment as the company's lead organizer for political and humanitarian events throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. Extremely passionate about local politics, Ms. Sanders was a founding member of Black Women Organized for Political Action (BWOPA). One of BWOPA's first major successes was helping elect Ronald V. Dellums to the United States Congress in 1971. Ms. Sanders' passion for political activism continued and she was appointed to serve on numerous boards, including the Commission of the Deputy Chief of Protocol by Oakland Mayor Elihu Harris, and the Horticultural Commission by Governor Jerry Brown. She was also the Founding President of Today's Women, Inc., and a founding member of the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame. Ms. Sanders' life was dedicated to the service of others. She generously donated her time to the Oakland Museum, the Oakland Symphony, the African American Museum and Library Coalition, the American Red Cross and many other humanitarian organizations. Ultimately, Ms. Sanders was blessed to live a full life with no regrets. A loving mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, and friend, Ms. Sanders will truly be missed. But we can rest assured knowing her lasting memory of love and wisdom will continue to guide all those who knew and loved her. Today, California's 13th Congressional District salutes the legacy of Ms. Teola Sanders, and her contributions which have truly impacted countless lives throughout the Bay Area. I join all of Ms. Sanders' loved ones in celebrating her incredible life and offer my most sincere condolences. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1570] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING MS.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life and service of Ms. Teola Sanders, and I commend her fifty years of impassioned leadership and unyielding volunteerism to the East Bay community. Ms. Sanders' dedication to Bay Area women's rights, horticulture, arts and humanities, reflects the lasting legacy of her service. Ms. Sanders was born in Mansfield, Louisiana in 1931 and was the oldest of four children. In 1938, the family relocated to Oakland, California. Ms. Sanders attended Oakland Public Schools and was a proud graduate of Oakland Technical High School. In 1951, she met Jeff Sanders and from this union three children were born: Tori, Andre, and Jay. Ms. Sanders completed community college courses before obtaining her Real Estate License. For 27 years, she worked for the Shorenstein Company (formerly Milton Meyer and Company), one of the country's oldest and most respected real estate organizations. Her tremendous leadership led to her appointment as the company's lead organizer for political and humanitarian events throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. Extremely passionate about local politics, Ms. Sanders was a founding member of Black Women Organized for Political Action (BWOPA). One of BWOPA's first major successes was helping elect Ronald V. Dellums to the United States Congress in 1971. Ms. Sanders' passion for political activism continued and she was appointed to serve on numerous boards, including the Commission of the Deputy Chief of Protocol by Oakland Mayor Elihu Harris, and the Horticultural Commission by Governor Jerry Brown. She was also the Founding President of Today's Women, Inc., and a founding member of the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame. Ms. Sanders' life was dedicated to the service of others. She generously donated her time to the Oakland Museum, the Oakland Symphony, the African American Museum and Library Coalition, the American Red Cross and many other humanitarian organizations. Ultimately, Ms. Sanders was blessed to live a full life with no regrets. A loving mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, and friend, Ms. Sanders will truly be missed. But we can rest assured knowing her lasting memory of love and wisdom will continue to guide all those who knew and loved her. Today, California's 13th Congressional District salutes the legacy of Ms. Teola Sanders, and her contributions which have truly impacted countless lives throughout the Bay Area. I join all of Ms. Sanders' loved ones in celebrating her incredible life and offer my most sincere condolences. ____________________",package_114_271.csv,2898,2898,2968,"[congressional record volume 161, number 162 (monday, november 2, 2015)] [extensions of remarks] [page e1570] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] honoring ms. teola sanders ______ hon. barbara lee of california in the house of representatives monday, november 2, 2015 ms. lee. mr. speaker, i rise today to honor the extraordinary life and service of ms. teola sanders, and i commend her fifty years of impassioned leadership and unyielding volunteerism to the east bay community. ms. sanders' dedication to bay area women's rights, horticulture, arts and humanities, reflects the lasting legacy of her service. ms. sanders was born in mansfield, louisiana in 1931 and was the oldest of four children. in 1938, the family relocated to oakland, california. ms. sanders attended oakland public schools and was a proud graduate of oakland technical high school. in 1951, she met jeff sanders and from this union three children were born: tori, andre, and jay. ms. sanders completed community college courses before obtaining her real estate license. for 27 years, she worked for the shorenstein company (formerly milton meyer and company), one of the country's oldest and most respected real estate organizations. her tremendous leadership led to her appointment as the company's lead organizer for political and humanitarian events throughout the san francisco bay area. extremely passionate about local politics, ms. sanders was a founding member of black women organized for political action (bwopa). one of bwopa's first major successes was helping elect ronald v. dellums to the united states congress in 1971. ms. sanders' passion for political activism continued and she was appointed to serve on numerous boards, including the commission of the deputy chief of protocol by oakland mayor elihu harris, and the horticultural commission by governor jerry brown. she was also the founding president of today's women, inc., and a founding member of the black filmmakers hall of fame. ms. sanders' life was dedicated to the service of others. she generously donated her time to the oakland museum, the oakland symphony, the african american museum and library coalition, the american red cross and many other humanitarian organizations. ultimately, ms. sanders was blessed to live a full life with no regrets. a loving mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, and friend, ms. sanders will truly be missed. but we can rest assured knowing her lasting memory of love and wisdom will continue to guide all those who knew and loved her. today, california's 13th congressional district salutes the legacy of ms. teola sanders, and her contributions which have truly impacted countless lives throughout the bay area. i join all of ms. sanders' loved ones in celebrating her incredible life and offer my most sincere condolences. ____________________",2898

ANTHONY AWARDS ______ HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of new york in the house of representatives Monday, November 2, 2015 Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the women who are receiving the 2015 Susan B. Anthony award from the New York City chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW-NYC) for their efforts in promoting equal rights for women. Each year, NOW-NYC recognizes grassroots activists who have worked to improve the lives of women and girls in New York City. This year's honorees are Kimberle Williams Crenshaw, Krystal C., and Tamar Kraft- Stolar. Committed to giving women a voice, NOW-NYC strives to promote reproductive rights, empower women economically, and end the violence and discrimination that women face. The organization provides a myriad of resources for issues relating to housing, police misconduct, and child-custody. NOW-NYC is a leading advocate of women's rights and a force for justice. Among other things, their volunteers escort women to reproductive health clinics, advocate for legislation such as anti- trafficking provisions and lead open discussions on the status of women in politics today. As the largest NOW chapter in the country, NOW-NYC plays a fundamental role in shaping the local and national debate on women's issues. Kimberle Williams Crenshaw, author of four groundbreaking reports on African American women and the unique struggles they face in America, has received national acclaim for the attention she draws to the challenges women of color face. Professor Crenshaw, a law professor at UCLA and Columbia, is a leading theorist on Black feminism and civil rights. An advocate for a gender-inclusive approach to racial justice, she is also the co-founder and Executive Director of the African American Policy Forum, a gender and racial justice think tank. Professor Crenshaw is co-author of the groundbreaking reports, Black Girls Matter: Pushed Out, Overpoliced and Underprotected, and Say Her Name: Resisting Police Brutality Against Black Women. Former New York Jets cheerleader turned women's rights activist, Krystal C., is taking a stand against unfair wage practices by professional football teams. As a Jets cheerleader, she was paid just $150 per game and $100 per special event, and was not compensated for practice time, training camp and other appearances. Based on hours actually worked, she was receiving only $3.77 an hour, significantly below the state's minimum wage. She was also required to incur out-of- pocket expenses for motivational gifts, uniform maintenance and hair straightening. Krystal filed a class action lawsuit against the Jets. Tamar Kraft-Stolar, Co-Director of the Women and Justice Project (WJP), is committed to advocating on behalf of women who are imprisoned. WJP is dedicated to ending the mass incarceration of women. Before joining WJP, she managed the Correctional Association of New York's Women in Prison Project for over a decade. As a leader on incarceration reform, Ms. Kraft-Stolar spearheaded the very successful campaign to pass legislation ending the shackling of incarcerated women during childbirth. Additionally Miyhosi Benton, Bridgette Gibbs, Ursulina Miranda, Tina Tinen, and Maria Ventura are being recognized for their efforts to end the inhumane practice of shackling incarcerated pregnant women in New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring NOW-NYC and the 2015 Susan B. Anthony Award recipients for their perseverance and advocacy in the fight to end injustice and ensure equality for women. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1571] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN HONOR OF NOW-NYC'S 35TH ANNUAL SUSAN B.

Among other things, their volunteers escort women to reproductive health clinics, advocate for legislation such as anti- trafficking provisions and lead open discussions on the status of women in politics today. As the largest NOW chapter in the country, NOW-NYC plays a fundamental role in shaping the local and national debate on women's issues. Kimberle Williams Crenshaw, author of four groundbreaking reports on African American women and the unique struggles they face in America, has received national acclaim for the attention she draws to the challenges women of color face. Professor Crenshaw, a law professor at UCLA and Columbia, is a leading theorist on Black feminism and civil rights. An advocate for a gender-inclusive approach to racial justice, she is also the co-founder and Executive Director of the African American Policy Forum, a gender and racial justice think tank.

Former New York Jets cheerleader turned women's rights activist, Krystal C., is taking a stand against unfair wage practices by professional football teams. As a Jets cheerleader, she was paid just $150 per game and $100 per special event, and was not compensated for practice time, training camp and other appearances. Based on hours actually worked, she was receiving only $3.77 an hour, significantly below the state's minimum wage. She was also required to incur out-of- pocket expenses for motivational gifts, uniform maintenance and hair straightening. Krystal filed a class action lawsuit against the Jets. Tamar Kraft-Stolar, Co-Director of the Women and Justice Project (WJP), is committed to advocating on behalf of women who are imprisoned. WJP is dedicated to ending the mass incarceration of women. Before joining WJP, she managed the Correctional Association of New York's Women in Prison Project for over a decade.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Export- Import Bank Reform and Reauthorization Act, and I applaud the triumph of democracy over ideology that it represents. The Export-Import Bank is, and always has been, about jobs. It's about the ability of U.S. companies of all sizes to grow their business by exporting their products, and to compete on a level playing field with their foreign competitors in global markets--many of whom continue to receive export financing from any one of the 85 foreign export credit agencies still operating around the world. The only companies hurt by the far right's crusade against the Export-Import Bank are our own companies, employing American workers, manufacturing products stamped ``Made in the USA.'' That didn't make sense in July, when the Export-Import Bank's charter was allowed to expire--and it doesn't make sense now. Which is why I am very pleased that a bipartisan majority in the House of Representatives is at long last saying ``enough is enough.'' I'm proud to be a part of that bipartisan majority, and I call on the Senate to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank without delay. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1571] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK REFORM AND REAUTHORIZATION ACT (H.R. 597) ______ HON.

CREC-2015-11-02-pt1-PgE1571-3,CREC-2015-11-02,114,HONORING THE SERVICE OF JUAN FELIPE HERRERA,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1571-E1572] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE SERVICE OF JUAN FELIPE HERRERA ______ HON. JIM COSTA of california in the house of representatives Monday, November 2, 2015 Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the work and celebrate the achievements of United States Poet Laureate, Juan Felipe Herrera. Mr. Herrera is a California native and the first Latino in history to become a Poet Laureate. He took up his duties of Poet Laureate this fall by opening Hispanic Heritage Month at the Library of Congress with a reading of one of his works. Mr. Herrera succeeds Charles Wright as the 21st Poet Laureate and joins a long line of distinguished poets who have served in the position, including the late Philip Levine who was a Fresno native and former professor at the California State University, Fresno. Mr. Herrera was previously appointed as California Poet Laureate by Governor Jerry Brown and served from 2012-2015. Born in Fowler, California in 1948 to migrant farmworker parents, Mr. Herrera spent his early life living in tents and trailers with his family throughout the San Joaquin Valley and the Salinas Valley following the seasonal crops. His experience as a campesino has strongly influenced his works. Traveling from the San Joaquin Valley to San Diego's Logan Heights and San Francisco's Mission District gave him three distinct California experiences, which is where he draws his inspiration from. Growing up in the '60s and attending college in the '70s during the Chicano Movement inspired Mr. Herrera and his writing style, which fuses wide-ranging experimentalism with reflections on Mexican-American identity. Mr. Herrera graduated from San Diego High School in 1967 and was one of the first waves of Latinos to receive the Educational Opportunity Program scholarship to attend the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He received a Bachelor's degree in Social Anthropology from UCLA, a Master's degree in Social Anthropology from Stanford University, and a Master's of Fine Arts degree at the University of Iowa Writer's Workshop. He has worked as a poet for over 40 years throughout California at various colleges, universities, migrant camps, continuation high schools, juvenile halls, and prisons. Among his many works Mr. Herrera is the author of 28 books of poetry, novels for young adults, and collections for children. He published his first collection of poems, Rebozos of Love in 1974 and some of his subsequent work includes Exiles of Desire (1985), Border-Crosser with a Lamorghini Dream (1999), and Senegal Taxi (2013). Mr. Herrera has also published 11 young adult and children's books, including The Upside Down Boy (2000), which was adopted into a musical and most recently Portraits of Hispanic American Heroes (2014), a picture book showcasing inspiring Hispanic and Latino Americans. Mr. Herrera's honors include fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts, two Latino Hall of Fame Poetry Awards, and a PEN Open Book Award. He has also received the PEN USA National Poetry Award, PEN Oakland Josephine Miles Award, two Americas Awards, two Pura Belpre Author Honor Awards, the Independent Publisher Book Award, the Ezra Jack Keats Award, and fellowships from the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference and the Stanford University Chicano Fellows. Among his writing and social activism, Mr. Herrera also served as Chancellor for the Academy of American Poets in 2011. He has served as the Chair of the Chicano and Latin American Studies Department at California State University, Fresno, and also held the Tomas Rivera Endowed Chair in the Creative Writing Department at the University of California, Riverside, where he taught until retiring in 2015. Since his retirement, Mr. Herrera has become a visiting professor in the Department of American Ethnic Studies at the University of Washington-Seattle. He currently resides in Fresno, with his five children and his partner, fellow poet, and performance artist, Margarita Robles. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me as we honor and celebrate [[Page E1572]] Juan Felipe Herrera for his dedication to poetry, his community, and education. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Pages E1571-E1572] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONORING THE SERVICE OF JUAN FELIPE HERRERA ______ HON.

WILLIAM R. KEATING of massachusetts in the house of representatives Monday, November 2, 2015 Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of October as National Down Syndrome Awareness Month. During the month of October, we celebrate the abilities of the more than 400,000 Americans who have Down syndrome and raise awareness of their accomplishments. We also recognize the difficulties that their families often face and the many opportunities that exist to support them. Individuals born with Down syndrome face more natural and societal challenges than others, including barriers in access to quality education. We, as Americans, have made great strides over the years in better understanding the difficulties these individuals, and their families, face. Given that 1 in every 691 babies in this country is born with Down syndrome, it is imperative we continue our efforts. Good work is being done all across this country to improve the health and quality of life for people with Down syndrome, but I want to give special attention to the efforts of the Massachusetts Down Syndrome Congress. The MDSC is an organization I have had the honor and pleasure of working with in recent years, and can attest that it has worked tirelessly for over thirty years to improve the educational and employment opportunities for children and adults with Down syndrome. To this end, I want to highlight the MDSC's annual Buddy Walk in Falmouth, which this past July brought people from all over the Commonwealth to advocate for heightened awareness, inclusion, and acceptance of people with Down syndrome. MDSC also held its annual National Buddy Walk on Washington, bringing over 150 people from more than 25 states together to Capitol Hill to advocate for legislation that positively impacts the lives of people with Down syndrome. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in continuing our efforts by recognizing October as National Down Syndrome Awareness Month. There is much work yet to be done. But, as our steadfast Massachusetts and national partners have demonstrated, together, we can make a difference for people with Down syndrome. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 162 (Monday, November 2, 2015)] [Extensions of Remarks] [Page E1572] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] IN RECOGNITION OF OCTOBER AS NATIONAL DOWN SYNDROME AWARENESS MONTH ______ HON.

This wing, with the signatures of Mr. Shinsky and other living members of the 384th Bomber Group, will be put in the Hill Aerospace Museum at Hill Air Force Base near Ogden, Utah. As a former Navy pilot, I am humbled by Paul's noble service to our country. He truly embodies the Greatest Generation. On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congressional District of Texas and all the brave men and women who have served our country, we thank Paul for his service. ____________________",package_114_271.csv,1392,1392,1462,"[congressional record volume 161, number 162 (monday, november 2, 2015)] [extensions of remarks] [page e1572] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] honoring the greatest generation ______ hon. pete olson of texas in the house of representatives monday, november 2, 2015 mr. olson. mr. speaker, i rise today to honor paul shinsky of alvin, texas for bravely serving the united states during world war ii. mr. shinsky valiantly served in the army air corps as a co-pilot of a b-17 in the 384th bomber group during world war ii. during the war, mr. shinsky's plane was taken down by german fire and he became a german prisoner of war. he says he survived his two years as a pow through god's grace and praying the rosary. recently, members from the 384th bg nexgen's veterans signing project came to mr. shinsky and asked him to sign a wing from an original b-17. this wing, with the signatures of mr. shinsky and other living members of the 384th bomber group, will be put in the hill aerospace museum at hill air force base near ogden, utah. as a former navy pilot, i am humbled by paul's noble service to our country. he truly embodies the greatest generation. on behalf of the twenty-second congressional district of texas and all the brave men and women who have served our country, we thank paul for his service. ____________________",1392

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor eighty-eight military veterans who reside in my Congressional District in Nassau County, Florida and recognize them with a special medal in honor of their military service and in gratitude of our country The veterans' ceremony carries special significance as it falls during Northeast Florida's Week of Valor and in light of the fact that brave American military members continue to serve across the globe. Veterans in Nassau County have always taken part in our Nation's battles dating back to the Seminole-Indian Wars, Civil War, World War I and II, Korea, Vietnam and operations in the Middle East. These citizens have served with distinction and courage no matter their assignments. Each veteran accepted the call to serve and take his or her turn on the watch. The secret of our outstanding military is the citizens from communities, like Nassau County, stepping forward to serve. The faces of America's military can be found right here in Bryceville, Callahan, Fernandina Beach, Hilliard and Yulee, Florida. The veterans we honor were nurses, doctors and aircraft mechanics. During World War II, one sat in a ball turret as a gunner; one was a P- 17 pilot. In Korea, they called in air strikes as forward air controllers and worked in MASH units. In Vietnam, they were on the ground as infantrymen or in the air in helicopters. One of them helped develop the assault amphibious vehicle still used by the Marine Corps today. Some saw fierce combat in Iraq and worked counter drug operations in South and Central America. Several earned Bronze Stars and other service medals. Some wear Purple Hearts. All of them served with distinction, dedication and devotion to our country. Over the years I have had the honor of recognizing over two thousand veterans in Florida's Fourth Congressional District. This year, I am honored to commend the following men and women for their service to our country and to salute them for a job well done: John W.
