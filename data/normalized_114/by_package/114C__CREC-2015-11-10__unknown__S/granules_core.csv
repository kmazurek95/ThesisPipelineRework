CREC-2015-11-10-pt1-PgS7869-6,CREC-2015-11-10,114,COMMEMORATING VETERANS DAY AND PASSING LEGISLATION SUPPORTING OUR VETERANS AND TROOPS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7869-S7870] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMEMORATING VETERANS DAY AND PASSING LEGISLATION SUPPORTING OUR VETERANS AND TROOPS Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, like many of my colleagues, I plan to commemorate Veterans Day with the people I am honored to represent here in the Senate. I will join Kentuckians at a ceremony in Shelbyville's Veterans Memorial Park. Hands will be put to heart as the ``Star Spangled Banner'' is played. Heads will bow in reverence as 106 names are read aloud, each a Kentuckian who made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of others, and each a reminder of our enduring debt to America's men and women in uniform. I am proud to represent the nearly 330,000 Kentuckians who have served in the Armed Forces. I am also proud to represent the many thousands of soldiers and their families who reside in or hail from our great Commonwealth, whether at Fort Knox, Fort Campbell, the Blue Grass Army Depot, or beyond. I recently had a chance to meet some of Kentucky's brave soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who currently serve in Afghanistan and Iraq. Sadly, a NATO helicopter had just crashed in Kabul, killing five people, including two American servicemembers. I was honored to take part in a prayer service led by a chaplain from Lexington, KY, and I note that the occupant of the Chair was with me at the time. What an incredibly humbling moment it was. The tragic crash is a stark reminder of the incredible danger our service men and women face every day, and a stark reminder of what all Americans owe them. Veterans should know that they have many champions fighting for them here in the Senate. One of them is Senator Isakson, the chair of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. Under his leadership, the committee has actively sought to do right by the men and women who never hesitate to do right [[Page S7870]] by us. He has sent important legislation to the Senate floor that we have been able to pass on a bipartisan basis and that the President has signed into law. One law we passed would improve the Veterans Choice Program, for instance, while another, the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act, would help reduce the tragedies that befall too many of our heroes and the heartbreak that befalls too many of their families. Important Veterans' Affairs Committee oversight has also been brought to bear on an agency that has lost the trust of many it serves; that is, the VA. Of course, there is much more to be done. Veterans deserve the very best, and the VA crisis will not be resolved easily or quickly, but working together, there is a lot we can do for the men and women who risk their all for their country. One way to do so is by passing the Veterans funding bill that is before us. It is a result of great work by another champion of veterans, Senator Kirk, chair of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee. Just like Senator Isakson's Veterans' Affairs Committee, the subcommittee led by the Senator from Illinois has done great work for veterans in sending important legislation such as this to the floor. We will pass one important measure today. Senator Kirk's bill would fund the health care and the benefits our veterans rely on. It would support military families by funding the housing, schools, and health facilities that sustain them. It would provide support for medical research, for women's health, and for veterans suffering from traumatic brain injury. And in Kentucky, it would provide funding for a special operations headquarters at Fort Campbell, for educational facilities at Fort Knox, and for design work for a new medical center in Louisville. Senator Kirk's bill would also fund reforms designed to help address the crisis we have seen at the VA. These reforms would allow for greater national and regional progress in reducing claims backlogs, and they would deploy important protections for whistleblowers as well. It is obvious why our veterans deserve this bill right now, so let's not wait a moment longer. Let's pass this important legislation later today. The men and women who have worn our uniform have had to wait long enough for it already. We will also turn to legislation today for the men and women who currently wear our uniform and have had to wait too long for it. When Senator McCain says that it is the first duty of the Federal Government to protect the Nation, he means it. He knows what it means to serve. He knows what it means to sacrifice. And in his role as chair of the Armed Services Committee, he worked hard to craft a bipartisan Defense authorization bill with input from both parties. It would transform bureaucratic waste into crucial investments for our troops and their families, like the raises they have earned and the quality of life programs they deserve. It would provide hope for wounded warriors and extend a hand of compassion to heroes who struggle with mental health challenges. It would also authorize a new medical facility at Fort Knox, an important project I have championed literally for years. And at a time when our country faces the most ``diverse and complex array of crises'' since the Second World War, as Henry Kissinger observed, Senator McCain's bill would help position our military to confront the challenges of tomorrow as it offers support to the men and women serving in harm's way today. The Defense authorization bill is legislation we typically consider every year. It is legislation that typically passes with broad bipartisan support. We expect that to finally happen again today. We expect the President to finally sign it this time. This should have been allowed to happen a whole lot sooner. We all know the unfortunate and unnecessary roadblocks the Defense authorization bill has faced this year. We all know the President decided to veto the version of the bill we passed last month. That veto is particularly unfortunate and puzzling, given the two chief concerns the President cited when he vetoed it. No. 1, he said he was concerned that the bill relied upon contingency funding to meet the Department's operational costs. No. 2, he said he was concerned that the bill again contained a clear, bipartisan prohibition on moving Guantanamo Bay terrorists into our local communities. But the bill really hasn't changed much since then, and the top line has now been settled by the bipartisan budget agreement. Either way, we look forward to the Senate passing this essentially unchanged legislation and the President's signing the bipartisan bill, along with--along with--its restrictions against bringing terrorists into the United States, into law. This bill will include restrictions on bringing terrorists into the United States, and he is going to sign it. That is the right thing for our men and women in uniform, and that is the right thing for our country. Before I leave the floor, I wish to underline a point I just referenced. This morning the Senate will pass two bills. It will pass a Veterans funding bill that supports Americans who have already served their country, and it will pass a Defense authorization bill that supports Americans who are currently serving. Each of these bills contains a clear, bipartisan prohibition on the President moving Guantanamo Bay terrorists into the backyards of the American people. Both of these bills include restrictions on moving terrorists into our country. The Senate has voted many times over the years to enact these bipartisan prohibitions. We have enacted them in Congresses with split party control. We have enacted them in Congresses with massive, overwhelming Democratic majorities. And, today, the Congress elected by the American people will express itself clearly one more time--not once, but twice--today. The President may not like this bipartisan action. It may conflict with a campaign slogan from 8 or 9 years ago. But here is how one Senator put it: ``Congress' job is to pass legislation. The President can veto it or he can sign it.'' That was then-Senator Obama as he was criticizing the idea of doing an ``end-run around Congress.'' ``I believe in the Constitution,'' he said at the time--Senator Obama--``and I will obey the Constitution of the United States,'' said Senator Obama. Those were his words then. They should guide his actions now. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7869-S7870] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] COMMEMORATING VETERANS DAY AND PASSING LEGISLATION SUPPORTING OUR VETERANS AND TROOPS Mr. McCONNELL.

the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] commemorating veterans day and passing legislation supporting our veterans and troops mr. mcconnell. madam president, like many of my colleagues, i plan to commemorate veterans day with the people i am honored to represent here in the senate. i will join kentuckians at a ceremony in shelbyville's veterans memorial park. hands will be put to heart as the ``star spangled banner'' is played. heads will bow in reverence as 106 names are read aloud, each a kentuckian who made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of others, and each a reminder of our enduring debt to america's men and women in uniform. i am proud to represent the nearly 330,000 kentuckians who have served in the armed forces. i am also proud to represent the many thousands of soldiers and their families who reside in or hail from our great commonwealth, whether at fort knox, fort campbell, the blue grass army depot, or beyond. i recently had a chance to meet some of kentucky's brave soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who currently serve in afghanistan and iraq. sadly, a nato helicopter had just crashed in kabul, killing five people, including two american servicemembers. i was honored to take part in a prayer service led by a chaplain from lexington, ky, and i note that the occupant of the chair was with me at the time. what an incredibly humbling moment it was. the tragic crash is a stark reminder of the incredible danger our service men and women face every day, and a stark reminder of what all americans owe them. veterans should know that they have many champions fighting for them here in the senate. one of them is senator isakson, the chair of the veterans' affairs committee. under his leadership, the committee has actively sought to do right by the men and women who never hesitate to do right [[page s7870]] by us. he has sent important legislation to the senate floor that we have been able to pass on a bipartisan basis and that the president has signed into law. one law we passed would improve the veterans choice program, for instance, while another, the clay hunt suicide prevention for american veterans act, would help reduce the tragedies that befall too many of our heroes and the heartbreak that befalls too many of their families. important veterans' affairs committee oversight has also been brought to bear on an agency that has lost the trust of many it serves; that is, the va. of course, there is much more to be done. veterans deserve the very best, and the va crisis will not be resolved easily or quickly, but working together, there is a lot we can do for the men and women who risk their all for their country. one way to do so is by passing the veterans funding bill that is before us. it is a result of great work by another champion of veterans, senator kirk, chair of the military construction and veterans affairs appropriations subcommittee. just like senator isakson's veterans' affairs committee, the subcommittee led by the senator from illinois has done great work for veterans in sending important legislation such as this to the floor. we will pass one important measure today. senator kirk's bill would fund the health care and the benefits our veterans rely on. it would support military families by funding the housing, schools, and health facilities that sustain them. it would provide support for medical research, for women's health, and for veterans suffering from traumatic brain injury. and in kentucky, it would provide funding for a special operations headquarters at fort campbell, for educational facilities at fort knox, and for design work for a new medical center in louisville. senator kirk's bill would also fund reforms designed to help address the crisis we have seen at the va. these reforms would allow for greater national and regional progress in reducing claims backlogs, and they would deploy important protections for whistleblowers as well. it is obvious why our veterans deserve this bill right now, so let's not wait a moment longer. let's pass this important legislation later today. the men and women who have worn our uniform have had to wait long enough for it already. we will also turn to legislation today for the men and women who currently wear our uniform and have had to wait too long for it. when senator mccain says that it is the first duty of the federal government to protect the nation, he means it. he knows what it means to serve. he knows what it means to sacrifice. and in his role as chair of the armed services committee, he worked hard to craft a bipartisan defense authorization bill with input from both parties. it would transform bureaucratic waste into crucial investments for our troops and their families, like the raises they have earned and the quality of life programs they deserve. it would provide hope for wounded warriors and extend a hand of compassion to heroes who struggle with mental health challenges. it would also authorize a new medical facility at fort knox, an important project i have championed literally for years. and at a time when our country faces the most ``diverse and complex array of crises'' since the second world war, as henry kissinger observed, senator mccain's bill would help position our military to confront the challenges of tomorrow as it offers support to the men and women serving in harm's way today. the defense authorization bill is legislation we typically consider every year. it is legislation that typically passes with broad bipartisan support. we expect that to finally happen again today. we expect the president to finally sign it this time. this should have been allowed to happen a whole lot sooner. we all know the unfortunate and unnecessary roadblocks the defense authorization bill has faced this year. we all know the president decided to veto the version of the bill we passed last month. that veto is particularly unfortunate and puzzling, given the two chief concerns the president cited when he vetoed it. no. 1, he said he was concerned that the bill relied upon contingency funding to meet the department's operational costs. no. 2, he said he was concerned that the bill again contained a clear, bipartisan prohibition on moving guantanamo bay terrorists into our local communities. but the bill really hasn't changed much since then, and the top line has now been settled by the bipartisan budget agreement. either way, we look forward to the senate passing this essentially unchanged legislation and the president's signing the bipartisan bill, along with--along with--its restrictions against bringing terrorists into the united states, into law. this bill will include restrictions on bringing terrorists into the united states, and he is going to sign it. that is the right thing for our men and women in uniform, and that is the right thing for our country. before i leave the floor, i wish to underline a point i just referenced. this morning the senate will pass two bills. it will pass a veterans funding bill that supports americans who have already served their country, and it will pass a defense authorization bill that supports americans who are currently serving. each of these bills contains a clear, bipartisan prohibition on the president moving guantanamo bay terrorists into the backyards of the american people. both of these bills include restrictions on moving terrorists into our country. the senate has voted many times over the years to enact these bipartisan prohibitions. we have enacted them in congresses with split party control. we have enacted them in congresses with massive, overwhelming democratic majorities. and, today, the congress elected by the american people will express itself clearly one more time--not once, but twice--today. the president may not like this bipartisan action. it may conflict with a campaign slogan from 8 or 9 years ago. but here is how one senator put it: ``congress' job is to pass legislation. the president can veto it or he can sign it.'' that was then-senator obama as he was criticizing the idea of doing an ``end-run around congress.'' ``i believe in the constitution,'' he said at the time--senator obama--``and i will obey the constitution of the united states,'' said senator obama. those were his words then. they should guide his actions now. ____________________",8502

Madam President, the Fifth Circuit Court's decision yesterday was a political move that ignores past precedents on Executive action on immigration. The Republicans have spoken out against the President's action on what he has done on immigration. Why did he do it? Because he was trapped. He had to do it because the Republicans refused to legislate. And like every President before him, President Obama has a legal right to establish clear immigration enforcement priorities and allocate resources accordingly. [[Page S7871]] But the attorney general of Texas and 25 other Republican Governors and attorneys general filed a lawsuit stating that the President had exceeded his authority. This decision affects millions of American families who are now subject to being torn apart, and as many as 5 million immigrants could be set for mass deportation. I expect the administration will swiftly appeal this decision to the Supreme Court and that the Court will find the actions lawful. It is sad that Republicans are wasting their time talking about mass deportation when they could be doing things to solve the problem, such as passing a bill that reforms our immigration system once and for all. The Republican Party has neglected the lessons of the 2012 elections and has plunged over a cliff following Donald Trump, Ben Carson, and the others. The Executive actions were neither a complete nor a permanent solution to the problems plaguing the immigration system, but they were a commonsense step in the face of inaction. As Judge Carolyn Dineen King stated in her dissent very clearly, ``a mistake has been made.'' So it is now up to the U.S. Supreme Court to correct this grave mistake--a mistake that sets not only a dangerous precedent but one that is bad for families, bad for our communities, and bad for the future prosperity of our country. Again, as Judge King said, ``a mistake has been made.'' ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7870-S7871] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FIFTH CIRCUIT COURT IMMIGRATION DECISION Mr. REID.

Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 2029, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (H.R. 2029) making appropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes. Pending: Kirk/Tester amendment No. 2763, in the nature of a substitute. Kirk amendment No. 2764 (to amendment No. 2763), to clarify the term ``congressional defense committees.'' The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 11 a.m. will be equally divided in the usual form. The Senator from Utah. Unanimous Consent Request--S. REs. 312 Mr. LEE. Madam President, I rise today to support and to request the Senate's approval of this resolution, which would designate the second week of November as National Pregnancy [[Page S7872]] Center Week in honor of the lifesaving and life-affirming work of America's community-supported pregnancy centers. I am asking for my colleague's unanimous consent because there is absolutely nothing contentious about this resolution, S. Res. 312, nor is there anything contentious about the pregnancy resource centers commemorated by this resolution. There are approximately 2,500 pregnancy resource centers in America. Every single day they serve an average of 65,000 women and men faced with challenging pregnancy decisions, providing them with a wide array of resources. That includes, at many centers, health care services such as pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, and testing for STDs and STIs. It includes emotional and educational support such as options counseling and parenting classes. It includes material and logistical assistance to help new moms and dads deal with all the little things that easily add up to big obstacles in the first few weeks and months of parenthood. America's pregnancy resource centers aren't out to make a profit nor are they out there to push a particular political agenda. They are just there to help and to do so in a way that is compassionate, considerate of individual privacy, and respectful of the equal dignity of all human life. Any way you look at it, America's pregnancy resource centers deserve our recognition and they deserve our respect and our gratitude. The real measure of their significance isn't in the words of a floor speech in the Senate or the outcome of a vote, it is in the thousands of lives they help save from the pain of abortion every year and in the millions of teachers, soldiers, nurses, neighbors, friends, and spouses whose lives and contributions to our communities we might never have known had it not been for the unassuming heroes down at the local pregnancy center who give their time to keep the lights on, answer the phones, and help young women find the hope and the courage to choose life. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 312, submitted earlier today; that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I would ask the Senator to modify his request and offer a resolution that actually helps to move women's health and rights forward. Simply put, the resolution that the Senator has offered is more of the same. It is another effort to pander to the extreme Republican base by using women's health and constitutionally protected rights as a political football. Unfortunately, it makes it clear for the umpteenth time that when it comes to improving access to affordable health care for women, some Republicans are determined to stand in the way of progress. I expect that some of my Republican colleagues will say this resolution shows how much they care about women's health. The truth is it shows the opposite. It shows once again that the Republican Party wants to interfere in a woman's medical decision. Strengthening women's health care doesn't start with telling women what they should and should not do with their own bodies, but that is exactly what that resolution does. If my Republican colleagues really want to support women's reproductive care, they would work with Democrats on improving access to affordable birth control under the Affordable Care Act, including emergency contraceptives, ensuring women and families make their own decisions about their health care--not their bosses--and fighting back against efforts across the country to undermine women's constitutionally protected health care rights. It is time for Republicans to drop the political attacks on women's health and instead join Democrats to focus on these priorities and more like them, so that women--not politicians, not insurance companies, not CFOs or CEOs--are in control of their health care, as it should be. Unanimous Consent Request--S. Res. 37 That is why I ask the Senator to modify his request and instead ask unanimous consent that the HELP Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res. 37, and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator so modify his request? Mr. LEE. Madam President, reserving the right to object, there is nothing divisive about this resolution I have offered today, nothing divisive whatsoever. This simply seeks recognition of the great work that is performed by the men and women who staff these pregnancy centers. There is nothing about it that is a political football, nothing about it that is designed to drive a wedge. Unlike our resolution, the resolution I submitted today, S. Res. 312, which mainly commends community volunteers around the country for helping young mothers and their children--hardly divisive--the Senator's counterproposal is divisive and controversial. My cosponsors and I only wanted to recognize the life-affirming and lifesaving work, the kind of work that brings families and communities together the counterproposal would only pull Americans further apart and further away from the more humane and compassionate society that all Americans deserve. If calling for recognition of these brave and noble men and women who serve people at pregnancy centers around the country is divisive, we have significant problems, but the fact is, it is not. I would encourage anyone within the sound of my voice to read S. Res. 312, and they will discover it is not the least bit divisive and doesn't discuss anything that is the least bit controversial. On that basis, I can't agree with the modification, and I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the modification. Is there objection to the original request? Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I object to the original request. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Maryland. Armed Services Authorization Bill Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to speak as in morning business in terms of the bill we will be voting on at 11:20 a.m. today, the armed services authorization, as well as what we are going to be voting on this afternoon, which is veterans health care. They actually go hand in hand and what a great set of votes in a symmetry that shows our support for national security, our support for our U.S. military, our support for our U.S. military who are on Active Duty today, and then also for our veterans who in their hearts are always on Active Duty. Today we have the ability to actually show we can govern, we can pass bills on a bipartisan basis that will help our country be able to defend itself, show our support to the U.S. military, and honor our commitment to the veterans. I am looking forward to voting on the armed services authorization because it does give the tools we need to be able to defend ourselves. I commend Senators McCain and Jack Reed for their excellent work. Madam President, I wish to speak now as the vice chair of the Appropriations Committee. I am so excited that we are bringing the MILCON-VA bill to the Senate. I have been voting for veterans ever since I have come to Congress. Veterans are our Nation's heroes. They put their lives on the line to fight for our freedom. They have made tremendous sacrifices for our country. Whether it is veterans who are still alive from World War II, those who fought on Pork Chop Hill during the Korean war, the Vietnam war at Mekong Delta, and of course Desert Storm, Iraq, and Afghanistan, we owe our veterans a debt of gratitude. We want to show our gratitude not only with words and yellow ribbons but with deeds. I believe the best deed is to make sure we adequately fund the Veterans' Administration to end the backlog for disability benefits--if you fought on the frontlines, you shouldn't stand in line to get your disability benefits--and to robustly fund veterans [[Page S7873]] health care, along with other benefits this Congress has so authorized. We have accomplished a lot over the years working for our veterans, and we will have a lot to do with what is in our legislation. I wish to commend the subcommittee chair, Senator Mark Kirk, and our vice chair, Senator Jon Tester, for the work they have done. As we were working on our bill this summer and through the spring, veterans told me and they told them that the Senate funding was too spartan; that we were underfunding our veterans and not just by a few dollars but by $850 million. So we held it up, not as a parliamentary ping-pong, not as a parliamentary temper tantrum but as a way of saying our veterans need more money. As a result of the budget agreement, we are able to do this. We are on the floor today where an amendment will be offered by Senators Kirk and Tester to add $2 billion for veterans health care, $2 billion to be determined by the Secretary. What do we look forward to? Well, lifesaving drugs. One of course is this issue of being able to pay for hepatitis C; the other, while we are looking at actual hands-on medical care, we want to reduce the wait times. There is too much waiting at the Veterans' Administration, whether you are waiting for your disability claim or you are waiting to see your doctor or your mental health counselor or your ophthalmologist. We need to be able to reduce the wait times, and this is what part of this $2 billion will do. Then there are those who are not only chronically ill from the wounds of war but are chronically and devastatingly injured. So we looked at those who are unable to care for themselves but are being cared for at home by loved ones. This will add more funds to be able to help those caregivers who are stepping up for their responsibility. So they are taking family responsibility, but we have to take USA responsibility. That is what we fought for in the $2 billion. I urge my colleagues to move ahead and be able to vote for this bill. I do believe this legislation, by adding the money and the kind of excellent work that has been done by our authorizers, the insistence of good provisions being put into the bill--we are going to shrink that VA backlog. Also, we are going to do something else. We are going to advance funding for mandatory veterans' benefits. So no matter what government means, if we ever get into more shutdown, slamdown, slowdown politics due to us, the veterans' benefits will go forward. I have been working on this backlog for a long time. By the time we got to March 2013, we were at a national standoff. There were over 600,000 claims pending. In Maryland we had one of the worst claims offices in my own hometown of Baltimore. I couldn't believe it. When I met with my Veterans Advisory Board and stories poured out of the kinds of calls that were coming into my Constituent Services Offices, not only were they waiting in line--this isn't like just standing in line at the supermarket, this is for disability benefits, for people who are in danger of losing their homes and other kinds of things. So we went to work on a bipartisan basis. I am proud of what we did. I am proud of our authorizers. I see Senator Isakson from Georgia is on the floor. He was a big part of the reform effort. It shows our military knows how to win wars, but we need to know how we can govern so they don't have to fight a war with the VA bureaucracy. We hope we will be able to make these reforms. We are not going to throw money at it. We are going to insist on metrics. The last point I wish to talk about is the advance appropriations. People will say: Aren't VA benefits mandatory? They are unless we get into one of our parliamentary ping-pong debates. So I worked with the Disabled Veterans of America and a coalition of several voluntary veterans service organizations--great groups: the American Legion, Vietnam Veterans and Iraq and Iran Veterans of America. They asked me to add advance appropriations to the omnibus 1 year in advance--making sure we funded things 1 year in advance-- protecting them from shutdown and slamdown politics. We were able to do that again, and I hope we can do that again this year. I know I have other colleagues on the floor who wish to speak now, but I wish to say we can really show we not only know how to fight for America and its security, but we know how to fight for those who do the fighting. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise on the eve of Veterans Day to urge my colleagues to support the fiscal year 2016 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill. This marks the first time in 2 years that we have had the opportunity to debate, amend, and vote on this important legislation on the Senate floor. It is vital to those who serve and to those who have served our Nation. I first learned to honor our veterans from my father. My father is a World War II veteran who was wounded twice in the Battle of the Bulge and earned his Purple Heart and his Bronze Star. It was he who would take me to the parades on Veterans Day and on Memorial Day and boost me high on his shoulders. From the best vantage point in the parade, I would watch our veterans march by. He taught me of their sacrifice and that we have a never-ending obligation to thank those who wore the uniform of our country. Passing this bill fulfills important obligations that we owe to our Nation's 22 million veterans, 127,000 of whom live in the great State of Maine. It sends an important message to our veterans: We will honor the sacrifices that you made and are making on our behalf. It would be a mistake to send the opposite message by further postponing or delaying consideration and final passage of this important bill before we celebrate our veterans, honor, and remember them tomorrow. As a member of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee, I know this bill before us now is the result of bipartisan compromise. I commend the leadership of Chairman Kirk and Ranking Member Tester, who have worked hand in hand to craft the managers' amendment that they will be bringing before us today. In May of this year, the Appropriations Committee reported this funding bill by a strong vote of 21 to 9. Since then the Bipartisan Budget Act has been enacted, which provides needed additional resources to fund vital national priorities and that will be reflected in the managers' amendment. The managers' substitute would provide a total of $79.7 billion in funding, which I would note represents more than $1 billion more than the President's budget request. This bill increases funding for our veterans in areas where they need it most, including mental health care and benefit claims processing, two issues which the Senator from Maryland has been so active in resolving. This bill also includes funds aimed at reducing veterans homelessness. This is a special priority of mine as the chairman of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee. I worked with Senator Murray on this issue, and we have made real progress--exciting progress--in reducing the number of homeless veterans across this country through the VASH Program, but there is still more work to be done. In addition, this bill includes $270 million in funding for the Office of Rural Health, through which the Access Received Closer to Home or the ARCH Program is funded. In five pilot States in which it operates, ARCH ensures that rural veterans, who often have a very difficult time accessing the regular VA health care system--particularly the VA hospitals--can receive care closer to where they live and where their families live. I will never forget the story shared with me by a Maine veteran who broke his hip during a terrible snow storm and needed urgent care. The ARCH program, located at Cary Memorial Hospital in Caribou, ME, ensured he could receive the care he needed in his community and close to his family, rather than enduring a 4-hour drive over bumpy winter roads during a ferocious snow storm to the Togas VA Medical Center in Augusta, ME. ARCH has made a tremendous difference for our veterans and continues to help those who live in rural communities and who are facing similar challenges and emergencies. The managers' substitute also increases Veterans Affairs medical services by nearly $2 billion, including $10 [[Page S7874]] million for programs supporting caregivers. We all know of the wonderful work that Elizabeth Dole has done in this area, and I have been very pleased to join with my colleague Senator Patty Murray in introducing the Military and Veteran Caregiver Services Improvement Act. The bill before us is going to help provide benefits for those who shoulder the responsibilities associated with long-term care for critically injured veterans. This bill would expand comprehensive caregiver benefits for those who take on those responsibilities. I would note, Madam President, that the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Baldwin, and I have a broader bill dealing with caregivers that the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions is considering and I hope will be approving shortly. In addition to the vital funds for veterans programs, this bill also funds military construction projects, which unfortunately had been adversely affected--cut, delayed, deferred--as a result of the budget caps and the impact of sequestration. Therefore, I am particularly pleased this bill includes $7.2 million in funding needed to repair, renovate, and upgrade the 101st Air Refueling Wing's fire and crash rescue station in Bangor, ME. This is funding for which I have strongly advocated, and I thank the managers for including it the bill. The 101st ``MAINEiacs'' provide critical 24/7 air and ground refueling services that support local military operations, and this funding will strengthen their capabilities. I would note, Madam President, that I recently met with General Breedlove, our NATO commander, and he told me he refueled at Bangor, ME, on his way back from Europe recently. Madam President, I could go on and on about the important programs and priorities in this bill. They are essential to providing what we owe to our servicemembers and our veterans: safe and reliable infrastructure so that our troops can complete the missions they are assigned, access to medical care, earned compensation and benefits, and assistance to help our veterans successfully transition to their civilian lives. Tomorrow, on Veterans Day, our Nation will pause to honor all those who served. Today, we have the opportunity to say to the American people, to our veterans, and to those who are considering military service to our Nation that no matter what partisan issues may divide us, we stand united in fulfilling our commitment to those who serve and those who have served. We can send that message by passing this measure and sending to the President a funding bill that takes care of our servicemembers, our veterans and their families, and that honors their service to our great country. Madam President, I yield the floor. (At the request of Mr. McConnell, the following statement was ordered to be printed in the Record.) Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I wish to support the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. This bipartisan bill provides critical resources for our active military, veterans, and their families. The courage and sacrifice that define our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, coastguardsmen, and all servicemembers over the years cannot be understated. Major chapters in our Nation's rich history have been and continue to be written by our brave servicemen and women, many of whom hail from Louisiana. The very least we can do in return is keep our commitments to them. It is our obligation to fund veterans' health care and benefits, and this bill does just that while also making necessary reforms to the scandal-plagued Department of Veterans Affairs. Our Louisiana veterans have waited a long, long time to have efficient access to effective health care, and they deserve much better than what has been handed to them. That is why I have worked for years to authorize new VA clinics and build interim clinics in southwest Louisiana, including one in Lake Charles, LA, that is expected to open before the Thanksgiving holiday. The latest National Defense Authorization measure has been revised to reflect the recent budget deal, which modified the spending caps for both base and war defense spending. In light of these changes, I firmly believe the administration should honor past statements that current military reductions are due to defense budget cuts stemming from sequestration, which have now been postponed for 2 years. It is critically important to recognize that the newly revised 2-year budget deal provides necessary relief for the Department of Defense and allows a much-needed opportunity to avoid further cuts to the Active- Duty Army's troop strength. Since 2013, the U.S. Army alone has decreased troop strength 21 percent. That is both dangerous and unacceptable. I have fought against dangerously steep drawdowns and was proud to fight this issue on the Senate floor last year. The United States cannot afford continued troop cuts at a time when military leaders say that we are facing an unprecedented number of threats. I urge my colleagues to support our military and to support this bipartisan bill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for 5 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Veterans Day Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, this Veterans Day we pause to honor the men and women in our military who stepped up to fight for our freedom and to protect our families. In my home State of Washington, we have a lot to be thankful for. More than 600,000 of our friends, our neighbors, and our family members have bravely served their country. As the daughter of a World War II veteran, I know the sacrifice it takes to keep our country safe and protect our values. Thanks to my father and the countless other veterans I have had the honor of meeting, I believe that when brave individuals sign up to serve our country, we must fulfill our promise to support them when they come home. We should honor our veterans by showing them we have their backs long after the war is over. While I would like to stand here and say that our country is doing everything we can for the people we owe the most to and that we are fulfilling the promise we made to them when we sent them off to fight for us, I believe our work is far from over. Though Congress passed a sweeping bill last year to provide new resources and add more accountability to the VA, I continue to hear from veterans across my home State of Washington about care that is falling short. Despite structural changes at the VA, veterans are still waiting on surgeries and MRIs and oncology appointments, mental health screenings, you name it. Our veterans have already fought for our country. They should not have to fight to get their health care or the benefits they were promised, so we have to fight on their behalf. As the senior member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I am committed to making this country work better for our veterans. Even though there are challenges, there is hope. Just 2 weeks ago, we successfully passed the Homeless Veterans Services Protection Act out of the Senate to make sure a VA policy change doesn't cut off services and force veterans onto the street. That bill cleared one hurdle; now I call on my colleagues in the House to get this done. I am also fighting to end the VA's outdated ban on fertility services for veterans so they can start families. There is absolutely no reason to deny this service for members of our military, especially when they are injured while fighting for our country. And I believe we must extend the critically important military caregiver support services program to veterans of all eras--a program that enables injured veterans to recover and stay in their homes with their families instead of being in a hospital or a nursing home. Madam President, these aren't the only things I am working on. Because our veterans kept their end of the bargain, we have to keep ours. That means they should have access to mental health care to help deal with the often invisible wounds of war. That means a solid path to a college degree. That means job training programs and transitional services so that veterans have a path to good careers after their military service is complete. These things aren't about going above and beyond; they are the bare minimum of what our country should be doing to fulfill its promise to care for our veterans. [[Page S7875]] So as our country recommits to that promise this Veterans Day, I want to let veterans know in my home State of Washington and across the country that I will not stop fighting for them. I again want to express my heartfelt thanks to all the veterans around the country who have served and for all who are still serving today. I call on all of my colleagues and fellow citizens to honor our veterans every day of the year with the kind of action that shows them we are grateful for their service. Madam President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia. Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I want to thank Senator Kirk and Senator Tester for their outstanding work on this appropriations bill; Senator Murray for her cooperation and help on caregivers and so many programs in the committee; and Senator Collins and her work on MILCON. I want to encourage all my fellow Members of the Senate to vote favorably on this legislation when it comes before us later today. I want everyone to stop, take a deep breath, and think about three things: No. 1, today is the 240th anniversary of the United States Marine Corps--the strongest veterans we have, veterans who fought and died for us around the world for 2\1/2\ centuries. Tomorrow, at the eleventh hour, on the eleventh day of the eleventh month, we celebrate the armistice of World War I and Veterans Day in America. And today on the floor of the Senate, we are fixing some problems that have confronted our veterans for the better part of the last 10 years. As the Members of the committee who are on the floor know, the VA literally almost collapsed 2 years ago. Health services in Phoenix, AZ, were a disaster. People were cheating on appointments and shortening veteran times to make themselves look better. The VA had a reputation of being the worst agency in the Federal government. Now, I don't take credit for it as chairman, but I will tell you what your committee members have done--members like Senator Tester and Senator Murray. Instead of complaining about people, instead of putting targets on the wall and saying they are the problem, we decided to be part of the solution. I want to recite for just a second what has happened in the last 10 months. No. 1, we passed the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act, and this bill funds it. It will help to reduce the number of suicides. Today, 22 veterans per day commit suicide, and we want that reduced to a perfect score of zero at some point in time. But you do that only by investing funds, hiring psychiatrists, and making a commitment. This Senate and the House have done so. We had an overrun of $1.428 billion--more than I can count to--in the Denver hospital the VA was trying to build. They were 13 years into construction and not even half finished. This committee said that will not stand. We passed legislation to complete the funding by taking the money out of VA without additional appropriations from the Congress, and more importantly we got the VA out of the construction business. We said: You guys are supposed to take care of the health of our veterans, not---- The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority time has expired, Senator. Mr. ISAKSON. I ask unanimous consent to have 3 additional minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. TESTER. I just need about 1 minute, Johnny--sorry, the Senator from Georgia. You can have everything, but just give me 1 minute. Mr. ISAKSON. How much time remains? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Approximately 2\1/2\ minutes, Senator. Mr. ISAKSON. Well, let me just give you the closing, and I will leave all the juicy parts for later on. We will talk about those in the press release. The story that should be read about this appropriations bill is we are not letting our veterans down. We are uplifting our veterans, and we are seeing to it they get what they deserve. We are seeing to it that the problems we have seen illustrated in the papers of the United States of America are being fixed. The VA is a work in progress. There will still be problems but not because of attitude or lack of funding and not because of a lack of commitment by this Congress. We are going to do what our veterans did for us. We are going to stand ground, we are going to take the hill, we are going to hold the hill, and we are going to see to it that those who fought and died for the United States of America are rewarded, not only for themselves and for their health care but for their retirement benefits and for their loved ones as well. I commend Senator Tester on what he has done, Senator Kirk for what he has done, and all the members of the committee. I yield back the remainder of the time to the distinguished Senator from Montana, who can call me Johnny any time he wants to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana. Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Georgia. I appreciate his comments and very much thank him for the compliments. This MILCON-VA appropriations bill is a critically important bill. Why? Because we are demanding a lot from the VA. In order to demand a lot, we need to give them the tools and resources they need to be successful. It would be totally unfair to put them on the line without the resources they need to take care of our veterans. That is important because today we have unprecedented demand. Not only are our Vietnam veterans getting older, not only do they need services like never before, but we have been at war for 15 years in the Middle East, and we have folks coming back with complex injuries. We have men and women who need help when they get back. Some of these veterans would not have survived if they had been in any other war but this one. So the pressure on the VA is incredibly important, and if we are going to fix the access problem, if we are going to serve our veterans in the way they need to be served, we need to pass this bill. Let me finish with a quick story. Not long ago a guy by the name of Henry--a Vietnam vet from Helena, MT--walked into my office. Henry fought in Vietnam. He was awarded four Purple Hearts for his combat and for his sacrifice. Henry walked into my office, sat down across from my staff member, and said: I can't live any more. Henry was in trouble. He had behavioral health problems that he needed professional help to get fixed. We were able to get him to the VA. The VA had a behavioral health professional who was able to help Henry, and Henry is living a good life today. Our veterans deserve no less than to make sure they get the help they need when they need it, and that is what this bill is about. So we will be voting on a managers' package soon, and then we will be voting on passing this bill and getting it to the President's desk. Hopefully, we can do it with a strong, healthy vote--a unanimous vote, as a matter of fact--because this is an important bill not only for military construction but also for veterans. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7871-S7875] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 2029, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (H.R. 2029) making appropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes. Pending: Kirk/Tester amendment No. 2763, in the nature of a substitute. Kirk amendment No. 2764 (to amendment No. 2763), to clarify the term ``congressional defense committees.'' The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 11 a.m. will be equally divided in the usual form. The Senator from Utah. Unanimous Consent Request--S. REs. 312 Mr. LEE. Madam President, I rise today to support and to request the Senate's approval of this resolution, which would designate the second week of November as National Pregnancy [[Page S7872]] Center Week in honor of the lifesaving and life-affirming work of America's community-supported pregnancy centers. I am asking for my colleague's unanimous consent because there is absolutely nothing contentious about this resolution, S. Res. 312, nor is there anything contentious about the pregnancy resource centers commemorated by this resolution. There are approximately 2,500 pregnancy resource centers in America. Every single day they serve an average of 65,000 women and men faced with challenging pregnancy decisions, providing them with a wide array of resources. That includes, at many centers, health care services such as pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, and testing for STDs and STIs. It includes emotional and educational support such as options counseling and parenting classes. It includes material and logistical assistance to help new moms and dads deal with all the little things that easily add up to big obstacles in the first few weeks and months of parenthood. America's pregnancy resource centers aren't out to make a profit nor are they out there to push a particular political agenda. They are just there to help and to do so in a way that is compassionate, considerate of individual privacy, and respectful of the equal dignity of all human life. Any way you look at it, America's pregnancy resource centers deserve our recognition and they deserve our respect and our gratitude. The real measure of their significance isn't in the words of a floor speech in the Senate or the outcome of a vote, it is in the thousands of lives they help save from the pain of abortion every year and in the millions of teachers, soldiers, nurses, neighbors, friends, and spouses whose lives and contributions to our communities we might never have known had it not been for the unassuming heroes down at the local pregnancy center who give their time to keep the lights on, answer the phones, and help young women find the hope and the courage to choose life. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 312, submitted earlier today; that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I would ask the Senator to modify his request and offer a resolution that actually helps to move women's health and rights forward. Simply put, the resolution that the Senator has offered is more of the same. It is another effort to pander to the extreme Republican base by using women's health and constitutionally protected rights as a political football. Unfortunately, it makes it clear for the umpteenth time that when it comes to improving access to affordable health care for women, some Republicans are determined to stand in the way of progress. I expect that some of my Republican colleagues will say this resolution shows how much they care about women's health. The truth is it shows the opposite. It shows once again that the Republican Party wants to interfere in a woman's medical decision. Strengthening women's health care doesn't start with telling women what they should and should not do with their own bodies, but that is exactly what that resolution does. If my Republican colleagues really want to support women's reproductive care, they would work with Democrats on improving access to affordable birth control under the Affordable Care Act, including emergency contraceptives, ensuring women and families make their own decisions about their health care--not their bosses--and fighting back against efforts across the country to undermine women's constitutionally protected health care rights. It is time for Republicans to drop the political attacks on women's health and instead join Democrats to focus on these priorities and more like them, so that women--not politicians, not insurance companies, not CFOs or CEOs--are in control of their health care, as it should be. Unanimous Consent Request--S. Res. 37 That is why I ask the Senator to modify his request and instead ask unanimous consent that the HELP Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res. 37, and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator so modify his request? Mr. LEE. Madam President, reserving the right to object, there is nothing divisive about this resolution I have offered today, nothing divisive whatsoever. This simply seeks recognition of the great work that is performed by the men and women who staff these pregnancy centers. There is nothing about it that is a political football, nothing about it that is designed to drive a wedge. Unlike our resolution, the resolution I submitted today, S. Res. 312, which mainly commends community volunteers around the country for helping young mothers and their children--hardly divisive--the Senator's counterproposal is divisive and controversial. My cosponsors and I only wanted to recognize the life-affirming and lifesaving work, the kind of work that brings families and communities together the counterproposal would only pull Americans further apart and further away from the more humane and compassionate society that all Americans deserve. If calling for recognition of these brave and noble men and women who serve people at pregnancy centers around the country is divisive, we have significant problems, but the fact is, it is not. I would encourage anyone within the sound of my voice to read S. Res. 312, and they will discover it is not the least bit divisive and doesn't discuss anything that is the least bit controversial. On that basis, I can't agree with the modification, and I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the modification. Is there objection to the original request? Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I object to the original request. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Maryland. Armed Services Authorization Bill Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to speak as in morning business in terms of the bill we will be voting on at 11:20 a.m. today, the armed services authorization, as well as what we are going to be voting on this afternoon, which is veterans health care. They actually go hand in hand and what a great set of votes in a symmetry that shows our support for national security, our support for our U.S. military, our support for our U.S. military who are on Active Duty today, and then also for our veterans who in their hearts are always on Active Duty. Today we have the ability to actually show we can govern, we can pass bills on a bipartisan basis that will help our country be able to defend itself, show our support to the U.S. military, and honor our commitment to the veterans. I am looking forward to voting on the armed services authorization because it does give the tools we need to be able to defend ourselves. I commend Senators McCain and Jack Reed for their excellent work. Madam President, I wish to speak now as the vice chair of the Appropriations Committee. I am so excited that we are bringing the MILCON-VA bill to the Senate. I have been voting for veterans ever since I have come to Congress. Veterans are our Nation's heroes. They put their lives on the line to fight for our freedom. They have made tremendous sacrifices for our country. Whether it is veterans who are still alive from World War II, those who fought on Pork Chop Hill during the Korean war, the Vietnam war at Mekong Delta, and of course Desert Storm, Iraq, and Afghanistan, we owe our veterans a debt of gratitude. We want to show our gratitude not only with words and yellow ribbons but with deeds. I believe the best deed is to make sure we adequately fund the Veterans' Administration to end the backlog for disability benefits--if you fought on the frontlines, you shouldn't stand in line to get your disability benefits--and to robustly fund veterans [[Page S7873]] health care, along with other benefits this Congress has so authorized. We have accomplished a lot over the years working for our veterans, and we will have a lot to do with what is in our legislation. I wish to commend the subcommittee chair, Senator Mark Kirk, and our vice chair, Senator Jon Tester, for the work they have done. As we were working on our bill this summer and through the spring, veterans told me and they told them that the Senate funding was too spartan; that we were underfunding our veterans and not just by a few dollars but by $850 million. So we held it up, not as a parliamentary ping-pong, not as a parliamentary temper tantrum but as a way of saying our veterans need more money. As a result of the budget agreement, we are able to do this. We are on the floor today where an amendment will be offered by Senators Kirk and Tester to add $2 billion for veterans health care, $2 billion to be determined by the Secretary. What do we look forward to? Well, lifesaving drugs. One of course is this issue of being able to pay for hepatitis C; the other, while we are looking at actual hands-on medical care, we want to reduce the wait times. There is too much waiting at the Veterans' Administration, whether you are waiting for your disability claim or you are waiting to see your doctor or your mental health counselor or your ophthalmologist. We need to be able to reduce the wait times, and this is what part of this $2 billion will do. Then there are those who are not only chronically ill from the wounds of war but are chronically and devastatingly injured. So we looked at those who are unable to care for themselves but are being cared for at home by loved ones. This will add more funds to be able to help those caregivers who are stepping up for their responsibility. So they are taking family responsibility, but we have to take USA responsibility. That is what we fought for in the $2 billion. I urge my colleagues to move ahead and be able to vote for this bill. I do believe this legislation, by adding the money and the kind of excellent work that has been done by our authorizers, the insistence of good provisions being put into the bill--we are going to shrink that VA backlog. Also, we are going to do something else. We are going to advance funding for mandatory veterans' benefits. So no matter what government means, if we ever get into more shutdown, slamdown, slowdown politics due to us, the veterans' benefits will go forward. I have been working on this backlog for a long time. By the time we got to March 2013, we were at a national standoff. There were over 600,000 claims pending. In Maryland we had one of the worst claims offices in my own hometown of Baltimore. I couldn't believe it. When I met with my Veterans Advisory Board and stories poured out of the kinds of calls that were coming into my Constituent Services Offices, not only were they waiting in line--this isn't like just standing in line at the supermarket, this is for disability benefits, for people who are in danger of losing their homes and other kinds of things. So we went to work on a bipartisan basis. I am proud of what we did. I am proud of our authorizers. I see Senator Isakson from Georgia is on the floor. He was a big part of the reform effort. It shows our military knows how to win wars, but we need to know how we can govern so they don't have to fight a war with the VA bureaucracy. We hope we will be able to make these reforms. We are not going to throw money at it. We are going to insist on metrics. The last point I wish to talk about is the advance appropriations. People will say: Aren't VA benefits mandatory? They are unless we get into one of our parliamentary ping-pong debates. So I worked with the Disabled Veterans of America and a coalition of several voluntary veterans service organizations--great groups: the American Legion, Vietnam Veterans and Iraq and Iran Veterans of America. They asked me to add advance appropriations to the omnibus 1 year in advance--making sure we funded things 1 year in advance-- protecting them from shutdown and slamdown politics. We were able to do that again, and I hope we can do that again this year. I know I have other colleagues on the floor who wish to speak now, but I wish to say we can really show we not only know how to fight for America and its security, but we know how to fight for those who do the fighting. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise on the eve of Veterans Day to urge my colleagues to support the fiscal year 2016 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill. This marks the first time in 2 years that we have had the opportunity to debate, amend, and vote on this important legislation on the Senate floor. It is vital to those who serve and to those who have served our Nation. I first learned to honor our veterans from my father. My father is a World War II veteran who was wounded twice in the Battle of the Bulge and earned his Purple Heart and his Bronze Star. It was he who would take me to the parades on Veterans Day and on Memorial Day and boost me high on his shoulders. From the best vantage point in the parade, I would watch our veterans march by. He taught me of their sacrifice and that we have a never-ending obligation to thank those who wore the uniform of our country. Passing this bill fulfills important obligations that we owe to our Nation's 22 million veterans, 127,000 of whom live in the great State of Maine. It sends an important message to our veterans: We will honor the sacrifices that you made and are making on our behalf. It would be a mistake to send the opposite message by further postponing or delaying consideration and final passage of this important bill before we celebrate our veterans, honor, and remember them tomorrow. As a member of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee, I know this bill before us now is the result of bipartisan compromise. I commend the leadership of Chairman Kirk and Ranking Member Tester, who have worked hand in hand to craft the managers' amendment that they will be bringing before us today. In May of this year, the Appropriations Committee reported this funding bill by a strong vote of 21 to 9. Since then the Bipartisan Budget Act has been enacted, which provides needed additional resources to fund vital national priorities and that will be reflected in the managers' amendment. The managers' substitute would provide a total of $79.7 billion in funding, which I would note represents more than $1 billion more than the President's budget request. This bill increases funding for our veterans in areas where they need it most, including mental health care and benefit claims processing, two issues which the Senator from Maryland has been so active in resolving. This bill also includes funds aimed at reducing veterans homelessness. This is a special priority of mine as the chairman of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee. I worked with Senator Murray on this issue, and we have made real progress--exciting progress--in reducing the number of homeless veterans across this country through the VASH Program, but there is still more work to be done. In addition, this bill includes $270 million in funding for the Office of Rural Health, through which the Access Received Closer to Home or the ARCH Program is funded. In five pilot States in which it operates, ARCH ensures that rural veterans, who often have a very difficult time accessing the regular VA health care system--particularly the VA hospitals--can receive care closer to where they live and where their families live. I will never forget the story shared with me by a Maine veteran who broke his hip during a terrible snow storm and needed urgent care. The ARCH program, located at Cary Memorial Hospital in Caribou, ME, ensured he could receive the care he needed in his community and close to his family, rather than enduring a 4-hour drive over bumpy winter roads during a ferocious snow storm to the Togas VA Medical Center in Augusta, ME. ARCH has made a tremendous difference for our veterans and continues to help those who live in rural communities and who are facing similar challenges and emergencies. The managers' substitute also increases Veterans Affairs medical services by nearly $2 billion, including $10 [[Page S7874]] million for programs supporting caregivers. We all know of the wonderful work that Elizabeth Dole has done in this area, and I have been very pleased to join with my colleague Senator Patty Murray in introducing the Military and Veteran Caregiver Services Improvement Act. The bill before us is going to help provide benefits for those who shoulder the responsibilities associated with long-term care for critically injured veterans. This bill would expand comprehensive caregiver benefits for those who take on those responsibilities. I would note, Madam President, that the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Baldwin, and I have a broader bill dealing with caregivers that the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions is considering and I hope will be approving shortly. In addition to the vital funds for veterans programs, this bill also funds military construction projects, which unfortunately had been adversely affected--cut, delayed, deferred--as a result of the budget caps and the impact of sequestration. Therefore, I am particularly pleased this bill includes $7.2 million in funding needed to repair, renovate, and upgrade the 101st Air Refueling Wing's fire and crash rescue station in Bangor, ME. This is funding for which I have strongly advocated, and I thank the managers for including it the bill. The 101st ``MAINEiacs'' provide critical 24/7 air and ground refueling services that support local military operations, and this funding will strengthen their capabilities. I would note, Madam President, that I recently met with General Breedlove, our NATO commander, and he told me he refueled at Bangor, ME, on his way back from Europe recently. Madam President, I could go on and on about the important programs and priorities in this bill. They are essential to providing what we owe to our servicemembers and our veterans: safe and reliable infrastructure so that our troops can complete the missions they are assigned, access to medical care, earned compensation and benefits, and assistance to help our veterans successfully transition to their civilian lives. Tomorrow, on Veterans Day, our Nation will pause to honor all those who served. Today, we have the opportunity to say to the American people, to our veterans, and to those who are considering military service to our Nation that no matter what partisan issues may divide us, we stand united in fulfilling our commitment to those who serve and those who have served. We can send that message by passing this measure and sending to the President a funding bill that takes care of our servicemembers, our veterans and their families, and that honors their service to our great country. Madam President, I yield the floor. (At the request of Mr. McConnell, the following statement was ordered to be printed in the Record.) Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I wish to support the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. This bipartisan bill provides critical resources for our active military, veterans, and their families. The courage and sacrifice that define our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, coastguardsmen, and all servicemembers over the years cannot be understated. Major chapters in our Nation's rich history have been and continue to be written by our brave servicemen and women, many of whom hail from Louisiana. The very least we can do in return is keep our commitments to them. It is our obligation to fund veterans' health care and benefits, and this bill does just that while also making necessary reforms to the scandal-plagued Department of Veterans Affairs. Our Louisiana veterans have waited a long, long time to have efficient access to effective health care, and they deserve much better than what has been handed to them. That is why I have worked for years to authorize new VA clinics and build interim clinics in southwest Louisiana, including one in Lake Charles, LA, that is expected to open before the Thanksgiving holiday. The latest National Defense Authorization measure has been revised to reflect the recent budget deal, which modified the spending caps for both base and war defense spending. In light of these changes, I firmly believe the administration should honor past statements that current military reductions are due to defense budget cuts stemming from sequestration, which have now been postponed for 2 years. It is critically important to recognize that the newly revised 2-year budget deal provides necessary relief for the Department of Defense and allows a much-needed opportunity to avoid further cuts to the Active- Duty Army's troop strength. Since 2013, the U.S. Army alone has decreased troop strength 21 percent. That is both dangerous and unacceptable. I have fought against dangerously steep drawdowns and was proud to fight this issue on the Senate floor last year. The United States cannot afford continued troop cuts at a time when military leaders say that we are facing an unprecedented number of threats. I urge my colleagues to support our military and to support this bipartisan bill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for 5 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Veterans Day Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, this Veterans Day we pause to honor the men and women in our military who stepped up to fight for our freedom and to protect our families. In my home State of Washington, we have a lot to be thankful for. More than 600,000 of our friends, our neighbors, and our family members have bravely served their country. As the daughter of a World War II veteran, I know the sacrifice it takes to keep our country safe and protect our values. Thanks to my father and the countless other veterans I have had the honor of meeting, I believe that when brave individuals sign up to serve our country, we must fulfill our promise to support them when they come home. We should honor our veterans by showing them we have their backs long after the war is over. While I would like to stand here and say that our country is doing everything we can for the people we owe the most to and that we are fulfilling the promise we made to them when we sent them off to fight for us, I believe our work is far from over. Though Congress passed a sweeping bill last year to provide new resources and add more accountability to the VA, I continue to hear from veterans across my home State of Washington about care that is falling short. Despite structural changes at the VA, veterans are still waiting on surgeries and MRIs and oncology appointments, mental health screenings, you name it. Our veterans have already fought for our country. They should not have to fight to get their health care or the benefits they were promised, so we have to fight on their behalf. As the senior member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I am committed to making this country work better for our veterans. Even though there are challenges, there is hope. Just 2 weeks ago, we successfully passed the Homeless Veterans Services Protection Act out of the Senate to make sure a VA policy change doesn't cut off services and force veterans onto the street. That bill cleared one hurdle; now I call on my colleagues in the House to get this done. I am also fighting to end the VA's outdated ban on fertility services for veterans so they can start families. There is absolutely no reason to deny this service for members of our military, especially when they are injured while fighting for our country. And I believe we must extend the critically important military caregiver support services program to veterans of all eras--a program that enables injured veterans to recover and stay in their homes with their families instead of being in a hospital or a nursing home. Madam President, these aren't the only things I am working on. Because our veterans kept their end of the bargain, we have to keep ours. That means they should have access to mental health care to help deal with the often invisible wounds of war. That means a solid path to a college degree. That means job training programs and transitional services so that veterans have a path to good careers after their military service is complete. These things aren't about going above and beyond; they are the bare minimum of what our country should be doing to fulfill its promise to care for our veterans. [[Page S7875]] So as our country recommits to that promise this Veterans Day, I want to let veterans know in my home State of Washington and across the country that I will not stop fighting for them. I again want to express my heartfelt thanks to all the veterans around the country who have served and for all who are still serving today. I call on all of my colleagues and fellow citizens to honor our veterans every day of the year with the kind of action that shows them we are grateful for their service. Madam President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia. Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I want to thank Senator Kirk and Senator Tester for their outstanding work on this appropriations bill; Senator Murray for her cooperation and help on caregivers and so many programs in the committee; and Senator Collins and her work on MILCON. I want to encourage all my fellow Members of the Senate to vote favorably on this legislation when it comes before us later today. I want everyone to stop, take a deep breath, and think about three things: No. 1, today is the 240th anniversary of the United States Marine Corps--the strongest veterans we have, veterans who fought and died for us around the world for 2\1/2\ centuries. Tomorrow, at the eleventh hour, on the eleventh day of the eleventh month, we celebrate the armistice of World War I and Veterans Day in America. And today on the floor of the Senate, we are fixing some problems that have confronted our veterans for the better part of the last 10 years. As the Members of the committee who are on the floor know, the VA literally almost collapsed 2 years ago. Health services in Phoenix, AZ, were a disaster. People were cheating on appointments and shortening veteran times to make themselves look better. The VA had a reputation of being the worst agency in the Federal government. Now, I don't take credit for it as chairman, but I will tell you what your committee members have done--members like Senator Tester and Senator Murray. Instead of complaining about people, instead of putting targets on the wall and saying they are the problem, we decided to be part of the solution. I want to recite for just a second what has happened in the last 10 months. No. 1, we passed the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act, and this bill funds it. It will help to reduce the number of suicides. Today, 22 veterans per day commit suicide, and we want that reduced to a perfect score of zero at some point in time. But you do that only by investing funds, hiring psychiatrists, and making a commitment. This Senate and the House have done so. We had an overrun of $1.428 billion--more than I can count to--in the Denver hospital the VA was trying to build. They were 13 years into construction and not even half finished. This committee said that will not stand. We passed legislation to complete the funding by taking the money out of VA without additional appropriations from the Congress, and more importantly we got the VA out of the construction business. We said: You guys are supposed to take care of the health of our veterans, not---- The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority time has expired, Senator. Mr. ISAKSON. I ask unanimous consent to have 3 additional minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. TESTER. I just need about 1 minute, Johnny--sorry, the Senator from Georgia. You can have everything, but just give me 1 minute. Mr. ISAKSON. How much time remains? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Approximately 2\1/2\ minutes, Senator. Mr. ISAKSON. Well, let me just give you the closing, and I will leave all the juicy parts for later on. We will talk about those in the press release. The story that should be read about this appropriations bill is we are not letting our veterans down. We are uplifting our veterans, and we are seeing to it they get what they deserve. We are seeing to it that the problems we have seen illustrated in the papers of the United States of America are being fixed. The VA is a work in progress. There will still be problems but not because of attitude or lack of funding and not because of a lack of commitment by this Congress. We are going to do what our veterans did for us. We are going to stand ground, we are going to take the hill, we are going to hold the hill, and we are going to see to it that those who fought and died for the United States of America are rewarded, not only for themselves and for their health care but for their retirement benefits and for their loved ones as well. I commend Senator Tester on what he has done, Senator Kirk for what he has done, and all the members of the committee. I yield back the remainder of the time to the distinguished Senator from Montana, who can call me Johnny any time he wants to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana. Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Georgia. I appreciate his comments and very much thank him for the compliments. This MILCON-VA appropriations bill is a critically important bill. Why? Because we are demanding a lot from the VA. In order to demand a lot, we need to give them the tools and resources they need to be successful. It would be totally unfair to put them on the line without the resources they need to take care of our veterans. That is important because today we have unprecedented demand. Not only are our Vietnam veterans getting older, not only do they need services like never before, but we have been at war for 15 years in the Middle East, and we have folks coming back with complex injuries. We have men and women who need help when they get back. Some of these veterans would not have survived if they had been in any other war but this one. So the pressure on the VA is incredibly important, and if we are going to fix the access problem, if we are going to serve our veterans in the way they need to be served, we need to pass this bill. Let me finish with a quick story. Not long ago a guy by the name of Henry--a Vietnam vet from Helena, MT--walked into my office. Henry fought in Vietnam. He was awarded four Purple Hearts for his combat and for his sacrifice. Henry walked into my office, sat down across from my staff member, and said: I can't live any more. Henry was in trouble. He had behavioral health problems that he needed professional help to get fixed. We were able to get him to the VA. The VA had a behavioral health professional who was able to help Henry, and Henry is living a good life today. Our veterans deserve no less than to make sure they get the help they need when they need it, and that is what this bill is about. So we will be voting on a managers' package soon, and then we will be voting on passing this bill and getting it to the President's desk. Hopefully, we can do it with a strong, healthy vote--a unanimous vote, as a matter of fact--because this is an important bill not only for military construction but also for veterans. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7871-S7875] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 2029, which the clerk will report. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (H.R. 2029) making appropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes. Pending: Kirk/Tester amendment No. 2763, in the nature of a substitute. Kirk amendment No. 2764 (to amendment No. 2763), to clarify the term ``congressional defense committees.'' The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 11 a.m. will be equally divided in the usual form. The Senator from Utah. Unanimous Consent Request--S. REs. 312 Mr. LEE. Madam President, I rise today to support and to request the Senate's approval of this resolution, which would designate the second week of November as National Pregnancy [[Page S7872]] Center Week in honor of the lifesaving and life-affirming work of America's community-supported pregnancy centers. I am asking for my colleague's unanimous consent because there is absolutely nothing contentious about this resolution, S. Res. 312, nor is there anything contentious about the pregnancy resource centers commemorated by this resolution. There are approximately 2,500 pregnancy resource centers in America. Every single day they serve an average of 65,000 women and men faced with challenging pregnancy decisions, providing them with a wide array of resources. That includes, at many centers, health care services such as pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, and testing for STDs and STIs. It includes emotional and educational support such as options counseling and parenting classes. It includes material and logistical assistance to help new moms and dads deal with all the little things that easily add up to big obstacles in the first few weeks and months of parenthood. America's pregnancy resource centers aren't out to make a profit nor are they out there to push a particular political agenda. They are just there to help and to do so in a way that is compassionate, considerate of individual privacy, and respectful of the equal dignity of all human life. Any way you look at it, America's pregnancy resource centers deserve our recognition and they deserve our respect and our gratitude. The real measure of their significance isn't in the words of a floor speech in the Senate or the outcome of a vote, it is in the thousands of lives they help save from the pain of abortion every year and in the millions of teachers, soldiers, nurses, neighbors, friends, and spouses whose lives and contributions to our communities we might never have known had it not been for the unassuming heroes down at the local pregnancy center who give their time to keep the lights on, answer the phones, and help young women find the hope and the courage to choose life. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 312, submitted earlier today; that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I would ask the Senator to modify his request and offer a resolution that actually helps to move women's health and rights forward. Simply put, the resolution that the Senator has offered is more of the same. It is another effort to pander to the extreme Republican base by using women's health and constitutionally protected rights as a political football. Unfortunately, it makes it clear for the umpteenth time that when it comes to improving access to affordable health care for women, some Republicans are determined to stand in the way of progress. I expect that some of my Republican colleagues will say this resolution shows how much they care about women's health. The truth is it shows the opposite. It shows once again that the Republican Party wants to interfere in a woman's medical decision. Strengthening women's health care doesn't start with telling women what they should and should not do with their own bodies, but that is exactly what that resolution does. If my Republican colleagues really want to support women's reproductive care, they would work with Democrats on improving access to affordable birth control under the Affordable Care Act, including emergency contraceptives, ensuring women and families make their own decisions about their health care--not their bosses--and fighting back against efforts across the country to undermine women's constitutionally protected health care rights. It is time for Republicans to drop the political attacks on women's health and instead join Democrats to focus on these priorities and more like them, so that women--not politicians, not insurance companies, not CFOs or CEOs--are in control of their health care, as it should be. Unanimous Consent Request--S. Res. 37 That is why I ask the Senator to modify his request and instead ask unanimous consent that the HELP Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res. 37, and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator so modify his request? Mr. LEE. Madam President, reserving the right to object, there is nothing divisive about this resolution I have offered today, nothing divisive whatsoever. This simply seeks recognition of the great work that is performed by the men and women who staff these pregnancy centers. There is nothing about it that is a political football, nothing about it that is designed to drive a wedge. Unlike our resolution, the resolution I submitted today, S. Res. 312, which mainly commends community volunteers around the country for helping young mothers and their children--hardly divisive--the Senator's counterproposal is divisive and controversial. My cosponsors and I only wanted to recognize the life-affirming and lifesaving work, the kind of work that brings families and communities together the counterproposal would only pull Americans further apart and further away from the more humane and compassionate society that all Americans deserve. If calling for recognition of these brave and noble men and women who serve people at pregnancy centers around the country is divisive, we have significant problems, but the fact is, it is not. I would encourage anyone within the sound of my voice to read S. Res. 312, and they will discover it is not the least bit divisive and doesn't discuss anything that is the least bit controversial. On that basis, I can't agree with the modification, and I object. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the modification. Is there objection to the original request? Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I object to the original request. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from Maryland. Armed Services Authorization Bill Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to speak as in morning business in terms of the bill we will be voting on at 11:20 a.m. today, the armed services authorization, as well as what we are going to be voting on this afternoon, which is veterans health care. They actually go hand in hand and what a great set of votes in a symmetry that shows our support for national security, our support for our U.S. military, our support for our U.S. military who are on Active Duty today, and then also for our veterans who in their hearts are always on Active Duty. Today we have the ability to actually show we can govern, we can pass bills on a bipartisan basis that will help our country be able to defend itself, show our support to the U.S. military, and honor our commitment to the veterans. I am looking forward to voting on the armed services authorization because it does give the tools we need to be able to defend ourselves. I commend Senators McCain and Jack Reed for their excellent work. Madam President, I wish to speak now as the vice chair of the Appropriations Committee. I am so excited that we are bringing the MILCON-VA bill to the Senate. I have been voting for veterans ever since I have come to Congress. Veterans are our Nation's heroes. They put their lives on the line to fight for our freedom. They have made tremendous sacrifices for our country. Whether it is veterans who are still alive from World War II, those who fought on Pork Chop Hill during the Korean war, the Vietnam war at Mekong Delta, and of course Desert Storm, Iraq, and Afghanistan, we owe our veterans a debt of gratitude. We want to show our gratitude not only with words and yellow ribbons but with deeds. I believe the best deed is to make sure we adequately fund the Veterans' Administration to end the backlog for disability benefits--if you fought on the frontlines, you shouldn't stand in line to get your disability benefits--and to robustly fund veterans [[Page S7873]] health care, along with other benefits this Congress has so authorized. We have accomplished a lot over the years working for our veterans, and we will have a lot to do with what is in our legislation. I wish to commend the subcommittee chair, Senator Mark Kirk, and our vice chair, Senator Jon Tester, for the work they have done. As we were working on our bill this summer and through the spring, veterans told me and they told them that the Senate funding was too spartan; that we were underfunding our veterans and not just by a few dollars but by $850 million. So we held it up, not as a parliamentary ping-pong, not as a parliamentary temper tantrum but as a way of saying our veterans need more money. As a result of the budget agreement, we are able to do this. We are on the floor today where an amendment will be offered by Senators Kirk and Tester to add $2 billion for veterans health care, $2 billion to be determined by the Secretary. What do we look forward to? Well, lifesaving drugs. One of course is this issue of being able to pay for hepatitis C; the other, while we are looking at actual hands-on medical care, we want to reduce the wait times. There is too much waiting at the Veterans' Administration, whether you are waiting for your disability claim or you are waiting to see your doctor or your mental health counselor or your ophthalmologist. We need to be able to reduce the wait times, and this is what part of this $2 billion will do. Then there are those who are not only chronically ill from the wounds of war but are chronically and devastatingly injured. So we looked at those who are unable to care for themselves but are being cared for at home by loved ones. This will add more funds to be able to help those caregivers who are stepping up for their responsibility. So they are taking family responsibility, but we have to take USA responsibility. That is what we fought for in the $2 billion. I urge my colleagues to move ahead and be able to vote for this bill. I do believe this legislation, by adding the money and the kind of excellent work that has been done by our authorizers, the insistence of good provisions being put into the bill--we are going to shrink that VA backlog. Also, we are going to do something else. We are going to advance funding for mandatory veterans' benefits. So no matter what government means, if we ever get into more shutdown, slamdown, slowdown politics due to us, the veterans' benefits will go forward. I have been working on this backlog for a long time. By the time we got to March 2013, we were at a national standoff. There were over 600,000 claims pending. In Maryland we had one of the worst claims offices in my own hometown of Baltimore. I couldn't believe it. When I met with my Veterans Advisory Board and stories poured out of the kinds of calls that were coming into my Constituent Services Offices, not only were they waiting in line--this isn't like just standing in line at the supermarket, this is for disability benefits, for people who are in danger of losing their homes and other kinds of things. So we went to work on a bipartisan basis. I am proud of what we did. I am proud of our authorizers. I see Senator Isakson from Georgia is on the floor. He was a big part of the reform effort. It shows our military knows how to win wars, but we need to know how we can govern so they don't have to fight a war with the VA bureaucracy. We hope we will be able to make these reforms. We are not going to throw money at it. We are going to insist on metrics. The last point I wish to talk about is the advance appropriations. People will say: Aren't VA benefits mandatory? They are unless we get into one of our parliamentary ping-pong debates. So I worked with the Disabled Veterans of America and a coalition of several voluntary veterans service organizations--great groups: the American Legion, Vietnam Veterans and Iraq and Iran Veterans of America. They asked me to add advance appropriations to the omnibus 1 year in advance--making sure we funded things 1 year in advance-- protecting them from shutdown and slamdown politics. We were able to do that again, and I hope we can do that again this year. I know I have other colleagues on the floor who wish to speak now, but I wish to say we can really show we not only know how to fight for America and its security, but we know how to fight for those who do the fighting. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine. Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise on the eve of Veterans Day to urge my colleagues to support the fiscal year 2016 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill. This marks the first time in 2 years that we have had the opportunity to debate, amend, and vote on this important legislation on the Senate floor. It is vital to those who serve and to those who have served our Nation. I first learned to honor our veterans from my father. My father is a World War II veteran who was wounded twice in the Battle of the Bulge and earned his Purple Heart and his Bronze Star. It was he who would take me to the parades on Veterans Day and on Memorial Day and boost me high on his shoulders. From the best vantage point in the parade, I would watch our veterans march by. He taught me of their sacrifice and that we have a never-ending obligation to thank those who wore the uniform of our country. Passing this bill fulfills important obligations that we owe to our Nation's 22 million veterans, 127,000 of whom live in the great State of Maine. It sends an important message to our veterans: We will honor the sacrifices that you made and are making on our behalf. It would be a mistake to send the opposite message by further postponing or delaying consideration and final passage of this important bill before we celebrate our veterans, honor, and remember them tomorrow. As a member of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee, I know this bill before us now is the result of bipartisan compromise. I commend the leadership of Chairman Kirk and Ranking Member Tester, who have worked hand in hand to craft the managers' amendment that they will be bringing before us today. In May of this year, the Appropriations Committee reported this funding bill by a strong vote of 21 to 9. Since then the Bipartisan Budget Act has been enacted, which provides needed additional resources to fund vital national priorities and that will be reflected in the managers' amendment. The managers' substitute would provide a total of $79.7 billion in funding, which I would note represents more than $1 billion more than the President's budget request. This bill increases funding for our veterans in areas where they need it most, including mental health care and benefit claims processing, two issues which the Senator from Maryland has been so active in resolving. This bill also includes funds aimed at reducing veterans homelessness. This is a special priority of mine as the chairman of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee. I worked with Senator Murray on this issue, and we have made real progress--exciting progress--in reducing the number of homeless veterans across this country through the VASH Program, but there is still more work to be done. In addition, this bill includes $270 million in funding for the Office of Rural Health, through which the Access Received Closer to Home or the ARCH Program is funded. In five pilot States in which it operates, ARCH ensures that rural veterans, who often have a very difficult time accessing the regular VA health care system--particularly the VA hospitals--can receive care closer to where they live and where their families live. I will never forget the story shared with me by a Maine veteran who broke his hip during a terrible snow storm and needed urgent care. The ARCH program, located at Cary Memorial Hospital in Caribou, ME, ensured he could receive the care he needed in his community and close to his family, rather than enduring a 4-hour drive over bumpy winter roads during a ferocious snow storm to the Togas VA Medical Center in Augusta, ME. ARCH has made a tremendous difference for our veterans and continues to help those who live in rural communities and who are facing similar challenges and emergencies. The managers' substitute also increases Veterans Affairs medical services by nearly $2 billion, including $10 [[Page S7874]] million for programs supporting caregivers. We all know of the wonderful work that Elizabeth Dole has done in this area, and I have been very pleased to join with my colleague Senator Patty Murray in introducing the Military and Veteran Caregiver Services Improvement Act. The bill before us is going to help provide benefits for those who shoulder the responsibilities associated with long-term care for critically injured veterans. This bill would expand comprehensive caregiver benefits for those who take on those responsibilities. I would note, Madam President, that the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Baldwin, and I have a broader bill dealing with caregivers that the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions is considering and I hope will be approving shortly. In addition to the vital funds for veterans programs, this bill also funds military construction projects, which unfortunately had been adversely affected--cut, delayed, deferred--as a result of the budget caps and the impact of sequestration. Therefore, I am particularly pleased this bill includes $7.2 million in funding needed to repair, renovate, and upgrade the 101st Air Refueling Wing's fire and crash rescue station in Bangor, ME. This is funding for which I have strongly advocated, and I thank the managers for including it the bill. The 101st ``MAINEiacs'' provide critical 24/7 air and ground refueling services that support local military operations, and this funding will strengthen their capabilities. I would note, Madam President, that I recently met with General Breedlove, our NATO commander, and he told me he refueled at Bangor, ME, on his way back from Europe recently. Madam President, I could go on and on about the important programs and priorities in this bill. They are essential to providing what we owe to our servicemembers and our veterans: safe and reliable infrastructure so that our troops can complete the missions they are assigned, access to medical care, earned compensation and benefits, and assistance to help our veterans successfully transition to their civilian lives. Tomorrow, on Veterans Day, our Nation will pause to honor all those who served. Today, we have the opportunity to say to the American people, to our veterans, and to those who are considering military service to our Nation that no matter what partisan issues may divide us, we stand united in fulfilling our commitment to those who serve and those who have served. We can send that message by passing this measure and sending to the President a funding bill that takes care of our servicemembers, our veterans and their families, and that honors their service to our great country. Madam President, I yield the floor. (At the request of Mr. McConnell, the following statement was ordered to be printed in the Record.) Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I wish to support the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. This bipartisan bill provides critical resources for our active military, veterans, and their families. The courage and sacrifice that define our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, coastguardsmen, and all servicemembers over the years cannot be understated. Major chapters in our Nation's rich history have been and continue to be written by our brave servicemen and women, many of whom hail from Louisiana. The very least we can do in return is keep our commitments to them. It is our obligation to fund veterans' health care and benefits, and this bill does just that while also making necessary reforms to the scandal-plagued Department of Veterans Affairs. Our Louisiana veterans have waited a long, long time to have efficient access to effective health care, and they deserve much better than what has been handed to them. That is why I have worked for years to authorize new VA clinics and build interim clinics in southwest Louisiana, including one in Lake Charles, LA, that is expected to open before the Thanksgiving holiday. The latest National Defense Authorization measure has been revised to reflect the recent budget deal, which modified the spending caps for both base and war defense spending. In light of these changes, I firmly believe the administration should honor past statements that current military reductions are due to defense budget cuts stemming from sequestration, which have now been postponed for 2 years. It is critically important to recognize that the newly revised 2-year budget deal provides necessary relief for the Department of Defense and allows a much-needed opportunity to avoid further cuts to the Active- Duty Army's troop strength. Since 2013, the U.S. Army alone has decreased troop strength 21 percent. That is both dangerous and unacceptable. I have fought against dangerously steep drawdowns and was proud to fight this issue on the Senate floor last year. The United States cannot afford continued troop cuts at a time when military leaders say that we are facing an unprecedented number of threats. I urge my colleagues to support our military and to support this bipartisan bill. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington. Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for 5 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Veterans Day Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, this Veterans Day we pause to honor the men and women in our military who stepped up to fight for our freedom and to protect our families. In my home State of Washington, we have a lot to be thankful for. More than 600,000 of our friends, our neighbors, and our family members have bravely served their country. As the daughter of a World War II veteran, I know the sacrifice it takes to keep our country safe and protect our values. Thanks to my father and the countless other veterans I have had the honor of meeting, I believe that when brave individuals sign up to serve our country, we must fulfill our promise to support them when they come home. We should honor our veterans by showing them we have their backs long after the war is over. While I would like to stand here and say that our country is doing everything we can for the people we owe the most to and that we are fulfilling the promise we made to them when we sent them off to fight for us, I believe our work is far from over. Though Congress passed a sweeping bill last year to provide new resources and add more accountability to the VA, I continue to hear from veterans across my home State of Washington about care that is falling short. Despite structural changes at the VA, veterans are still waiting on surgeries and MRIs and oncology appointments, mental health screenings, you name it. Our veterans have already fought for our country. They should not have to fight to get their health care or the benefits they were promised, so we have to fight on their behalf. As the senior member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I am committed to making this country work better for our veterans. Even though there are challenges, there is hope. Just 2 weeks ago, we successfully passed the Homeless Veterans Services Protection Act out of the Senate to make sure a VA policy change doesn't cut off services and force veterans onto the street. That bill cleared one hurdle; now I call on my colleagues in the House to get this done. I am also fighting to end the VA's outdated ban on fertility services for veterans so they can start families. There is absolutely no reason to deny this service for members of our military, especially when they are injured while fighting for our country. And I believe we must extend the critically important military caregiver support services program to veterans of all eras--a program that enables injured veterans to recover and stay in their homes with their families instead of being in a hospital or a nursing home. Madam President, these aren't the only things I am working on. Because our veterans kept their end of the bargain, we have to keep ours. That means they should have access to mental health care to help deal with the often invisible wounds of war. That means a solid path to a college degree. That means job training programs and transitional services so that veterans have a path to good careers after their military service is complete. These things aren't about going above and beyond; they are the bare minimum of what our country should be doing to fulfill its promise to care for our veterans. [[Page S7875]] So as our country recommits to that promise this Veterans Day, I want to let veterans know in my home State of Washington and across the country that I will not stop fighting for them. I again want to express my heartfelt thanks to all the veterans around the country who have served and for all who are still serving today. I call on all of my colleagues and fellow citizens to honor our veterans every day of the year with the kind of action that shows them we are grateful for their service. Madam President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia. Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I want to thank Senator Kirk and Senator Tester for their outstanding work on this appropriations bill; Senator Murray for her cooperation and help on caregivers and so many programs in the committee; and Senator Collins and her work on MILCON. I want to encourage all my fellow Members of the Senate to vote favorably on this legislation when it comes before us later today. I want everyone to stop, take a deep breath, and think about three things: No. 1, today is the 240th anniversary of the United States Marine Corps--the strongest veterans we have, veterans who fought and died for us around the world for 2\1/2\ centuries. Tomorrow, at the eleventh hour, on the eleventh day of the eleventh month, we celebrate the armistice of World War I and Veterans Day in America. And today on the floor of the Senate, we are fixing some problems that have confronted our veterans for the better part of the last 10 years. As the Members of the committee who are on the floor know, the VA literally almost collapsed 2 years ago. Health services in Phoenix, AZ, were a disaster. People were cheating on appointments and shortening veteran times to make themselves look better. The VA had a reputation of being the worst agency in the Federal government. Now, I don't take credit for it as chairman, but I will tell you what your committee members have done--members like Senator Tester and Senator Murray. Instead of complaining about people, instead of putting targets on the wall and saying they are the problem, we decided to be part of the solution. I want to recite for just a second what has happened in the last 10 months. No. 1, we passed the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act, and this bill funds it. It will help to reduce the number of suicides. Today, 22 veterans per day commit suicide, and we want that reduced to a perfect score of zero at some point in time. But you do that only by investing funds, hiring psychiatrists, and making a commitment. This Senate and the House have done so. We had an overrun of $1.428 billion--more than I can count to--in the Denver hospital the VA was trying to build. They were 13 years into construction and not even half finished. This committee said that will not stand. We passed legislation to complete the funding by taking the money out of VA without additional appropriations from the Congress, and more importantly we got the VA out of the construction business. We said: You guys are supposed to take care of the health of our veterans, not---- The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority time has expired, Senator. Mr. ISAKSON. I ask unanimous consent to have 3 additional minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. TESTER. I just need about 1 minute, Johnny--sorry, the Senator from Georgia. You can have everything, but just give me 1 minute. Mr. ISAKSON. How much time remains? The PRESIDING OFFICER. Approximately 2\1/2\ minutes, Senator. Mr. ISAKSON. Well, let me just give you the closing, and I will leave all the juicy parts for later on. We will talk about those in the press release. The story that should be read about this appropriations bill is we are not letting our veterans down. We are uplifting our veterans, and we are seeing to it they get what they deserve. We are seeing to it that the problems we have seen illustrated in the papers of the United States of America are being fixed. The VA is a work in progress. There will still be problems but not because of attitude or lack of funding and not because of a lack of commitment by this Congress. We are going to do what our veterans did for us. We are going to stand ground, we are going to take the hill, we are going to hold the hill, and we are going to see to it that those who fought and died for the United States of America are rewarded, not only for themselves and for their health care but for their retirement benefits and for their loved ones as well. I commend Senator Tester on what he has done, Senator Kirk for what he has done, and all the members of the committee. I yield back the remainder of the time to the distinguished Senator from Montana, who can call me Johnny any time he wants to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana. Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Georgia. I appreciate his comments and very much thank him for the compliments. This MILCON-VA appropriations bill is a critically important bill. Why? Because we are demanding a lot from the VA. In order to demand a lot, we need to give them the tools and resources they need to be successful. It would be totally unfair to put them on the line without the resources they need to take care of our veterans. That is important because today we have unprecedented demand. Not only are our Vietnam veterans getting older, not only do they need services like never before, but we have been at war for 15 years in the Middle East, and we have folks coming back with complex injuries. We have men and women who need help when they get back. Some of these veterans would not have survived if they had been in any other war but this one. So the pressure on the VA is incredibly important, and if we are going to fix the access problem, if we are going to serve our veterans in the way they need to be served, we need to pass this bill. Let me finish with a quick story. Not long ago a guy by the name of Henry--a Vietnam vet from Helena, MT--walked into my office. Henry fought in Vietnam. He was awarded four Purple Hearts for his combat and for his sacrifice. Henry walked into my office, sat down across from my staff member, and said: I can't live any more. Henry was in trouble. He had behavioral health problems that he needed professional help to get fixed. We were able to get him to the VA. The VA had a behavioral health professional who was able to help Henry, and Henry is living a good life today. Our veterans deserve no less than to make sure they get the help they need when they need it, and that is what this bill is about. So we will be voting on a managers' package soon, and then we will be voting on passing this bill and getting it to the President's desk. Hopefully, we can do it with a strong, healthy vote--a unanimous vote, as a matter of fact--because this is an important bill not only for military construction but also for veterans. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",package_114_41.csv,33672,33672,33744,"[congressional record volume 161, number 167 (tuesday, november 10, 2015)] [senate] [pages s7871-s7875]

with all the little things that easily add up to big obstacles in the first few weeks and months of parenthood. america's pregnancy resource centers aren't out to make a profit nor are they out there to push a particular political agenda. they are just there to help and to do so in a way that is compassionate, considerate of individual privacy, and respectful of the equal dignity of all human life. any way you look at it, america's pregnancy resource centers deserve our recognition and they deserve our respect and our gratitude. the real measure of their significance isn't in the words of a floor speech in the senate or the outcome of a vote, it is in the thousands of lives they help save from the pain of abortion every year and in the millions of teachers, soldiers, nurses, neighbors, friends, and spouses whose lives and contributions to our communities we might never have known had it not been for the unassuming heroes down at the local pregnancy center who give their time to keep the lights on, answer the phones, and help young women find the hope and the courage to choose life. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the senate proceed to the immediate consideration of s. res. 312, submitted earlier today; that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate. the presiding officer. is there objection? the senator from washington. mrs. murray. madam president, reserving the right to object, i would ask the senator to modify his request and offer a resolution that actually helps to move women's health and rights forward. simply put, the resolution that the senator has offered is more of the same. it is another effort to pander to the extreme republican base by using women's health and constitutionally protected rights as a political football. unfortunately, it makes it clear for the umpteenth time that when it comes to improving access to affordable health care for women, some republicans are determined to stand in the way of progress. i expect that some of my republican colleagues will say this resolution shows how much they care about women's health. the truth is it shows the opposite. it shows once again that the republican party wants to interfere in a woman's medical decision. strengthening women's health care doesn't start with telling women what they should and should not do with their own bodies, but that is exactly what that resolution does. if my republican colleagues really want to support women's reproductive care, they would work with democrats on improving access to affordable birth control under the affordable care act, including emergency contraceptives, ensuring women and families make their own decisions about their health care--not their bosses--and fighting back against efforts across the country to undermine women's constitutionally protected health care rights. it is time for republicans to drop the political attacks on women's health and instead join democrats to focus on these priorities and more like them, so that women--not politicians, not insurance companies, not cfos or ceos--are in control of their health care, as it should be. unanimous consent request--s. res. 37 that is why i ask the senator to modify his request and instead ask unanimous consent that the help committee be discharged from further consideration of s. res. 37, and the senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate. the presiding officer. will the senator so modify his request? mr. lee. madam president, reserving the right to object, there is nothing divisive about this resolution i have offered today, nothing divisive whatsoever. this simply seeks recognition of the great work that is performed by the men and women who staff these pregnancy centers. there is nothing about it that is a political football, nothing about it that is designed to drive a wedge. unlike our resolution, the resolution i submitted today, s. res. 312, which mainly commends community volunteers around the country for helping young mothers and their children--hardly divisive--the senator's counterproposal is divisive and controversial. my cosponsors and i only wanted to recognize the life-affirming and lifesaving work, the kind of work that brings families and communities together the counterproposal would only pull americans further apart and further away from the more humane and compassionate society that all americans deserve. if calling for recognition of these brave and noble men and women who serve people at pregnancy centers around the country is divisive, we have significant problems, but the fact is, it is not. i would encourage anyone within the sound of my voice to read s. res. 312, and they will discover it is not the least bit divisive and doesn't discuss anything that is the least bit controversial. on that basis, i can't agree with the modification, and i object. the presiding officer. objection is heard to the modification. is there objection to the original request? mrs. murray. madam president, i object to the original request. the presiding officer. objection is heard. the senator from maryland. armed services authorization bill ms. mikulski. madam president, i rise to speak as in morning business in terms of the bill we will be voting on at 11:20 a.m. today, the armed services authorization, as well as what we are going to be voting on this afternoon, which is veterans health care. they actually go hand in hand and what a great set of votes in a symmetry that shows our support for national security, our support for our u.s. military, our support for our u.s. military who are on active duty today, and then also for our veterans who in their hearts are always on active duty. today we have the ability to actually show we can govern, we can pass bills on a bipartisan basis that will help our country be able to defend itself, show our support to the u.s. military, and honor our commitment to the veterans. i am looking forward to voting on the armed services authorization because it does give the tools we need to be able to defend ourselves. i commend senators mccain and jack reed for their excellent work. madam president, i wish to speak now as the vice chair of the appropriations committee. i am so excited that we are bringing the milcon-va bill to the senate. i have been voting for veterans ever since i have come to congress. veterans are our nation's heroes. they put their lives on the line to fight for our freedom. they have made tremendous sacrifices for our country. whether it is veterans who are still alive from world war ii, those who fought on pork chop hill during the korean war, the vietnam war at mekong delta, and of course desert storm, iraq, and afghanistan, we owe our veterans a debt of gratitude. we want to show our gratitude not only with words and yellow ribbons but with deeds. i believe the best deed is to make sure we adequately fund the veterans' administration to end the backlog for disability benefits--if you fought on the frontlines, you shouldn't stand in line to get your disability benefits--and to robustly fund veterans [[page s7873]] health care, along with other benefits this congress has so authorized. we have accomplished a lot over the years working for our veterans, and we will have a lot to do with what is in our legislation. i wish to commend the subcommittee chair, senator mark kirk, and our vice chair, senator jon tester, for the work they have done. as we were working on our bill this summer and through the spring, veterans told me and they told them that the senate funding was too spartan; that we were underfunding our veterans and not just by a few dollars but by $850 million. so we held it up, not as a parliamentary ping-pong, not as a parliamentary temper tantrum but as a way of saying our veterans need more money. as a result of the budget agreement, we are able to do this. we are on the floor today where an amendment will be offered by senators kirk and tester to add $2 billion for veterans health care, $2 billion to be determined by the secretary. what do we look forward to? well, lifesaving drugs. one of course is this issue of being able to pay for hepatitis c; the other, while we are looking at actual hands-on medical care, we want to reduce the wait times. there is too much waiting at the veterans' administration, whether you are waiting for your disability claim or you are waiting to see your doctor or your mental health counselor or your ophthalmologist. we need to be able to reduce the wait times, and this is what part of this $2 billion will do. then there are those who are not only chronically ill from the wounds of war but are chronically and devastatingly injured. so we looked at those who are unable to care for themselves but are being cared for at home by loved ones. this will add more funds to be able to help those caregivers who are stepping up for their responsibility. so they are taking family responsibility, but we have to take usa responsibility. that is what we fought for in the $2 billion. i urge my colleagues to move ahead and be able to vote for this bill. i do believe this legislation, by adding the money and the kind of excellent work that has been done by our authorizers, the insistence of good provisions being put into the bill--we are going to shrink that va backlog. also, we are going to do something else. we are going to advance funding for mandatory veterans' benefits. so no matter what government means, if we ever get into more shutdown, slamdown, slowdown politics due to us, the veterans' benefits will go forward. i have been working on this backlog for a long time. by the time we got to march 2013, we were at a national standoff. there were over 600,000 claims pending. in maryland we had one of the worst claims offices in my own hometown of baltimore. i couldn't believe it. when i met with my veterans advisory board and stories poured out of the kinds of calls that were coming into my constituent services offices, not only were they waiting in line--this isn't like just standing in line at the supermarket, this is for disability benefits, for people who are in danger of losing their homes and other kinds of things. so we went to work on a bipartisan basis. i am proud of what we did. i am proud of our authorizers. i see senator isakson from georgia is on the floor. he was a big part of the reform effort. it shows our military knows how to win wars, but we need to know how we can govern so they don't have to fight a war with the va bureaucracy. we hope we will be able to make these reforms. we are not going to throw money at it. we are going to insist on metrics. the last point i wish to talk about is the advance appropriations. people will say: aren't va benefits mandatory? they are unless we get into one of our parliamentary ping-pong debates. so i worked with the disabled veterans of america and a coalition of several voluntary veterans service organizations--great groups: the american legion, vietnam veterans and iraq and iran veterans of america. they asked me to add advance appropriations to the omnibus 1 year in advance--making sure we funded things 1 year in advance-- protecting them from shutdown and slamdown politics. we were able to do that again, and i hope we can do that again this year. i know i have other colleagues on the floor who wish to speak now, but i wish to say we can really show we not only know how to fight for america and its security, but we know how to fight for those who do the fighting. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from maine. ms. collins. madam president, i rise on the eve of veterans day to urge my colleagues to support the fiscal year 2016 military construction and veterans affairs appropriations bill. this marks the first time in 2 years that we have had the opportunity to debate, amend, and vote on this important legislation on the senate floor. it is vital to those who serve and to those who have served our nation. i first learned to honor our veterans from my father. my father is a world war ii veteran who was wounded twice in the battle of the bulge and earned his purple heart and his bronze star. it was he who would take me to the parades on veterans day and on memorial day and boost me high on his shoulders. from the best vantage point in the parade, i would watch our veterans march by. he taught me of their sacrifice and that we have a never-ending obligation to thank those who wore the uniform of our country. passing this bill fulfills important obligations that we owe to our nation's 22 million veterans, 127,000 of whom live in the great state of maine. it sends an important message to our veterans: we will honor the sacrifices that you made and are making on our behalf. it would be a mistake to send the opposite message by further postponing or delaying consideration and final passage of this important bill before we celebrate our veterans, honor, and remember them tomorrow. as a member of the military construction and veterans affairs subcommittee, i know this bill before us now is the result of bipartisan compromise. i commend the leadership of chairman kirk and ranking member tester, who have worked hand in hand to craft the managers' amendment that they will be bringing before us today. in may of this year, the appropriations committee reported this funding bill by a strong vote of 21 to 9. since then the bipartisan budget act has been enacted, which provides needed additional resources to fund vital national priorities and that will be reflected in the managers' amendment. the managers' substitute would provide a total of $79.7 billion in funding, which i would note represents more than $1 billion more than the president's budget request. this bill increases funding for our veterans in areas where they need it most, including mental health care and benefit claims processing, two issues which the senator from maryland has been so active in resolving. this bill also includes funds aimed at reducing veterans homelessness. this is a special priority of mine as the chairman of the transportation, housing and urban development appropriations subcommittee. i worked with senator murray on this issue, and we have made real progress--exciting progress--in reducing the number of homeless veterans across this country through the vash program, but there is still more work to be done. in addition, this bill includes $270 million in funding for the office of rural health, through which the access received closer to home or the arch program is funded. in five pilot states in which it operates, arch ensures that rural veterans, who often have a very difficult time accessing the regular va health care system--particularly the va hospitals--can receive care closer to where they live and where their families live. i will never forget the story shared with me by a maine veteran who broke his hip during a terrible snow storm and needed urgent care. the arch program, located at cary memorial hospital in caribou, me, ensured he could receive the care he needed in his community and close to his family, rather than enduring a 4-hour drive over bumpy winter roads during a ferocious snow storm to the togas va medical center in augusta, me. arch has made a tremendous difference for our veterans and continues to help those who live in rural communities and who are facing similar challenges and emergencies. the managers' substitute also increases veterans affairs medical services by nearly $2 billion, including $10 [[page s7874]] million for programs supporting caregivers. we all know of the wonderful work that elizabeth dole has done in this area, and i have been very pleased to join with my colleague senator patty murray in introducing the military and veteran caregiver services improvement act. the bill before us is going to help provide benefits for those who shoulder the responsibilities associated with long-term care for critically injured veterans. this bill would expand comprehensive caregiver benefits for those who take on those responsibilities. i would note, madam president, that the senator from wisconsin, senator baldwin, and i have a broader bill dealing with caregivers that the committee on health, education, labor and pensions is considering and i hope will be approving shortly. in addition to the vital funds for veterans programs, this bill also funds military construction projects, which unfortunately had been adversely affected--cut, delayed, deferred--as a result of the budget caps and the impact of sequestration. therefore, i am particularly pleased this bill includes $7.2 million in funding needed to repair, renovate, and upgrade the 101st air refueling wing's fire and crash rescue station in bangor, me. this is funding for which i have strongly advocated, and i thank the managers for including it the bill. the 101st ``maineiacs'' provide critical 24/7 air and ground refueling services that support local military operations, and this funding will strengthen their capabilities. i would note, madam president, that i recently met with general breedlove, our nato commander, and he told me he refueled at bangor, me, on his way back from europe recently. madam president, i could go on and on about the important programs and priorities in this bill. they are essential to providing what we owe to our servicemembers and our veterans: safe and reliable infrastructure so that our troops can complete the missions they are assigned, access to medical care, earned compensation and benefits, and assistance to help our veterans successfully transition to their civilian lives. tomorrow, on veterans day, our nation will pause to honor all those who served. today, we have the opportunity to say to the american people, to our veterans, and to those who are considering military service to our nation that no matter what partisan issues may divide us, we stand united in fulfilling our commitment to those who serve and those who have served. we can send that message by passing this measure and sending to the president a funding bill that takes care of our servicemembers, our veterans and their families, and that honors their service to our great country. madam president, i yield the floor. (at the request of mr. mcconnell, the following statement was ordered to be printed in the record.) mr. vitter. madam president, i wish to support the military construction and veterans affairs and related agencies appropriations act. this bipartisan bill provides critical resources for our active military, veterans, and their families. the courage and sacrifice that define our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, coastguardsmen, and all servicemembers over the years cannot be understated. major chapters in our nation's rich history have been and continue to be written by our brave servicemen and women, many of whom hail from louisiana. the very least we can do in return is keep our commitments to them. it is our obligation to fund veterans' health care and benefits, and this bill does just that while also making necessary reforms to the scandal-plagued department of veterans affairs. our louisiana veterans have waited a long, long time to have efficient access to effective health care, and they deserve much better than what has been handed to them. that is why i have worked for years to authorize new va clinics and build interim clinics in southwest louisiana, including one in lake charles, la, that is expected to open before the thanksgiving holiday. the latest national defense authorization measure has been revised to reflect the recent budget deal, which modified the spending caps for both base and war defense spending. in light of these changes, i firmly believe the administration should honor past statements that current military reductions are due to defense budget cuts stemming from sequestration, which have now been postponed for 2 years. it is critically important to recognize that the newly revised 2-year budget deal provides necessary relief for the department of defense and allows a much-needed opportunity to avoid further cuts to the active- duty army's troop strength. since 2013, the u.s. army alone has decreased troop strength 21 percent. that is both dangerous and unacceptable. i have fought against dangerously steep drawdowns and was proud to fight this issue on the senate floor last year. the united states cannot afford continued troop cuts at a time when military leaders say that we are facing an unprecedented number of threats. i urge my colleagues to support our military and to support this bipartisan bill. the presiding officer. the senator from washington. mrs. murray. madam president, i ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for 5 minutes. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. veterans day mrs. murray. madam president, this veterans day we pause to honor the men and women in our military who stepped up to fight for our freedom and to protect our families. in my home state of washington, we have a lot to be thankful for. more than 600,000 of our friends, our neighbors, and our family members have bravely served their country. as the daughter of a world war ii veteran, i know the sacrifice it takes to keep our country safe and protect our values. thanks to my father and the countless other veterans i have had the honor of meeting, i believe that when brave individuals sign up to serve our country, we must fulfill our promise to support them when they come home. we should honor our veterans by showing them we have their backs long after the war is over. while i would like to stand here and say that our country is doing everything we can for the people we owe the most to and that we are fulfilling the promise we made to them when we sent them off to fight for us, i believe our work is far from over. though congress passed a sweeping bill last year to provide new resources and add more accountability to the va, i continue to hear from veterans across my home state of washington about care that is falling short. despite structural changes at the va, veterans are still waiting on surgeries and mris and oncology appointments, mental health screenings, you name it. our veterans have already fought for our country. they should not have to fight to get their health care or the benefits they were promised, so we have to fight on their behalf. as the senior member of the senate veterans' affairs committee, i am committed to making this country work better for our veterans. even though there are challenges, there is hope. just 2 weeks ago, we successfully passed the homeless veterans services protection act out of the senate to make sure a va policy change doesn't cut off services and force veterans onto the street. that bill cleared one hurdle; now i call on my colleagues in the house to get this done. i am also fighting to end the va's outdated ban on fertility services for veterans so they can start families. there is absolutely no reason to deny this service for members of our military, especially when they are injured while fighting for our country. and i believe we must extend the critically important military caregiver support services program to veterans of all eras--a program that enables injured veterans to recover and stay in their homes with their families instead of being in a hospital or a nursing home. madam president, these aren't the only things i am working on. because our veterans kept their end of the bargain, we have to keep ours. that means they should have access to mental health care to help deal with the often invisible wounds of war. that means a solid path to a college degree. that means job training programs and transitional services so that veterans have a path to good careers after their military service is complete. these things aren't about going above and beyond; they are the bare minimum of what our country should be doing to fulfill its promise to care for our veterans. [[page s7875]] so as our country recommits to that promise this veterans day, i want to let veterans know in my home state of washington and across the country that i will not stop fighting for them. i again want to express my heartfelt thanks to all the veterans around the country who have served and for all who are still serving today. i call on all of my colleagues and fellow citizens to honor our veterans every day of the year with the kind of action that shows them we are grateful for their service. madam president, i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from georgia. mr. isakson. madam president, i want to thank senator kirk and senator tester for their outstanding work on this appropriations bill; senator murray for her cooperation and help on caregivers and so many programs in the committee; and senator collins and her work on milcon. i want to encourage all my fellow members of the senate to vote favorably on this legislation when it comes before us later today. i want everyone to stop, take a deep breath, and think about three things: no. 1, today is the 240th anniversary of the united states marine corps--the strongest veterans we have, veterans who fought and died for us around the world for 2\1/2\ centuries. tomorrow, at the eleventh hour, on the eleventh day of the eleventh month, we celebrate the armistice of world war i and veterans day in america. and today on the floor of the senate, we are fixing some problems that have confronted our veterans for the better part of the last 10 years. as the members of the committee who are on the floor know, the va literally almost collapsed 2 years ago. health services in phoenix, az, were a disaster. people were cheating on appointments and shortening veteran times to make themselves look better. the va had a reputation of being the worst agency in the federal government. now, i don't take credit for it as chairman, but i will tell you what your committee members have done--members like senator tester and senator murray. instead of complaining about people, instead of putting targets on the wall and saying they are the problem, we decided to be part of the solution. i want to recite for just a second what has happened in the last 10 months. no. 1, we passed the clay hunt suicide prevention for american veterans act, and this bill funds it. it will help to reduce the number of suicides. today, 22 veterans per day commit suicide, and we want that reduced to a perfect score of zero at some point in time. but you do that only by investing funds, hiring psychiatrists, and making a commitment. this senate and the house have done so. we had an overrun of $1.428 billion--more than i can count to--in the denver hospital the va was trying to build. they were 13 years into construction and not even half finished. this committee said that will not stand. we passed legislation to complete the funding by taking the money out of va without additional appropriations from the congress, and more importantly we got the va out of the construction business. we said: you guys are supposed to take care of the health of our veterans, not---- the presiding officer. the majority time has expired, senator. mr. isakson. i ask unanimous consent to have 3 additional minutes. the presiding officer. is there objection? mr. tester. i just need about 1 minute, johnny--sorry, the senator from georgia. you can have everything, but just give me 1 minute. mr. isakson. how much time remains? the presiding officer. approximately 2\1/2\ minutes, senator. mr. isakson. well, let me just give you the closing, and i will leave all the juicy parts for later on. we will talk about those in the press release. the story that should be read about this appropriations bill is we are not letting our veterans down. we are uplifting our veterans, and we are seeing to it they get what they deserve. we are seeing to it that the problems we have seen illustrated in the papers of the united states of america are being fixed. the va is a work in progress. there will still be problems but not because of attitude or lack of funding and not because of a lack of commitment by this congress. we are going to do what our veterans did for us. we are going to stand ground, we are going to take the hill, we are going to hold the hill, and we are going to see to it that those who fought and died for the united states of america are rewarded, not only for themselves and for their health care but for their retirement benefits and for their loved ones as well. i commend senator tester on what he has done, senator kirk for what he has done, and all the members of the committee. i yield back the remainder of the time to the distinguished senator from montana, who can call me johnny any time he wants to. the presiding officer. the senator from montana. mr. tester. madam president, i thank the senator from georgia. i appreciate his comments and very much thank him for the compliments. this milcon-va appropriations bill is a critically important bill. why? because we are demanding a lot from the va. in order to demand a lot, we need to give them the tools and resources they need to be successful. it would be totally unfair to put them on the line without the resources they need to take care of our veterans. that is important because today we have unprecedented demand. not only are our vietnam veterans getting older, not only do they need services like never before, but we have been at war for 15 years in the middle east, and we have folks coming back with complex injuries. we have men and women who need help when they get back. some of these veterans would not have survived if they had been in any other war but this one. so the pressure on the va is incredibly important, and if we are going to fix the access problem, if we are going to serve our veterans in the way they need to be served, we need to pass this bill. let me finish with a quick story. not long ago a guy by the name of henry--a vietnam vet from helena, mt--walked into my office. henry fought in vietnam. he was awarded four purple hearts for his combat and for his sacrifice. henry walked into my office, sat down across from my staff member, and said: i can't live any more. henry was in trouble. he had behavioral health problems that he needed professional help to get fixed. we were able to get him to the va. the va had a behavioral health professional who was able to help henry, and henry is living a good life today. our veterans deserve no less than to make sure they get the help they need when they need it, and that is what this bill is about. so we will be voting on a managers' package soon, and then we will be voting on passing this bill and getting it to the president's desk. hopefully, we can do it with a strong, healthy vote--a unanimous vote, as a matter of fact--because this is an important bill not only for military construction but also for veterans. i yield the floor. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mr. mccain. madam president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________",33672
CREC-2015-11-10-pt1-PgS7871-3,CREC-2015-11-10,114,VETERANS DAY,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S7871] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VETERANS DAY Mr. REID. Madam President, I share the Republican leader's hope that we can conclude the Military Construction-VA bill later this morning. I commend the managers of that legislation for doing a good job. There is no Senator I admire more than Jon Tester from Montana, and he has been ably leading the direction of this bill. I join with the Republican leader as we honor our veterans tomorrow on Veterans Day. Madam President, I just want to take a brief minute to talk about a veteran, whom I look to with admiration. Today the chaplain gave a prayer saying that he prayed for veterans who have already left us and those veterans who are still alive. My town is Searchlight, NV, a little tiny town with not a lot of people in it. It has been that way for a long time. For a brief period Searchlight was bigger than Las Vegas. It had 3,000 people there. During World War II a young man who was already married and had children went to a movie with his wife in Las Vegas. He came out of the movies and told his wife: I think I have to join. He didn't have to, but he felt he had to. So this young man joined the U.S. Army Air Corps, which is now the U.S. Air Force. It was a huge sacrifice for him and his family. He traveled with his wife and children to Georgia where he did his training and then went to the European theater as a pilot. He served gallantly, bombing, strafing, and all the other things you did in the air in World War II. He had been through 68 different missions. He was through. But as happens sometimes in life, things develop that change your life. He volunteered for one more flight because one of the other pilots was unable to go. On his 69th flight, somewhere over Belgium, Bill Nellis, the boy from Searchlight, was shot down. He is still there. That is where his grave is. I know his family. I know his son Gary and his Aunt Thelma, whom I knew in Searchlight. This good man was so gallant in the eyes of people from Nevada that a previous congressional delegation, in conjunction with the President of the United States, decided it would be appropriate to name the Las Vegas Gunnery School, as it was called at that time, Nellis Air Force Base. Today Nellis Air Force Base, named after this man from Searchlight, is the finest Air Force fighter training facility in the world. Thousands and thousands of people serve there. It was originally on the outskirts of Las Vegas. Now it is in Las Vegas in a very populated area. No one complains about it. We are so proud of that Air Force base. It is a huge facility that has the finest gunnery range for Air Force pilots in the world. We have exercises there every year where pilots from all over the world bring their own aircraft from Australia, Great Britain, and other places to train there. We in Nevada are very proud of Nellis Air Force Base, as is the entire military complex in the United States. It is a wonderful facility. Tomorrow is the day we honor Bill Nellis and the other gallant people who have served and are serving in the U.S. military. Would the Chair announce the business this morning. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S7871] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VETERANS DAY Mr. REID.

This good man was so gallant in the eyes of people from Nevada that a previous congressional delegation, in conjunction with the President of the United States, decided it would be appropriate to name the Las Vegas Gunnery School, as it was called at that time, Nellis Air Force Base. Today Nellis Air Force Base, named after this man from Searchlight, is the finest Air Force fighter training facility in the world. Thousands and thousands of people serve there. It was originally on the outskirts of Las Vegas. Now it is in Las Vegas in a very populated area. No one complains about it. We are so proud of that Air Force base. It is a huge facility that has the finest gunnery range for Air Force pilots in the world. We have exercises there every year where pilots from all over the world bring their own aircraft from Australia, Great Britain, and other places to train there. We in Nevada are very proud of Nellis Air Force Base, as is the entire military complex in the United States. It is a wonderful facility. Tomorrow is the day we honor Bill Nellis and the other gallant people who have served and are serving in the U.S. military.

Madam President, I share the Republican leader's hope that we can conclude the Military Construction-VA bill later this morning. I commend the managers of that legislation for doing a good job. There is no Senator I admire more than Jon Tester from Montana, and he has been ably leading the direction of this bill. I join with the Republican leader as we honor our veterans tomorrow on Veterans Day. Madam President, I just want to take a brief minute to talk about a veteran, whom I look to with admiration. Today the chaplain gave a prayer saying that he prayed for veterans who have already left us and those veterans who are still alive. My town is Searchlight, NV, a little tiny town with not a lot of people in it. It has been that way for a long time. For a brief period Searchlight was bigger than Las Vegas. It had 3,000 people there. During World War II a young man who was already married and had children went to a movie with his wife in Las Vegas. He came out of the movies and told his wife: I think I have to join. He didn't have to, but he felt he had to. So this young man joined the U.S. Army Air Corps, which is now the U.S. Air Force. It was a huge sacrifice for him and his family. He traveled with his wife and children to Georgia where he did his training and then went to the European theater as a pilot. He served gallantly, bombing, strafing, and all the other things you did in the air in World War II. He had been through 68 different missions. He was through. But as happens sometimes in life, things develop that change your life. He volunteered for one more flight because one of the other pilots was unable to go. On his 69th flight, somewhere over Belgium, Bill Nellis, the boy from Searchlight, was shot down. He is still there. That is where his grave is. I know his family. I know his son Gary and his Aunt Thelma, whom I knew in Searchlight.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 20 minutes equally divided prior to a vote on the motion to concur in the House amendment to S. 1356. The Senator from Arizona. Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, today the Senate will once again consider the National Defense Authorization Act. This legislation passed the House last week in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 370 to 58. I hope we will have a similarly resounding vote here today. Today's vote would not be possible without the hard work of Chairman Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. It has been a privilege to work alongside him and the gentleman from Washington, Congressman Smith, to produce a defense authorization bill worthy of the troops it supports. I thank my friend and colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, for his dedicated work on this legislation and his many substantive contributions that made this a better bill. I thank the majority leader, Senator McConnell, for bringing this legislation to the floor today and for his commitment throughout this process to ensuring we give our military the certainty they need to plan and execute their missions. For 53 consecutive years, Congress has passed the National Defense Authorization Act. That is a testament to the vital importance of this legislation, which provides the authorities and support necessary for our military to defend the Nation. But perhaps at no time in the last half century has this legislation been so critical. Our Nation confronts the most diverse and complex array of crises since the end of World War II--the rampage of ISIL's terrorist army, Iran's malign activities across the Middle East, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and bloody intervention in Syria, China's continued pattern of assertive behavior toward its neighbors in the Asia-Pacific, and the list goes on, including what appears to be the recent bombing of an airliner over Egypt which apparently caused the loss of 244 lives, apparently an act of terror of monumental consequences. Rising to the challenges of an increasingly dangerous world requires bold reforms to national defense, and that is what this legislation delivers. The legislation is a reform bill. This legislation delivers the most sweeping reforms to our defense acquisition system in a generation. The NDAA modernizes a 70-year-old military retirement system and extends benefits to hundreds of thousands of servicemembers previously excluded under the old system. The legislation also makes significant reforms to Pentagon headquarters and management to ensure that precious defense resources are focused on our warfighters rather than bloated staffs. The bill identifies $11 billion in excessive and unnecessary spending from that request and reinvests those savings in critical national security priorities, including more fighter aircraft, accelerated shipbuilding, strengthening our cyber defenses, and $300 million in vital assistance to Ukraine to resist Russian aggression. We did all of this while upholding our commitments to our servicemembers, retirees, and their families. The NDAA reauthorizes over 30 special pays and bonuses, makes military health care more portable, increases access to urgent care facilities, strengthens sexual assault prevention and response, and knocks down bureaucratic obstacles to ensure servicemembers maintain access to the medicines they need as they transition from Active Duty. Finally, the legislation before us recognizes that a strong national defense requires supporting our friends and allies and responding to common threats. With Vladimir Putin on the march, the NDAA includes $300 million to help Ukraine resist Russian aggression, including $50 million for lethal assistance and counter-artillery radars. As China continues its aggressive behavior in the South China Sea, the NDAA will provide $50 million to assist and train our allies in the region to increase maritime security and the maritime domain awareness. As the Taliban mounts an offensive across Afghanistan, the NDAA authorizes $3.8 billion for the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund to preserve the gains of the past decade and continue to degrade and defeat terrorists who want to attack the United States and our allies. This is an ambitious piece of legislation, but in the times we live, we cannot afford business as usual in the Department of Defense. To prepare our military to confront our present and future national security challenges, we must champion the cause of defense reform, rigorously root out Pentagon waste, and invest in modernization and next-generation technologies to maintain our military technological advantage. That is what this legislation is all about. Additionally, I would point out that as our citizenry and our voters are deeply frustrated and angry about our failure to get anything done here in the Congress of the United States, I would at least make the comment that our highest priority and responsibility is defending the Nation. I believe this legislation is an example of working not only on both sides of the aisle but on both sides of the Capitol. I would argue that this is the most significant reform legislation that has been passed in 30 years, but I would also tell my colleagues that this is just the beginning. This is the beginning of a bipartisan effort to reform the Pentagon, to reform the way we do business, to reform our priorities, and to reform the way the Pentagon was structured and our defense was structured. The last time it was reformed was 30 years ago under legislation called Goldwater-Nichols. Obviously, in the last 30 years that world situation has changed dramatically--dramatically. On a bipartisan basis, working across the aisle and across the Capitol, I can assure my colleagues that next year at about this time, they will be seeing legislation that will try to address the challenges we are now facing in the world--in a more chaotic world than we have seen since the end of World War II. That is not just John McCain's opinion; that is the opinion of every knowledgeable, respected national security expert, ranging from Henry Kissinger, to Madeleine Albright, to Zbigniew Brzezinski, to Brent Scowcroft and others. We have to have a reformed Pentagon to meet the challenges. One great example of that is cyber security. Thirty years ago there were no cyber attacks on the United States of America. Today it is one of the looming challenges we face. I intend to carry on in the long tradition of this committee in which the Senator from Rhode Island and I have worked in partnership in addressing these new challenges and these grave challenges to America's security. I am proud of this legislation. Could we have done more? Yes. Were there different areas to which perhaps we should have paid more attention? Perhaps. But I would argue that this is the most significant reform legislation in the last 30 years. I thank my friend and colleague from Rhode Island. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the revised National Defense Authorization Act conference report we have before us today. It is the result of months of collaborative work by the Senate Armed Services Committee and a very thoughtful conference. I would like to join Chairman McCain and commend Chairman Mac Thornberry of Texas and Ranking Member Adam Smith of Washington. The collaboration, the thoughtfulness, and the consideration were extraordinary and outstanding throughout the conference process. I have to say that from my point of view, the reason we are here today most fundamentally is the leadership of Chairman McCain on the committee. It was thoughtful, it was bipartisan, and it encouraged participation by all the members of the committee. There was vigorous debate and then there were votes, and that is the way this [[Page S7877]] committee and this Congress should operate. Ultimately, too, I think it reflected what the Chairman has always brought to his duties as a Member of the U.S. Senate and before that the U.S. House of Representatives and before that the U.S. Navy-- understanding that what we do here ultimately reflects and influences and shapes the service and sacrifice of millions of young Americans in uniform. The Chairman never forgets that. He has laid out some of the extraordinary reforms that have been included in this legislation, and he has also indicated that we will continue to work next year under his leadership on additional reforms. These reforms in compensation, personnel policies, and a host of others, are going to set us and our Department of Defense on a better path forward. Again, much of it is because of his leadership and his direction. Previously, the National Defense Authorization bill came before the Senate and there was one area of major disagreement; that was the use of the overseas contingency operations fund. I must again thank the Chairman because he allowed a vigorous debate, a vote on the floor, and ultimately and very satisfactorily this has been resolved in the recent budget agreement. So now we have legislation before us that raises the annual budget cap of the Department of Defense and other agencies, and it allows our defense to be more forward-looking and more able to rationally budget going forward. I think this has given us both the budget authority and the proper direction so that we can have a much more stable and much more predictable future. Again, I think it will be a wonderful facilitator as we consider additional reforms next year in the Defense Authorization bill. The budget agreement also recognizes the fact that one of the challenges is not only those programs that are controlled by the Department of Defense but also other agencies that are involved in national security. Relief for those agencies is also important in carrying out the mission of the Department of Defense and protecting the American people. With this new NDAA, I think we have been able to keep our pledge to the men and women in uniform of the United States. Let me finally conclude where I began. I thank Chairman McCain, Chairman Thornberry, and Ranking Member Smith, but more particularly the staff. We who have the privilege of serving on the Armed Services Committee understand the extraordinary hours, the effort, the insight, and the total commitment of not only the committee staff members but the staffs of the individual members. Their efforts are reflected in this bill. It will not bear their names but, more importantly, it will bear their work. For that I thank them very, very much. Let me urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, to join Senator McCain and others so that for the 54th straight year we will have a National Defense Authorization Act that will become the law of the United States. Madam President, I yield the floor. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this year, I voted in opposition to the fiscal year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA. Since the Senate last voted on the fiscal year 2016 NDAA, Congress has passed and the President has signed the new Bipartisan Budget Act, which raised the discretionary caps on spending across the government, averted a default, and provided a path forward on appropriations. The Bipartisan Budget Act also enabled authors of the NDAA to fix a gimmick that called for spending from overseas contingency operations, OCO, funding to meet requirements that should have been supported by the Department's base budget. I remain concerned, however, that, in order to meet the new caps, budgetary authority had to be cut from this bill. Specifically, I do not believe that readiness funds for the Army, the Army National Guard, and the Army Reserves should be slashed at the same time that many in this body are demanding more soldiers be sent to places like Eastern Europe. This authorization bill will spend hundreds of millions of dollars on unneeded and ineffective missile defense programs, for example, while cutting the training and preparation funds for the men and women we send overseas. The bill also makes significant changes to the defense acquisition system and, inexplicably, cuts key provisions to support the National Guard that enjoyed support in both the Senate and the House. But perhaps most importantly, I am concerned that, in this new version of the bill, Congress failed to reconsider the ill-advised restrictions on detainee transfers from Guantanamo Bay that are contained in this NDAA--restrictions that President Obama cited as one reason for his veto of the original version of the bill last month. I opposed passage of that conference report in part because it contained a needless prohibition on transferring detainees to the United States for detention or trial, and it imposed unnecessary restrictions on transferring detainees to foreign countries. Rather than working to address these misguided provisions, Republicans in Congress have evidently decided to stand in the way of finally bringing this terrible chapter to a close. They are making a grave mistake. For over a decade, the detention facility at Guantanamo has been a stain on our national reputation and served as a recruitment tool for terrorists. Guantanamo is also a tremendous waste of taxpayer dollars, costing approximately $3.4 million per year to maintain a single detainee--an astonishing amount of money that could be repurposed to keep our men and women in uniform safe. Closing Guantanamo is the morally and fiscally responsible thing to do, and I am deeply disappointed that these restrictions have been included. That is why I was proud to cosponsor an amendment filed by Senator Feinstein to strip these troubling provisions from the bill. The bill does include an extremely significant provision: the McCain- Feinstein antitorture amendment. Last year, Senator Feinstein and the Senate Intelligence Committee did this country a great service in exposing the CIA's horrific practices under the Bush administration. The McCain-Feinstein amendment is a major step toward finally bringing to a close that dark, shameful chapter in our Nation's history. This provision finally codifies in statute the interrogation standards in the Army Field Manual--not just for military personnel, but for intelligence agents as well. It will clearly define acceptable interrogation practices and will hopefully ensure that America never engages in torture again. Providing certainty for the Department's men and women and their families, as well as for military planners, is very important, and in significant ways, this bill accomplishes that. While this bill has shortcomings I hope we can address in the near future, I have given my support to its adoption and will only add that, in advance of Veterans Day and every day the men and women who serve and protect us deserve nothing less than the thanks of a grateful nation. Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I wish to express reluctant support for the fiscal year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act. Many parts of the agreement represent bipartisan consensus between Chairman McCain, Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Reed, and Ranking Member Adam Smith. We all appreciate their hard work on those matters for our troops and their families. It provides well-deserved pay increases to our uniformed and defense civilian workforce. It modernizes the personnel benefit system to include a government matched savings plan. It authorizes $300 million in assistance to Ukraine, of which $50 million may be lethal assistance. It codifies the President's Executive order against torture and ensures that interrogations follow the Army Field Manual. I wish to thank Senator McCain and Senator Feinstein in particular for their leadership on this issue. In addition, it extends the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa program so that we may continue to keep faith with foreign translators who risked their lives working with our troops. It authorizes a number of military construction projects around the world, including $29 million in family housing units at Rock Island Arsenal, IL. It reauthorizes the DOD-VA pilot program at North Chicago, the Lovell Federal Health Care Center. For these and many other reasons, I voted for the agreement, but it is a [[Page S7878]] compromise, and I must express my opposition to a few of its provisions. One of those points of disagreement is that the bill prevents the closure of the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The reality is that, every day that it remains open, Guantanamo prison weakens our alliances, inspires our enemies, and calls into question our commitment to human rights. Time and again, our most senior national security and military leaders have called for the closure of Guantanamo. In addition to the national security cost, every day that Guantanamo remains open, we are wasting taxpayer dollars. We are spending $3.3 million per year for each detainee held at Guantanamo Bay--compare that with the estimated $78,000 that it costs to hold a detainee in a Federal super maximum security prison. Yet the conference agreement makes it even harder to transfer detainees to foreign countries, prohibits transfers to the U.S., and prohibits construction or modification of facilities in the U.S. All of us are committed to preventing terrorist attacks. Terrorists deserve swift and sure justice and severe prison sentences. But holding detainees at Guantanamo does not administer justice effectively. It does not serve our national security interests, and it is inconsistent with the country's history as a champion of human rights. In order to conform to the budget agreement, the bill also includes $1.7 billion in reductions to headquarters management personnel. Everyone in the Senate wants to cut the fat from the Pentagon, but we must make sure that these cuts are targeted toward inefficiency and waste, as opposed to recklessly eliminating our valued DOD civilian workforce. The women and men who serve our Nation's defense outside of a uniform are our teammates in making our country secure. They process military pay; investigate fraud, waste, and abuse; oversee expensive weapons programs; and many more important functions. I am proud of each DOD civilian, especially those who work in Illinois, and I will work to make sure that the Congress supports their contributions to our country. This is a very good agreement, these reservations notwithstanding. It is full of provisions which help our troops, reforms the way the Pentagon does business, and provides for our military families.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 20 minutes equally divided prior to a vote on the motion to concur in the House amendment to S. 1356. The Senator from Arizona. Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, today the Senate will once again consider the National Defense Authorization Act. This legislation passed the House last week in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 370 to 58. I hope we will have a similarly resounding vote here today. Today's vote would not be possible without the hard work of Chairman Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. It has been a privilege to work alongside him and the gentleman from Washington, Congressman Smith, to produce a defense authorization bill worthy of the troops it supports. I thank my friend and colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, for his dedicated work on this legislation and his many substantive contributions that made this a better bill. I thank the majority leader, Senator McConnell, for bringing this legislation to the floor today and for his commitment throughout this process to ensuring we give our military the certainty they need to plan and execute their missions. For 53 consecutive years, Congress has passed the National Defense Authorization Act. That is a testament to the vital importance of this legislation, which provides the authorities and support necessary for our military to defend the Nation. But perhaps at no time in the last half century has this legislation been so critical. Our Nation confronts the most diverse and complex array of crises since the end of World War II--the rampage of ISIL's terrorist army, Iran's malign activities across the Middle East, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and bloody intervention in Syria, China's continued pattern of assertive behavior toward its neighbors in the Asia-Pacific, and the list goes on, including what appears to be the recent bombing of an airliner over Egypt which apparently caused the loss of 244 lives, apparently an act of terror of monumental consequences. Rising to the challenges of an increasingly dangerous world requires bold reforms to national defense, and that is what this legislation delivers. The legislation is a reform bill. This legislation delivers the most sweeping reforms to our defense acquisition system in a generation. The NDAA modernizes a 70-year-old military retirement system and extends benefits to hundreds of thousands of servicemembers previously excluded under the old system. The legislation also makes significant reforms to Pentagon headquarters and management to ensure that precious defense resources are focused on our warfighters rather than bloated staffs. The bill identifies $11 billion in excessive and unnecessary spending from that request and reinvests those savings in critical national security priorities, including more fighter aircraft, accelerated shipbuilding, strengthening our cyber defenses, and $300 million in vital assistance to Ukraine to resist Russian aggression. We did all of this while upholding our commitments to our servicemembers, retirees, and their families. The NDAA reauthorizes over 30 special pays and bonuses, makes military health care more portable, increases access to urgent care facilities, strengthens sexual assault prevention and response, and knocks down bureaucratic obstacles to ensure servicemembers maintain access to the medicines they need as they transition from Active Duty. Finally, the legislation before us recognizes that a strong national defense requires supporting our friends and allies and responding to common threats. With Vladimir Putin on the march, the NDAA includes $300 million to help Ukraine resist Russian aggression, including $50 million for lethal assistance and counter-artillery radars. As China continues its aggressive behavior in the South China Sea, the NDAA will provide $50 million to assist and train our allies in the region to increase maritime security and the maritime domain awareness. As the Taliban mounts an offensive across Afghanistan, the NDAA authorizes $3.8 billion for the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund to preserve the gains of the past decade and continue to degrade and defeat terrorists who want to attack the United States and our allies. This is an ambitious piece of legislation, but in the times we live, we cannot afford business as usual in the Department of Defense. To prepare our military to confront our present and future national security challenges, we must champion the cause of defense reform, rigorously root out Pentagon waste, and invest in modernization and next-generation technologies to maintain our military technological advantage. That is what this legislation is all about. Additionally, I would point out that as our citizenry and our voters are deeply frustrated and angry about our failure to get anything done here in the Congress of the United States, I would at least make the comment that our highest priority and responsibility is defending the Nation. I believe this legislation is an example of working not only on both sides of the aisle but on both sides of the Capitol. I would argue that this is the most significant reform legislation that has been passed in 30 years, but I would also tell my colleagues that this is just the beginning. This is the beginning of a bipartisan effort to reform the Pentagon, to reform the way we do business, to reform our priorities, and to reform the way the Pentagon was structured and our defense was structured. The last time it was reformed was 30 years ago under legislation called Goldwater-Nichols. Obviously, in the last 30 years that world situation has changed dramatically--dramatically. On a bipartisan basis, working across the aisle and across the Capitol, I can assure my colleagues that next year at about this time, they will be seeing legislation that will try to address the challenges we are now facing in the world--in a more chaotic world than we have seen since the end of World War II. That is not just John McCain's opinion; that is the opinion of every knowledgeable, respected national security expert, ranging from Henry Kissinger, to Madeleine Albright, to Zbigniew Brzezinski, to Brent Scowcroft and others. We have to have a reformed Pentagon to meet the challenges. One great example of that is cyber security. Thirty years ago there were no cyber attacks on the United States of America. Today it is one of the looming challenges we face. I intend to carry on in the long tradition of this committee in which the Senator from Rhode Island and I have worked in partnership in addressing these new challenges and these grave challenges to America's security. I am proud of this legislation. Could we have done more? Yes. Were there different areas to which perhaps we should have paid more attention? Perhaps. But I would argue that this is the most significant reform legislation in the last 30 years. I thank my friend and colleague from Rhode Island. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the revised National Defense Authorization Act conference report we have before us today. It is the result of months of collaborative work by the Senate Armed Services Committee and a very thoughtful conference. I would like to join Chairman McCain and commend Chairman Mac Thornberry of Texas and Ranking Member Adam Smith of Washington. The collaboration, the thoughtfulness, and the consideration were extraordinary and outstanding throughout the conference process. I have to say that from my point of view, the reason we are here today most fundamentally is the leadership of Chairman McCain on the committee. It was thoughtful, it was bipartisan, and it encouraged participation by all the members of the committee. There was vigorous debate and then there were votes, and that is the way this [[Page S7877]] committee and this Congress should operate. Ultimately, too, I think it reflected what the Chairman has always brought to his duties as a Member of the U.S. Senate and before that the U.S. House of Representatives and before that the U.S. Navy-- understanding that what we do here ultimately reflects and influences and shapes the service and sacrifice of millions of young Americans in uniform. The Chairman never forgets that. He has laid out some of the extraordinary reforms that have been included in this legislation, and he has also indicated that we will continue to work next year under his leadership on additional reforms. These reforms in compensation, personnel policies, and a host of others, are going to set us and our Department of Defense on a better path forward. Again, much of it is because of his leadership and his direction. Previously, the National Defense Authorization bill came before the Senate and there was one area of major disagreement; that was the use of the overseas contingency operations fund. I must again thank the Chairman because he allowed a vigorous debate, a vote on the floor, and ultimately and very satisfactorily this has been resolved in the recent budget agreement. So now we have legislation before us that raises the annual budget cap of the Department of Defense and other agencies, and it allows our defense to be more forward-looking and more able to rationally budget going forward. I think this has given us both the budget authority and the proper direction so that we can have a much more stable and much more predictable future. Again, I think it will be a wonderful facilitator as we consider additional reforms next year in the Defense Authorization bill. The budget agreement also recognizes the fact that one of the challenges is not only those programs that are controlled by the Department of Defense but also other agencies that are involved in national security. Relief for those agencies is also important in carrying out the mission of the Department of Defense and protecting the American people. With this new NDAA, I think we have been able to keep our pledge to the men and women in uniform of the United States. Let me finally conclude where I began. I thank Chairman McCain, Chairman Thornberry, and Ranking Member Smith, but more particularly the staff. We who have the privilege of serving on the Armed Services Committee understand the extraordinary hours, the effort, the insight, and the total commitment of not only the committee staff members but the staffs of the individual members. Their efforts are reflected in this bill. It will not bear their names but, more importantly, it will bear their work. For that I thank them very, very much. Let me urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, to join Senator McCain and others so that for the 54th straight year we will have a National Defense Authorization Act that will become the law of the United States. Madam President, I yield the floor. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this year, I voted in opposition to the fiscal year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA. Since the Senate last voted on the fiscal year 2016 NDAA, Congress has passed and the President has signed the new Bipartisan Budget Act, which raised the discretionary caps on spending across the government, averted a default, and provided a path forward on appropriations. The Bipartisan Budget Act also enabled authors of the NDAA to fix a gimmick that called for spending from overseas contingency operations, OCO, funding to meet requirements that should have been supported by the Department's base budget. I remain concerned, however, that, in order to meet the new caps, budgetary authority had to be cut from this bill. Specifically, I do not believe that readiness funds for the Army, the Army National Guard, and the Army Reserves should be slashed at the same time that many in this body are demanding more soldiers be sent to places like Eastern Europe. This authorization bill will spend hundreds of millions of dollars on unneeded and ineffective missile defense programs, for example, while cutting the training and preparation funds for the men and women we send overseas. The bill also makes significant changes to the defense acquisition system and, inexplicably, cuts key provisions to support the National Guard that enjoyed support in both the Senate and the House. But perhaps most importantly, I am concerned that, in this new version of the bill, Congress failed to reconsider the ill-advised restrictions on detainee transfers from Guantanamo Bay that are contained in this NDAA--restrictions that President Obama cited as one reason for his veto of the original version of the bill last month. I opposed passage of that conference report in part because it contained a needless prohibition on transferring detainees to the United States for detention or trial, and it imposed unnecessary restrictions on transferring detainees to foreign countries. Rather than working to address these misguided provisions, Republicans in Congress have evidently decided to stand in the way of finally bringing this terrible chapter to a close. They are making a grave mistake. For over a decade, the detention facility at Guantanamo has been a stain on our national reputation and served as a recruitment tool for terrorists. Guantanamo is also a tremendous waste of taxpayer dollars, costing approximately $3.4 million per year to maintain a single detainee--an astonishing amount of money that could be repurposed to keep our men and women in uniform safe. Closing Guantanamo is the morally and fiscally responsible thing to do, and I am deeply disappointed that these restrictions have been included. That is why I was proud to cosponsor an amendment filed by Senator Feinstein to strip these troubling provisions from the bill. The bill does include an extremely significant provision: the McCain- Feinstein antitorture amendment. Last year, Senator Feinstein and the Senate Intelligence Committee did this country a great service in exposing the CIA's horrific practices under the Bush administration. The McCain-Feinstein amendment is a major step toward finally bringing to a close that dark, shameful chapter in our Nation's history. This provision finally codifies in statute the interrogation standards in the Army Field Manual--not just for military personnel, but for intelligence agents as well. It will clearly define acceptable interrogation practices and will hopefully ensure that America never engages in torture again. Providing certainty for the Department's men and women and their families, as well as for military planners, is very important, and in significant ways, this bill accomplishes that. While this bill has shortcomings I hope we can address in the near future, I have given my support to its adoption and will only add that, in advance of Veterans Day and every day the men and women who serve and protect us deserve nothing less than the thanks of a grateful nation. Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I wish to express reluctant support for the fiscal year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act. Many parts of the agreement represent bipartisan consensus between Chairman McCain, Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Reed, and Ranking Member Adam Smith. We all appreciate their hard work on those matters for our troops and their families. It provides well-deserved pay increases to our uniformed and defense civilian workforce. It modernizes the personnel benefit system to include a government matched savings plan. It authorizes $300 million in assistance to Ukraine, of which $50 million may be lethal assistance. It codifies the President's Executive order against torture and ensures that interrogations follow the Army Field Manual. I wish to thank Senator McCain and Senator Feinstein in particular for their leadership on this issue. In addition, it extends the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa program so that we may continue to keep faith with foreign translators who risked their lives working with our troops. It authorizes a number of military construction projects around the world, including $29 million in family housing units at Rock Island Arsenal, IL. It reauthorizes the DOD-VA pilot program at North Chicago, the Lovell Federal Health Care Center. For these and many other reasons, I voted for the agreement, but it is a [[Page S7878]] compromise, and I must express my opposition to a few of its provisions. One of those points of disagreement is that the bill prevents the closure of the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The reality is that, every day that it remains open, Guantanamo prison weakens our alliances, inspires our enemies, and calls into question our commitment to human rights. Time and again, our most senior national security and military leaders have called for the closure of Guantanamo. In addition to the national security cost, every day that Guantanamo remains open, we are wasting taxpayer dollars. We are spending $3.3 million per year for each detainee held at Guantanamo Bay--compare that with the estimated $78,000 that it costs to hold a detainee in a Federal super maximum security prison. Yet the conference agreement makes it even harder to transfer detainees to foreign countries, prohibits transfers to the U.S., and prohibits construction or modification of facilities in the U.S. All of us are committed to preventing terrorist attacks. Terrorists deserve swift and sure justice and severe prison sentences. But holding detainees at Guantanamo does not administer justice effectively. It does not serve our national security interests, and it is inconsistent with the country's history as a champion of human rights. In order to conform to the budget agreement, the bill also includes $1.7 billion in reductions to headquarters management personnel. Everyone in the Senate wants to cut the fat from the Pentagon, but we must make sure that these cuts are targeted toward inefficiency and waste, as opposed to recklessly eliminating our valued DOD civilian workforce. The women and men who serve our Nation's defense outside of a uniform are our teammates in making our country secure. They process military pay; investigate fraud, waste, and abuse; oversee expensive weapons programs; and many more important functions. I am proud of each DOD civilian, especially those who work in Illinois, and I will work to make sure that the Congress supports their contributions to our country. This is a very good agreement, these reservations notwithstanding. It is full of provisions which help our troops, reforms the way the Pentagon does business, and provides for our military families. I thank Senator McCain and Senator Reed for their hard work and commend the bill's passage for the 54th year in a row. Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

We who have the privilege of serving on the Armed Services Committee understand the extraordinary hours, the effort, the insight, and the total commitment of not only the committee staff members but the staffs of the individual members. Their efforts are reflected in this bill. It will not bear their names but, more importantly, it will bear their work. For that I thank them very, very much. Let me urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, to join Senator McCain and others so that for the 54th straight year we will have a National Defense Authorization Act that will become the law of the United States. Madam President, I yield the floor. Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this year, I voted in opposition to the fiscal year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA. Since the Senate last voted on the fiscal year 2016 NDAA, Congress has passed and the President has signed the new Bipartisan Budget Act, which raised the discretionary caps on spending across the government, averted a default, and provided a path forward on appropriations. The Bipartisan Budget Act also enabled authors of the NDAA to fix a gimmick that called for spending from overseas contingency operations, OCO, funding to meet requirements that should have been supported by the Department's base budget. I remain concerned, however, that, in order to meet the new caps, budgetary authority had to be cut from this bill. Specifically, I do not believe that readiness funds for the Army, the Army National Guard, and the Army Reserves should be slashed at the same time that many in this body are demanding more soldiers be sent to places like Eastern Europe. This authorization bill will spend hundreds of millions of dollars on unneeded and ineffective missile defense programs, for example, while cutting the training and preparation funds for the men and women we send overseas. The bill also makes significant changes to the defense acquisition system and, inexplicably, cuts key provisions to support the National Guard that enjoyed support in both the Senate and the House. But perhaps most importantly, I am concerned that, in this new version of the bill, Congress failed to reconsider the ill-advised restrictions on detainee transfers from Guantanamo Bay that are contained in this NDAA--restrictions that President Obama cited as one reason for his veto of the original version of the bill last month. I opposed passage of that conference report in part because it contained a needless prohibition on transferring detainees to the United States for detention or trial, and it imposed unnecessary restrictions on transferring detainees to foreign countries. Rather than working to address these misguided provisions, Republicans in Congress have evidently decided to stand in the way of finally bringing this terrible chapter to a close. They are making a grave mistake. For over a decade, the detention facility at Guantanamo has been a stain on our national reputation and served as a recruitment tool for terrorists. Guantanamo is also a tremendous waste of taxpayer dollars, costing approximately $3.4 million per year to maintain a single detainee--an astonishing amount of money that could be repurposed to keep our men and women in uniform safe. Closing Guantanamo is the morally and fiscally responsible thing to do, and I am deeply disappointed that these restrictions have been included. That is why I was proud to cosponsor an amendment filed by Senator Feinstein to strip these troubling provisions from the bill. The bill does include an extremely significant provision: the McCain- Feinstein antitorture amendment. Last year, Senator Feinstein and the Senate Intelligence Committee did this country a great service in exposing the CIA's horrific practices under the Bush administration. The McCain-Feinstein amendment is a major step toward finally bringing to a close that dark, shameful chapter in our Nation's history. This provision finally codifies in statute the interrogation standards in the Army Field Manual--not just for military personnel, but for intelligence agents as well. It will clearly define acceptable interrogation practices and will hopefully ensure that America never engages in torture again. Providing certainty for the Department's men and women and their families, as well as for military planners, is very important, and in significant ways, this bill accomplishes that. While this bill has shortcomings I hope we can address in the near future, I have given my support to its adoption and will only add that, in advance of Veterans Day and every day the men and women who serve and protect us deserve nothing less than the thanks of a grateful nation. Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I wish to express reluctant support for the fiscal year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act. Many parts of the agreement represent bipartisan consensus between Chairman McCain, Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Reed, and Ranking Member Adam Smith. We all appreciate their hard work on those matters for our troops and their families. It provides well-deserved pay increases to our uniformed and defense civilian workforce. It modernizes the personnel benefit system to include a government matched savings plan. It authorizes $300 million in assistance to Ukraine, of which $50 million may be lethal assistance. It codifies the President's Executive order against torture and ensures that interrogations follow the Army Field Manual. I wish to thank Senator McCain and Senator Feinstein in particular for their leadership on this issue. In addition, it extends the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa program so that we may continue to keep faith with foreign translators who risked their lives working with our troops. It authorizes a number of military construction projects around the world, including $29 million in family housing units at Rock Island Arsenal, IL. It reauthorizes the DOD-VA pilot program at North Chicago, the Lovell Federal Health Care Center. For these and many other reasons, I voted for the agreement, but it is a [[Page S7878]] compromise, and I must express my opposition to a few of its provisions. One of those points of disagreement is that the bill prevents the closure of the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The reality is that, every day that it remains open, Guantanamo prison weakens our alliances, inspires our enemies, and calls into question our commitment to human rights. Time and again, our most senior national security and military leaders have called for the closure of Guantanamo. In addition to the national security cost, every day that Guantanamo remains open, we are wasting taxpayer dollars. We are spending $3.3 million per year for each detainee held at Guantanamo Bay--compare that with the estimated $78,000 that it costs to hold a detainee in a Federal super maximum security prison. Yet the conference agreement makes it even harder to transfer detainees to foreign countries, prohibits transfers to the U.S., and prohibits construction or modification of facilities in the U.S. All of us are committed to preventing terrorist attacks. Terrorists deserve swift and sure justice and severe prison sentences. But holding detainees at Guantanamo does not administer justice effectively. It does not serve our national security interests, and it is inconsistent with the country's history as a champion of human rights. In order to conform to the budget agreement, the bill also includes $1.7 billion in reductions to headquarters management personnel. Everyone in the Senate wants to cut the fat from the Pentagon, but we must make sure that these cuts are targeted toward inefficiency and waste, as opposed to recklessly eliminating our valued DOD civilian workforce. The women and men who serve our Nation's defense outside of a uniform are our teammates in making our country secure. They process military pay; investigate fraud, waste, and abuse; oversee expensive weapons programs; and many more important functions. I am proud of each DOD civilian, especially those who work in Illinois, and I will work to make sure that the Congress supports their contributions to our country. This is a very good agreement, these reservations notwithstanding. It is full of provisions which help our troops, reforms the way the Pentagon does business, and provides for our military families. I thank Senator McCain and Senator Reed for their hard work and commend the bill's passage for the 54th year in a row. Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 2029 Mr. KIRK.

house amendment to s. 1356. the presiding officer. under the previous order, there will be 20 minutes equally divided prior to a vote on the motion to concur in the house amendment to s. 1356. the senator from arizona. mr. mccain. madam president, today the senate will once again consider the national defense authorization act. this legislation passed the house last week in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 370 to 58. i hope we will have a similarly resounding vote here today. today's vote would not be possible without the hard work of chairman mac thornberry, chairman of the house armed services committee. it has been a privilege to work alongside him and the gentleman from washington, congressman smith, to produce a defense authorization bill worthy of the troops it supports. i thank my friend and colleague from rhode island, senator reed, for his dedicated work on this legislation and his many substantive contributions that made this a better bill. i thank the majority leader, senator mcconnell, for bringing this legislation to the floor today and for his commitment throughout this process to ensuring we give our military the certainty they need to plan and execute their missions. for 53 consecutive years, congress has passed the national defense authorization act. that is a testament to the vital importance of this legislation, which provides the authorities and support necessary for our military to defend the nation. but perhaps at no time in the last half century has this legislation been so critical. our nation confronts the most diverse and complex array of crises since the end of world war ii--the rampage of isil's terrorist army, iran's malign activities across the middle east, russia's invasion of ukraine and bloody intervention in syria, china's continued pattern of assertive behavior toward its neighbors in the asia-pacific, and the list goes on, including what appears to be the recent bombing of an airliner over egypt which apparently caused the loss of 244 lives, apparently an act of terror of monumental consequences. rising to the challenges of an increasingly dangerous world requires bold reforms to national defense, and that is what this legislation delivers. the legislation is a reform bill. this legislation delivers the most sweeping reforms to our defense acquisition system in a generation. the ndaa modernizes a 70-year-old military retirement system and extends benefits to hundreds of thousands of servicemembers previously excluded under the old system. the legislation also makes significant reforms to pentagon headquarters and management to ensure that precious defense resources are focused on our warfighters rather than bloated staffs. the bill identifies $11 billion in excessive and unnecessary spending from that request and reinvests those savings in critical national security priorities, including more fighter aircraft, accelerated shipbuilding, strengthening our cyber defenses, and $300 million in vital assistance to ukraine to resist russian aggression. we did all of this while upholding our commitments to our servicemembers, retirees, and their families. the ndaa reauthorizes over 30 special pays and bonuses, makes military health care more portable, increases access to urgent care facilities, strengthens sexual assault prevention and response, and knocks down bureaucratic obstacles to ensure servicemembers maintain access to the medicines they need as they transition from active duty. finally, the legislation before us recognizes that a strong national defense requires supporting our friends and allies and responding to common threats. with vladimir putin on the march, the ndaa includes $300 million to help ukraine resist russian aggression, including $50 million for lethal assistance and counter-artillery radars. as china continues its aggressive behavior in the south china sea, the ndaa will provide $50 million to assist and train our allies in the region to increase maritime security and the maritime domain awareness. as the taliban mounts an offensive across afghanistan, the ndaa authorizes $3.8 billion for the afghanistan security forces fund to preserve the gains of the past decade and continue to degrade and defeat terrorists who want to attack the united states and our allies. this is an ambitious piece of legislation, but in the times we live, we cannot afford business as usual in the department of defense. to prepare our military to confront our present and future national security challenges, we must champion the cause of defense reform, rigorously root out pentagon waste, and invest in modernization and next-generation technologies to maintain our military technological advantage. that is what this legislation is all about. additionally, i would point out that as our citizenry and our voters are deeply frustrated and angry about our failure to get anything done here in the congress of the united states, i would at least make the comment that our highest priority and responsibility is defending the nation. i believe this legislation is an example of working not only on both sides of the aisle but on both sides of the capitol. i would argue that this is the most significant reform legislation that has been passed in 30 years, but i would also tell my colleagues that this is just the beginning. this is the beginning of a bipartisan effort to reform the pentagon, to reform the way we do business, to reform our priorities, and to reform the way the pentagon was structured and our defense was structured. the last time it was reformed was 30 years ago under legislation called goldwater-nichols. obviously, in the last 30 years that world situation has changed dramatically--dramatically. on a bipartisan basis, working across the aisle and across the capitol, i can assure my colleagues that next year at about this time, they will be seeing legislation that will try to address the challenges we are now facing in the world--in a more chaotic world than we have seen since the end of world war ii. that is not just john mccain's opinion; that is the opinion of every knowledgeable, respected national security expert, ranging from henry kissinger, to madeleine albright, to zbigniew brzezinski, to brent scowcroft and others. we have to have a reformed pentagon to meet the challenges. one great example of that is cyber security. thirty years ago there were no cyber attacks on the united states of america. today it is one of the looming challenges we face. i intend to carry on in the long tradition of this committee in which the senator from rhode island and i have worked in partnership in addressing these new challenges and these grave challenges to america's security. i am proud of this legislation. could we have done more? yes. were there different areas to which perhaps we should have paid more attention? perhaps. but i would argue that this is the most significant reform legislation in the last 30 years. i thank my friend and colleague from rhode island. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from rhode island. mr. reed. madam president, i rise to speak in support of the revised national defense authorization act conference report we have before us today. it is the result of months of collaborative work by the senate armed services committee and a very thoughtful conference. i would like to join chairman mccain and commend chairman mac thornberry of texas and ranking member adam smith of washington. the collaboration, the thoughtfulness, and the consideration were extraordinary and outstanding throughout the conference process. i have to say that from my point of view, the reason we are here today most fundamentally is the leadership of chairman mccain on the committee. it was thoughtful, it was bipartisan, and it encouraged participation by all the members of the committee. there was vigorous debate and then there were votes, and that is the way this [[page s7877]] committee and this congress should operate. ultimately, too, i think it reflected what the chairman has always brought to his duties as a member of the u.s. senate and before that the u.s. house of representatives and before that the u.s. navy-- understanding that what we do here ultimately reflects and influences and shapes the service and sacrifice of millions of young americans in uniform. the chairman never forgets that. he has laid out some of the extraordinary reforms that have been included in this legislation, and he has also indicated that we will continue to work next year under his leadership on additional reforms. these reforms in compensation, personnel policies, and a host of others, are going to set us and our department of defense on a better path forward. again, much of it is because of his leadership and his direction. previously, the national defense authorization bill came before the senate and there was one area of major disagreement; that was the use of the overseas contingency operations fund. i must again thank the chairman because he allowed a vigorous debate, a vote on the floor, and ultimately and very satisfactorily this has been resolved in the recent budget agreement. so now we have legislation before us that raises the annual budget cap of the department of defense and other agencies, and it allows our defense to be more forward-looking and more able to rationally budget going forward. i think this has given us both the budget authority and the proper direction so that we can have a much more stable and much more predictable future. again, i think it will be a wonderful facilitator as we consider additional reforms next year in the defense authorization bill. the budget agreement also recognizes the fact that one of the challenges is not only those programs that are controlled by the department of defense but also other agencies that are involved in national security. relief for those agencies is also important in carrying out the mission of the department of defense and protecting the american people. with this new ndaa, i think we have been able to keep our pledge to the men and women in uniform of the united states. let me finally conclude where i began. i thank chairman mccain, chairman thornberry, and ranking member smith, but more particularly the staff. we who have the privilege of serving on the armed services committee understand the extraordinary hours, the effort, the insight, and the total commitment of not only the committee staff members but the staffs of the individual members. their efforts are reflected in this bill. it will not bear their names but, more importantly, it will bear their work. for that i thank them very, very much. let me urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, to join senator mccain and others so that for the 54th straight year we will have a national defense authorization act that will become the law of the united states. madam president, i yield the floor. mr. leahy. mr. president, earlier this year, i voted in opposition to the fiscal year 2016 national defense authorization act, ndaa. since the senate

the training and preparation funds for the men and women we send overseas. the bill also makes significant changes to the defense acquisition system and, inexplicably, cuts key provisions to support

care center. for these and many other reasons, i voted for the agreement, but it is a [[page s7878]] compromise, and i must express my opposition to a few of its provisions. one of those points of

the country's history as a champion of human rights. in order to conform to the budget agreement, the bill also includes $1.7 billion in reductions to headquarters management personnel. everyone in

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Wicker). Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Delaware. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, something came to my attention today that I haven't seen before. Actually, it is a blog which was apparently written by Ben Bernanke, the immediate past Chairman of the Federal Reserve. He wrote it for the Brookings Institute, and he talked about one of the pay-fors for the transportation bill for which we will be sending conferees to discuss later today. As my colleagues may recall, the House passed a 6-year authorization bill for transportation--roads, highways, bridges, and transit--with funding for 3 years. When we sent our legislation over to the House, they came up with some new pay-fors. Frankly, it is not user fees, it is not even like pension smoothing, it is not like stealing TSA fees or Custom fees, but something new. They found money--about $40 to $50 billion--in the Federal Reserve and said: Why don't we use that for transportation spending? Interestingly enough, the former Chairman of the Federal Reserve has written about this issue, and it has been editorialized in today's Washington Post, among others. I will read a sentence or two out of Chairman Bernanke's comments, if I may, talking about the new pay-for, where we take money from the Federal Reserve and use it for transportation purposes. Here is what Chairman Bernanke says: More substantively--and this is what I want to focus on in the post-- ``paying'' for highway spending with Fed capital is not paying for it at all in any economically meaningful sense. Rather, this maneuver is a form of budgetary sleight-of-hand that would count funds that are already designated for the Treasury as ``new'' revenue. Every year this extra money that the Federal Reserve has is turned over to the Treasury. In fact, it may be as much as one-half trillion dollars. That money goes into the earnings that the Federal Reserve makes, and at different points during the year, they turn money over to the Treasury. What the House language says here is that we are going to reduce that amount of money that would normally go from the Federal Reserve to the Treasury during some part of this year, and we are simply going to pull that money out and use it for transportation. Now, that money was going to go to the Treasury anyway. It was going to go from the Federal Reserve to Treasury anyway, and now we are going to sort of slip in and pull that money out and say: No, no, we are going to use it for roads, highways, and bridges. It is a sleight of hand. GAO is blowing the whistle on it as well, and I am delighted Chairman Bernanke is calling it for what it is. Look, we had the opportunity to pay for transportation projects. We had the opportunity to pay for roads, highways, and bridges, and to do it the old-fashioned way, and frankly, in a way that the chairman of our committee, Senator Inhofe, was in favor of. We have a tradition and history in this country of saying that things that are worth having are worth paying for, and people and businesses that use roads, highways, and bridges here in the past have said we ought to pay for the use of them. Now we are looking at a transportation bill that says: No, we are going to take money from TSA--TSA fee increases--and instead of using it to make our skies and aviation safer, we are going to steal 10 years of TSA revenues and put it over here in transportation. We are going to take money that ought to go to fortify our borders to make us stronger and better equipped so we can do a better job of finding out whether what is in the trucks is really produce or some other product, such as narcotics--our border crossings, where we have literally tens of millions of dollars' worth of trade going through trade every day--and instead we are going to take those revenues and put them into transportation. There is the idea of taking money out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, where we pay $80 to $90 to $100 a barrel and are now selling it for about half that and using the proceeds from that--buy high, sell low--to pay for transportation. The latest trick from the House is to take the money out of the Federal Reserve when it is already going to go to Treasury anyway. Instead, we are going to take that money away from the Federal Reserve and pretend like it has no consequence. Well, actually that $50 or $60 billion would have reduced the deficit. That is where it would have gone. This is not the way to do business. We had the opportunity to fully fund a robust transportation plan. Several of us--Senator Durbin, Senator Feinstein, and I--offered legislation, very much like Bowles- Simpson, that would actually restore the purchasing power of the gas and diesel taxes in this country. We have not raised them since 1993. Since 1993, the Federal gasoline tax has been roughly 18 cents. It is now worth less than a dime because of inflation. The diesel tax, since 1993, is worth less than 15 cents. Nominally, it is 23 cents. Meanwhile, roads, highways, and bridges are more expensive. Asphalt is more expensive, as is concrete, steel, and labor. Instead of being able to fund transportation in a genuine, honest kind of way, we are spending about $50 billion a year at the Federal level for transportation. It is about one-third of what is being spent nationally. Out of that $50 billion, we are only raising $35 billion through our user fees, and we just go out and borrow the money for the rest. When we run out of money in the general fund, we go around the world and borrow money from China and other places so that we can build roads, highways, and bridges. When the Chinese are mucking around in the South China Sea or the Spratly Islands or some of those other places, we say: You can't do that. They say: We thought you wanted to borrow our money. If they are manipulating their currency or dumping their goods and products into our markets, we say: You can't do that. They say: We thought you wanted to borrow our money. We should not be beholden to them or to anybody else. We should fully fund transportation projects, and we could do that. The legislation that Senators Feinstein, Durbin, and I offered would gradually raise the tax on diesel and gasoline by 4 cents a year for 4 years, and then index it going forward. How much money would that generate? That would generate about $220 billion over the next 10 years. Our roads, highway, and bridges get D-plus these days. Why? Because about a quarter of our bridges are in bad shape and the service of our roads and highways is as well. People say they don't want to pay any more money for user fees on gas or diesel. Well, people paid less than $2 a gallon for gasoline at about 30,000 gas stations across America last week. My friends, as it turns out, if we actually did raise the price for gas and diesel by 4 cents a year for 4 years, what would the effect be in 2020--4 years from now--for average drivers? The out-of-pocket impact would be about the cost of a cup of coffee a week. Meanwhile, because our roads, bridges, and highways are in such lousy [[Page S7883]] shape, we, as constituents--people who drive around this country--have an average cost of damage to our vehicles, tires, steering, and rims of our tires of over $350 a year. That is not my number; that is a real number. The other thing that is going on here is that we sit in traffic a lot in our country these days because we are not addressing our bottlenecks and doing what we ought to be doing in terms of upgrading our roads, highways, and bridges. Every year Texas A&M does an analysis. What they do is to look at how much time we sit in traffic in this country. The average driver in this country sits in traffic 42 hours a year. In cities such as Washington, DC, the numbers are more like 80 hours a year. We are not moving. We are just sitting there wasting time, wasting fuel, and polluting the skies. We don't have to do that. Instead of doing something that is intellectually honest, what we are doing is really, I think, shameful. I think it is shameful. Initially, I was just confused by what the House wants to do with the Federal Reserve by moving $50 to $60 billion out of there. Now that I understand what they are doing, it is even more shameful. We can do better than this, and the American people deserve better than that. Our friends at the McKinsey Global Institute spent some time last year trying to figure out if we were actually investing robustly in our roads, highways, and bridges in this country. They looked at how it would affect our GDP and if it would have any effect on putting people to work. If we are willing to make robust investments for the next 10 years instead of, frankly, not much at all in terms of investments, here is what they said: We would grow GDP by about 1.5 percent per year for the next 10 years. So far this year it has been somewhere between 2 and 2.5 percent. We could increase it by another 1.5 percent if we make these kinds of honest investments. We are not going to come close to making robust investments. The McKinsey Global Institute also told us that in terms of new employment, if we were actually to invest robustly in roads, highways, and bridges in this country, we would put 1.8 million people to work building roads, highways, bridges, and transit systems. But we are not going to do that. We are not even close to what the McKinsey Global Institute was calling for in robust investments that would actually grow our GDP by 1.5 percent each year and increase employment by 1.8 million people. In fact, what we are passing here isn't even close to the 4 cents a year for 4 years and indexing going forward. That produces $220 billion over the next 10 years. What we are doing is barely keeping Federal funding at $50 billion, and the way we are doing most of that is by sleight of hand and by using money that has nothing to do with roads, highways, and bridges and nothing to do with businesses and people that use those transportation modes to pay for them--nothing. And now we are about to name conferees and go to conference on that kind of deal? The American people aren't stupid. They are not stupid. Do you know what a bunch of States around the country--like 12 States in the last 2 years--did when they found out they were running out of money to build their transportation systems in their States? They raised their user fees. They actually raised them. Do you know what happened when they had elections last November? Some 95 percent of the Republicans who voted to raise their user fees were reelected, and 90 percent of the Democrats who voted to raise their user fees in those 12 States were reelected. They didn't pay a penalty for it. They were rewarded for it. The people who voted the other way-- who voted not to raise the user fees--didn't do as well. People aren't stupid. We are going to have an opportunity here to name conferees and go to conference, and I just want to say that this man sitting next to me, Jim Inhofe, is a good man. He chairs our Environment and Public Works Committee. Our committee reported out a very good 6-year authorization bill. He is proud of it. Senator Boxer and I worked on it, and I am very proud of what we did. I commend Senator Inhofe for a great bill. That is the authorization piece. If we could just stop there, we would be fine. Unfortunately, the authorization is only half the game. What was the picture of the guy they had on the floor not long ago? It was a picture of a cowboy wearing a big hat and lying back sleeping, and the caption under the picture says: All hat, no cattle. Well, when you have a great authorization bill but no real money to pay for it, that is really all hat, no cattle. I don't think there is a better example of it that I have seen than the legislation that we are going to be conferencing on very soon. I wish I could sit here and say it is all going to work out and we will do just fine, but that is not the truth. We have let a great opportunity pass us by. We are about to let a great opportunity pass us by. We are worthy of a better opportunity than that, and frankly the people of our country deserve a better effort than that. With that, I yield the floor to my friend from Oklahoma. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Mr. CARPER. I withdraw my objection. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me say in response that a couple of times my good friend from Delaware has observed that the American people are not stupid, but the American people also want highways. That is one of the big things they want. In fact, we have a document called a Constitution that says we are supposed to be doing two things here: defending America, and roads and bridges. And I think we both agree on the significance of that. Burundi I hope I will have time to get into something because our State Department of the United States of America is getting involved in Burundi, in their election. They had a duly-qualified election. The constitutional convention declared that Nkurunziza, who is the President, had a legal election, and we ought to stay out of their business. If there is time, I would like to elaborate on that, but I know I am competing for time. Gitmo On the President's Gitmo message, we have--I will give a little chronology on that. On January 22, 2009, Obama signed an Executive order to close Gitmo within the year. On February 3 of that same year, 2009, I introduced a bill to permanently prevent Gitmo detainees from being relocated anywhere in the United States. At that time they were ready to talk about relocating them to parts of my State of Oklahoma, in the Fort Sill area. In May 2009 I authored bipartisan legislation with Senator Danny Inouye to block funding to close Gitmo and to move the detainees anywhere on U.S. soil. That passed 90 to 6. Every year since, Congress has blocked the attempts by this President and his administration to close Gitmo or move terrorist detainees into the United States. Every year, Congress has passed laws that continue to limit the transfer of these detainees, including in the conference report for the fiscal year 2016 NDAA bill. That is what we are talking about right now. It prohibits the transferring of Gitmo detainees to the United States through December 31, 2016. That also tightens the restrictions on the detainees being transferred to other countries. The fiscal year NDAA also included language preventing closure of Gitmo through December 31, 2016. However, this has not prevented President Obama from trying to empty Gitmo and releasing these terrorist detainees to any country he can pay to take them back and now threatening an Executive order to bring them to the United States--to the States of Colorado, South Carolina, and Kansas--against the will of the Senators from those States, the House Members from those States, and the American people. This is not the first time the President has gone against the will of the American people and violated our laws. The President violated the law last June when he transferred the Taliban Five from Gitmo in exchange for Sergeant Bergdahl, and my colleagues will [[Page S7884]] remember that issue. He failed to notify Congress. The laws we passed said they had to notify Congress 30 days in advance of any transfer of terrorists to any facility. His failure to adhere to the law he signed placed our Nation's security at great risk. Let me just mention--I carry this with me. If people realize whom he turned loose, the Taliban Five--this is a statement that was made by the Taliban commander. His name is Mullah Khan. He was talking about Mohammad Fazl. Keep in mind he was arguably the most dangerous person-- terrorist--who was being held in Gitmo. He said: His return is like pouring 10,000 Taliban fighters into the battle on the side of jihad. Now the Taliban have the right lion to lead them in the final moment before victory in Afghanistan. These are the kinds of people he is turning loose. According to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, 29 percent of the detainees transferred out of Gitmo have either been confirmed or suspected of returning to the fight and killing Americans. That is how serious this is. Gitmo is outside the sovereign territory of the United States, which means detainees held there do not have constitutional rights. But if we put them back in the United States, it is very likely they would have those rights. I have a quote from former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey, who said: The question of what constitutional rights may apply to aliens in government custody is unsettled, but it is clear from existing jurisprudence that physical presence in the United States would be a significant, if not a decisive, factor. I am also concerned about the security of the people here who would have to guard these terrorists. Back when a Thomson, IL, prison was discussed--that was in 2009-- Representative Mark Kirk--at that time he was in the House; that was before he was in the Senate--called the move ``an unnecessary risk,'' and other Illinois Members were concerned that the transfer of prisoners--some for trial and some for indefinite detention--could make the State a target for terrorists. Mark Kirk was then and is now correct that prisons holding these detainees will become magnets, and there is the very real possibility that these detainees would recruit more terrorists. We have to keep in mind that a terrorist is not a criminal. A terrorist is someone who trains other people to be terrorists, and that is what we would be seeing happening in our courts. FBI Director Robert Mueller said there is the very real possibility that Gitmo detainees will recruit more terrorists from among the Federal inmate population and continue Al Qaeda operations from outside the country. I have been to Gitmo several times, as has the occupier of the chair. It is a state-of-the-art facility that provides humane treatment for all detainees. When I was there, the biggest problem they had with the detainees was that they were overweight. They are all obese because they are eating so well. It is fully in compliance with the Geneva Convention and provides treatment and oversight that exceed any maximum security prison in the world, as tested by human rights organizations such as the Red Cross, Attorney General Holder, and an independent commission led by Admiral Walsh. It is a secure location away from population centers, and it has a $12 million expeditionary legal complex. That is a courtroom. We can't use our courtrooms because of the confidentiality of information that is extracted from these individuals and used in the courtroom, so they use the expeditionary legal complex. The last thing I would say is that it is clear that--and this comes from former CIA Director Leon Panetta. He was talking about the fact that our President--talking about the way they were able to get the bad guy, and what they have refused to understand is the information they extracted at Gitmo was used to actually capture Osama bin Laden. Anyway, we don't want that to happen, we can't afford to let that happen, and we are going to do everything we can to keep the President from making that happen. This has become an obsession of his, and we are not going to let that happen. Burundi Lastly, I do want to mention that on this whole issue in Burundi right now, we have to understand in this country that there are other nations that have their own systems of government. They are the ones that have their elections. In this case, I happened to be there in Burundi when the court declared that the incumbent President, Nkurunziza, was qualified to run again, even though they have a term limit. The first term was not a complete term, so that didn't count, according to the court. For us to come in afterward and say ``Well, we think the court was wrong, we don't think he is qualified to run, and we are going to withhold things from that country'' is something we should not be doing in this country. I can assure my colleagues that the six Members who went with me over there were all on the scene and agreed that Nkurunziza should be legitimately elected, and we should stay out of their business. With that, I yield the floor. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7881-S7884] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DRIVE ACT Mr. McCONNELL.

I have a statement I would like to make at this point in time. If this is the appropriate time to do it, then I would like to do it. I would like to speak for 10 minutes. Mr. McCONNELL. I renew my request. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. CARPER. Reserving the right to object. Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield? Mr. CARPER. I am happy to yield. Mr. INHOFE. There is a lot of mumbling going on. I am not sure what we finally decided to do. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I will speak for 10 minutes on transportation, and then we will have our caucus lunch. Mr. INHOFE. All right. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of the remarks of the Senator from Delaware, I be recognized for up to 10 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Wicker). Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Delaware. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, something came to my attention today that I haven't seen before. Actually, it is a blog which was apparently written by Ben Bernanke, the immediate past Chairman of the Federal Reserve. He wrote it for the Brookings Institute, and he talked about one of the pay-fors for the transportation bill for which we will be sending conferees to discuss later today. As my colleagues may recall, the House passed a 6-year authorization bill for transportation--roads, highways, bridges, and transit--with funding for 3 years. When we sent our legislation over to the House, they came up with some new pay-fors. Frankly, it is not user fees, it is not even like pension smoothing, it is not like stealing TSA fees or Custom fees, but something new. They found money--about $40 to $50 billion--in the Federal Reserve and said: Why don't we use that for transportation spending? Interestingly enough, the former Chairman of the Federal Reserve has written about this issue, and it has been editorialized in today's Washington Post, among others. I will read a sentence or two out of Chairman Bernanke's comments, if I may, talking about the new pay-for, where we take money from the Federal Reserve and use it for transportation purposes. Here is what Chairman Bernanke says: More substantively--and this is what I want to focus on in the post-- ``paying'' for highway spending with Fed capital is not paying for it at all in any economically meaningful sense. Rather, this maneuver is a form of budgetary sleight-of-hand that would count funds that are already designated for the Treasury as ``new'' revenue. Every year this extra money that the Federal Reserve has is turned over to the Treasury. In fact, it may be as much as one-half trillion dollars. That money goes into the earnings that the Federal Reserve makes, and at different points during the year, they turn money over to the Treasury. What the House language says here is that we are going to reduce that amount of money that would normally go from the Federal Reserve to the Treasury during some part of this year, and we are simply going to pull that money out and use it for transportation. Now, that money was going to go to the Treasury anyway. It was going to go from the Federal Reserve to Treasury anyway, and now we are going to sort of slip in and pull that money out and say: No, no, we are going to use it for roads, highways, and bridges. It is a sleight of hand. GAO is blowing the whistle on it as well, and I am delighted Chairman Bernanke is calling it for what it is. Look, we had the opportunity to pay for transportation projects. We had the opportunity to pay for roads, highways, and bridges, and to do it the old-fashioned way, and frankly, in a way that the chairman of our committee, Senator Inhofe, was in favor of. We have a tradition and history in this country of saying that things that are worth having are worth paying for, and people and businesses that use roads, highways, and bridges here in the past have said we ought to pay for the use of them.

I wish I could sit here and say it is all going to work out and we will do just fine, but that is not the truth. We have let a great opportunity pass us by. We are about to let a great opportunity pass us by. We are worthy of a better opportunity than that, and frankly the people of our country deserve a better effort than that. With that, I yield the floor to my friend from Oklahoma. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Mr. CARPER. I withdraw my objection. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Oklahoma. Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me say in response that a couple of times my good friend from Delaware has observed that the American people are not stupid, but the American people also want highways. That is one of the big things they want. In fact, we have a document called a Constitution that says we are supposed to be doing two things here: defending America, and roads and bridges. And I think we both agree on the significance of that. Burundi I hope I will have time to get into something because our State Department of the United States of America is getting involved in Burundi, in their election. They had a duly-qualified election. The constitutional convention declared that Nkurunziza, who is the President, had a legal election, and we ought to stay out of their business. If there is time, I would like to elaborate on that, but I know I am competing for time. Gitmo On the President's Gitmo message, we have--I will give a little chronology on that. On January 22, 2009, Obama signed an Executive order to close Gitmo within the year. On February 3 of that same year, 2009, I introduced a bill to permanently prevent Gitmo detainees from being relocated anywhere in the United States. At that time they were ready to talk about relocating them to parts of my State of Oklahoma, in the Fort Sill area. In May 2009 I authored bipartisan legislation with Senator Danny Inouye to block funding to close Gitmo and to move the detainees anywhere on U.S. soil. That passed 90 to 6. Every year since, Congress has blocked the attempts by this President and his administration to close Gitmo or move terrorist detainees into the United States. Every year, Congress has passed laws that continue to limit the transfer of these detainees, including in the conference report for the fiscal year 2016 NDAA bill. That is what we are talking about right now. It prohibits the transferring of Gitmo detainees to the United States through December 31, 2016. That also tightens the restrictions on the detainees being transferred to other countries. The fiscal year NDAA also included language preventing closure of Gitmo through December 31, 2016. However, this has not prevented President Obama from trying to empty Gitmo and releasing these terrorist detainees to any country he can pay to take them back and now threatening an Executive order to bring them to the United States--to the States of Colorado, South Carolina, and Kansas--against the will of the Senators from those States, the House Members from those States, and the American people. This is not the first time the President has gone against the will of the American people and violated our laws. The President violated the law last June when he transferred the Taliban Five from Gitmo in exchange for Sergeant Bergdahl, and my colleagues will [[Page S7884]] remember that issue. He failed to notify Congress. The laws we passed said they had to notify Congress 30 days in advance of any transfer of terrorists to any facility. His failure to adhere to the law he signed placed our Nation's security at great risk. Let me just mention--I carry this with me. If people realize whom he turned loose, the Taliban Five--this is a statement that was made by the Taliban commander. His name is Mullah Khan. He was talking about Mohammad Fazl. Keep in mind he was arguably the most dangerous person-- terrorist--who was being held in Gitmo. He said: His return is like pouring 10,000 Taliban fighters into the battle on the side of jihad. Now the Taliban have the right lion to lead them in the final moment before victory in Afghanistan. These are the kinds of people he is turning loose. According to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, 29 percent of the detainees transferred out of Gitmo have either been confirmed or suspected of returning to the fight and killing Americans. That is how serious this is. Gitmo is outside the sovereign territory of the United States, which means detainees held there do not have constitutional rights. But if we put them back in the United States, it is very likely they would have those rights. I have a quote from former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey, who said: The question of what constitutional rights may apply to aliens in government custody is unsettled, but it is clear from existing jurisprudence that physical presence in the United States would be a significant, if not a decisive, factor. I am also concerned about the security of the people here who would have to guard these terrorists. Back when a Thomson, IL, prison was discussed--that was in 2009-- Representative Mark Kirk--at that time he was in the House; that was before he was in the Senate--called the move ``an unnecessary risk,'' and other Illinois Members were concerned that the transfer of prisoners--some for trial and some for indefinite detention--could make the State a target for terrorists. Mark Kirk was then and is now correct that prisons holding these detainees will become magnets, and there is the very real possibility that these detainees would recruit more terrorists. We have to keep in mind that a terrorist is not a criminal. A terrorist is someone who trains other people to be terrorists, and that is what we would be seeing happening in our courts. FBI Director Robert Mueller said there is the very real possibility that Gitmo detainees will recruit more terrorists from among the Federal inmate population and continue Al Qaeda operations from outside the country. I have been to Gitmo several times, as has the occupier of the chair. It is a state-of-the-art facility that provides humane treatment for all detainees. When I was there, the biggest problem they had with the detainees was that they were overweight. They are all obese because they are eating so well. It is fully in compliance with the Geneva Convention and provides treatment and oversight that exceed any maximum security prison in the world, as tested by human rights organizations such as the Red Cross, Attorney General Holder, and an independent commission led by Admiral Walsh. It is a secure location away from population centers, and it has a $12 million expeditionary legal complex. That is a courtroom. We can't use our courtrooms because of the confidentiality of information that is extracted from these individuals and used in the courtroom, so they use the expeditionary legal complex. The last thing I would say is that it is clear that--and this comes from former CIA Director Leon Panetta. He was talking about the fact that our President--talking about the way they were able to get the bad guy, and what they have refused to understand is the information they extracted at Gitmo was used to actually capture Osama bin Laden. Anyway, we don't want that to happen, we can't afford to let that happen, and we are going to do everything we can to keep the President from making that happen. This has become an obsession of his, and we are not going to let that happen. Burundi Lastly, I do want to mention that on this whole issue in Burundi right now, we have to understand in this country that there are other nations that have their own systems of government. They are the ones that have their elections. In this case, I happened to be there in Burundi when the court declared that the incumbent President, Nkurunziza, was qualified to run again, even though they have a term limit. The first term was not a complete term, so that didn't count, according to the court. For us to come in afterward and say ``Well, we think the court was wrong, we don't think he is qualified to run, and we are going to withhold things from that country'' is something we should not be doing in this country. I can assure my colleagues that the six Members who went with me over there were all on the scene and agreed that Nkurunziza should be legitimately elected, and we should stay out of their business. With that, I yield the floor. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7881-S7884] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DRIVE ACT Mr. McCONNELL.

I have a statement I would like to make at this point in time. If this is the appropriate time to do it, then I would like to do it. I would like to speak for 10 minutes. Mr. McCONNELL. I renew my request. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Mr. CARPER. Reserving the right to object. Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield? Mr. CARPER. I am happy to yield. Mr. INHOFE. There is a lot of mumbling going on. I am not sure what we finally decided to do. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I will speak for 10 minutes on transportation, and then we will have our caucus lunch. Mr. INHOFE. All right. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of the remarks of the Senator from Delaware, I be recognized for up to 10 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Wicker). Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Delaware. Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, something came to my attention today that I haven't seen before. Actually, it is a blog which was apparently written by Ben Bernanke, the immediate past Chairman of the Federal Reserve. He wrote it for the Brookings Institute, and he talked about one of the pay-fors for the transportation bill for which we will be sending conferees to discuss later today. As my colleagues may recall, the House passed a 6-year authorization bill for transportation--roads, highways, bridges, and transit--with funding for 3 years. When we sent our legislation over to the House, they came up with some new pay-fors. Frankly, it is not user fees, it is not even like pension smoothing, it is not like stealing TSA fees or Custom fees, but something new. They found money--about $40 to $50 billion--in the Federal Reserve and said: Why don't we use that for transportation spending? Interestingly enough, the former Chairman of the Federal Reserve has written about this issue, and it has been editorialized in today's Washington Post, among others. I will read a sentence or two out of Chairman Bernanke's comments, if I may, talking about the new pay-for, where we take money from the Federal Reserve and use it for transportation purposes. Here is what Chairman Bernanke says: More substantively--and this is what I want to focus on in the post-- ``paying'' for highway spending with Fed capital is not paying for it at all in any economically meaningful sense. Rather, this maneuver is a form of budgetary sleight-of-hand that would count funds that are already designated for the Treasury as ``new'' revenue. Every year this extra money that the Federal Reserve has is turned over to the Treasury. In fact, it may be as much as one-half trillion dollars. That money goes into the earnings that the Federal Reserve makes, and at different points during the year, they turn money over to the Treasury. What the House language says here is that we are going to reduce that amount of money that would normally go from the Federal Reserve to the Treasury during some part of this year, and we are simply going to pull that money out and use it for transportation. Now, that money was going to go to the Treasury anyway. It was going to go from the Federal Reserve to Treasury anyway, and now we are going to sort of slip in and pull that money out and say: No, no, we are going to use it for roads, highways, and bridges. It is a sleight of hand. GAO is blowing the whistle on it as well, and I am delighted Chairman Bernanke is calling it for what it is. Look, we had the opportunity to pay for transportation projects. We had the opportunity to pay for roads, highways, and bridges, and to do it the old-fashioned way, and frankly, in a way that the chairman of our committee, Senator Inhofe, was in favor of. We have a tradition and history in this country of saying that things that are worth having are worth paying for, and people and businesses that use roads, highways, and bridges here in the past have said we ought to pay for the use of them. Now we are looking at a transportation bill that says: No, we are going to take money from TSA--TSA fee increases--and instead of using it to make our skies and aviation safer, we are going to steal 10 years of TSA revenues and put it over here in transportation. We are going to take money that ought to go to fortify our borders to make us stronger and better equipped so we can do a better job of finding out whether what is in the trucks is really produce or some other product, such as narcotics--our border crossings, where we have literally tens of millions of dollars' worth of trade going through trade every day--and instead we are going to take those revenues and put them into transportation. There is the idea of taking money out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, where we pay $80 to $90 to $100 a barrel and are now selling it for about half that and using the proceeds from that--buy high, sell low--to pay for transportation. The latest trick from the House is to take the money out of the Federal Reserve when it is already going to go to Treasury anyway. Instead, we are going to take that money away from the Federal Reserve and pretend like it has no consequence. Well, actually that $50 or $60 billion would have reduced the deficit. That is where it would have gone. This is not the way to do business. We had the opportunity to fully fund a robust transportation plan. Several of us--Senator Durbin, Senator Feinstein, and I--offered legislation, very much like Bowles- Simpson, that would actually restore the purchasing power of the gas and diesel taxes in this country. We have not raised them since 1993. Since 1993, the Federal gasoline tax has been roughly 18 cents. It is now worth less than a dime because of inflation. The diesel tax, since 1993, is worth less than 15 cents. Nominally, it is 23 cents. Meanwhile, roads, highways, and bridges are more expensive. Asphalt is more expensive, as is concrete, steel, and labor. Instead of being able to fund transportation in a genuine, honest kind of way, we are spending about $50 billion a year at the Federal level for transportation. It is about one-third of what is being spent nationally. Out of that $50 billion, we are only raising $35 billion through our user fees, and we just go out and borrow the money for the rest. When we run out of money in the general fund, we go around the world and borrow money from China and other places so that we can build roads, highways, and bridges. When the Chinese are mucking around in the South China Sea or the Spratly Islands or some of those other places, we say: You can't do that. They say: We thought you wanted to borrow our money. If they are manipulating their currency or dumping their goods and products into our markets, we say: You can't do that. They say: We thought you wanted to borrow our money. We should not be beholden to them or to anybody else. We should fully fund transportation projects, and we could do that. The legislation that Senators Feinstein, Durbin, and I offered would gradually raise the tax on diesel and gasoline by 4 cents a year for 4 years, and then index it going forward. How much money would that generate? That would generate about $220 billion over the next 10 years. Our roads, highway, and bridges get D-plus these days. Why? Because about a quarter of our bridges are in bad shape and the service of our roads and highways is as well. People say they don't want to pay any more money for user fees on gas or diesel. Well, people paid less than $2 a gallon for gasoline at about 30,000 gas stations across America last week. My friends, as it turns out, if we actually did raise the price for gas and diesel by 4 cents a year for 4 years, what would the effect be in 2020--4 years from now--for average drivers? The out-of-pocket impact would be about the cost of a cup of coffee a week. Meanwhile, because our roads, bridges, and highways are in such lousy [[Page S7883]] shape, we, as constituents--people who drive around this country--have an average cost of damage to our vehicles, tires, steering, and rims of our tires of over $350 a year. That is not my number; that is a real number. The other thing that is going on here is that we sit in traffic a lot in our country these days because we are not addressing our bottlenecks and doing what we ought to be doing in terms of upgrading our roads, highways, and bridges. Every year Texas A&M does an analysis. What they do is to look at how much time we sit in traffic in this country. The average driver in this country sits in traffic 42 hours a year. In cities such as Washington, DC, the numbers are more like 80 hours a year. We are not moving. We are just sitting there wasting time, wasting fuel, and polluting the skies. We don't have to do that. Instead of doing something that is intellectually honest, what we are doing is really, I think, shameful. I think it is shameful. Initially, I was just confused by what the House wants to do with the Federal Reserve by moving $50 to $60 billion out of there. Now that I understand what they are doing, it is even more shameful. We can do better than this, and the American people deserve better than that. Our friends at the McKinsey Global Institute spent some time last year trying to figure out if we were actually investing robustly in our roads, highways, and bridges in this country. They looked at how it would affect our GDP and if it would have any effect on putting people to work. If we are willing to make robust investments for the next 10 years instead of, frankly, not much at all in terms of investments, here is what they said: We would grow GDP by about 1.5 percent per year for the next 10 years. So far this year it has been somewhere between 2 and 2.5 percent. We could increase it by another 1.5 percent if we make these kinds of honest investments. We are not going to come close to making robust investments. The McKinsey Global Institute also told us that in terms of new employment, if we were actually to invest robustly in roads, highways, and bridges in this country, we would put 1.8 million people to work building roads, highways, bridges, and transit systems. But we are not going to do that. We are not even close to what the McKinsey Global Institute was calling for in robust investments that would actually grow our GDP by 1.5 percent each year and increase employment by 1.8 million people. In fact, what we are passing here isn't even close to the 4 cents a year for 4 years and indexing going forward. That produces $220 billion over the next 10 years. What we are doing is barely keeping Federal funding at $50 billion, and the way we are doing most of that is by sleight of hand and by using money that has nothing to do with roads, highways, and bridges and nothing to do with businesses and people that use those transportation modes to pay for them--nothing. And now we are about to name conferees and go to conference on that kind of deal? The American people aren't stupid. They are not stupid. Do you know what a bunch of States around the country--like 12 States in the last 2 years--did when they found out they were running out of money to build their transportation systems in their States? They raised their user fees. They actually raised them. Do you know what happened when they had elections last November? Some 95 percent of the Republicans who voted to raise their user fees were reelected, and 90 percent of the Democrats who voted to raise their user fees in those 12 States were reelected. They didn't pay a penalty for it. They were rewarded for it. The people who voted the other way-- who voted not to raise the user fees--didn't do as well. People aren't stupid. We are going to have an opportunity here to name conferees and go to conference, and I just want to say that this man sitting next to me, Jim Inhofe, is a good man. He chairs our Environment and Public Works Committee. Our committee reported out a very good 6-year authorization bill. He is proud of it. Senator Boxer and I worked on it, and I am very proud of what we did. I commend Senator Inhofe for a great bill. That is the authorization piece. If we could just stop there, we would be fine. Unfortunately, the authorization is only half the game. What was the picture of the guy they had on the floor not long ago? It was a picture of a cowboy wearing a big hat and lying back sleeping, and the caption under the picture says: All hat, no cattle. Well, when you have a great authorization bill but no real money to pay for it, that is really all hat, no cattle. I don't think there is a better example of it that I have seen than the legislation that we are going to be conferencing on very soon. I wish I could sit here and say it is all going to work out and we will do just fine, but that is not the truth. We have let a great opportunity pass us by. We are about to let a great opportunity pass us by. We are worthy of a better opportunity than that, and frankly the people of our country deserve a better effort than that. With that, I yield the floor to my friend from Oklahoma. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Mr. CARPER. I withdraw my objection. The PRESIDING OFFICER.

With that, I yield the floor. ____________________",package_114_41.csv,24483,24483,24555,"[congressional record volume 161, number 167 (tuesday, november 10, 2015)] [senate] [pages s7881-s7884] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] drive act mr. mcconnell. mr. president, i ask that the chair lay before the senate the house message accompanying h.r. 22. the presiding officer laid before the senate the following message from the house of representatives: resolved, that the house insist upon its amendment to the amendment of the senate to the text of the bill (h.r. 22) entitled ``an act to authorize funds for federal-aid highways, highway safety programs, and transit programs, and for other purposes,'' and ask a conference with the senate on the disagreeing votes of the two houses thereon. compound motion mr. mcconnell. mr. president, i move to disagree to the amendment of the house, agree to the request from the house for a conference, and authorize the presiding officer to appoint conferees. cloture motion mr. mcconnell. mr. president, i send a cloture motion to the desk. the presiding officer. the cloture motion having been presented under rule xxii, the chair directs the clerk to read the motion. the bill clerk read the following: cloture motion we, the undersigned senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule xxii of the standing rules of the senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to disagree to the amendment of the house, agree to the request from the house for a conference, and authorize the presiding officer to appoint conferees with respect to h.r. 22. mitch mcconnell, mike rounds, lamar alexander, johnny isakson, deb fischer, john cornyn, chuck grassley, thad cochran, joni ernst, cory gardner, john thune, daniel coats, orrin g. hatch, john barrasso, james m. inhofe, thom tillis, roy blunt. mr. mcconnell. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call be waived. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. mcconnell. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the time between 2:15 p.m. and 2:45 p.m. be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees and that notwithstanding rule xxviii, at 2:45 p.m. the senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the compound motion to go to conference; further, that if cloture is invoked, that the senate agree to the compound motion to go to conference and that senator wicker be recognized to offer a motion to instruct the conferees; that there be up to 4 minutes of debate equally divided on the motion and that following the use or yielding back of that time, the senate then vote in relation to the wicker motion; that following the disposition of the wicker motion, senator blumenthal be recognized to offer a motion to instruct the conferees; that there be up to 4 minutes of debate equally divided on the motion and that following the use or yielding back of that time, the senate then vote in relation to the blumenthal motion.

from delaware. mr. carper. mr. president, something came to my attention today that i haven't seen before. actually, it is a blog which was apparently written by ben bernanke, the immediate past chairman of the federal reserve. he wrote it for the brookings institute, and he talked about one of the pay-fors for the transportation bill for which we will be sending conferees to discuss later today. as my colleagues may recall, the house passed a 6-year authorization bill for transportation--roads, highways, bridges, and transit--with funding for 3 years. when we sent our legislation over to the house, they came up with some new pay-fors. frankly, it is not user fees, it is not even like pension smoothing, it is not like stealing tsa fees or custom fees, but something new. they found money--about $40 to $50 billion--in the federal reserve and said: why don't we use that for transportation spending? interestingly enough, the former chairman of the federal reserve has written about this issue, and it has been editorialized in today's washington post, among others. i will read a sentence or two out of chairman bernanke's comments, if i may, talking about the new pay-for, where we take money from the federal reserve and use it for transportation purposes. here is what chairman bernanke says: more substantively--and this is what i want to focus on in the post-- ``paying'' for highway spending with fed capital is not paying for it at all in any economically meaningful sense. rather, this maneuver is a form of budgetary sleight-of-hand that would count funds that are already designated for the treasury as ``new'' revenue. every year this extra money that the federal reserve has is turned over to the treasury. in fact, it may be as much as one-half trillion dollars. that money goes into the earnings that the federal reserve makes, and at different points during the year, they turn money over to the treasury. what the house language says here is that we are going to reduce that amount of money that would normally go from the federal reserve to the treasury during some part of this year, and we are simply going to pull that money out and use it for transportation. now, that money was going to go to the treasury anyway. it was going to go from the federal reserve to treasury anyway, and now we are going to sort of slip in and pull that money out and say: no, no, we are going to use it for roads, highways, and bridges. it is a sleight of hand. gao is blowing the whistle on it as well, and i am delighted chairman bernanke is calling it for what it is. look, we had the opportunity to pay for transportation projects. we had the opportunity to pay for roads, highways, and bridges, and to do it the old-fashioned way, and frankly, in a way that the chairman of our committee, senator inhofe, was in favor of. we have a tradition and history in this country of saying that things that are worth having are worth paying for, and people and businesses that use roads, highways, and bridges here in the past have said we ought to pay for the use of them. now we are looking at a transportation bill that says: no, we are going to take money from tsa--tsa fee increases--and instead of using it to make our skies and aviation safer, we are going to steal 10 years of tsa revenues and put it over here in transportation. we are going to take money that ought to go to fortify our borders to make us stronger and better equipped so we can do a better job of finding out whether what is in the trucks is really produce or some other product, such as narcotics--our border crossings, where we have literally tens of millions of dollars' worth of trade going through trade every day--and instead we are going to take those revenues and put them into transportation. there is the idea of taking money out of the strategic petroleum reserve, where we pay $80 to $90 to $100 a barrel and are now selling it for about half that and using the proceeds from that--buy high, sell low--to pay for transportation. the latest trick from the house is to take the money out of the federal reserve when it is already going to go to treasury anyway. instead, we are going to take that money away from the federal reserve and pretend like it has no consequence. well, actually that $50 or $60 billion would have reduced the deficit. that is where it would have gone. this is not the way to do business. we had the opportunity to fully fund a robust transportation plan. several of us--senator durbin, senator feinstein, and i--offered legislation, very much like bowles- simpson, that would actually restore the purchasing power of the gas and diesel taxes in this country. we have not raised them since 1993. since 1993, the federal gasoline tax has been roughly 18 cents. it is now worth less than a dime because of inflation. the diesel tax, since 1993, is worth less than 15 cents. nominally, it is 23 cents. meanwhile, roads, highways, and bridges are more expensive. asphalt is more expensive, as is concrete, steel, and labor. instead of being able to fund transportation in a genuine, honest kind of way, we are spending about $50 billion a year at the federal level for transportation. it is about one-third of what is being spent nationally. out of that $50 billion, we are only raising $35 billion through our user fees, and we just go out and borrow the money for the rest. when we run out of money in the general fund, we go around the world and borrow money from china and other places so that we can build roads, highways, and bridges. when the chinese are mucking around in the south china sea or the spratly islands or some of those other places, we say: you can't do that. they say: we thought you wanted to borrow our money. if they are manipulating their currency or dumping their goods and products into our markets, we say: you can't do that. they say: we thought you wanted to borrow our money. we should not be beholden to them or to anybody else. we should fully fund transportation projects, and we could do that. the legislation that senators feinstein, durbin, and i offered would gradually raise the tax on diesel and gasoline by 4 cents a year for 4 years, and then index it going forward. how much money would that generate? that would generate about $220 billion over the next 10 years. our roads, highway, and bridges get d-plus these days. why? because about a quarter of our bridges are in bad shape and the service of our roads and highways is as well. people say they don't want to pay any more money for user fees on gas or diesel. well, people paid less than $2 a gallon for gasoline at about 30,000 gas stations across america last week. my friends, as it turns out, if we actually did raise the price for gas and diesel by 4 cents a year for 4 years, what would the effect be in 2020--4 years from now--for average drivers? the out-of-pocket impact would be about the cost of a cup of coffee a week. meanwhile, because our roads, bridges, and highways are in such lousy [[page s7883]] shape, we, as constituents--people who drive around this country--have an average cost of damage to our vehicles, tires, steering, and rims of our tires of over $350 a year. that is not my number; that is a real number. the other thing that is going on here is that we sit in traffic a lot in our country these days because we are not addressing our bottlenecks and doing what we ought to be doing in terms of upgrading our roads, highways, and bridges. every year texas a&m does an analysis. what they do is to look at how much time we sit in traffic in this country. the average driver in this country sits in traffic 42 hours a year. in cities such as washington, dc, the numbers are more like 80 hours a year. we are not moving. we are just sitting there wasting time, wasting fuel, and polluting the skies. we don't have to do that. instead of doing something that is intellectually honest, what we are doing is really, i think, shameful. i think it is shameful. initially, i was just confused by what the house wants to do with the federal reserve by moving $50 to $60 billion out of there. now that i understand what they are doing, it is even more shameful. we can do better than this, and the american people deserve better than that. our friends at the mckinsey global institute spent some time last year trying to figure out if we were actually investing robustly in our roads, highways, and bridges in this country. they looked at how it would affect our gdp and if it would have any effect on putting people to work. if we are willing to make robust investments for the next 10 years instead of, frankly, not much at all in terms of investments, here is what they said: we would grow gdp by about 1.5 percent per year for the next 10 years. so far this year it has been somewhere between 2 and 2.5 percent. we could increase it by another 1.5 percent if we make these kinds of honest investments. we are not going to come close to making robust investments. the mckinsey global institute also told us that in terms of new employment, if we were actually to invest robustly in roads, highways, and bridges in this country, we would put 1.8 million people to work building roads, highways, bridges, and transit systems. but we are not going to do that. we are not even close to what the mckinsey global institute was calling for in robust investments that would actually grow our gdp by 1.5 percent each year and increase employment by 1.8 million people. in fact, what we are passing here isn't even close to the 4 cents a year for 4 years and indexing going forward. that produces $220 billion over the next 10 years. what we are doing is barely keeping federal funding at $50 billion, and the way we are doing most of that is by sleight of hand and by using money that has nothing to do with roads, highways, and bridges and nothing to do with businesses and people that use those transportation modes to pay for them--nothing. and now we are about to name conferees and go to conference on that kind of deal? the american people aren't stupid. they are not stupid. do you know what a bunch of states around the country--like 12 states in the last 2 years--did when they found out they were running out of money to build their transportation systems in their states? they raised their user fees. they actually raised them. do you know what happened when they had elections last november? some 95 percent of the republicans who voted to raise their user fees were reelected, and 90 percent of the democrats who voted to raise their user fees in those 12 states were reelected. they didn't pay a penalty for it. they were rewarded for it. the people who voted the other way-- who voted not to raise the user fees--didn't do as well. people aren't stupid. we are going to have an opportunity here to name conferees and go to conference, and i just want to say that this man sitting next to me, jim inhofe, is a good man. he chairs our environment and public works committee. our committee reported out a very good 6-year authorization bill. he is proud of it. senator boxer and i worked on it, and i am very proud of what we did. i commend senator inhofe for a great bill. that is the authorization piece. if we could just stop there, we would be fine. unfortunately, the authorization is only half the game. what was the picture of the guy they had on the floor not long ago? it was a picture of a cowboy wearing a big hat and lying back sleeping, and the caption under the picture says: all hat, no cattle. well, when you have a great authorization bill but no real money to pay for it, that is really all hat, no cattle. i don't think there is a better example of it that i have seen than the legislation that we are going to be conferencing on very soon. i wish i could sit here and say it is all going to work out and we will do just fine, but that is not the truth. we have let a great opportunity pass us by. we are about to let a great opportunity pass us by. we are worthy of a better opportunity than that, and frankly the people of our country deserve a better effort than that. with that, i yield the floor to my friend from oklahoma. the presiding officer. is there objection to the request? mr. carper. i withdraw my objection. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. the senator from oklahoma. mr. inhofe. mr. president, let me say in response that a couple of times my good friend from delaware has observed that the american people are not stupid, but the american people also want highways. that is one of the big things they want. in fact, we have a document called a constitution that says we are supposed to be doing two things here: defending america, and roads and bridges. and i think we both agree on the significance of that. burundi i hope i will have time to get into something because our state department of the united states of america is getting involved in burundi, in their election. they had a duly-qualified election. the constitutional convention declared that nkurunziza, who is the president, had a legal election, and we ought to stay out of their business. if there is time, i would like to elaborate on that, but i know i am competing for time. gitmo on the president's gitmo message, we have--i will give a little chronology on that. on january 22, 2009, obama signed an executive order to close gitmo within the year. on february 3 of that same year, 2009, i introduced a bill to permanently prevent gitmo detainees from being relocated anywhere in the united states. at that time they were ready to talk about relocating them to parts of my state of oklahoma, in the fort sill area. in may 2009 i authored bipartisan legislation with senator danny inouye to block funding to close gitmo and to move the detainees anywhere on u.s. soil. that passed 90 to 6. every year since, congress has blocked the attempts by this president and his administration to close gitmo or move terrorist detainees into the united states. every year, congress has passed laws that continue to limit the transfer of these detainees, including in the conference report for the fiscal year 2016 ndaa bill. that is what we are talking about right now. it prohibits the transferring of gitmo detainees to the united states through december 31, 2016. that also tightens the restrictions on the detainees being transferred to other countries. the fiscal year ndaa also included language preventing closure of gitmo through december 31, 2016. however, this has not prevented president obama from trying to empty gitmo and releasing these terrorist detainees to any country he can pay to take them back and now threatening an executive order to bring them to the united states--to the states of colorado, south carolina, and kansas--against the will of the senators from those states, the house members from those states, and the american people. this is not the first time the president has gone against the will of the american people and violated our laws. the president violated the law last june when he transferred the taliban five from gitmo in exchange for sergeant bergdahl, and my colleagues will [[page s7884]] remember that issue. he failed to notify congress. the laws we passed said they had to notify congress 30 days in advance of any transfer of terrorists to any facility. his failure to adhere to the law he signed placed our nation's security at great risk. let me just mention--i carry this with me. if people realize whom he turned loose, the taliban five--this is a statement that was made by the taliban commander. his name is mullah khan. he was talking about mohammad fazl. keep in mind he was arguably the most dangerous person-- terrorist--who was being held in gitmo. he said: his return is like pouring 10,000 taliban fighters into the battle on the side of jihad. now the taliban have the right lion to lead them in the final moment before victory in afghanistan. these are the kinds of people he is turning loose. according to the office of the director of national intelligence, 29 percent of the detainees transferred out of gitmo have either been confirmed or suspected of returning to the fight and killing americans. that is how serious this is. gitmo is outside the sovereign territory of the united states, which means detainees held there do not have constitutional rights. but if we put them back in the united states, it is very likely they would have those rights. i have a quote from former u.s. attorney general michael mukasey, who said: the question of what constitutional rights may apply to aliens in government custody is unsettled, but it is clear from existing jurisprudence that physical presence in the united states would be a significant, if not a decisive, factor. i am also concerned about the security of the people here who would have to guard these terrorists. back when a thomson, il, prison was discussed--that was in 2009-- representative mark kirk--at that time he was in the house; that was before he was in the senate--called the move ``an unnecessary risk,'' and other illinois members were concerned that the transfer of prisoners--some for trial and some for indefinite detention--could make the state a target for terrorists. mark kirk was then and is now correct that prisons holding these detainees will become magnets, and there is the very real possibility that these detainees would recruit more terrorists. we have to keep in mind that a terrorist is not a criminal. a terrorist is someone who trains other people to be terrorists, and that is what we would be seeing happening in our courts. fbi director robert mueller said there is the very real possibility that gitmo detainees will recruit more terrorists from among the federal inmate population and continue al qaeda operations from outside the country. i have been to gitmo several times, as has the occupier of the chair. it is a state-of-the-art facility that provides humane treatment for all detainees. when i was there, the biggest problem they had with the detainees was that they were overweight. they are all obese because they are eating so well. it is fully in compliance with the geneva convention and provides treatment and oversight that exceed any maximum security prison in the world, as tested by human rights organizations such as the red cross, attorney general holder, and an independent commission led by admiral walsh. it is a secure location away from population centers, and it has a $12 million expeditionary legal complex. that is a courtroom. we can't use our courtrooms because of the confidentiality of information that is extracted from these individuals and used in the courtroom, so they use the expeditionary legal complex. the last thing i would say is that it is clear that--and this comes from former cia director leon panetta. he was talking about the fact that our president--talking about the way they were able to get the bad guy, and what they have refused to understand is the information they extracted at gitmo was used to actually capture osama bin laden. anyway, we don't want that to happen, we can't afford to let that happen, and we are going to do everything we can to keep the president from making that happen. this has become an obsession of his, and we are not going to let that happen. burundi lastly, i do want to mention that on this whole issue in burundi right now, we have to understand in this country that there are other nations that have their own systems of government. they are the ones that have their elections. in this case, i happened to be there in burundi when the court declared that the incumbent president, nkurunziza, was qualified to run again, even though they have a term limit. the first term was not a complete term, so that didn't count, according to the court. for us to come in afterward and say ``well, we think the court was wrong, we don't think he is qualified to run, and we are going to withhold things from that country'' is something we should not be doing in this country. i can assure my colleagues that the six members who went with me over there were all on the scene and agreed that nkurunziza should be legitimately elected, and we should stay out of their business. with that, i yield the floor. ____________________",24483

CREC-2015-11-10-pt1-PgS7887-2,CREC-2015-11-10,114,VETERANS DAY AND LEGISLATION SUPPORTING OUR VETERANS AND TROOPS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7887-S7888] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VETERANS DAY AND LEGISLATION SUPPORTING OUR VETERANS AND TROOPS Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I am honored to represent nearly 500,000 Missouri veterans in the Senate. Tomorrow, on Veterans Day, we pause to reflect on the countless contributions and sacrifices that the men and women who serve in uniform and have served in uniform have made to our country. I hope we will all use this opportunity to recommit ourselves not only to appreciate their service but to be sure that the commitments our government has made to them are commitments that we move forward on and that they are commitments that we look at the time, place, and the veterans being served and decide when they need to be changed. I think one of the things we have done in the last year to create more choices and more competition for veterans is an important step in that direction. When I introduced the Excellence in Mental Health Act with Senator Stabenow, one of our biggest support groups for that act, which not only would treat behavioral health care like all other health care but would also create more opportunities to access behavioral health care, were the younger veterans. The Iraq and Iran veterans and the veterans from Afghanistan wanted to have more choices and were big supporters of not just traditional VA services but other services as well. I am pleased that the bill today steps forward in important ways and does things for veterans. The bill we just voted on, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill, actually reached a record level of funding for veterans services. It increases veterans services by $7.9 billion over last year's levels, and it appropriates $1 billion more than the President asked for. It was also a bipartisan vote for lots of reasons. There should be no more of a bipartisan cause among all the funding bills than a bill that takes care of veterans and provides the facilities for those who are serving and for their families' needs. This is an important matter for us to address, and this is a great week for us to do it. This bill provides specific funding for women veterans. I was at a women's veterans clinic in St. Louis recently. This bill includes additional care for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. It provides treatment for the kinds of traumatic brain injuries that veterans often leave the military with today, which they did not have post-9/11 and post the cowardly devices that are used to attack our people in the service. It increases veterans funding in areas such as health care, benefit claims processing, medical research, and technology upgrades. It also includes funding for construction and renovation of projects that ensure military readiness and improve the quality of life for military families. As GEN Ray Odierno, the recently retired Chief of Staff of the Army, has said, our military families are the strength of the military. Senator Gillibrand and I recently introduced a bill--The Military Families Stability Act--that allows us to do new things. It allows families for educational or professional reasons to stay longer or leave earlier, depending on when the person serving gets transferred. If there is a month of school left or a professional matter that the spouse needs to be a part of and needs to finish a job quickly or go to a job early, why wouldn't we want to allow that to happen through legislation? This legislation looks at military families' needs, among the other things it looks at. Because of the dissatisfaction that many of our veterans appropriately have with the Veterans' Administration, this bill includes necessary reforms such as protection for whistleblowers, the kind of protection that construction oversight managers need, and it assesses some new measures for construction oversight so that we don't have these facilities costing more than they should cost. Frankly, if we look at competitive alternatives that veterans should have available to them, it is probably a good time to think about how we could make that program work better--rather than to continue to invest more money in facilities that they have to drive by--with better locations to get to that would give them that choice. This bill has been ready for months now. I was disappointed the Democrats blocked consideration of this bill earlier this year, but I am pleased that we finally got to a bill that everybody could vote for. It actually shows how shortsighted the lack of willingness was to let us do our work, to bring this [[Page S7888]] bill to the floor, and to let Members offer amendments. Those amendments were either included in the bill or explained to Members: No, this is already in there. We have already taken care of this, and this is why this doesn't have to be done. We have a real obligation to take care of our veterans--those who have served for our country--and I hope we continue to build on the work we have done today. Earlier today we also passed the bipartisan Defense Authorization Act, another bill we could have gotten to earlier. In fact, the House passed it earlier. The President vetoed it, but now that same essential bill goes back to the President's desk because some other problem has been solved that should never have been tied to authorizing the defense of the country. Every year since 2011, the Congress has passed and the President has signed a bill just like the bill we passed today that would make it clear to the President that the Congress doesn't want the President to go forward with his proposed changes for Guantanamo. Unfortunately, the media reports suggest that the President once again is considering acting unilaterally to bring terrorists to the United States. Both of these bills today said no terrorist can be brought to the United States from Guantanamo. It is another example of the President ignoring the law, deciding instead: I am going to enforce the law I want to enforce, and I am going to ignore the law I want to ignore. He did that a few months ago with Executive amnesty. The President decided there are some laws that relate to people who are in the country and who are here without documents that he doesn't intend to enforce. Unfortunately for the President and fortunately for the law, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled last night that the President can't do what the President said he was going to do. An earlier court had immediately said the President can't do what he said he was going to do. This morning, I heard one of the spokesmen for the White House say: Well, every legal expert we have talked to believes the President has the authority to do this. Well, apparently none of the legal experts they have talked to are Federal judges, because Federal judges now, at the two levels below the Supreme Court, have decided that the President doesn't have, in all likelihood, the authority he says he has. The courts, along with a bipartisan majority of the Congress, have taken the President to task on a sweeping new rule on waters of the United States--an issue we debated here last week. The law says the EPA has the authority to regulate navigable waters in the country. For 170 years everybody understood what that meant, and I think everybody still probably understands what that means, even the people at the EPA, who want it to mean something much broader than it clearly means. The Federal courts, again, at both the first level and the appeals level-- the appeal of the appeal court and the appeal court have said: No, you don't have the authority to do that. We are not going to let that rule go into effect. That rule, by the way, in my State would put more than 99 percent of all of the geography of Missouri under the control of the EPA for anything that is related to water, including any water that runs off a roof, any water that runs off a parking lot, any water that runs down a roadside ditch. If the EPA wants that authority, they need to come to the Congress and say: Change the law. Give us the authority over all of the landmass, 99.3 percent of Missouri and similar amounts in many other States. Give us that authority. Of course, the Congress wouldn't do that. The Congress knew what they were doing when they said ``navigable waters,'' and the EPA has never suggested to the Congress that the Congress change the law. The EPA would like to change it on their own, but the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals said: No, you don't have the authority to do that. Here is another issue that has to go to the Supreme Court. Apparently, the President doesn't mind going to the Supreme Court and doesn't mind being reversed by the Supreme Court. The President particularly, it appears, doesn't mind being reversed by the Supreme Court if somehow the rules got by the other two levels of Federal court, as the mercury rule did 2 years ago. Twenty-two months later, when the Supreme Court finally ruled, they said: No, the EPA doesn't have the authority to regulate that item in that way. But even people at the EPA said: Well, even though we didn't have the authority, 1,500 powerplants had to close down permanently because of the rule. And they seemed to take great pleasure in the fact that the rule accomplished its goal even though the law was not served and the EPA, according to the Supreme Court, didn't have the authority for that rule. On the President's overreach, I reintroduced a law again this year-- the Executive Needs to Faithfully Observe and Respect Congressional Enactments of the Law Act--the ENFORCE Act--which simply says something one would never think the Congress would have to say to the President, which is: Mr. President, you have to enforce the law. Mr. President, you have taken an oath to uphold the Constitution. There is a way to do this job in a constitutional way, and there is a way to do the job in the way you are doing it now. We shouldn't need this bill. The President swore to uphold the law. With the action we took today, we see another place where the Congress has clearly spoken over and over and over again, and the President says: If the Congress won't do this, I am going to do it on my own. Apparently, the President has discovered some authority as Commander in Chief to close military bases. Does that mean the President on his own can close any military base in the country? I don't think that is a precedent we want to set. There is a way to do this. The Congress has to be involved. The laws of the Constitution have to be respected. Over and over again, even on the eve of Veterans Day--a celebration of those who did more than anybody else to defend our freedoms--even on the eve of Veterans Day, we need to remind ourselves what the Constitution is all about, what the country stands for, and the freedoms those veterans were willing to serve to defend. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7887-S7888] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VETERANS DAY AND LEGISLATION SUPPORTING OUR VETERANS AND TROOPS Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I am honored to represent nearly 500,000 Missouri veterans in the Senate. Tomorrow, on Veterans Day, we pause to reflect on the countless contributions and sacrifices that the men and women who serve in uniform and have served in uniform have made to our country. I hope we will all use this opportunity to recommit ourselves not only to appreciate their service but to be sure that the commitments our government has made to them are commitments that we move forward on and that they are commitments that we look at the time, place, and the veterans being served and decide when they need to be changed. I think one of the things we have done in the last year to create more choices and more competition for veterans is an important step in that direction. When I introduced the Excellence in Mental Health Act with Senator Stabenow, one of our biggest support groups for that act, which not only would treat behavioral health care like all other health care but would also create more opportunities to access behavioral health care, were the younger veterans. The Iraq and Iran veterans and the veterans from Afghanistan wanted to have more choices and were big supporters of not just traditional VA services but other services as well. I am pleased that the bill today steps forward in important ways and does things for veterans. The bill we just voted on, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill, actually reached a record level of funding for veterans services. It increases veterans services by $7.9 billion over last year's levels, and it appropriates $1 billion more than the President asked for. It was also a bipartisan vote for lots of reasons. There should be no more of a bipartisan cause among all the funding bills than a bill that takes care of veterans and provides the facilities for those who are serving and for their families' needs. This is an important matter for us to address, and this is a great week for us to do it. This bill provides specific funding for women veterans. I was at a women's veterans clinic in St. Louis recently. This bill includes additional care for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. It provides treatment for the kinds of traumatic brain injuries that veterans often leave the military with today, which they did not have post-9/11 and post the cowardly devices that are used to attack our people in the service. It increases veterans funding in areas such as health care, benefit claims processing, medical research, and technology upgrades. It also includes funding for construction and renovation of projects that ensure military readiness and improve the quality of life for military families. As GEN Ray Odierno, the recently retired Chief of Staff of the Army, has said, our military families are the strength of the military. Senator Gillibrand and I recently introduced a bill--The Military Families Stability Act--that allows us to do new things. It allows families for educational or professional reasons to stay longer or leave earlier, depending on when the person serving gets transferred. If there is a month of school left or a professional matter that the spouse needs to be a part of and needs to finish a job quickly or go to a job early, why wouldn't we want to allow that to happen through legislation? This legislation looks at military families' needs, among the other things it looks at. Because of the dissatisfaction that many of our veterans appropriately have with the Veterans' Administration, this bill includes necessary reforms such as protection for whistleblowers, the kind of protection that construction oversight managers need, and it assesses some new measures for construction oversight so that we don't have these facilities costing more than they should cost. Frankly, if we look at competitive alternatives that veterans should have available to them, it is probably a good time to think about how we could make that program work better--rather than to continue to invest more money in facilities that they have to drive by--with better locations to get to that would give them that choice. This bill has been ready for months now. I was disappointed the Democrats blocked consideration of this bill earlier this year, but I am pleased that we finally got to a bill that everybody could vote for. It actually shows how shortsighted the lack of willingness was to let us do our work, to bring this [[Page S7888]] bill to the floor, and to let Members offer amendments. Those amendments were either included in the bill or explained to Members: No, this is already in there. We have already taken care of this, and this is why this doesn't have to be done. We have a real obligation to take care of our veterans--those who have served for our country--and I hope we continue to build on the work we have done today. Earlier today we also passed the bipartisan Defense Authorization Act, another bill we could have gotten to earlier. In fact, the House passed it earlier. The President vetoed it, but now that same essential bill goes back to the President's desk because some other problem has been solved that should never have been tied to authorizing the defense of the country. Every year since 2011, the Congress has passed and the President has signed a bill just like the bill we passed today that would make it clear to the President that the Congress doesn't want the President to go forward with his proposed changes for Guantanamo. Unfortunately, the media reports suggest that the President once again is considering acting unilaterally to bring terrorists to the United States. Both of these bills today said no terrorist can be brought to the United States from Guantanamo. It is another example of the President ignoring the law, deciding instead: I am going to enforce the law I want to enforce, and I am going to ignore the law I want to ignore. He did that a few months ago with Executive amnesty. The President decided there are some laws that relate to people who are in the country and who are here without documents that he doesn't intend to enforce. Unfortunately for the President and fortunately for the law, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled last night that the President can't do what the President said he was going to do. An earlier court had immediately said the President can't do what he said he was going to do. This morning, I heard one of the spokesmen for the White House say: Well, every legal expert we have talked to believes the President has the authority to do this.

clearly spoken over and over and over again, and the president says: if the congress won't do this, i am going to do it on my own. apparently, the president has discovered some authority as commander in chief to close military bases. does that mean the president on his own can close any military base in the country? i don't think that is a precedent we want to set. there is a way to do this. the congress has to be involved. the laws of the constitution have to be respected. over and over again, even on the eve of veterans day--a celebration of those who did more than anybody else to defend our freedoms--even on the eve of veterans day, we need to remind ourselves what the constitution is all about, what the country stands for, and the freedoms those veterans were willing to serve to defend. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from rhode island. ____________________",11091
CREC-2015-11-10-pt1-PgS7888,CREC-2015-11-10,114,CLIMATE CHANGE,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7888-S7890] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CLIMATE CHANGE Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, it is my habit to give my ``Time to Wake Up'' speeches once a week when the Senate is in session. It is also a practice of mine to go to other States--particularly States that have Republican Senators--to look at what is happening in the States and get a sense of where the local universities and the local experts are with respect to climate change. My last visit was to Ohio. I have also been to New Hampshire, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, and Iowa. The thing that is common across all of those trips is that there is no denying climate change in those States. The denial is the function of this building, and it is the function of the wall of money the fossil fuel industry has erected around this building. But pick a State university in the country and go there, and we find there is simply not climate denial. I am joined today by my friend Sherrod Brown, Ohio's senior Senator, who was kind enough to accompany me on the trip--on several parts of it, anyway. We went to Cleveland. We had a couple of meetings there together. Another one of my visits was to Lake Erie, which got clobbered by the cyanotic bacteria that shut down Toledo's water system, which is also climate change-related. Let me yield to the Senator from Ohio for a few moments, and then we can talk about Cleveland and the lake. Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Whitehouse. When I introduced Senator Whitehouse to the mayor of Cleveland and to a number of experts in Cleveland, from public health officials, to wind energy entrepreneurs, to community groups to whom climate change matters so much, I introduced him as probably--not just probably--there is no person in the Senate who has done a better job of focusing public attention on the threats of climate change and what it means to our way of life and what it means to our country. I thank Senator Whitehouse for that. [[Page S7889]] I want to point to what happened in Toledo, OH, in 2011. This green color in this picture is algae bloom. This is a small boat that is making its way through the algae bloom. This wasn't even the year Toledo residents lost their water supply. In 2014--last August, 15 months ago--algae blooms were so serious in Lake Erie and in the western basin--Toledo is in the western basin of Lake Erie, Cleveland is sort of central, and then Ashtabula and Erie, PA, are in the eastern basin of Lake Erie. Again, this is not the most serious situation, although the algae bloom is so overwhelming here. This green is all algae bloom. The lake actually should be the color-- where you can see dark blue here, that is normally the color of the lake. We can see the wake of the boat, and that is the normal color of the lake, as the boat plowed through the algae bloom. The problem with Lake Erie is that it is the most vulnerable lake because it is the shallowest lake in the western basin of Lake Erie. In this part of Lake Erie, it is only 30 feet deep. It is fed by the Maumee River, which is the largest tributary of any river into any of the five Great Lakes. Keep in mind that it is 30 feet deep here, fed by farmland and commercial activity and industry and homeowners--greater Toledo in northwest Ohio. Contrast that with Lake Superior. It is 30 feet deep here, and Lake Superior is 600 feet deep on average. And Lake Superior mostly drains forests, so we can see why Cleveland and Toledo are so vulnerable to climate change and so vulnerable to pollution and all that has happened with the algae blooms. People in Toledo--500,000 people lost their drinking water for 2\1/2\ days. People were great, stepping up from all over southern Michigan, eastern Indiana, and northwest Ohio to ship in water for people. But it made such a--it says to us that climate change isn't the only reason this happened, but it is clearly happening. We are seeing this algae bloom worse and worse and worse in hot weather. One other thing about this Great Lake. Lake Erie is only 2 percent of all of the Great Lakes' water--five Great Lakes. Lake Erie is only 2 percent of all the Great Lakes' water because it is shallow and its surface areas are not as big as the others. Fifty percent of the fish of all of the Great Lakes are in Lake Erie because fish will produce and will prosper in shallower, warmer water, but the water was too warm because of climate change and all of the things that came out of that. In this meeting we had with Dr. Aparna Bole--a pediatric specialist at Cleveland's University Hospital--she talked about asthma rates. We heard from others too. I will turn it back to Senator Whitehouse and ask him what he learned from these meetings. He was not just in meetings with people in Cleveland learning about what climate change means there, he also went to the Stone Lab and he can tell us about that. Then he had an amazing meeting at Ohio State University with some of America's amazing climate scientists. I will kick it back to Senator Whitehouse and again thank him for traveling the country every single week and looking for places where climate change has done the most damage in terms that people can understand. His leadership is so important. I thank Senator Whitehouse for the work he has done, and I am so grateful he came to the city of Cleveland and joined us. Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Well, I was very happy to join the Senator. I thought Frank Jackson was extremely impressive on this subject. He pointed out that there are times in life when we simply have to go to the future, and if you decide to hang on to the past, you will fail as a result of missing that curve. He said that the business community in Cleveland was really beginning to get that, beginning to take it on. So he has led with a Cleveland Climate Action Plan, which is one of the best ones in the country. We went to a great place where they are growing lettuce hydroponically, 3, 4 acres in an old building, under an open glass ceiling. They are using captured rain water; they are recycling it. The people there have jobs that pay well. They were the owners of the project and they were really vested in it. Wasn't the morale of the people working there phenomenal? It was terrific. Dr. Aparna Bole, whom Senator Brown mentioned, was very in tune to what was happening in minority communities as a result of climate change from asthma, from heat. She is seeing it with her young patients. She was wonderful, talking about that. At this point, because of toxic ground level ozone and ragweed being triggers for asthma attacks--she has seen so much of that. She said that more than one in five African-American kids in Cleveland has asthma, and she connects it to what is happening in climate change. Of course, we understand that in Rhode Island because we have the same bad air days where we have to have kids stay indoors and elderly people stay indoors, all because of the air coming from the Midwest that has been fouled by these coal-burning powerplants. Out on Lake Erie I met with some of the scientists from Stone Labs and a couple of the lifelong fishing captains who had been out there on the lake. Here are some of the water samples we took while we were out. It is clean now--this is what the water should look like--but back before, when the climate change-driven rain bursts were flooding Lake Erie with phosphorus from the farms in the watershed, there was an explosion of cyanotic bacteria to the point where these guys said driving their boats wasn't like driving through water, it was like driving through pudding, and the wake would slurp over instead of turning the way a regular boat's wake would. One of them had been doing this for 35 years and he said: I don't know this lake any longer. I don't know where the fish are going to be. For 35 years I have fished this lake, and now it is like a stranger to me because of all these changes that are happening. That is exactly what my Rhode Island fishermen are telling me, too, about Narragansett Bay and Rhode Island Sound. We are here with the Senator from Massachusetts. ``Sheldon, it is getting weird out there. Sheldon, this is not my grandfather's ocean.'' We have some responsibilities to pay attention to these people and to listen to them. One of the most impressive parts of the trip was this at Ohio State. Ohio State is host to the Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center named after the famous polar explorer Admiral Byrd. These two scientists, Ellen Mosley-Thompson and Lonnie Thompson, have spent their lives traveling all over the planet going to these incredible, faraway places--the North Pole, the South Pole, to the Greenland icecap, going to glaciers high in Peru, going to glaciers in the faraway mountains of China. They drill down and take a core sample out of the glacier and get hundreds of thousands of years of data in that core sample. Then there you are on the top of a glacier in Peru or China, and you have to figure out how to get this core sample back to Ohio--and it has to stay frozen the whole time. So they had this huge logistical challenge. They conquered all of that. They are two amazing people. These are all the core samples from glaciers all around the globe. Some of them, because of the way climate has dissipated the glaciers, where they drilled the core sample the glacier doesn't exist anymore. It is the last record of gone glaciers. Here is a picture they had. This is the same site. On this side is a picture of the glacier. You can see striations from the seasons and years going by, and they took this picture from the same place. You can see how the glacier used to be right in front of them and now this glacier is off in the distance. It has moved back as the climate has warmed. They gave me this. This is a piece of plant matter. You can hardly see it. It is plants that were unearthed as the glacier moved back, and they can date them. Those plants were last out 6,626 years ago, when a snow covered those plants. Snow piled on to snow and it was buried under the glacier. It stayed and it stayed, and thousands of years went by. Then, after thousands of years had gone by, Jesus came and walked the Earth, and then thousands more years came by, and now the glaciers are melting so fast that here it is. You can look, and you can still see the leaves. It is squashed and old, but it hasn't decomposed because of the way [[Page S7890]] it was preserved under the glacier that is going away now. In this laboratory they have this incredible treasure. You can go in and you can find air that was on this planet when Jesus walked the Earth, and it is still preserved just the way it was in the ice. You can find dust from dust storms that were written about in Egyptian hieroglyphics, and there is the actual dust held in the ice. This is the record that the climate science is based on, and it truly is a marvel. The last thing I will mention is that we also stopped by the Ohio State Center for Automotive Research. Here is a brandnew Camaro in the background. They work with GM to get cars brand-spanking-new, a high- performance American Camaro. These students are going to take it apart and put it back together so it runs cheaper, faster, and with less fuel. They are going to make a hybrid Camaro with the same level of performance, and it is really very impressive what they are doing. They know climate change is here. That is why they are doing this stuff. I will close out because I have other Senators waiting, but I thank Senator Brown for taking me around Cleveland, meeting all the people we did, and taking me on those visits. I thank the folks at Ohio State. Stone Labs out on Lake Erie is an Ohio State facility. The Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center is an Ohio State facility. I met with the John Glenn Institute folks at Ohio State University. Look, if you are a Buckeye fan and you are listening, pay attention to what Ohio University says about climate change. Don't listen to the fossil fuel phonies. Listen to what your home State university says. These guys are deadly serious. They know it is real. I don't think there is a home State university in this country that is denying climate change, and yet this body is stuck in denial. It has nothing to do with the facts; otherwise the home State universities would say something different. You can't go home and root for the Buckeyes on the weekend and then come here and deny climate change and pretend you are being true to your home State university. I don't care what your home State is--Iowa, Oklahoma, Florida, Georgia--you name it. Go to the big State universities. They understand that climate change is real. What prevents us from acting isn't information, it is the wall of special influence money that the fossil fuel industry has built around this place, and it is time we woke up and got on with our business. So I will close with that. I am grateful for the people in Ohio who showed me around, particularly to Dave Spangler and Paul Pacholski, lifelong charter boat captains. They make their living out on Lake Erie. They know what it is like out there, and they know what climate change is doing to their beloved lake and their beloved way of life. I yield the floor.

The Senator from Iowa. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7888-S7890] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CLIMATE CHANGE Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

At this point, because of toxic ground level ozone and ragweed being triggers for asthma attacks--she has seen so much of that. She said that more than one in five African-American kids in Cleveland has asthma, and she connects it to what is happening in climate change. Of course, we understand that in Rhode Island because we have the same bad air days where we have to have kids stay indoors and elderly people stay indoors, all because of the air coming from the Midwest that has been fouled by these coal-burning powerplants. Out on Lake Erie I met with some of the scientists from Stone Labs and a couple of the lifelong fishing captains who had been out there on the lake. Here are some of the water samples we took while we were out. It is clean now--this is what the water should look like--but back before, when the climate change-driven rain bursts were flooding Lake Erie with phosphorus from the farms in the watershed, there was an explosion of cyanotic bacteria to the point where these guys said driving their boats wasn't like driving through water, it was like driving through pudding, and the wake would slurp over instead of turning the way a regular boat's wake would. One of them had been doing this for 35 years and he said: I don't know this lake any longer. I don't know where the fish are going to be. For 35 years I have fished this lake, and now it is like a stranger to me because of all these changes that are happening. That is exactly what my Rhode Island fishermen are telling me, too, about Narragansett Bay and Rhode Island Sound. We are here with the Senator from Massachusetts. ``Sheldon, it is getting weird out there. Sheldon, this is not my grandfather's ocean.'' We have some responsibilities to pay attention to these people and to listen to them. One of the most impressive parts of the trip was this at Ohio State. Ohio State is host to the Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center named after the famous polar explorer Admiral Byrd. These two scientists, Ellen Mosley-Thompson and Lonnie Thompson, have spent their lives traveling all over the planet going to these incredible, faraway places--the North Pole, the South Pole, to the Greenland icecap, going to glaciers high in Peru, going to glaciers in the faraway mountains of China. They drill down and take a core sample out of the glacier and get hundreds of thousands of years of data in that core sample. Then there you are on the top of a glacier in Peru or China, and you have to figure out how to get this core sample back to Ohio--and it has to stay frozen the whole time. So they had this huge logistical challenge. They conquered all of that. They are two amazing people. These are all the core samples from glaciers all around the globe. Some of them, because of the way climate has dissipated the glaciers, where they drilled the core sample the glacier doesn't exist anymore. It is the last record of gone glaciers. Here is a picture they had. This is the same site. On this side is a picture of the glacier. You can see striations from the seasons and years going by, and they took this picture from the same place. You can see how the glacier used to be right in front of them and now this glacier is off in the distance. It has moved back as the climate has warmed. They gave me this. This is a piece of plant matter. You can hardly see it. It is plants that were unearthed as the glacier moved back, and they can date them. Those plants were last out 6,626 years ago, when a snow covered those plants. Snow piled on to snow and it was buried under the glacier. It stayed and it stayed, and thousands of years went by. Then, after thousands of years had gone by, Jesus came and walked the Earth, and then thousands more years came by, and now the glaciers are melting so fast that here it is. You can look, and you can still see the leaves. It is squashed and old, but it hasn't decomposed because of the way [[Page S7890]] it was preserved under the glacier that is going away now. In this laboratory they have this incredible treasure. You can go in and you can find air that was on this planet when Jesus walked the Earth, and it is still preserved just the way it was in the ice. You can find dust from dust storms that were written about in Egyptian hieroglyphics, and there is the actual dust held in the ice. This is the record that the climate science is based on, and it truly is a marvel. The last thing I will mention is that we also stopped by the Ohio State Center for Automotive Research. Here is a brandnew Camaro in the background. They work with GM to get cars brand-spanking-new, a high- performance American Camaro. These students are going to take it apart and put it back together so it runs cheaper, faster, and with less fuel. They are going to make a hybrid Camaro with the same level of performance, and it is really very impressive what they are doing. They know climate change is here. That is why they are doing this stuff. I will close out because I have other Senators waiting, but I thank Senator Brown for taking me around Cleveland, meeting all the people we did, and taking me on those visits. I thank the folks at Ohio State. Stone Labs out on Lake Erie is an Ohio State facility. The Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center is an Ohio State facility. I met with the John Glenn Institute folks at Ohio State University. Look, if you are a Buckeye fan and you are listening, pay attention to what Ohio University says about climate change. Don't listen to the fossil fuel phonies. Listen to what your home State university says. These guys are deadly serious. They know it is real. I don't think there is a home State university in this country that is denying climate change, and yet this body is stuck in denial. It has nothing to do with the facts; otherwise the home State universities would say something different. You can't go home and root for the Buckeyes on the weekend and then come here and deny climate change and pretend you are being true to your home State university. I don't care what your home State is--Iowa, Oklahoma, Florida, Georgia--you name it. Go to the big State universities. They understand that climate change is real. What prevents us from acting isn't information, it is the wall of special influence money that the fossil fuel industry has built around this place, and it is time we woke up and got on with our business. So I will close with that. I am grateful for the people in Ohio who showed me around, particularly to Dave Spangler and Paul Pacholski, lifelong charter boat captains. They make their living out on Lake Erie. They know what it is like out there, and they know what climate change is doing to their beloved lake and their beloved way of life. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa. ____________________",package_114_41.csv,13483,13483,13555,"[congressional record volume 161, number 167 (tuesday, november 10, 2015)] [senate] [pages s7888-s7890] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] climate change mr. whitehouse. mr. president, it is my habit to give my ``time to wake up'' speeches once a week when the senate is in session. it is also a practice of mine to go to other states--particularly states that have republican senators--to look at what is happening in the states and get a sense of where the local universities and the local experts are with respect to climate change. my last visit was to ohio. i have also been to new hampshire, north carolina, south carolina, georgia, florida, tennessee, and iowa. the thing that is common across all of those trips is that there is no denying climate change in those states. the denial is the function of this building, and it is the function of the wall of money the fossil fuel industry has erected around this building. but pick a state university in the country and go there, and we find there is simply not climate denial. i am joined today by my friend sherrod brown, ohio's senior senator, who was kind enough to accompany me on the trip--on several parts of it, anyway. we went to cleveland. we had a couple of meetings there together. another one of my visits was to lake erie, which got clobbered by the cyanotic bacteria that shut down toledo's water system, which is also climate change-related. let me yield to the senator from ohio for a few moments, and then we can talk about cleveland and the lake. mr. brown. mr. president, i thank senator whitehouse. when i introduced senator whitehouse to the mayor of cleveland and to a number of experts in cleveland, from public health officials, to wind energy entrepreneurs, to community groups to whom climate change matters so much, i introduced him as probably--not just probably--there is no person in the senate who has done a better job of focusing public attention on the threats of climate change and what it means to our way of life and what it means to our country. i thank senator whitehouse for that. [[page s7889]] i want to point to what happened in toledo, oh, in 2011. this green color in this picture is algae bloom. this is a small boat that is making its way through the algae bloom. this wasn't even the year toledo residents lost their water supply. in 2014--last august, 15 months ago--algae blooms were so serious in lake erie and in the western basin--toledo is in the western basin of lake erie, cleveland is sort of central, and then ashtabula and erie, pa, are in the eastern basin of lake erie. again, this is not the most serious situation, although the algae bloom is so overwhelming here. this green is all algae bloom. the lake actually should be the color-- where you can see dark blue here, that is normally the color of the lake. we can see the wake of the boat, and that is the normal color of the lake, as the boat plowed through the algae bloom. the problem with lake erie is that it is the most vulnerable lake because it is the shallowest lake in the western basin of lake erie. in this part of lake erie, it is only 30 feet deep. it is fed by the maumee river, which is the largest tributary of any river into any of the five great lakes. keep in mind that it is 30 feet deep here, fed by farmland and commercial activity and industry and homeowners--greater toledo in northwest ohio. contrast that with lake superior. it is 30 feet deep here, and lake superior is 600 feet deep on average. and lake superior mostly drains forests, so we can see why cleveland and toledo are so vulnerable to climate change and so vulnerable to pollution and all that has happened with the algae blooms. people in toledo--500,000 people lost their drinking water for 2\1/2\ days. people were great, stepping up from all over southern michigan, eastern indiana, and northwest ohio to ship in water for people. but it made such a--it says to us that climate change isn't the only reason this happened, but it is clearly happening. we are seeing this algae bloom worse and worse and worse in hot weather. one other thing about this great lake. lake erie is only 2 percent of all of the great lakes' water--five great lakes. lake erie is only 2 percent of all the great lakes' water because it is shallow and its surface areas are not as big as the others. fifty percent of the fish of all of the great lakes are in lake erie because fish will produce and will prosper in shallower, warmer water, but the water was too warm because of climate change and all of the things that came out of that. in this meeting we had with dr. aparna bole--a pediatric specialist at cleveland's university hospital--she talked about asthma rates. we heard from others too. i will turn it back to senator whitehouse and ask him what he learned from these meetings. he was not just in meetings with people in cleveland learning about what climate change means there, he also went to the stone lab and he can tell us about that. then he had an amazing meeting at ohio state university with some of america's amazing climate scientists. i will kick it back to senator whitehouse and again thank him for traveling the country every single week and looking for places where climate change has done the most damage in terms that people can understand. his leadership is so important. i thank senator whitehouse for the work he has done, and i am so grateful he came to the city of cleveland and joined us. mr. whitehouse. well, i was very happy to join the senator. i thought frank jackson was extremely impressive on this subject. he pointed out that there are times in life when we simply have to go to the future, and if you decide to hang on to the past, you will fail as a result of missing that curve. he said that the business community in cleveland was really beginning to get that, beginning to take it on. so he has led with a cleveland climate action plan, which is one of the best ones in the country. we went to a great place where they are growing lettuce hydroponically, 3, 4 acres in an old building, under an open glass ceiling. they are using captured rain water; they are recycling it. the people there have jobs that pay well. they were the owners of the project and they were really vested in it. wasn't the morale of the people working there phenomenal? it was terrific. dr. aparna bole, whom senator brown mentioned, was very in tune to what was happening in minority communities as a result of climate change from asthma, from heat. she is seeing it with her young patients. she was wonderful, talking about that. at this point, because of toxic ground level ozone and ragweed being triggers for asthma attacks--she has seen so much of that. she said that more than one in five african-american kids in cleveland has asthma, and she connects it to what is happening

CREC-2015-11-10-pt1-PgS7884-2,CREC-2015-11-10,114,DRIVE ACT--Continued,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7884-S7887] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] DRIVE ACT--Continued The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 2:45 p.m. is equally divided. The Senator from Mississippi. Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, in a few moments we are going to vote on a motion to instruct the conferees on the highway bill. It will be a motion to instruct them not to proceed with a Federal mandate that would force these long double trailers called twin 33s on the 38 States where currently they are illegal. This Senator would observe that it is not often we get a chance to vote on a motion that will accomplish so much. We are going to get a chance in 30 minutes or so to vote on a motion that will save lives. It is a motion that would prohibit a Federal mandate, that supports small business, and that would save $1.2 billion to $1.8 billion per year in highway maintenance. It is a vote that is supported by an overwhelming majority of the American people. This is a rare opportunity for us to come together on a motion that does all of those things. It is also a bipartisan motion to instruct. It will be sponsored by the Senator from California, Senator Feinstein, and there will be bipartisan votes for the motion on both sides of the aisle. Now, why are we here? The motion is here because it stems from an amendment in the Appropriations Committee to the Transportation appropriations bill, which would require every State to allow these twin 33-foot trailers on Federal highways. Currently some 12 States do allow them. They have a right to do that, and if they made a considered decision in their State legislatures and in consultation with their departments of transportation, then more power to them. Well, 38 States say that these trucks are not safe and that these trucks are too long. They tell us they don't want them on the highways. I think we should respect that decision by these 38 States. Who supports the Wicker-Feinstein motion to instruct the conferees? I go back to the point that this is a vote to save lives. Who says this? AAA, a respected nationwide organization that knows quite a bit about highway safety, says support the Wicker amendment. Don't mandate on 38 States something they don't want to do with these extra long trucks. I would point out on this diagram the size of the average passenger car. Look how much longer this proposed twin 33 double rig with the tractor part on the front is. Frankly, the American people don't want to contend with these long double trailers on their roads. The Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety say this isn't safe. A ``yes'' vote [[Page S7885]] on the Wicker-Feinstein motion would be a vote for safety. The National Troopers Coalition--we ought to listen to them--say these trucks are not safe, and at the very least, there should be no mandate from Washington, DC. In the time remaining, I would suggest to Members and legislative staff back in their offices to call their local troopers in their various States and see what the troopers say about this. I will tell you that troopers in State after State say don't mandate these long trucks. Sheriff's associations say don't mandate these long trucks. Chiefs of police say don't mandate these long, twin 33 double trailers. So you may ask yourself what a chief of police in a municipality has to do with this. Aren't we talking about interstate highways and big old Federal highways? Not true at all. I don't know about you, but in the place where I live, if something comes in by truck, they bring it right into town. So the chiefs of police say: We don't want these twin 33s on our two-lane streets; we don't want them on the two-lane highways. That would be the result of the mandate that is contained in the appropriations bill unless we turn that around. Who else is opposed to mandating twin 33s on the 38 States that don't want them? The State trucking associations are opposed to this mandate. One would think that the truckers would be for this. After all, if you are a big enough trucking company and you have enough money, you can buy the truck, haul more, and make more money. That is the idea, but we need to bear in mind that most of the truckers in the United States are small business owners. Frankly, some of them have told me that if this mandate on all 50 States is passed, they are going out of business. We have resolutions from the Mississippi Trucking Association, the Arizona Trucking Association, Louisiana Trucking Association, and we have an alliance of small business truckers from States that include Indiana, Texas, Tennessee, Nebraska, Louisiana, Maryland, Washington, Iowa, Mississippi, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Oregon, and Arkansas--and I can go on. Trucking companies and small truckers in all of these States are saying: Please don't put us out of business by having us try to compete with these large twin 33s. I would submit to my colleagues that 20 minutes from now we are going to have a vote. This is the only opportunity that 100 Senators elected by the people of the 50 States will have to address this issue. This vote we are going to take in just a few moments will send a strong signal to the people in some office here on Capitol Hill, in some room on Capitol Hill, where they are devising the Omnibus appropriations bill. We need to send a strong signal to them that we don't want this mandate in the omnibus. We don't want the mandate in the highway bill. We need a strong vote. This is a chance to vote on how we stand with small business in our States, with the troopers, the sheriffs, the chiefs of police, the trucking associations, and the advocates for highway safety. I would urge my colleagues to thoroughly consider this in the next 20 or 25 minutes. When you come to vote, a ``yes'' vote will be a vote to avoid the Federal mandate. I urge my colleagues to join me on a bipartisan basis--and I believe they will join me on a bipartisan basis--in allowing the 38 States that opt out of this to continue to do so, making a stand for small business, for the States' decisionmaking, and for safety. Mr. President, I understand we are going to move to a vote at 2:45 p.m. The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remaining time while we are in quorum calls be divided equally between the parties. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. WICKER. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are about to vote on whether we want to go to conference with our Transportation bill that passed this body with well over 60 votes in July. We have been pushing hard--Senators on both sides of the aisle--to move the House toward a situation where we can finally go to conference and reconcile the two bills. We are at that point, and I certainly hope we get a very solid vote. I am also hopeful the Wicker-Feinstein motion does succeed, and I certainly will try my best to raise it in the conference. We still have about 1.5 million unemployed construction workers since the recession. We have seen terrific job growth, but we know it hasn't hit all the sectors, so this is an extremely important bill. Also, we know that thousands in businesses rely on a robust highway trust fund. Whether it is the granite people, the cement people, they are all for going to conference. Whether it is the international association of machinists or it is the labor union, the chamber of commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, it is a rare and glorious occasion to see everybody come together and say: Let's get a bill. We want to have a robust bill. We don't want to have a bill that is business as usual and this is why--we have 60,000 bridges that are deficient. They were not built with the kinds of traffic they are now withstanding in mind, so we must have this vote to go to conference. I thank the majority leader, Senator McConnell, for his work and the Democratic leader, Senator Reid. I also extend my thanks to Senator Cantwell, who worked so hard with other Senators on this side to get Ex-Im included in this bill. We will have the Export-Import reauthorization in this bill. I am very excited to get to conference. My goal is just to put it on the table, to bring to that conference the bipartisan spirit we had when we did this bill in the Senate. When I thank both the majority leader and the Democratic leader, it is because they put strong people on this conference. I think it is going to be a strong conference. We have a lot of similarities. Somebody who looked at both bills said the House bill is about 90 percent similar to the Senate bill. This is a good thing. This means we don't have to take our time because the trust fund, the authorization runs out very soon, right before Thanksgiving. So it is a good moment for the Senate. I think we showed leadership on both sides of the aisle on getting this bill done. We continue to work well together, both leaders have sent strong conferees to the conference. I know our staffs are already speaking, and I am hopeful we get a strong vote, which I think we are going to have in a few minutes. Am I correct it is about 3 minutes from that vote? The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Mrs. BOXER. All right. So in 3 minutes I hope we have a solid vote to take our bill to conference with the House, where I will work very closely with Chairman Shuster and the rest. The last point I make is I read that Congressman DeFazio--who is our Democratic ranking member in the House T&I Committee--has had a very serious eye situation and had to go for emergency surgery. I wish to say my heart is with him. He is a very important person in terms of weighing in on the transportation needs. I will work with him, I will speak with him, and I am very hopeful that although he may not be present--I hope he will be present for the conference--if he is not, I wish to reassure him that we will take his concerns into this conference. I am looking forward to a strong vote. I yield the floor. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield back all time and proceed. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time is yielded back. Cloture Motion The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: Cloture Motion We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to disagree to the amendment of the [[Page S7886]] House, agree to the request from the House for a conference, and authorize the Presiding Officer to appoint conferees with respect to H.R. 22. Mitch McConnell, Mike Rounds, Lamar Alexander, Johnny Isakson, Deb Fischer, John Cornyn, Chuck Grassley, Thad Cochran, Joni Ernst, Cory Gardner, John Thune, Daniel Coats, Orrin G. Hatch, John Barrasso, James M. Inhofe, Thom Tillis, Roy Blunt. The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the motion to disagree to the amendment of the House, agree to the request from the House for a conference, and authorize the Presiding Officer to appoint conferees with respect to H.R. 22 shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo), the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz), the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Gardner), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Graham), the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Heller), the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Johnson), the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Paul), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio), and the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter). Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Heller) would have voted ``yea'' and the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter) would have voted ``yea.'' Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy) and the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote?

The clerk will report the motion. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Wicker] moves that the managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 22 be instructed to insist upon the inclusion of the following section in title XXXII: SEC. 32__. TRUCK TRACTOR-SEMITRAILER-TRAILER COMBINATION LENGTH LIMITATION. The Secretary may promulgate a rule to increase the minimum length limitation that a State may prescribe for a truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer combination under section 31111(b)(1)(A) of title 49, United States Code, from 28 feet to 33 feet if the Secretary makes a statistically significant finding, based on the final Comprehensive Truck Size and Weight Limits Study required under section 32801 of the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Enhancement Act of 2012 (title II of division C of Public Law 112-141), that such increase would not have a net negative impact on public safety. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi. Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I understand I have 2 minutes. I will speak briefly and then yield to Senator Feinstein. This is what this is about, these twin 33 double trailers, which are longer than is legal in 38 States. The question is whether we as a Senate, we as a Congress, we as a Federal Government, are going to mandate on the 38 States that don't allow these to allow them on their roads at any rate. So a ``yes'' vote would be a vote against the Federal mandate. When do you get in one fell swoop an opportunity to vote--a vote that will save lives, a vote to prevent a Federal mandate, a vote for small business, a vote to save $1.2 to $1.8 billion a year in highway maintenance, and a vote supported by the overwhelming majority of the people? Vote yes not to mandate this on the States. I yield the floor to the Senator from California. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if we look at that, that is 91 feet with the twin 33s and the cab, 91 feet of truck. Thirty-eight States do not want that in their States. This bill overwhelms that. We had an amendment in the Appropriations Committee that would prevent that. It was a tie vote. Senator Wicker and I ask you, please don't force States to do this before the safety work is done by the Secretary. We have 4,000 people killed every year from these trucks in all kinds of horrific accidents--and they are not as long as this one. These trucks would not only be on the freeways, but they would be in the villages, the towns, and the cities as well. I hope you will support this motion to instruct to protect the 38 States and say: Before you do this, do the safety investigations and tell us these trucks are safe. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there time taken in opposition? If not, the question is on agreeing to the motion. Mr. WICKER. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. Motion to Instruct Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I have a motion to instruct at the desk. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Blumenthal] moves that the managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the House amendment to the bill H.R. 22 be instructed to insist upon the inclusion of the rail safety provisions contained in the amendment passed by the Senate on July 30, 2015, including the authorization of grants for the installation of positive train control. The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 4 minutes of debate equally divided. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, in recent years all of our constituents have seen a scourge in rail accidents. There have been similar accidents all around the country. This motion insists that the Senate's provisions be included in this conference and in what comes out of the conference committee, including the authorization of grants for the installation of positive train control. This summer, with the leadership of the committee chairman, Senator Thune, and the ranking member, Bill Nelson, who are both champions of rail safety, in this instance it resulted in some very key reforms, and the Senate passed the DRIVE Act which is not perfect--troublesome in some highway safety elements--but forward thinking on rail safety. It includes funding for PTC, redundant signal protection, improved inspection practices, and a followup on the FRA's deep dive investigation. Along with cameras and grade crossing, these provisions help to advance the cause of rail safety. The House has done nothing. The House bill is completely and abjectly lacking on rail safety, and therefore this motion instructs our conferees to insist on the Senate's provisions. I know that our conferees will be extremely sympathetic and supportive, but in order to simply to express our views, I ask unanimous consent that this measure be approved and that the motion be taken on a voice vote. I ask unanimous consent that all remaining time be yielded back. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The question occurs on agreeing to the motion. The motion was agreed to. The Presiding Officer appointed Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Thune, Mr. Hatch, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Fischer, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Cornyn, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brown, Mr. Nelson, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Schumer conferees on the part of the Senate.

Under the previous order, the time until 2:45 p.m. is equally divided. The Senator from Mississippi. Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, in a few moments we are going to vote on a motion to instruct the conferees on the highway bill. It will be a motion to instruct them not to proceed with a Federal mandate that would force these long double trailers called twin 33s on the 38 States where currently they are illegal. This Senator would observe that it is not often we get a chance to vote on a motion that will accomplish so much. We are going to get a chance in 30 minutes or so to vote on a motion that will save lives. It is a motion that would prohibit a Federal mandate, that supports small business, and that would save $1.2 billion to $1.8 billion per year in highway maintenance. It is a vote that is supported by an overwhelming majority of the American people. This is a rare opportunity for us to come together on a motion that does all of those things. It is also a bipartisan motion to instruct. It will be sponsored by the Senator from California, Senator Feinstein, and there will be bipartisan votes for the motion on both sides of the aisle. Now, why are we here? The motion is here because it stems from an amendment in the Appropriations Committee to the Transportation appropriations bill, which would require every State to allow these twin 33-foot trailers on Federal highways. Currently some 12 States do allow them. They have a right to do that, and if they made a considered decision in their State legislatures and in consultation with their departments of transportation, then more power to them. Well, 38 States say that these trucks are not safe and that these trucks are too long. They tell us they don't want them on the highways. I think we should respect that decision by these 38 States. Who supports the Wicker-Feinstein motion to instruct the conferees? I go back to the point that this is a vote to save lives. Who says this? AAA, a respected nationwide organization that knows quite a bit about highway safety, says support the Wicker amendment. Don't mandate on 38 States something they don't want to do with these extra long trucks. I would point out on this diagram the size of the average passenger car. Look how much longer this proposed twin 33 double rig with the tractor part on the front is. Frankly, the American people don't want to contend with these long double trailers on their roads. The Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety say this isn't safe. A ``yes'' vote [[Page S7885]] on the Wicker-Feinstein motion would be a vote for safety. The National Troopers Coalition--we ought to listen to them--say these trucks are not safe, and at the very least, there should be no mandate from Washington, DC. In the time remaining, I would suggest to Members and legislative staff back in their offices to call their local troopers in their various States and see what the troopers say about this. I will tell you that troopers in State after State say don't mandate these long trucks. Sheriff's associations say don't mandate these long trucks. Chiefs of police say don't mandate these long, twin 33 double trailers. So you may ask yourself what a chief of police in a municipality has to do with this. Aren't we talking about interstate highways and big old Federal highways? Not true at all. I don't know about you, but in the place where I live, if something comes in by truck, they bring it right into town. So the chiefs of police say: We don't want these twin 33s on our two-lane streets; we don't want them on the two-lane highways. That would be the result of the mandate that is contained in the appropriations bill unless we turn that around. Who else is opposed to mandating twin 33s on the 38 States that don't want them? The State trucking associations are opposed to this mandate. One would think that the truckers would be for this. After all, if you are a big enough trucking company and you have enough money, you can buy the truck, haul more, and make more money. That is the idea, but we need to bear in mind that most of the truckers in the United States are small business owners. Frankly, some of them have told me that if this mandate on all 50 States is passed, they are going out of business. We have resolutions from the Mississippi Trucking Association, the Arizona Trucking Association, Louisiana Trucking Association, and we have an alliance of small business truckers from States that include Indiana, Texas, Tennessee, Nebraska, Louisiana, Maryland, Washington, Iowa, Mississippi, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Oregon, and Arkansas--and I can go on. Trucking companies and small truckers in all of these States are saying: Please don't put us out of business by having us try to compete with these large twin 33s. I would submit to my colleagues that 20 minutes from now we are going to have a vote. This is the only opportunity that 100 Senators elected by the people of the 50 States will have to address this issue. This vote we are going to take in just a few moments will send a strong signal to the people in some office here on Capitol Hill, in some room on Capitol Hill, where they are devising the Omnibus appropriations bill. We need to send a strong signal to them that we don't want this mandate in the omnibus. We don't want the mandate in the highway bill. We need a strong vote. This is a chance to vote on how we stand with small business in our States, with the troopers, the sheriffs, the chiefs of police, the trucking associations, and the advocates for highway safety. I would urge my colleagues to thoroughly consider this in the next 20 or 25 minutes. When you come to vote, a ``yes'' vote will be a vote to avoid the Federal mandate. I urge my colleagues to join me on a bipartisan basis--and I believe they will join me on a bipartisan basis--in allowing the 38 States that opt out of this to continue to do so, making a stand for small business, for the States' decisionmaking, and for safety. Mr. President, I understand we are going to move to a vote at 2:45 p.m. The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remaining time while we are in quorum calls be divided equally between the parties. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. WICKER. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are about to vote on whether we want to go to conference with our Transportation bill that passed this body with well over 60 votes in July. We have been pushing hard--Senators on both sides of the aisle--to move the House toward a situation where we can finally go to conference and reconcile the two bills. We are at that point, and I certainly hope we get a very solid vote. I am also hopeful the Wicker-Feinstein motion does succeed, and I certainly will try my best to raise it in the conference. We still have about 1.5 million unemployed construction workers since the recession. We have seen terrific job growth, but we know it hasn't hit all the sectors, so this is an extremely important bill. Also, we know that thousands in businesses rely on a robust highway trust fund. Whether it is the granite people, the cement people, they are all for going to conference. Whether it is the international association of machinists or it is the labor union, the chamber of commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, it is a rare and glorious occasion to see everybody come together and say: Let's get a bill. We want to have a robust bill. We don't want to have a bill that is business as usual and this is why--we have 60,000 bridges that are deficient. They were not built with the kinds of traffic they are now withstanding in mind, so we must have this vote to go to conference. I thank the majority leader, Senator McConnell, for his work and the Democratic leader, Senator Reid. I also extend my thanks to Senator Cantwell, who worked so hard with other Senators on this side to get Ex-Im included in this bill. We will have the Export-Import reauthorization in this bill. I am very excited to get to conference. My goal is just to put it on the table, to bring to that conference the bipartisan spirit we had when we did this bill in the Senate. When I thank both the majority leader and the Democratic leader, it is because they put strong people on this conference. I think it is going to be a strong conference. We have a lot of similarities. Somebody who looked at both bills said the House bill is about 90 percent similar to the Senate bill. This is a good thing. This means we don't have to take our time because the trust fund, the authorization runs out very soon, right before Thanksgiving. So it is a good moment for the Senate. I think we showed leadership on both sides of the aisle on getting this bill done. We continue to work well together, both leaders have sent strong conferees to the conference. I know our staffs are already speaking, and I am hopeful we get a strong vote, which I think we are going to have in a few minutes. Am I correct it is about 3 minutes from that vote? The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Mrs. BOXER. All right. So in 3 minutes I hope we have a solid vote to take our bill to conference with the House, where I will work very closely with Chairman Shuster and the rest. The last point I make is I read that Congressman DeFazio--who is our Democratic ranking member in the House T&I Committee--has had a very serious eye situation and had to go for emergency surgery. I wish to say my heart is with him. He is a very important person in terms of weighing in on the transportation needs. I will work with him, I will speak with him, and I am very hopeful that although he may not be present--I hope he will be present for the conference--if he is not, I wish to reassure him that we will take his concerns into this conference. I am looking forward to a strong vote. I yield the floor. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield back all time and proceed. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time is yielded back. Cloture Motion The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: Cloture Motion We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to disagree to the amendment of the [[Page S7886]] House, agree to the request from the House for a conference, and authorize the Presiding Officer to appoint conferees with respect to H.R. 22.

Hatch, John Barrasso, James M. Inhofe, Thom Tillis, Roy Blunt. The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the motion to disagree to the amendment of the House, agree to the request from the House for a conference, and authorize the Presiding Officer to appoint conferees with respect to H.R. 22 shall be brought to a close?

So the chiefs of police say: We don't want these twin 33s on our two-lane streets; we don't want them on the two-lane highways. That would be the result of the mandate that is contained in the appropriations bill unless we turn that around. Who else is opposed to mandating twin 33s on the 38 States that don't want them? The State trucking associations are opposed to this mandate. One would think that the truckers would be for this. After all, if you are a big enough trucking company and you have enough money, you can buy the truck, haul more, and make more money. That is the idea, but we need to bear in mind that most of the truckers in the United States are small business owners. Frankly, some of them have told me that if this mandate on all 50 States is passed, they are going out of business. We have resolutions from the Mississippi Trucking Association, the Arizona Trucking Association, Louisiana Trucking Association, and we have an alliance of small business truckers from States that include Indiana, Texas, Tennessee, Nebraska, Louisiana, Maryland, Washington, Iowa, Mississippi, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Oregon, and Arkansas--and I can go on. Trucking companies and small truckers in all of these States are saying: Please don't put us out of business by having us try to compete with these large twin 33s. I would submit to my colleagues that 20 minutes from now we are going to have a vote. This is the only opportunity that 100 Senators elected by the people of the 50 States will have to address this issue. This vote we are going to take in just a few moments will send a strong signal to the people in some office here on Capitol Hill, in some room on Capitol Hill, where they are devising the Omnibus appropriations bill. We need to send a strong signal to them that we don't want this mandate in the omnibus. We don't want the mandate in the highway bill. We need a strong vote. This is a chance to vote on how we stand with small business in our States, with the troopers, the sheriffs, the chiefs of police, the trucking associations, and the advocates for highway safety. I would urge my colleagues to thoroughly consider this in the next 20 or 25 minutes. When you come to vote, a ``yes'' vote will be a vote to avoid the Federal mandate. I urge my colleagues to join me on a bipartisan basis--and I believe they will join me on a bipartisan basis--in allowing the 38 States that opt out of this to continue to do so, making a stand for small business, for the States' decisionmaking, and for safety. Mr. President, I understand we are going to move to a vote at 2:45 p.m. The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remaining time while we are in quorum calls be divided equally between the parties. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. WICKER. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are about to vote on whether we want to go to conference with our Transportation bill that passed this body with well over 60 votes in July. We have been pushing hard--Senators on both sides of the aisle--to move the House toward a situation where we can finally go to conference and reconcile the two bills. We are at that point, and I certainly hope we get a very solid vote. I am also hopeful the Wicker-Feinstein motion does succeed, and I certainly will try my best to raise it in the conference. We still have about 1.5 million unemployed construction workers since the recession. We have seen terrific job growth, but we know it hasn't hit all the sectors, so this is an extremely important bill. Also, we know that thousands in businesses rely on a robust highway trust fund. Whether it is the granite people, the cement people, they are all for going to conference. Whether it is the international association of machinists or it is the labor union, the chamber of commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, it is a rare and glorious occasion to see everybody come together and say: Let's get a bill. We want to have a robust bill. We don't want to have a bill that is business as usual and this is why--we have 60,000 bridges that are deficient. They were not built with the kinds of traffic they are now withstanding in mind, so we must have this vote to go to conference. I thank the majority leader, Senator McConnell, for his work and the Democratic leader, Senator Reid. I also extend my thanks to Senator Cantwell, who worked so hard with other Senators on this side to get Ex-Im included in this bill. We will have the Export-Import reauthorization in this bill. I am very excited to get to conference. My goal is just to put it on the table, to bring to that conference the bipartisan spirit we had when we did this bill in the Senate. When I thank both the majority leader and the Democratic leader, it is because they put strong people on this conference. I think it is going to be a strong conference. We have a lot of similarities. Somebody who looked at both bills said the House bill is about 90 percent similar to the Senate bill. This is a good thing. This means we don't have to take our time because the trust fund, the authorization runs out very soon, right before Thanksgiving. So it is a good moment for the Senate. I think we showed leadership on both sides of the aisle on getting this bill done. We continue to work well together, both leaders have sent strong conferees to the conference. I know our staffs are already speaking, and I am hopeful we get a strong vote, which I think we are going to have in a few minutes. Am I correct it is about 3 minutes from that vote? The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Mrs. BOXER. All right. So in 3 minutes I hope we have a solid vote to take our bill to conference with the House, where I will work very closely with Chairman Shuster and the rest. The last point I make is I read that Congressman DeFazio--who is our Democratic ranking member in the House T&I Committee--has had a very serious eye situation and had to go for emergency surgery. I wish to say my heart is with him. He is a very important person in terms of weighing in on the transportation needs. I will work with him, I will speak with him, and I am very hopeful that although he may not be present--I hope he will be present for the conference--if he is not, I wish to reassure him that we will take his concerns into this conference. I am looking forward to a strong vote. I yield the floor. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield back all time and proceed. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time is yielded back. Cloture Motion The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state. The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows: Cloture Motion We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to disagree to the amendment of the [[Page S7886]] House, agree to the request from the House for a conference, and authorize the Presiding Officer to appoint conferees with respect to H.R. 22. Mitch McConnell, Mike Rounds, Lamar Alexander, Johnny Isakson, Deb Fischer, John Cornyn, Chuck Grassley, Thad Cochran, Joni Ernst, Cory Gardner, John Thune, Daniel Coats, Orrin G. Hatch, John Barrasso, James M. Inhofe, Thom Tillis, Roy Blunt. The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum call has been waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the motion to disagree to the amendment of the House, agree to the request from the House for a conference, and authorize the Presiding Officer to appoint conferees with respect to H.R. 22 shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo), the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz), the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Gardner), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Graham), the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Heller), the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Johnson), the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Paul), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio), and the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter). Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Heller) would have voted ``yea'' and the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter) would have voted ``yea.'' Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy) and the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 82, nays 7, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 303 Leg.] YEAS--82 Alexander Ayotte Baldwin Barrasso Bennet Blumenthal Blunt Booker Boozman Boxer Brown Burr Cantwell Capito Cardin Carper Casey Cassidy Coats Cochran Collins Coons Cornyn Cotton Daines Donnelly Durbin Enzi Ernst Feinstein Fischer Franken Gillibrand Grassley Hatch Heinrich Heitkamp Hirono Hoeven Inhofe Isakson Kaine King Kirk Klobuchar Lankford Manchin Markey McCain McCaskill McConnell Menendez Merkley Mikulski Moran Murkowski Murphy Murray Nelson Peters Portman Reed Reid Roberts Rounds Sanders Schatz Schumer Scott Sessions Shaheen Stabenow Sullivan Tester Thune Tillis Toomey Udall Warren Whitehouse Wicker Wyden NAYS--7 Corker Flake Lee Perdue Risch Sasse Shelby NOT VOTING--11 Crapo Cruz Gardner Graham Heller Johnson Leahy Paul Rubio Vitter Warner The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 82, the nays are 7. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to. Under the previous order, the compound motion is agreed to. The Senator from Mississippi. Motion to Instruct Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I have a motion to instruct at the desk. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Wicker] moves that the managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 22 be instructed to insist upon the inclusion of the following section in title XXXII: SEC. 32__. TRUCK TRACTOR-SEMITRAILER-TRAILER COMBINATION LENGTH LIMITATION. The Secretary may promulgate a rule to increase the minimum length limitation that a State may prescribe for a truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer combination under section 31111(b)(1)(A) of title 49, United States Code, from 28 feet to 33 feet if the Secretary makes a statistically significant finding, based on the final Comprehensive Truck Size and Weight Limits Study required under section 32801 of the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Enhancement Act of 2012 (title II of division C of Public Law 112-141), that such increase would not have a net negative impact on public safety. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi. Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I understand I have 2 minutes. I will speak briefly and then yield to Senator Feinstein. This is what this is about, these twin 33 double trailers, which are longer than is legal in 38 States. The question is whether we as a Senate, we as a Congress, we as a Federal Government, are going to mandate on the 38 States that don't allow these to allow them on their roads at any rate. So a ``yes'' vote would be a vote against the Federal mandate. When do you get in one fell swoop an opportunity to vote--a vote that will save lives, a vote to prevent a Federal mandate, a vote for small business, a vote to save $1.2 to $1.8 billion a year in highway maintenance, and a vote supported by the overwhelming majority of the people? Vote yes not to mandate this on the States. I yield the floor to the Senator from California. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California. Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if we look at that, that is 91 feet with the twin 33s and the cab, 91 feet of truck. Thirty-eight States do not want that in their States. This bill overwhelms that. We had an amendment in the Appropriations Committee that would prevent that. It was a tie vote. Senator Wicker and I ask you, please don't force States to do this before the safety work is done by the Secretary. We have 4,000 people killed every year from these trucks in all kinds of horrific accidents--and they are not as long as this one. These trucks would not only be on the freeways, but they would be in the villages, the towns, and the cities as well. I hope you will support this motion to instruct to protect the 38 States and say: Before you do this, do the safety investigations and tell us these trucks are safe. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there time taken in opposition? If not, the question is on agreeing to the motion. Mr. WICKER. I ask for the yeas and nays. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll. The legislative clerk called the roll. Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo), the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz), the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Gardner), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Graham), the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Heller), the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe), the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Johnson), the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Paul), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio), and the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter). Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter) would have voted ``yea.'' Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. Boxer), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy), and the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) are necessarily absent. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber desiring to vote? The result was announced--yeas 56, nays 31, as follows: [Rollcall Vote No. 304 Leg.] YEAS--56 Baldwin Bennet Blumenthal Booker Brown Burr Cantwell Cardin Carper Casey Coats Cochran Coons Donnelly Durbin Ernst Feinstein Fischer Flake Franken Gillibrand Grassley Heinrich Hirono Isakson Kaine King Klobuchar Manchin Markey McCain McCaskill Menendez Merkley Mikulski Murphy Murray Nelson Perdue Peters Portman Reed Reid Sanders Sasse Schatz Schumer Shaheen Stabenow Tillis Toomey Udall Warren Whitehouse Wicker Wyden [[Page S7887]] NAYS--31 Alexander Ayotte Barrasso Blunt Boozman Capito Cassidy Collins Corker Cornyn Cotton Daines Enzi Hatch Heitkamp Hoeven Kirk Lankford Lee McConnell Moran Murkowski Risch Roberts Rounds Scott Sessions Shelby Sullivan Tester Thune NOT VOTING--13 Boxer Crapo Cruz Gardner Graham Heller Inhofe Johnson Leahy Paul Rubio Vitter Warner The motion was agreed to. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut. Motion to Instruct Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I have a motion to instruct at the desk. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion. The legislative clerk read as follows: The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Blumenthal] moves that the managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the House amendment to the bill H.R. 22 be instructed to insist upon the inclusion of the rail safety provisions contained in the amendment passed by the Senate on July 30, 2015, including the authorization of grants for the installation of positive train control. The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 4 minutes of debate equally divided. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized. Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, in recent years all of our constituents have seen a scourge in rail accidents. There have been similar accidents all around the country. This motion insists that the Senate's provisions be included in this conference and in what comes out of the conference committee, including the authorization of grants for the installation of positive train control. This summer, with the leadership of the committee chairman, Senator Thune, and the ranking member, Bill Nelson, who are both champions of rail safety, in this instance it resulted in some very key reforms, and the Senate passed the DRIVE Act which is not perfect--troublesome in some highway safety elements--but forward thinking on rail safety. It includes funding for PTC, redundant signal protection, improved inspection practices, and a followup on the FRA's deep dive investigation. Along with cameras and grade crossing, these provisions help to advance the cause of rail safety. The House has done nothing. The House bill is completely and abjectly lacking on rail safety, and therefore this motion instructs our conferees to insist on the Senate's provisions. I know that our conferees will be extremely sympathetic and supportive, but in order to simply to express our views, I ask unanimous consent that this measure be approved and that the motion be taken on a voice vote. I ask unanimous consent that all remaining time be yielded back. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. The question occurs on agreeing to the motion. The motion was agreed to. The Presiding Officer appointed Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Thune, Mr. Hatch, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Fischer, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Cornyn, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brown, Mr. Nelson, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Schumer conferees on the part of the Senate. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri. ____________________",package_114_41.csv,21608,21608,21680,"[congressional record volume 161, number 167 (tuesday, november 10, 2015)] [senate] [pages s7884-s7887] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] drive act--continued the presiding officer. under the previous order, the time until 2:45 p.m. is equally divided. the senator from mississippi. mr. wicker. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. wicker. mr. president, in a few moments we are going to vote on a motion to instruct the conferees on the highway bill. it will be a motion to instruct them not to proceed with a federal mandate that would force these long double trailers called twin 33s on the 38 states where currently they are illegal. this senator would observe that it is not often we get a chance to vote on a motion that will accomplish so much. we are going to get a chance in 30 minutes or so to vote on a motion that will save lives. it is a motion that would prohibit a federal mandate, that supports small business, and that would save $1.2 billion to $1.8 billion per year in highway maintenance. it is a vote that is supported by an overwhelming majority of the american people. this is a rare opportunity for us to come together on a motion that does all of those things. it is also a bipartisan motion to instruct. it will be sponsored by the senator from california, senator feinstein, and there will be bipartisan votes for the motion on both sides of the aisle. now, why are we here? the motion is here because it stems from an amendment in the appropriations committee to the transportation appropriations bill, which would require every state to allow these twin 33-foot trailers on federal highways. currently some 12 states do allow them. they have a right to do that, and if they made a considered decision in their state legislatures and in consultation with their departments of transportation, then more power to them. well, 38 states say that these trucks are not safe and that these trucks are too long. they tell us they don't want them on the highways. i think we should respect that decision by these 38 states. who supports the wicker-feinstein motion to instruct the conferees? i go back to the point that this is a vote to save lives. who says this? aaa, a respected nationwide organization that knows quite a bit about highway safety, says support the wicker amendment. don't mandate on 38 states something they don't want to do with these extra long trucks. i would point out on this diagram the size of the average passenger car. look how much longer this proposed twin 33 double rig with the tractor part on the front is. frankly, the american people don't want to contend with these long double trailers on their roads. the advocates for highway and auto safety say this isn't safe. a ``yes'' vote [[page s7885]] on the wicker-feinstein motion would be a vote for safety. the national troopers coalition--we ought to listen to them--say these trucks are not safe, and at the very least, there should be no mandate from washington, dc. in the time remaining, i would suggest to members and legislative staff back in their offices to call their local troopers in their various states and see what the troopers say about this. i will tell you that troopers in state after state say don't mandate these long trucks. sheriff's associations say don't mandate these long trucks. chiefs of police say don't mandate these long, twin 33 double trailers. so you may ask yourself what a chief of police in a municipality has to do with this. aren't we talking about interstate highways and big old federal highways? not true at all. i don't know about you, but in the place where i live, if something comes in by truck, they bring it right into town. so the chiefs of police say: we don't want these twin 33s on our two-lane streets; we don't want them on the two-lane highways. that would be the result of the mandate that is contained in the appropriations bill unless we turn that around. who else is opposed to mandating twin 33s on the 38 states that don't want them? the state trucking associations are opposed to this mandate. one would think that the truckers would be for this. after all, if you are a big enough trucking company and you have enough money, you can buy the truck, haul more, and make more money. that is the idea, but we need to bear in mind that most of the truckers in the united states are small business owners. frankly, some of them have told me that if this mandate on all 50 states is passed, they are going out of business. we have resolutions from the mississippi trucking association, the arizona trucking association, louisiana trucking association, and we have an alliance of small business truckers from states that include indiana, texas, tennessee, nebraska, louisiana, maryland, washington, iowa, mississippi, arizona, pennsylvania, oregon, and arkansas--and i can go on. trucking companies and small truckers in all of these states are saying: please don't put us out of business by having us try to compete with these large twin 33s. i would submit to my colleagues that 20 minutes from now we are going to have a vote. this is the only opportunity that 100 senators elected by the people of the 50 states will have to address this issue. this vote we are going to take in just a few moments will send a strong signal to the people in some office here on capitol hill, in some room on capitol hill, where they are devising the omnibus appropriations bill. we need to send a strong signal to them that we don't

presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. wicker. i suggest the absence of a quorum. the presiding officer. the clerk will call the roll. the senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. mrs. boxer. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mrs. boxer. mr. president, we are about to vote on whether we want to go to conference with our transportation bill that passed this body with well over 60 votes in july. we have been pushing hard--senators on

every year from these trucks in all kinds of horrific accidents--and they are not as long as this one. these trucks would not only be on the freeways, but they would be in the villages, the towns, and the cities as well. i hope you will support this motion to instruct to protect the 38 states and say: before you do this, do the safety investigations and tell us these trucks are safe. i yield the

conference on the disagreeing votes of the two houses on the house amendment to the bill h.r. 22 be instructed to insist upon the inclusion of the rail safety provisions contained in the amendment passed by the senate on july 30, 2015, including the authorization of grants for the installation of positive train control. the presiding officer. there will be 4 minutes of debate equally divided. the senator from connecticut is recognized. mr. blumenthal. mr. president, in recent years all of our constituents have seen a scourge in rail accidents. there have been similar accidents all around the country. this motion insists that the senate's provisions be included in this conference and in what comes out of the conference committee, including the authorization of grants for the installation of positive train control. this summer, with the leadership of the committee chairman, senator thune, and the ranking member, bill nelson, who are both champions of rail safety, in this instance it resulted in some very key reforms, and the senate passed the drive act which is not perfect--troublesome in some highway safety elements--but forward thinking on rail safety. it includes funding for ptc, redundant signal protection, improved inspection practices, and a followup on the fra's deep dive investigation. along with cameras and grade crossing, these provisions help to advance the cause of rail safety. the house has done nothing. the house bill is completely and abjectly lacking on rail safety, and therefore this motion instructs our conferees to insist on the senate's provisions. i know that our conferees will be extremely sympathetic and supportive, but in order to simply to express our views, i ask unanimous consent that this measure be approved and that the motion be taken on a voice vote. i ask unanimous consent that all remaining time be yielded back. the presiding officer. is there objection? without objection, it is so ordered. the question occurs on agreeing to the motion. the motion was agreed to. the presiding officer appointed mr. inhofe, mr. thune, mr. hatch, ms. murkowski, mrs. fischer, mr. barrasso, mr. cornyn, mrs. boxer, mr.

CREC-2015-11-10-pt1-PgS7890,CREC-2015-11-10,114,OVERSIGHT OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7890-S7892] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] OVERSIGHT OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, oversight of the executive branch of government by the Congress is as old as the Constitution, it is a critical role, and it is one that was intended by the writers of the Constitution. I believe oversight leads to better government, better laws, and actually saves the taxpayers money. That is why this Senator works very hard at oversight. I went after the Reagan Defense Department for wasteful spending in the 1980s. I held up the Department of Justice nominees during the Bush administration to get my oversight letters answered, just as I am doing now with the Obama Department of State. I voted in support of giving the Judiciary Committee the authority to issue subpoenas regarding its inquiry into the firing of U.S. attorneys during the Bush administration when a lot of Republicans didn't want that to happen. My belief in and exercise of the oversight role by Congress is longstanding and nonpartisan. Yesterday the Senate minority leader said my investigation into the Department of State's use of special government employee designations and how Secretary Clinton's private email arrangement interfered with the Freedom of Information Act compliance is political. This simply is not so. This investigation involves many things, but it does not involve politics. His speech yesterday inferred that I was doing all these things for political reasons. That is simply not true, nor is it in accordance with my reputation as an equal opportunity overseer. My investigation into the potential abuse of the special government employee designations and Secretary Clinton's use of a personal email server and the potential spillage of classified information is not political. It is evidence-based, and it has something to do with our national security. Unfortunately, the Department has been largely uncooperative since June of 2013. The Department's lack of cooperation has caused me to place 22 holds on its nominees. These are not secret holds. I have placed, according to the rules of the Senate, a statement in the Record of why those holds are placed, and to correct the senior Senator from Nevada, my holds do not include 600 Foreign Service officers and do not include individuals from Iowa. With respect to my pending requests to the Department of State, I am still waiting for a full production of documents from my June 2013 oversight request--the constitutional responsibility of those of us who pass laws and appropriate money. That happened to be 2\1/2\ years ago, and the State Department has still not produced the materials I have requested. The Department has implemented several clever strategies to delay the process. I will give you some examples. The Department routinely assigns new employees to handle different requests. Each time a new employee is assigned we get the same excuses why they cannot deliver on our requests. These excuses go something like this: I am new, so I don't know who to talk to and where to find the documents. For years the Department has delayed in productions, each time with more excuses. For instance, the Department still refuses to answer whether Secretary Clinton's private server was approved. The Department has failed to provide emails for Department personnel communicating about Secretary Clinton's private server that we have strong reason to believe exist. The Department took over 2 months to schedule a single interview with a former employee. The Department for over 2 months has refused to provide instructions it gave to Clinton attorney David Kendall to secure the thumb drives that contained classified information--even though the Department was quoted in the news as providing those instructions. The Department has failed to provide travel reimbursements and leave documents for its employees. On August 5 of this year, I requested classification nondisclosure forms for Secretary Clinton, Huma Abedin, and Cheryl Mills. On November 5, the Department provided those documents to a Freedom of Information Act requester but not to the committee. I highlight that. The Freedom of Information Act request was made, but the same information that was sought by a congressional committee-- one was granted and the other so far has been denied. While the Department provided the documents to that requester under the Freedom of Information Act, Department employees told me they had been unable to find those documents. Not only has the Judiciary Committee experienced unacceptable Department of State delays in receiving the information we request, others inside and outside of the government have experienced delays as well. The Associated Press sued the State Department over the failure to satisfy repeated document requests under the Freedom of Information Act related to these same agents. One of these requests dates back 5 years ago. Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the judge responsible for this case, scolded the State Department for its failure to produce documents on time: Now, any person should be able to review that in one day-- one day. Even the least ambitious bureaucrat could do this. Let there be no mistake about this investigation. This investigation is centered on the Freedom of Information Act, a law that is within the Judiciary Committee's jurisdiction. This investigation is centered on potential abuse of the special government employee designation that allows government employees to be paid by outside [[Page S7891]] employers, in this case hundreds of thousands of dollars by a consulting firm run by a former Clinton administration employee. This investigation is centered on potential violations of the Federal Records Act and holding government officials accountable for their actions. This investigation is centered on whether public officials properly handled classified information. Nobody is above the law. Senior government officials and regular employees should get equal treatment under the law, and that treatment should be fair and objective. It should not depend on what your position is. When it looks like the treatment is different, we have to figure out what is going on. For example, it looks like other government employees are subject to very different treatment when accused of mishandling classified information. Army LTC Jason Amerine, a decorated war hero, contacted Congress to try to warn about bureaucratic problems with U.S. hostage recovery efforts, problems that he believed were putting lives at risk. He was accused of improperly transmitting classified information to Congress in the process. This war hero was removed from his job, was escorted out of the Pentagon, had his clearances suspended, had his scheduled retirement delayed indefinitely, was fingerprinted and had a mug shot taken, was threatened with court-martial, and was subject to extensive investigation. After almost a year of being investigated, the Army decided not to court-martial Lieutenant Colonel Amerine. Instead, he was awarded the Legion of Merit for exceptionally meritorious service and was finally allowed to retire. But look at how differently he, a war hero, was treated when accused of mishandling classified information compared to Secretary Clinton and her associates. Where was the minority leader in trying to help this war hero from these attacks from this administration? Nowhere to be seen is the answer to that. It is apparent that some have a selective memory when it comes to putting value on oversight and investigations. But I do not. I have been consistent in my oversight role my entire career, investigating Republicans and Democrats. My oversight and investigations unit is involved in many investigations. The vast majority of them have nothing to do with Secretary Clinton. Looking out for the public interest isn't a waste of time, and I will keep at it regardless of misguided attacks on my motivations and mischaracterizations of my work. I will continue this investigation because the American people have a right to the truth and government officials have an obligation to answer to ``We the People.'' Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article dated September 4, 2015, be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the Daily Beast, Sept. 4, 2015] The Hillary Email Double Standard (By Danielle Brian) How whistleblowers see their lives destroyed over infractions the powerful get away with. Watching the news about Hillary Clinton's emails, it is remarkable to see how many people now have opinions about the overclassification of information and the relative merits of prosecuting people for mishandling classified material or destroying government records. Newspapers, blogs, and television reports are full of pundits explaining the law as they see it, with people opining about who is right: the two Inspectors General who assert there was classified material in her emails, or the State Department, which asserts that the information was not classified at the time. So where were all these ``experts'' when whistleblowers accused of the same infraction--mishandling classified material--were forced to spend a fortune on lawyers, were fired from their jobs, and were threatened with imprisonment? The amount of time being spent by Hillary Clinton defenders and detractors parsing rules, policies, and laws on whether she broke the law is maddening. That time desperately needs to be spent on transforming the classification system and modernizing electronic records retention policies, as promised in the Obama administration's second National Action Plan for the Open Government Partnership nearly two years ago. It is hard to reconcile Clinton's actions with her speech at the 2012 opening session of the Open Government Partnership: ``In the 21st century, the United States is convinced that one of the most significant divisions among nations will not be north/south, east/west, religious, or any other category so much as whether they are open or closed societies. We believe that countries with open governments, open economies, and open societies will increasingly flourish. They will become more prosperous, healthier, more secure, and more peaceful.'' She was right then. It is essential to maintain the records of our policymakers for historical analysis so that the public can know what actions have been taken in our name by our leaders. Clinton did not maintain these records. The fact is she indisputably broke the rules, and although that is not a criminal offense, it certainly is a political one. Even more infuriating is the disparity of treatment between the politically powerful and everyday truth-tellers. High- level officials often receive little more than a tap on the wrist for mishandling classified information. But whistleblowers seeking to expose wrongdoing and protect the public are almost without exception subjected to overzealous investigations and prosecution. Rather than focusing on the distinction between whether a person deliberately released classified information or not, the more appropriate lens is whether there was an intended public benefit for that disclosure, such as protecting public health or safety or revealing wrongdoing. Of course the Secretary of State had some classified information in her emails. As Bill Leonard, former director of the federal Information Security Oversight Office, told Reuters, information that foreign officials give U.S. officials in confidence is ``born classified.'' And yes, the government is dramatically overclassifying information. Clinton herself tweeted that the government's ridiculous classification rules are the ``real problem.'' But rather than tackling the many problems with the classification system, or investigating Clinton through the post-Wikileaks ``insider threat'' program created to investigate individuals who exploited, compromised, or made an unauthorized disclosure of classified information, the State Department has spent weeks defending their former boss and claiming dismissively that nothing was classified at the time anyway. General Petraeus, who deliberately gave classified information to his lover/biographer, was afforded similar latitude, with Senator Feinstein going so far as to make a public plea for clemency in his case. In the end he was only given a paltry fine--one that he will be able to pay off with less than one of his speaking engagement fees. The Department of Defense Inspector General (IG) tried to bury, and then gutted, its own report that concluded then-CIA Director Leon Panetta had released classified information about the Osama bin Laden raid to the Zero Dark Thirty Hollywood producers. Panetta was never penalized despite the IG's findings. In stark comparison, even national security whistleblowers who worked through proper channels, including reporting to their superiors, Inspectors General, and the Congress, are faced with a white-hot vindictive frontal attack from the government. NSA whistleblower Tom Drake and Justice Department whistleblower Thomas Tamm both had armed FBI agents raid their homes. Drake reported to the Pentagon IG and Congress about the NSA's unconstitutional and wasteful overreach through its domestic surveillance program (years before Edward Snowden). Tamm also challenged the legality of the government's warrantless wiretap program. Tamm lost his clearance and his government career. Drake was prosecuted for espionage and lost his career after pleading to the misdemeanor of ``excceding the authorized use of a computer.'' Both spent a fortune on attorneys. Air Marshal Robert MacLean had to take his case all the way to the Supreme Court to prove that he had a right to reveal unclassified information to a TV reporter about the TSA's decision to remove air marshals from high-risk flights after 9/11. His disclosure forced the TSA to reverse their plan and to better protect the public by keeping air marshals on cross-country flights. MacLean won, but he and his family had to put their lives on hold while he fought his case for years without a paycheck. Lieutenant Colonel Jason Amerine is being investigated by the Army Criminal Investigation Division over accusations of revealing classified information to Congress, which is permitted by law to receive disclosures about wrongdoing in the executive branch. His disclosure to Congress led the White House to overhaul its hostage recovery policies. Yet his retirement from the military, after an extraordinary and decorated career in the Army, has been put on hold indefinitely as the investigation drags on. Our system now protects the powerful and attacks the heroes, both of which are fundamentally un-American. So let's stop wasting time making politically expedient proclamations that serve no purpose but to score points for candidates. There are real issues all the campaigns should address: We need to dramatically shrink the incidence of and incentives for overclassification. We also need to apply a public interest balancing test so that when there is an alleged breach of classified information, the violation is weighed against the benefits of the information becoming known. [[Page S7892]] And we need to level the playing field so that there aren't different accountability standards for those with clout and those without. If the dialogue doesn't change, most federal employees who witnesses waste, fraud. or abuse will feel the chill and decide against stepping forward while the politically powerful class will continue to be rewarded and see their transgressions forgiven.

Yesterday the Senate minority leader said my investigation into the Department of State's use of special government employee designations and how Secretary Clinton's private email arrangement interfered with the Freedom of Information Act compliance is political. This simply is not so. This investigation involves many things, but it does not involve politics. His speech yesterday inferred that I was doing all these things for political reasons. That is simply not true, nor is it in accordance with my reputation as an equal opportunity overseer. My investigation into the potential abuse of the special government employee designations and Secretary Clinton's use of a personal email server and the potential spillage of classified information is not political. It is evidence-based, and it has something to do with our national security. Unfortunately, the Department has been largely uncooperative since June of 2013. The Department's lack of cooperation has caused me to place 22 holds on its nominees. These are not secret holds. I have placed, according to the rules of the Senate, a statement in the Record of why those holds are placed, and to correct the senior Senator from Nevada, my holds do not include 600 Foreign Service officers and do not include individuals from Iowa. With respect to my pending requests to the Department of State, I am still waiting for a full production of documents from my June 2013 oversight request--the constitutional responsibility of those of us who pass laws and appropriate money. That happened to be 2\1/2\ years ago, and the State Department has still not produced the materials I have requested. The Department has implemented several clever strategies to delay the process. I will give you some examples. The Department routinely assigns new employees to handle different requests. Each time a new employee is assigned we get the same excuses why they cannot deliver on our requests. These excuses go something like this: I am new, so I don't know who to talk to and where to find the documents. For years the Department has delayed in productions, each time with more excuses. For instance, the Department still refuses to answer whether Secretary Clinton's private server was approved. The Department has failed to provide emails for Department personnel communicating about Secretary Clinton's private server that we have strong reason to believe exist. The Department took over 2 months to schedule a single interview with a former employee. The Department for over 2 months has refused to provide instructions it gave to Clinton attorney David Kendall to secure the thumb drives that contained classified information--even though the Department was quoted in the news as providing those instructions. The Department has failed to provide travel reimbursements and leave documents for its employees. On August 5 of this year, I requested classification nondisclosure forms for Secretary Clinton, Huma Abedin, and Cheryl Mills. On November 5, the Department provided those documents to a Freedom of Information Act requester but not to the committee. I highlight that. The Freedom of Information Act request was made, but the same information that was sought by a congressional committee-- one was granted and the other so far has been denied. While the Department provided the documents to that requester under the Freedom of Information Act, Department employees told me they had been unable to find those documents. Not only has the Judiciary Committee experienced unacceptable Department of State delays in receiving the information we request, others inside and outside of the government have experienced delays as well. The Associated Press sued the State Department over the failure to satisfy repeated document requests under the Freedom of Information Act related to these same agents. One of these requests dates back 5 years ago. Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the judge responsible for this case, scolded the State Department for its failure to produce documents on time: Now, any person should be able to review that in one day-- one day. Even the least ambitious bureaucrat could do this. Let there be no mistake about this investigation. This investigation is centered on the Freedom of Information Act, a law that is within the Judiciary Committee's jurisdiction. This investigation is centered on potential abuse of the special government employee designation that allows government employees to be paid by outside [[Page S7891]] employers, in this case hundreds of thousands of dollars by a consulting firm run by a former Clinton administration employee. This investigation is centered on potential violations of the Federal Records Act and holding government officials accountable for their actions. This investigation is centered on whether public officials properly handled classified information. Nobody is above the law. Senior government officials and regular employees should get equal treatment under the law, and that treatment should be fair and objective. It should not depend on what your position is. When it looks like the treatment is different, we have to figure out what is going on. For example, it looks like other government employees are subject to very different treatment when accused of mishandling classified information. Army LTC Jason Amerine, a decorated war hero, contacted Congress to try to warn about bureaucratic problems with U.S. hostage recovery efforts, problems that he believed were putting lives at risk. He was accused of improperly transmitting classified information to Congress in the process. This war hero was removed from his job, was escorted out of the Pentagon, had his clearances suspended, had his scheduled retirement delayed indefinitely, was fingerprinted and had a mug shot taken, was threatened with court-martial, and was subject to extensive investigation. After almost a year of being investigated, the Army decided not to court-martial Lieutenant Colonel Amerine. Instead, he was awarded the Legion of Merit for exceptionally meritorious service and was finally allowed to retire. But look at how differently he, a war hero, was treated when accused of mishandling classified information compared to Secretary Clinton and her associates. Where was the minority leader in trying to help this war hero from these attacks from this administration? Nowhere to be seen is the answer to that. It is apparent that some have a selective memory when it comes to putting value on oversight and investigations. But I do not. I have been consistent in my oversight role my entire career, investigating Republicans and Democrats. My oversight and investigations unit is involved in many investigations. The vast majority of them have nothing to do with Secretary Clinton. Looking out for the public interest isn't a waste of time, and I will keep at it regardless of misguided attacks on my motivations and mischaracterizations of my work. I will continue this investigation because the American people have a right to the truth and government officials have an obligation to answer to ``We the People.'' Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article dated September 4, 2015, be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the Daily Beast, Sept. 4, 2015] The Hillary Email Double Standard (By Danielle Brian) How whistleblowers see their lives destroyed over infractions the powerful get away with. Watching the news about Hillary Clinton's emails, it is remarkable to see how many people now have opinions about the overclassification of information and the relative merits of prosecuting people for mishandling classified material or destroying government records. Newspapers, blogs, and television reports are full of pundits explaining the law as they see it, with people opining about who is right: the two Inspectors General who assert there was classified material in her emails, or the State Department, which asserts that the information was not classified at the time. So where were all these ``experts'' when whistleblowers accused of the same infraction--mishandling classified material--were forced to spend a fortune on lawyers, were fired from their jobs, and were threatened with imprisonment? The amount of time being spent by Hillary Clinton defenders and detractors parsing rules, policies, and laws on whether she broke the law is maddening. That time desperately needs to be spent on transforming the classification system and modernizing electronic records retention policies, as promised in the Obama administration's second National Action Plan for the Open Government Partnership nearly two years ago. It is hard to reconcile Clinton's actions with her speech at the 2012 opening session of the Open Government Partnership: ``In the 21st century, the United States is convinced that one of the most significant divisions among nations will not be north/south, east/west, religious, or any other category so much as whether they are open or closed societies. We believe that countries with open governments, open economies, and open societies will increasingly flourish. They will become more prosperous, healthier, more secure, and more peaceful.'' She was right then. It is essential to maintain the records of our policymakers for historical analysis so that the public can know what actions have been taken in our name by our leaders. Clinton did not maintain these records. The fact is she indisputably broke the rules, and although that is not a criminal offense, it certainly is a political one. Even more infuriating is the disparity of treatment between the politically powerful and everyday truth-tellers. High- level officials often receive little more than a tap on the wrist for mishandling classified information. But whistleblowers seeking to expose wrongdoing and protect the public are almost without exception subjected to overzealous investigations and prosecution. Rather than focusing on the distinction between whether a person deliberately released classified information or not, the more appropriate lens is whether there was an intended public benefit for that disclosure, such as protecting public health or safety or revealing wrongdoing. Of course the Secretary of State had some classified information in her emails. As Bill Leonard, former director of the federal Information Security Oversight Office, told Reuters, information that foreign officials give U.S. officials in confidence is ``born classified.'' And yes, the government is dramatically overclassifying information. Clinton herself tweeted that the government's ridiculous classification rules are the ``real problem.'' But rather than tackling the many problems with the classification system, or investigating Clinton through the post-Wikileaks ``insider threat'' program created to investigate individuals who exploited, compromised, or made an unauthorized disclosure of classified information, the State Department has spent weeks defending their former boss and claiming dismissively that nothing was classified at the time anyway. General Petraeus, who deliberately gave classified information to his lover/biographer, was afforded similar latitude, with Senator Feinstein going so far as to make a public plea for clemency in his case. In the end he was only given a paltry fine--one that he will be able to pay off with less than one of his speaking engagement fees. The Department of Defense Inspector General (IG) tried to bury, and then gutted, its own report that concluded then-CIA Director Leon Panetta had released classified information about the Osama bin Laden raid to the Zero Dark Thirty Hollywood producers. Panetta was never penalized despite the IG's findings. In stark comparison, even national security whistleblowers who worked through proper channels, including reporting to their superiors, Inspectors General, and the Congress, are faced with a white-hot vindictive frontal attack from the government. NSA whistleblower Tom Drake and Justice Department whistleblower Thomas Tamm both had armed FBI agents raid their homes. Drake reported to the Pentagon IG and Congress about the NSA's unconstitutional and wasteful overreach through its domestic surveillance program (years before Edward Snowden). Tamm also challenged the legality of the government's warrantless wiretap program. Tamm lost his clearance and his government career. Drake was prosecuted for espionage and lost his career after pleading to the misdemeanor of ``excceding the authorized use of a computer.'' Both spent a fortune on attorneys. Air Marshal Robert MacLean had to take his case all the way to the Supreme Court to prove that he had a right to reveal unclassified information to a TV reporter about the TSA's decision to remove air marshals from high-risk flights after 9/11. His disclosure forced the TSA to reverse their plan and to better protect the public by keeping air marshals on cross-country flights. MacLean won, but he and his family had to put their lives on hold while he fought his case for years without a paycheck. Lieutenant Colonel Jason Amerine is being investigated by the Army Criminal Investigation Division over accusations of revealing classified information to Congress, which is permitted by law to receive disclosures about wrongdoing in the executive branch. His disclosure to Congress led the White House to overhaul its hostage recovery policies. Yet his retirement from the military, after an extraordinary and decorated career in the Army, has been put on hold indefinitely as the investigation drags on. Our system now protects the powerful and attacks the heroes, both of which are fundamentally un-American. So let's stop wasting time making politically expedient proclamations that serve no purpose but to score points for candidates. There are real issues all the campaigns should address: We need to dramatically shrink the incidence of and incentives for overclassification. We also need to apply a public interest balancing test so that when there is an alleged breach of classified information, the violation is weighed against the benefits of the information becoming known. [[Page S7892]] And we need to level the playing field so that there aren't different accountability standards for those with clout and those without. If the dialogue doesn't change, most federal employees who witnesses waste, fraud. or abuse will feel the chill and decide against stepping forward while the politically powerful class will continue to be rewarded and see their transgressions forgiven.

by the congress is as old as the constitution, it is a critical role, and it is one that was intended by the writers of the constitution. i believe oversight leads to better government, better laws, and actually saves the taxpayers money. that is why this senator works very hard at oversight. i went after the reagan defense department for wasteful spending in the 1980s. i held up the department of justice nominees during the bush administration to get my oversight letters answered, just as i am doing now with the obama department of state. i voted in support of giving the judiciary committee

CREC-2015-11-10-pt1-PgS7892-2,CREC-2015-11-10,114,VETERANS DAY,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7892-S7893] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VETERANS DAY Lucius Forsyth and Robert ``Emmett'' Stanley Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, in commemoration, celebration, and honor of Veterans Day, I would like to share the stories of two Louisiana heroes who served in World War II: Lucius Forsyth and Robert ``Emmett'' Stanley--two Louisianans who answered the call to serve and did so most honorably. Lucius Forsyth left his home in Paulina, LA, to serve in World War II in his late teens as a U.S. Navy seaman aboard the USS Saratoga. On February 21, 1945, Lucius and the crew of the Saratoga experienced the most concentrated assault of World War II against a warship. The Saratoga and her 3,500 sailors fought bravely as the Japanese forces attacked the ship for 3 hours. Bombs were dropped and five Japanese kamikazes crashed their aircraft into the Saratoga. Seven levels below the main deck, Lucius knew that the impact of a bomb or a kamikaze near his location would [[Page S7893]] mean certain death. Ignoring the danger, Lucius continued to work in the compartments adjacent to the ammunition stockpiles. Mr. President, 125 members of the Saratoga lost their lives that day. Lucius remained aboard the Saratoga for the rest of the war. After the Japanese surrendered, he returned home, married Rita Bourgeois of Gonzales, LA, raised 5 children, and today is blessed with 21 grandchildren and 20 great-grandchildren. The other Louisiana veteran I would like to recognize is Robert ``Emmett'' Stanley. Born in New Orleans in 1923, Emmett left home shortly after graduating from high school to serve the United States. He enlisted in the Navy Reserve in 1943 and served as a seaman first class on the USS Luce. On the morning of May 4, 1945, 1 day after Emmett's 22nd birthday, Japanese kamikaze pilots attacked the USS Luce. Emmett was knocked to the deck as shrapnel pierced his scalp through his steel helmet and fragmented pieces went into his legs. He still feels pain from those injuries today. Emmett and the other crew members were soon given orders to abandon the USS Luce after more kamikazes struck. Emmett swam 40 yards away from the sinking ship to avoid being sucked under by the waves, but a second explosion forced more shrapnel into his stomach. Out of the 312 men on the USS Luce, 126 were killed in the attack. Although eligible then, Emmett did not receive his Purple Heart until October 17 of this year, when he was the honoree at the U.S. Navy Birthday Ball. He was thrilled to be surrounded by his entire family. These are two stories about heroism and valor, but there are many more. Let me brag a little bit about a couple of young men who work on my staff. One young man, Chris Anderson, enlisted in the Army after completing his college education. He could have pursued business or graduate school, but Chris wanted to serve our country in the War on Terror. He did so bravely and honorably in Afghanistan clearing ordnance. Imagine what his mother thought every night, knowing the job he had. Now he is a tireless advocate for VA reform so that those he served with can get the care they need and deserve. Another member of my staff back in Baton Rouge, Michael Eby, served in the Louisiana National Guard for 9 years and was awarded the National Defense Medal and the Louisiana War Cross. To Lucius, Emmett, Chris, and Michael and all who served and serve now, thank you for your service. This Veterans Day and every day, we remember your sacrifices, courage, and dedication to ensuring that our children, their children, and we all can live in freedom in the greatest Nation in the world. May God bless you, your families, and the United States of America. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Boozman).

Mr. President, in commemoration, celebration, and honor of Veterans Day, I would like to share the stories of two Louisiana heroes who served in World War II: Lucius Forsyth and Robert ``Emmett'' Stanley--two Louisianans who answered the call to serve and did so most honorably. Lucius Forsyth left his home in Paulina, LA, to serve in World War II in his late teens as a U.S. Navy seaman aboard the USS Saratoga. On February 21, 1945, Lucius and the crew of the Saratoga experienced the most concentrated assault of World War II against a warship. The Saratoga and her 3,500 sailors fought bravely as the Japanese forces attacked the ship for 3 hours. Bombs were dropped and five Japanese kamikazes crashed their aircraft into the Saratoga. Seven levels below the main deck, Lucius knew that the impact of a bomb or a kamikaze near his location would [[Page S7893]] mean certain death. Ignoring the danger, Lucius continued to work in the compartments adjacent to the ammunition stockpiles. Mr. President, 125 members of the Saratoga lost their lives that day. Lucius remained aboard the Saratoga for the rest of the war. After the Japanese surrendered, he returned home, married Rita Bourgeois of Gonzales, LA, raised 5 children, and today is blessed with 21 grandchildren and 20 great-grandchildren. The other Louisiana veteran I would like to recognize is Robert ``Emmett'' Stanley. Born in New Orleans in 1923, Emmett left home shortly after graduating from high school to serve the United States. He enlisted in the Navy Reserve in 1943 and served as a seaman first class on the USS Luce. On the morning of May 4, 1945, 1 day after Emmett's 22nd birthday, Japanese kamikaze pilots attacked the USS Luce. Emmett was knocked to the deck as shrapnel pierced his scalp through his steel helmet and fragmented pieces went into his legs. He still feels pain from those injuries today. Emmett and the other crew members were soon given orders to abandon the USS Luce after more kamikazes struck. Emmett swam 40 yards away from the sinking ship to avoid being sucked under by the waves, but a second explosion forced more shrapnel into his stomach. Out of the 312 men on the USS Luce, 126 were killed in the attack. Although eligible then, Emmett did not receive his Purple Heart until October 17 of this year, when he was the honoree at the U.S. Navy Birthday Ball. He was thrilled to be surrounded by his entire family. These are two stories about heroism and valor, but there are many more. Let me brag a little bit about a couple of young men who work on my staff. One young man, Chris Anderson, enlisted in the Army after completing his college education. He could have pursued business or graduate school, but Chris wanted to serve our country in the War on Terror. He did so bravely and honorably in Afghanistan clearing ordnance. Imagine what his mother thought every night, knowing the job he had. Now he is a tireless advocate for VA reform so that those he served with can get the care they need and deserve. Another member of my staff back in Baton Rouge, Michael Eby, served in the Louisiana National Guard for 9 years and was awarded the National Defense Medal and the Louisiana War Cross. To Lucius, Emmett, Chris, and Michael and all who served and serve now, thank you for your service. This Veterans Day and every day, we remember your sacrifices, courage, and dedication to ensuring that our children, their children, and we all can live in freedom in the greatest Nation in the world.

CREC-2015-11-10-pt1-PgS7892,CREC-2015-11-10,114,ACCOUNTABILITY FOR LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S7892] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ACCOUNTABILITY FOR LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, before long, two must-pass pieces of legislation will come to the floor, a highway bill and a government- funding bill. It is like ringing the dinner bell for Wall Street banks. The lobbyists are swarming this place. They want to roll back financial regulations, and they are working every contact they can to attach these rollbacks to anything that moves. It is a pretty neat trick. They probably can't get a rollback of financial regulations passed out in the open where Americans can see what is happening and see which Senators and which representatives voted to gut the rules for Wall Street banks. So they slipped these rollbacks into must-pass legislation, which gives the financial industry's friends in Congress a lot of cover. Of course, it is not just Wall Street that is trying this. Lobbyists and their Republican allies want to weaken the rules protecting workers, retirees, and our environment. They want to defund Planned Parenthood, attack civil rights laws, and shove all kinds of other provisions that would be terrible for our country. But, as in so many things, Wall Street is the true master of this strategy. It has been almost 1 year since Citigroup lobbyists wrote a provision to blast a hole in Dodd-Frank and, at the last minute, got it attached to a government funding bill. Since the government would have shut down if the funding bill hadn't passed, that Citigroup amendment made it through tacked on the back of the funding deal. The provision that got blown up last year was called ``Prohibition against Federal Government bailouts of swaps entities.'' The idea behind the rule is pretty simple. If a bank wanted to enter into certain risky deals--such as the credit default swaps that had been at the heart of the 2008 crisis--it had to bear all of the risk itself instead of passing it along to taxpayers. That was the provision that Congress repealed. Because Democrats weren't willing to shut down the government, Wall Street won that round. But this isn't over. Congressman Elijah Cummings and I decided to hunt down the impact of the Citigroup amendment. We opened an investigation, and today we released our findings. There are lots of details, but here is the takeaway. The FDIC estimates that the provision written by Citigroup lobbyists last year allows a few banks to put taxpayers on the hook for risky swaps with an estimated value of nearly $10 trillion. And what does it mean to load up on swaps such as this? The FDIC said: ``Generally speaking, large volumes of derivative activity conducted by a [bank] would be expected to increase its risk profile. And who is gobbling down most of this $10 trillion of risk? Three huge banks: Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America--three banks, nearly $10 trillion. Now $10 trillion is a lot of risky business. Just remember, the whole TARP bailout was less than $1 trillion. Now a few banks--a few too-big- to-fail banks--are going to keep another $10 trillion in risky business on their books. These banks will happily suck down the profits when their high-stakes bets work out, and they will just as happily turn to the taxpayers to bail them out when there is a problem--all of this because the lobbyists persuaded Congress to do just one little favor for them. Earlier today Congressman Cummings and I asked the Government Accountability Office to do more analysis of these issues. But whatever the GAO finds, Congress now has 10 trillion reasons to stand up to Citigroup and bring back the swaps pushout rule to ensure that working families in this country--families with mortgages and student loans to pay and kids to take care of--aren't on the hook again, this time for $10 trillion of the big banks' risky bets. Congress has one job here. Congress should strengthen, not roll back, financial rules before one of these banks takes down our economy again. But bills to hold the big banks more accountable aren't getting much traction around here. Instead, right now people in Congress are talking about repealing more Dodd-Frank provisions. That is right. At this very moment lobbyists and Senators are plotting new ways to take cops off the beat on Wall Street and to weaken, delay or dilute the rules that protect consumers and hold big banks accountable and then to hook those rollbacks either onto a bill to fund our highways or to keep our government open. Now, Republicans say: Hey, if you want to get something done, if you want to repair our roads or keep the government open, this is the price; help the big banks. To be fair, Republicans are also getting some help from some Democrats. They say: Wall Street accountability is important, but I just want to get something done around here for a change; so let's go along. Well, yes, I want to get something done too. Who doesn't? But I didn't come here to carry water for the big banks. If Republicans think it is time to talk about financial reform, then let's put it all on the table and let's have everyone in Congress-- Democrats and Republicans--declare publicly where they stand. If the industry wants to push rollbacks, then I want to make it easier to send bankers to jail when they launder money for drug cartels or when they rig foreign exchange markets or when they cheat pension funds out of desperately needed money. If the industry wants to chip away at financial oversight, then I want to have a serious, on-the-record conversation about breaking up the biggest banks. Let's start with the three that are taking $10 trillion in risky business onto their books: Citibank, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America. Yes, the American people want us to get something done. They are begging us to do some real work, but I don't hear a lot of my constituents asking us to water down financial rules and to do more favors for the big banks. So let's put it to the American people. Are you ready to weaken Dodd- Frank, to give the biggest banks in the country more chances to take more risks and to leave you holding the bag, or is it time for a little more accountability--accountability for large financial institutions that month after month are in the headlines for breaking the law? Is it time to stop pretending and truly get rid of too big to fail once and for all? We can let every Republican and every Democrat vote in Congress on these questions. Let's do it with microphones on and the cameras rolling, but not behind closed doors and out of public view. We need to vote on a highway bill. We need to vote on a government funding bill. And if there is anyone in this Chamber, Republican or Democrat, who thinks they can slip goodies for Wall Street into these bills without a fight, they are very wrong. I yield the floor.

The Senator from Louisiana. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S7892] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ACCOUNTABILITY FOR LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS Ms. WARREN.

but i didn't come here to carry water for the big banks. if republicans think it is time to talk about financial reform, then let's put it all on the table and let's have everyone in congress-- democrats and republicans--declare publicly where they stand. if the industry wants to push rollbacks, then i want to make it easier to send bankers to jail when they launder money for drug cartels or when they rig foreign exchange markets or when they cheat pension funds out of desperately needed money. if the industry wants to chip away at financial oversight, then i want to have a serious, on-the-record conversation about breaking up the biggest banks. let's start with the three that are taking $10 trillion in risky business onto their books: citibank, jpmorgan chase, and bank of america. yes, the american people want us to get something done. they are begging us to do some real work, but i don't hear a lot of my constituents asking us to water down financial rules and to do more favors for the big banks. so let's put it to the american people. are you ready to weaken dodd- frank, to give the biggest banks in the country more chances to take more risks and to leave you holding the bag, or is it time for a little more accountability--accountability for large financial institutions that month after month are in the headlines for breaking the law? is it time to stop pretending and truly get rid of too big to fail once and for all? we can let every republican and every democrat vote in congress on these questions. let's do it with microphones on and the cameras rolling, but not behind closed doors and out of public view. we need to vote on a highway bill. we need to vote on a government funding bill. and if there is anyone in this chamber, republican or democrat, who thinks they can slip goodies for wall street into these bills without a fight, they are very wrong. i yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from louisiana. ____________________",7034
CREC-2015-11-10-pt1-PgS7893,CREC-2015-11-10,114,CHILD POVERTY,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7893-S7895] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CHILD POVERTY Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to talk about a set of issues we don't, frankly, spend enough time on that relate to our children. I have often said--and I think it is true throughout this Chamber when we talk about these issues--that we come to this because we are concerned about the future of this country when we talk about what happens to our children. I have always believed--and I think this is a prevailing point of view here in this Chamber and across the country--that every child is born with a light inside them, the light of the full measure of their potential. Some children don't need a lot of help along the way. They are born into circumstances or into families or born to parents or there are other factors that give them an advantage. They have a lot of ability, and they do not need much in the way of intervention from any part of our society, including the government. Some children are born with a bright light, but it may not burn as brightly or shine as brightly as some other kids, and they need a little extra help. Some of those kids, if they get help when they are very young, can thrive and succeed and grow without any further help or assistance. If we are serious about growing the economy, if we are serious about creating jobs and creating the kind of opportunity that we say we are concerned about and that we say is part of the fabric of being an American, then we have to be concerned about what happens to our kids. A lot of what I will talk about today can be summarized in maybe one line: As kids learn more now, they are going to earn more later. We know all the data shows that. The child who has access to early learning will earn more later in life. It also is essential that they have access to quality health care and the kind of security that comes when you have enough to eat--food security. If we want our children to learn more now and earn more later, we have to make the right investments. Unfortunately, that child or any child won't be able to learn more now and therefore earn more later if they live a life of poverty. Maybe some will get through, but that is very difficult. If we don't take action against child poverty, we have already erected barriers in their path. Today, as of 2014, the latest numbers for child poverty in the United States are 21.1 percent. That number is up substantially since the great recession--a couple of percentage points--and therefore there are millions more children living in poverty. In Pennsylvania, it is only a little lower--19.4 percent. No one here would try to make the case that is acceptable, that 21 percent of children living in poverty is something we can accept. We should all be not only outraged by it but take action and have a sense of urgency to combat it. There are a couple of things we can do. First of all, we have to know what is happening to children on a broad range of topics. That is why we have to rely upon public policy expertise. There is a whole group of folks out there in organizations. I am holding in my hand just one example. You can't see it from a distance, but this is a kind of one- page summary by the Annie E. Casey Foundation--no relation to me but a great foundation that has tracked child well-being for years. They have four categories: economic well-being, education, health, and the fourth category is family and community. If you could see this up close, you would notice some categories. There are 16 altogether, with 4 indicators in 4 categories. If you look at the orange, wherever you see orange, that means the numbers are getting worse for children. If you see green, that means we are doing better. So it is a mixed report, with some numbers getting better over the last 5 years or 7 years or time increments such as that. But what has gotten worse since the great recession is that the number of children living in poverty has gone up. The number of children whose parents lack secure employment has gone up. Unfortunately, two other indicators of poverty--children in single- parent families is up, meaning the number has worsened, and children living in high-poverty areas is worse. I won't go into those numbers today, but that is just an indication that childhood poverty has been a challenge for a long time. It got a lot worse after the great recession, when our economy began to collapse and folks across the country paid the price, and a lot of children have paid the price. So what do we do about it? One thing we do is to begin to see that at long last we can't just talk about reducing child poverty. We can't just nibble around the edges or hope a program here or a program there will help. We have to have a strategy. In order to have a strategy, we have to have a goal, and the goal ought to be that we reduce child poverty and take the same approach, frankly, the United Kingdom took a couple of years ago. I will walk through some of the background, but Senator Baldwin and Senator Brown and I introduced a bill just last week--the Child Poverty Reduction Act--to establish that kind of a target to reduce child poverty. Under the legislation, child poverty would be cut in half in 10 years. So child poverty would be cut in half in a decade. The second goal would be to eliminate child poverty in 20 years. Deep poverty would be eliminated in 10 years--meaning the worst kind of poverty for our children and for our families. [[Page S7894]] To meet these goals, we would give an assignment to an interagency working group to reduce child poverty, to develop a plan, and include recommendations to improve coordination and efficiency of existing programs and initiatives, because there are a lot of them--and we can get to those in a moment--along with recommendations for new legislation, new strategies, and new approaches to focus on child poverty. Here is what happened in the United Kingdom. In 1999, the UK established a national child poverty target and measured in U.S. terms the UK's child poverty target, and the policy changes made in conjunction with that effort reduced Britain's child poverty rate by 50 percent in the first 10 years--a significant achievement. In comparison, between 2000 and 2013--a little more than a decade--in the United States, the child poverty rate increased by over 20 percent. So roughly in the same time period, as our poverty rate was going up for kids, the UK's poverty rate for children was going down. One of the reasons for that--not the only reason--is they set a target, and both sides came together--the labor party, the conservatives--and the country made it a goal. We haven't done that yet, and we need to focus on that kind of a goal. So one thing we need to do is to focus on a goal and have legislation to enact part of the strategy. Then, of course, we can't just stop there. We can't just assume having a target and working toward it is enough. One of the most powerful examples in my home State of Pennsylvania over the last couple of years of what it means to live in poverty--in this case, moms who were willing to tell their stories--is the effort undertaken by Witnesses to Hunger. That is what this photograph depicts--a child who was photographed by her mother. Other mothers were willing to take pictures of their children to tell the world about their own circumstances and to give us living proof of what it means to live in poverty, what it means to be a child living in poverty. That is Witnesses to Hunger. This all started at Drexel University, where they gave cameras to a group of moms who decided to open up their own lives, courageously and generously, and to tell us more about these challenges. The first picture after that is a picture of a young woman by the name of Monique who is on her way to her local WIC office--the Women, Infants, and Children Program--the office in this part of Philadelphia. Monique says: ``I love WIC because it supports me by helping me nurse my baby.'' That is a picture of her and her baby. The next picture is a picture of a group of classmates, and the mom's name is Shearine. Shearine's daughter joins her classmates in this photo. Here is what Shearine says about her circumstances and what she hopes for the future: My daughter and her classmates are symbols of change. They have hope for a brighter future and faith that the adults in their lives will work together to make a change. We must do whatever it takes so that they can grow up and be strong, educated adults. I think Shearine gave us all an assignment, not just speaking to herself. I think she gave us all an assignment that we have to make sure we are taking the steps necessary and essential to do all we can to give that bright future and to validate the faith those children have in us, whether we are going to meet our obligations to help those children--every single one of those children in that class picture. Finally, the last picture is of a young boy giving his mother Gale a great smile. In this photo, Gale captures her son's happiness as he holds up nutritious bananas. It is good to have that in the picture. When we talk about child poverty and hunger, it is not just some public policy issue, some issue for a think tank to analyze. Child poverty is depicted in some of these pictures, but it is also in our newspapers every day of the week and in our midst. I hope more of us will be summoned by our conscience to do something constructively about this issue. We have a lot to do in the next couple of months. We have child nutrition reauthorization, which is a great opportunity for us to, at long last, begin to take steps in the right direction. The Women, Infants, and Children Program I mentioned before is one of those. One reason I am so concerned about where we are in the WIC Program is that some children literally are caught in a nutrition gap. Because they are age 5, they may be caught in a gap where they are not getting school meals and they are not getting nutrition any other way. Some children can experience this nutrition gap almost 12 months, almost a year being caught because they turned 5. The time in this nutrition gap is a time when they are neither supported by WIC nor supported by a school meals program. We had the privilege recently of talking to a constituent from Western Pennsylvania. Her son is currently 4 years old. He will be enrolled in kindergarten in the fall of 2016. When he enrolls in school, he will get healthy meals, but in the next month when he turns 5, he will be cut off from the opportunity to benefit from the WIC Program. This child loves yogurt, fruit and vegetables and whole grains provided by the WIC Program, but he will not benefit from that because of this glitch in the law. So I propose a new bill, the Wise Investment in our Children Act, the WIC Act, to close the nutrition gap by allowing States to increase the age limit for WIC to age 6. We also have to be concerned, at the same time focusing on making changes to the WIC Program, to focus on another support for our children and families, the Child and Adult Care Food Program, so-called CACFB, as a quality source of nutrition. For many children, the meals they eat in childcare programs are the most nutritious meals they will eat all week. In other words, absent the childcare setting, they will likely not have a nutritious meal in the course of a week. As working families shuttle between home, childcare, and work, little time remains for food shopping, healthy meal planning or sitting down to eat healthy meals. The Child and Adult Care Food Program provides healthy, nutritious meals to more than 3 million children each day who are either in Head Start, Early Head Start or childcare programs in both centers and family childcare homes. I introduced this bill as well to focus, improve, and strengthen this program. The Child and Adult Care Improvement Act would enhance several aspects of this program, including allowing childcare centers and homes the option of serving a third meal for children who are in care for 8 or more hours a day. We have a lot to do, but we cannot get to the goal of reducing child poverty by 50 percent or reducing poverty overall in the near term in the next decade, unless we have a strategy, set a goal, and then begin to strengthen what works and improve the existing programs--whether it is WIC, the Child and Adult Care Food Program, the SNAP program--what used to be called food stamps. Whatever the program is, we have to strengthen and invest in it. We can't talk about all those lofty terms--like ``GDP growth, job growth, and growing economy'' and all the wonderful things that get discussed in this Chamber--without a strategy for our kids. We have a way to go, but I believe this commitment to our children is not just the right thing to do and it is not just something we ought to focus on as something consistent with what our conscience tells us, but it is in fact a great economic strategy for the country. If kids learn more now, they are going to earn more later. They can't learn more now if they don't have access to early learning, if they don't have access to healthy, nutritious foods, if they don't have access to quality health care, and if we don't protect them from people who would do them harm. If we do at least four of those things well--if we have early learning opportunities, opportunities to invest in food security strategies so they get healthy, nutritious foods, and we make sure they have quality health care in addition to early learning, we can move forward in a direction that gets us to the goal of making sure every child in this country has an opportunity to grow and to learn and to move in the future together. We can't do that if all we do in Washington is use phrases like ``job creation'' and ``economic growth'' without a strategy to get our kids there. We should make sure every child in this country has the same opportunity to learn and to grow. They can't do that if we as the adults don't give them that opportunity. [[Page S7895]] So as we look at some of the real lives depicted in these photographs, I think Shearine gave us a very powerful message today, where she said: ``They,'' meaning the children in the picture of the classroom--``They have hope for a brighter future and faith that the adults in their lives will work together to make change.'' Shearine is right. She has given me an assignment, she has given 99 other Senators an assignment, and a lot of other adults across the country. I believe this is a mission worthy of a great nation, just like every other major undertaking we have confronted and dealt with over many generations of greatness in our country. When we talk about American exceptionalism and what it means to be an American, part of being an American is making sure every child has the same opportunity to learn and to grow. We can do this. We can do it in a bipartisan fashion. If the United Kingdom can reduce child poverty, the United States can do the same. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7893-S7895] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] CHILD POVERTY Mr. CASEY.

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to talk about a set of issues we don't, frankly, spend enough time on that relate to our children. I have often said--and I think it is true throughout this Chamber when we talk about these issues--that we come to this because we are concerned about the future of this country when we talk about what happens to our children. I have always believed--and I think this is a prevailing point of view here in this Chamber and across the country--that every child is born with a light inside them, the light of the full measure of their potential. Some children don't need a lot of help along the way. They are born into circumstances or into families or born to parents or there are other factors that give them an advantage. They have a lot of ability, and they do not need much in the way of intervention from any part of our society, including the government. Some children are born with a bright light, but it may not burn as brightly or shine as brightly as some other kids, and they need a little extra help. Some of those kids, if they get help when they are very young, can thrive and succeed and grow without any further help or assistance. If we are serious about growing the economy, if we are serious about creating jobs and creating the kind of opportunity that we say we are concerned about and that we say is part of the fabric of being an American, then we have to be concerned about what happens to our kids. A lot of what I will talk about today can be summarized in maybe one line: As kids learn more now, they are going to earn more later. We know all the data shows that. The child who has access to early learning will earn more later in life. It also is essential that they have access to quality health care and the kind of security that comes when you have enough to eat--food security. If we want our children to learn more now and earn more later, we have to make the right investments. Unfortunately, that child or any child won't be able to learn more now and therefore earn more later if they live a life of poverty. Maybe some will get through, but that is very difficult. If we don't take action against child poverty, we have already erected barriers in their path. Today, as of 2014, the latest numbers for child poverty in the United States are 21.1 percent. That number is up substantially since the great recession--a couple of percentage points--and therefore there are millions more children living in poverty. In Pennsylvania, it is only a little lower--19.4 percent. No one here would try to make the case that is acceptable, that 21 percent of children living in poverty is something we can accept. We should all be not only outraged by it but take action and have a sense of urgency to combat it. There are a couple of things we can do. First of all, we have to know what is happening to children on a broad range of topics. That is why we have to rely upon public policy expertise. There is a whole group of folks out there in organizations. I am holding in my hand just one example. You can't see it from a distance, but this is a kind of one- page summary by the Annie E. Casey Foundation--no relation to me but a great foundation that has tracked child well-being for years. They have four categories: economic well-being, education, health, and the fourth category is family and community. If you could see this up close, you would notice some categories. There are 16 altogether, with 4 indicators in 4 categories. If you look at the orange, wherever you see orange, that means the numbers are getting worse for children. If you see green, that means we are doing better. So it is a mixed report, with some numbers getting better over the last 5 years or 7 years or time increments such as that. But what has gotten worse since the great recession is that the number of children living in poverty has gone up. The number of children whose parents lack secure employment has gone up. Unfortunately, two other indicators of poverty--children in single- parent families is up, meaning the number has worsened, and children living in high-poverty areas is worse. I won't go into those numbers today, but that is just an indication that childhood poverty has been a challenge for a long time. It got a lot worse after the great recession, when our economy began to collapse and folks across the country paid the price, and a lot of children have paid the price. So what do we do about it? One thing we do is to begin to see that at long last we can't just talk about reducing child poverty. We can't just nibble around the edges or hope a program here or a program there will help. We have to have a strategy. In order to have a strategy, we have to have a goal, and the goal ought to be that we reduce child poverty and take the same approach, frankly, the United Kingdom took a couple of years ago. I will walk through some of the background, but Senator Baldwin and Senator Brown and I introduced a bill just last week--the Child Poverty Reduction Act--to establish that kind of a target to reduce child poverty. Under the legislation, child poverty would be cut in half in 10 years. So child poverty would be cut in half in a decade. The second goal would be to eliminate child poverty in 20 years. Deep poverty would be eliminated in 10 years--meaning the worst kind of poverty for our children and for our families. [[Page S7894]] To meet these goals, we would give an assignment to an interagency working group to reduce child poverty, to develop a plan, and include recommendations to improve coordination and efficiency of existing programs and initiatives, because there are a lot of them--and we can get to those in a moment--along with recommendations for new legislation, new strategies, and new approaches to focus on child poverty. Here is what happened in the United Kingdom. In 1999, the UK established a national child poverty target and measured in U.S. terms the UK's child poverty target, and the policy changes made in conjunction with that effort reduced Britain's child poverty rate by 50 percent in the first 10 years--a significant achievement. In comparison, between 2000 and 2013--a little more than a decade--in the United States, the child poverty rate increased by over 20 percent. So roughly in the same time period, as our poverty rate was going up for kids, the UK's poverty rate for children was going down. One of the reasons for that--not the only reason--is they set a target, and both sides came together--the labor party, the conservatives--and the country made it a goal. We haven't done that yet, and we need to focus on that kind of a goal. So one thing we need to do is to focus on a goal and have legislation to enact part of the strategy. Then, of course, we can't just stop there. We can't just assume having a target and working toward it is enough. One of the most powerful examples in my home State of Pennsylvania over the last couple of years of what it means to live in poverty--in this case, moms who were willing to tell their stories--is the effort undertaken by Witnesses to Hunger. That is what this photograph depicts--a child who was photographed by her mother. Other mothers were willing to take pictures of their children to tell the world about their own circumstances and to give us living proof of what it means to live in poverty, what it means to be a child living in poverty. That is Witnesses to Hunger. This all started at Drexel University, where they gave cameras to a group of moms who decided to open up their own lives, courageously and generously, and to tell us more about these challenges. The first picture after that is a picture of a young woman by the name of Monique who is on her way to her local WIC office--the Women, Infants, and Children Program--the office in this part of Philadelphia. Monique says: ``I love WIC because it supports me by helping me nurse my baby.'' That is a picture of her and her baby. The next picture is a picture of a group of classmates, and the mom's name is Shearine. Shearine's daughter joins her classmates in this photo. Here is what Shearine says about her circumstances and what she hopes for the future: My daughter and her classmates are symbols of change. They have hope for a brighter future and faith that the adults in their lives will work together to make a change. We must do whatever it takes so that they can grow up and be strong, educated adults. I think Shearine gave us all an assignment, not just speaking to herself. I think she gave us all an assignment that we have to make sure we are taking the steps necessary and essential to do all we can to give that bright future and to validate the faith those children have in us, whether we are going to meet our obligations to help those children--every single one of those children in that class picture. Finally, the last picture is of a young boy giving his mother Gale a great smile. In this photo, Gale captures her son's happiness as he holds up nutritious bananas. It is good to have that in the picture. When we talk about child poverty and hunger, it is not just some public policy issue, some issue for a think tank to analyze. Child poverty is depicted in some of these pictures, but it is also in our newspapers every day of the week and in our midst. I hope more of us will be summoned by our conscience to do something constructively about this issue. We have a lot to do in the next couple of months. We have child nutrition reauthorization, which is a great opportunity for us to, at long last, begin to take steps in the right direction. The Women, Infants, and Children Program I mentioned before is one of those. One reason I am so concerned about where we are in the WIC Program is that some children literally are caught in a nutrition gap. Because they are age 5, they may be caught in a gap where they are not getting school meals and they are not getting nutrition any other way. Some children can experience this nutrition gap almost 12 months, almost a year being caught because they turned 5. The time in this nutrition gap is a time when they are neither supported by WIC nor supported by a school meals program. We had the privilege recently of talking to a constituent from Western Pennsylvania. Her son is currently 4 years old. He will be enrolled in kindergarten in the fall of 2016. When he enrolls in school, he will get healthy meals, but in the next month when he turns 5, he will be cut off from the opportunity to benefit from the WIC Program. This child loves yogurt, fruit and vegetables and whole grains provided by the WIC Program, but he will not benefit from that because of this glitch in the law. So I propose a new bill, the Wise Investment in our Children Act, the WIC Act, to close the nutrition gap by allowing States to increase the age limit for WIC to age 6. We also have to be concerned, at the same time focusing on making changes to the WIC Program, to focus on another support for our children and families, the Child and Adult Care Food Program, so-called CACFB, as a quality source of nutrition. For many children, the meals they eat in childcare programs are the most nutritious meals they will eat all week. In other words, absent the childcare setting, they will likely not have a nutritious meal in the course of a week. As working families shuttle between home, childcare, and work, little time remains for food shopping, healthy meal planning or sitting down to eat healthy meals. The Child and Adult Care Food Program provides healthy, nutritious meals to more than 3 million children each day who are either in Head Start, Early Head Start or childcare programs in both centers and family childcare homes. I introduced this bill as well to focus, improve, and strengthen this program. The Child and Adult Care Improvement Act would enhance several aspects of this program, including allowing childcare centers and homes the option of serving a third meal for children who are in care for 8 or more hours a day. We have a lot to do, but we cannot get to the goal of reducing child poverty by 50 percent or reducing poverty overall in the near term in the next decade, unless we have a strategy, set a goal, and then begin to strengthen what works and improve the existing programs--whether it is WIC, the Child and Adult Care Food Program, the SNAP program--what used to be called food stamps. Whatever the program is, we have to strengthen and invest in it. We can't talk about all those lofty terms--like ``GDP growth, job growth, and growing economy'' and all the wonderful things that get discussed in this Chamber--without a strategy for our kids. We have a way to go, but I believe this commitment to our children is not just the right thing to do and it is not just something we ought to focus on as something consistent with what our conscience tells us, but it is in fact a great economic strategy for the country. If kids learn more now, they are going to earn more later. They can't learn more now if they don't have access to early learning, if they don't have access to healthy, nutritious foods, if they don't have access to quality health care, and if we don't protect them from people who would do them harm. If we do at least four of those things well--if we have early learning opportunities, opportunities to invest in food security strategies so they get healthy, nutritious foods, and we make sure they have quality health care in addition to early learning, we can move forward in a direction that gets us to the goal of making sure every child in this country has an opportunity to grow and to learn and to move in the future together. We can't do that if all we do in Washington is use phrases like ``job creation'' and ``economic growth'' without a strategy to get our kids there. We should make sure every child in this country has the same opportunity to learn and to grow. They can't do that if we as the adults don't give them that opportunity. [[Page S7895]] So as we look at some of the real lives depicted in these photographs, I think Shearine gave us a very powerful message today, where she said: ``They,'' meaning the children in the picture of the classroom--``They have hope for a brighter future and faith that the adults in their lives will work together to make change.'' Shearine is right. She has given me an assignment, she has given 99 other Senators an assignment, and a lot of other adults across the country. I believe this is a mission worthy of a great nation, just like every other major undertaking we have confronted and dealt with over many generations of greatness in our country. When we talk about American exceptionalism and what it means to be an American, part of being an American is making sure every child has the same opportunity to learn and to grow. We can do this. We can do it in a bipartisan fashion. If the United Kingdom can reduce child poverty, the United States can do the same. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.

CREC-2015-11-10-pt1-PgS7895,CREC-2015-11-10,114,TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7895-S7896] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would point out to our colleagues, that we now have now received the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. It amounts to 5,544 pages, not including the dozens of side- agreements--three times the book I know the Presiding Officer knows, the Bible. It is three times the length of the Bible and several times the length of ObamaCare. It has just been delivered to us with all kinds of promises for good things that might result from its affirmation. No American has the resources to ensure that his or her interests are being protected in this document. It is so long and the ramifications are so broad that Congress cannot do its job to ensure that the people's interests are safeguarded by such an agreement. We already have trade deals with all the major TPP countries, except Japan. So I will say with real confidence this is much more than trade. If it was, a bilateral agreement with Japan would fix it. We have agreements with Australia, Chile, Canada, and other countries. The TPP is about the goal of creating a new global regulatory structure--what I have called a Pacific Union--transferring power from individual Americans and Congress, eroding Congress, to an unaccountable, unelected, international bureaucratic committee. Because President Obama has been given fast-track powers by this Congress--unwisely I think--Congress cannot amend this deal, we cannot strike one offending provision, apply a filibuster to force a supermajority of 60 votes, as we have to have for most legislation, or to apply a two-thirds treaty vote. Additionally, the White House writes the implementing legislation, which, in turn, necessarily supersedes any existing American law. So this is what we mean by fast-track. Today I would like to share a few thoughts about one aspect of this agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership Commission. There is a particular chapter in this mammoth agreement, chapter 27, titled-- innocuously enough--``Administrative and Institutional Provisions,'' which deals with the creation of a Trans-Pacific Partnership Commission. Section 27.1 outlines the creation of this Commission and who is a member. The agreement states that ``each party shall be responsible for the composition of its delegation.'' In other words, we are empowering the Trans-Pacific Partnership countries to create a new congress of sorts--a group with delegates that goes and meets and decides important issues that can impact everyday lives of Americans. The American representative in this Commission, which will operate in many ways like the U.N., will not be answerable to voters anywhere. How long will their terms be? How will they be chosen? Will there be any restrictions on lobbying, any requirements of transparency? Can they always meet in secret? Are there any ethics rules? The answer is, it will be whatever the TPP countries decide it will be. The fact that they negotiated this in secret for months--years, really--indicates that transparency is not a quality they value very highly. It is an entity untethered above and outside the Constitution of the United States. All our government agencies in the United States must answer to the Congress and the President, the Chief Executive. These institutions will not. So we need to be cautious. All I am saying is, why do we have to do this? Why do we have to create a Commission in which Vietnam or the Sultan of Brunei gets the same vote as the President of the United States? Section 27.2 lists several powers of the Commission which should be expected in any regulatory body. It is granted the power to oversee the implementation of the TPP and the power to supervise the work of relevant working groups under its jurisdiction. However, then the section states this: Under the rules, the Commission shall ``consider any proposal to amend or modify this Agreement,'' to change the agreement. They get to change the agreement. We can ratify this, but they get to change it whenever they deem appropriate. Also, the Commission shall ``seek the advice of non-governmental persons or groups on any matter falling within the Commission's functions'' and ``take such other action as the Parties may agree,'' while considering ``input from non-governmental persons or groups of the Parties.'' It also says it will consider the findings of international fora to help advise them. I guess one of the fora they will not be considering is a group like the National Federation of Independent Business, small businesses. None of these terms are defined as to what constitutes a nongovernmental person or group. What is that? Remember, when the Founders of our country negotiated the Constitution, they worried about every word. They thought about what it would mean and could mean decades, centuries later. They talked about creating a new form of government on this entire continent. They actually believed that could be possible, and it certainly has become reality. Have we given that kind of thought to the power we are delegating to this Commission? How will the agreement be amended or modified? Just last week, the Secretary of State, Secretary Kerry, was in Kazakhstan. He told the television station in Kazakhstan that he is interested in seeing China and Russia be added to the TPP and that they would consider the Philippines a prime candidate to join in the future. That is an interesting thing to announce, particularly in Kazakhstan. Since it impacts the people of the United States, it might be nice for him to be talking more to the people of the United States. So this would create a situation in which new countries can be added, it appears, most any different way. The point is, this global governance authority is open-ended. The agreement states that ``the Commission and any subsidiary body established under this Agreement may establish rules of procedures for the conduct of its work.'' It even covers climate regulation--a lot about climate regulation. The agreement states that ``the Parties acknowledge that transition to a low emissions economy requires collective action.'' Having been a proud cold warrior, I have never been happy with people who use the word ``collective.'' It makes me nervous. The TPP is a living agreement. According to the U.S. Trade Representative's own Web site, the living agreement provision is in the TPP: ``. . . to enable the updating of the agreement as appropriate to address trade issues that emerge in the future as well as new issues that arise with the expansion of the agreement to include new countries.'' It says it is to deal with trade issues and new issues. Are those issues nontrade? Are they environmental issues? Are they labor agreements or other kinds of things that are unrelated directly to trade? I think it is clear this would allow that to happen. Regardless, after the TPP is passed and Congress has blessed the union, the Senate will have no say in how the [[Page S7896]] Commission is established or the rules by which it is governed. It is untethered to the Congress. Second, currency manipulation is a serious issue. It is impacting our ability to trade effectively today in a very large way. Paul Volcker, Chairman of the Federal Reserve during a time when he and President Reagan transformed the American economy from raging inflation and interest rates to a sound economy, said that currency manipulation could wipe out decades of trade negotiations in a matter of minutes. We have seen that happen. Currency is huge and impacts so many companies. If you read the financial pages, you will see that companies are worried about their bottom line in large part because it will be harder for them to compete with foreign competitors who devalue their currency deliberately in order to gain an advantage in trade. But there is no enforceable currency mechanism in this agreement, although it was fought for in both Houses of Congress and came close, but it is not in it. On November 5, the Wall Street Journal wrote: ``Mexico, Canada and other countries signaled they were open to the [currency] deal when they realized it wouldn't include binding currency rules that could lead to trade sanctions through the TPP.'' This caused Ford Motor Company to immediately reject the TPP the day it was released. Their spokesman argued that they could not support a deal in which currency rules ``fell outside of TPP and [failed to] include dispute settlement mechanisms to ensure global rules prohibiting currency manipulation are enforced.'' This is a huge matter. Ford says that when they are selling an American-made automobile or truck in a foreign country, they are losing thousands of dollars as a result of currency manipulation by many of our trading partners. So it is hard to sell an automobile if our foreign competitors have, in effect, a comparative advantage on currency alone of several thousand dollars. The administration has zero interest in preventing foreign market manipulations and currency manipulations, and thus the TPP will cause massive job losses. It just will. We will be less able to compete. Let's be frank. I supported the Korean trade agreement. We have great allies in Japan and Korea and others in the Pacific, but they are tough trading partners--competitors, if you want to know the truth. They are competitors. They are mercantilists. They have a goal. Their goal is to sell as much as possible to foreign countries and particularly to the greatest market in the world, the market they lust to gain even more access to--our market. They want to sell to us. Through a whole lot of different mechanisms, they resist purchasing anything from us. Have we made any progress in lessening the trade deficit to Japan or Korea lately? It is not going to happen because these barriers are nontariff, currency being one of the most noteworthy. Foreign workers and governments under the TPP are not inhibited from illegally undercutting American workers through currency manipulation in order to export their unemployment to the United States. The way this happens is, if you have a business in a foreign country and the world market has slowed down and your exports are slowing down, if you devalue your currency, your product becomes cheaper and can be sold in the United States or other countries at a cheaper price, and you keep your people working and manufacturing those widgets, whereas the country that imported your product lays off its workers because it can't compete at that price--for the widgets. It is an artificial way to gain market advantage. In May of this year, I wrote the President and asked him simple questions. This is important, colleagues. I asked him to state whether the TPP would increase or decrease our trade deficit. He refused to answer. I asked him whether the TPP would increase or decrease the number of manufacturing jobs in the United States. He refused to answer. I asked him how the TPP would affect the average hourly wages of the American middle class. He refused to answer. He never wrote back. All that the proponents in the White House have said about this deal is that it would increase production and jobs in the export industries. But exporting is such a small part of American industry production. They don't mention how many jobs would be lost by the increased imports into our country. Dan DiMicco, the CEO emeritus of Nucor Steel, which operates steel plants all over the Nation, wrote in his recent book: The world says one thing about open markets and free trade but does another. Whatever sharp cultural or political or language differences may separate the Japanese from the Chinese, or the Germans from the French, this much they all have in common: they know how to advance and protect their economic interests. Mr. President, has my time lapsed? The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama, there is a 10-minute time limit. Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes to wrap up. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. SESSIONS. They know how to advance their interests, and we have not been effective in advancing ours. It is time to take TPP off the fast track, take this off the fast track and get busy defending the interests of the American people. DiMicco writes: In principle, any industrial policy would begin by saying the business of creating, making, and building things must be at the heart of any overreaching economic strategy. This agreement is not just about promoting trade; it is about creating a framework for a transnational union which supersedes the authority of Congress. Finally, if it were truly about opening markets to U.S. producers, the United States would simply have negotiated bilateral agreements with the countries we need to talk to. We are the world's greatest market for worldwide products that are made, and right now we give open access, incredibly, to foreign imports. Just look at those containerships on the Pacific coast stacked to the top. It is not working for jobs in America, it is not working for wages in America, and it is not working for manufacturing. We have to make things. Moving to a services economy would be failure. Of course we want trade. Of course we want to purchase items from abroad. I am not saying we shouldn't. What I am asking is, are we, in negotiating this trade agreement, giving even broader access to our markets without getting enough in return? That is the problem. America must make things. Consumption in America should be for Americans and for export. Our competitors want the opposite, and they have been winning, but they need us more than we need them; thus, we have great power to reverse this course. Figuratively speaking, some of our politicians will be pushing up daisies if they don't listen to what the American people are saying. They must listen to the sound, common sense of the people who hold the ultimate power. They expect us to make sure their interests are legitimately defended. I don't believe this trade agreement does that, and we will talk more about it as time goes by. I thank the Chair and yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7895-S7896] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would point out to our colleagues, that we now have now received the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. It amounts to 5,544 pages, not including the dozens of side- agreements--three times the book I know the Presiding Officer knows, the Bible. It is three times the length of the Bible and several times the length of ObamaCare. It has just been delivered to us with all kinds of promises for good things that might result from its affirmation. No American has the resources to ensure that his or her interests are being protected in this document. It is so long and the ramifications are so broad that Congress cannot do its job to ensure that the people's interests are safeguarded by such an agreement. We already have trade deals with all the major TPP countries, except Japan. So I will say with real confidence this is much more than trade. If it was, a bilateral agreement with Japan would fix it. We have agreements with Australia, Chile, Canada, and other countries. The TPP is about the goal of creating a new global regulatory structure--what I have called a Pacific Union--transferring power from individual Americans and Congress, eroding Congress, to an unaccountable, unelected, international bureaucratic committee. Because President Obama has been given fast-track powers by this Congress--unwisely I think--Congress cannot amend this deal, we cannot strike one offending provision, apply a filibuster to force a supermajority of 60 votes, as we have to have for most legislation, or to apply a two-thirds treaty vote. Additionally, the White House writes the implementing legislation, which, in turn, necessarily supersedes any existing American law. So this is what we mean by fast-track. Today I would like to share a few thoughts about one aspect of this agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership Commission. There is a particular chapter in this mammoth agreement, chapter 27, titled-- innocuously enough--``Administrative and Institutional Provisions,'' which deals with the creation of a Trans-Pacific Partnership Commission. Section 27.1 outlines the creation of this Commission and who is a member. The agreement states that ``each party shall be responsible for the composition of its delegation.'' In other words, we are empowering the Trans-Pacific Partnership countries to create a new congress of sorts--a group with delegates that goes and meets and decides important issues that can impact everyday lives of Americans. The American representative in this Commission, which will operate in many ways like the U.N., will not be answerable to voters anywhere. How long will their terms be? How will they be chosen? Will there be any restrictions on lobbying, any requirements of transparency? Can they always meet in secret? Are there any ethics rules? The answer is, it will be whatever the TPP countries decide it will be. The fact that they negotiated this in secret for months--years, really--indicates that transparency is not a quality they value very highly. It is an entity untethered above and outside the Constitution of the United States. All our government agencies in the United States must answer to the Congress and the President, the Chief Executive. These institutions will not. So we need to be cautious. All I am saying is, why do we have to do this? Why do we have to create a Commission in which Vietnam or the Sultan of Brunei gets the same vote as the President of the United States? Section 27.2 lists several powers of the Commission which should be expected in any regulatory body. It is granted the power to oversee the implementation of the TPP and the power to supervise the work of relevant working groups under its jurisdiction. However, then the section states this: Under the rules, the Commission shall ``consider any proposal to amend or modify this Agreement,'' to change the agreement. They get to change the agreement. We can ratify this, but they get to change it whenever they deem appropriate. Also, the Commission shall ``seek the advice of non-governmental persons or groups on any matter falling within the Commission's functions'' and ``take such other action as the Parties may agree,'' while considering ``input from non-governmental persons or groups of the Parties.'' It also says it will consider the findings of international fora to help advise them. I guess one of the fora they will not be considering is a group like the National Federation of Independent Business, small businesses. None of these terms are defined as to what constitutes a nongovernmental person or group. What is that? Remember, when the Founders of our country negotiated the Constitution, they worried about every word. They thought about what it would mean and could mean decades, centuries later. They talked about creating a new form of government on this entire continent. They actually believed that could be possible, and it certainly has become reality. Have we given that kind of thought to the power we are delegating to this Commission? How will the agreement be amended or modified? Just last week, the Secretary of State, Secretary Kerry, was in Kazakhstan.

I don't believe this trade agreement does that, and we will talk more about it as time goes by. I thank the Chair and yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina. ____________________",package_114_41.csv,14408,14408,14480,"[congressional record volume 161, number 167 (tuesday, november 10, 2015)] [senate] [pages s7895-s7896] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] trans-pacific partnership mr. sessions. mr. president, i would point out to our colleagues, that we now have now received the trans-pacific partnership agreement. it amounts to 5,544 pages, not including the dozens of side- agreements--three times the book i know the presiding officer knows, the bible. it is three times the length of the bible and several times the length of obamacare. it has just been delivered to us with all kinds of promises for good things that might result from its affirmation. no american has the resources to ensure that his or her interests are being protected in this document. it is so long and the ramifications are so broad that congress cannot do its job to ensure that the people's interests are safeguarded by such an agreement. we already have trade deals with all the major tpp countries, except japan. so i will say with real confidence this is much more than trade. if it was, a bilateral agreement with japan would fix it. we have agreements with australia, chile, canada, and other countries. the tpp is about the goal of creating a new global regulatory structure--what i have called a pacific union--transferring power from individual americans and congress, eroding congress, to an unaccountable, unelected, international bureaucratic committee. because president obama has been given fast-track powers by this congress--unwisely i think--congress cannot amend this deal, we cannot strike one offending provision, apply a filibuster to force a supermajority of 60 votes, as we have to have for most legislation, or to apply a two-thirds treaty vote. additionally, the white house writes the implementing legislation, which, in turn, necessarily supersedes any existing american law. so this is what we mean by fast-track. today i would like to share a few thoughts about one aspect of this agreement, the trans-pacific partnership commission. there is a particular chapter in this mammoth agreement, chapter 27, titled-- innocuously enough--``administrative and institutional provisions,'' which deals with the creation of a trans-pacific partnership commission. section 27.1 outlines the creation of this commission and who is a member. the agreement states that ``each party shall be responsible for the composition of its delegation.'' in other words, we are empowering the trans-pacific partnership countries to create a new congress of sorts--a group with delegates that goes and meets and decides important issues that can impact everyday lives of americans. the american representative in this commission, which will operate in many ways like the u.n., will not be answerable to voters anywhere. how long will their terms be? how will they be chosen? will there be any restrictions on lobbying, any requirements of transparency? can they always meet in secret? are there any ethics rules? the answer is, it will be whatever the tpp countries decide it will be. the fact that they negotiated this in secret for months--years, really--indicates that transparency is not a quality they value very highly. it is an entity untethered above and outside the constitution of the united states. all our government agencies in the united states must answer to the congress and the president, the chief executive. these institutions will not. so we need to be cautious. all i am saying is, why do we have to do this? why do we have to create a commission in which vietnam or the sultan of brunei gets the same vote as the president of the united states? section 27.2 lists several powers of the commission which should be expected in any regulatory body. it is granted the power to oversee the implementation of the tpp and the power to supervise the work of relevant working groups under its jurisdiction. however, then the section states this: under the rules, the commission shall ``consider any proposal to amend or modify this agreement,'' to change the agreement. they get to change the agreement. we can ratify this, but they get to change it whenever they deem appropriate. also, the commission shall ``seek the advice of non-governmental persons or groups on any matter falling within the commission's functions'' and ``take such other action as the parties may agree,'' while considering ``input from non-governmental persons or groups of the parties.'' it also says it will consider the findings of international fora to help advise them. i guess one of the fora they will not be considering is a group like the national federation of independent business, small businesses. none of these terms are defined as to what constitutes a nongovernmental person or group. what is that? remember, when the founders of our country negotiated the constitution, they worried about every word. they thought about what it would mean and could mean decades, centuries later. they talked about creating a new form of government on this entire continent. they actually believed that could be possible, and it certainly has become reality. have we given that kind of thought to the power we are delegating to this commission? how will the agreement be amended or modified? just last week, the secretary of state, secretary kerry, was in kazakhstan. he told the television station in kazakhstan that he is interested in seeing china and russia be added to the tpp and that they would consider the philippines a prime candidate to join in the future. that is an interesting thing to announce, particularly in kazakhstan. since it impacts the people of the united states, it might be nice for him to be talking more to the people of the united states. so this would create a situation in which new countries can be added, it appears, most any different way. the point is, this global governance authority is open-ended. the agreement states that ``the commission and any subsidiary body established under this agreement may establish rules of procedures for the conduct of its work.'' it even covers climate regulation--a lot about climate regulation. the agreement states that ``the parties acknowledge that transition to a low emissions economy requires collective action.'' having been a proud cold warrior, i have never been happy with people who use the word ``collective.'' it makes me nervous. the tpp is a living agreement. according to the u.s. trade representative's own web site, the living agreement provision is in the tpp: ``. . . to enable the updating of the agreement as appropriate to address trade issues that emerge in the future as well as new issues that arise with the expansion of the agreement to include new countries.'' it says it is to deal with trade issues and new issues. are those issues nontrade? are they environmental issues? are they labor agreements or other kinds of things that are unrelated directly to trade? i think it is clear this would allow that to happen. regardless, after the tpp is passed and congress has blessed the union, the senate will have no say in how the [[page s7896]] commission is established or the rules by which it is governed. it is untethered to the congress. second, currency manipulation is a serious issue. it is impacting our ability to trade effectively today in a very large way. paul volcker, chairman of the federal reserve during a time when he and president reagan transformed the american economy from raging inflation and interest rates to a sound economy, said that currency manipulation could wipe out decades of trade negotiations in a matter of minutes. we have seen that happen. currency is huge and impacts so many companies. if you read the financial pages, you will see that companies are worried about their bottom line in large part because it will be harder for them to compete with foreign competitors who devalue their currency deliberately in order to gain an advantage in trade. but there is no enforceable currency mechanism in this agreement, although it was fought for in both houses of congress and came close, but it is not in it. on november 5, the wall street journal wrote: ``mexico, canada and other countries signaled they were open to the [currency] deal when they realized it wouldn't include binding currency rules that could lead to trade sanctions through the tpp.'' this caused ford motor company to immediately reject the tpp the day it was released. their spokesman argued that they could not support a deal in which currency rules ``fell outside of tpp and [failed to] include dispute settlement mechanisms to ensure global rules prohibiting currency manipulation are enforced.'' this is a huge matter. ford says that when they are selling an american-made automobile or truck in a foreign country, they are losing thousands of dollars as a result of currency manipulation by many of our trading partners. so it is hard to sell an automobile if our foreign competitors have, in effect, a comparative advantage on currency alone of several thousand dollars. the administration has zero interest in preventing foreign market manipulations and currency manipulations, and thus the tpp will cause massive job losses. it just will. we will be less able to compete. let's be frank. i supported the korean trade agreement. we have great allies in japan and korea and others in the pacific, but they are tough trading partners--competitors, if you want to know the truth. they are competitors. they are mercantilists. they have a goal. their goal is to sell as much as possible to foreign countries and particularly to the greatest market in the world, the market they lust to gain even more access to--our market. they want to sell to us. through a whole lot of different mechanisms, they resist purchasing anything from us. have we made any progress in lessening the trade deficit to japan or korea lately? it is not going to happen because these barriers are nontariff, currency being one of the most noteworthy. foreign workers and governments under the tpp are not inhibited from illegally undercutting american workers through currency manipulation in order to export their unemployment to the united states. the way this happens is, if you have a business in a foreign country and the world market has slowed down and your exports are slowing down, if you devalue your currency, your product becomes cheaper and can be sold in the united states or other countries at a cheaper price, and you keep your people working and manufacturing those widgets, whereas the country that imported your product lays off its workers because it can't compete at that price--for the widgets. it is an artificial way to gain market advantage. in may of this year, i wrote the president and asked him simple questions. this is important, colleagues. i asked him to state whether the tpp would increase or decrease our trade deficit. he refused to answer. i asked him whether the tpp would increase or decrease the number of manufacturing jobs in the united states. he refused to answer. i asked him how the tpp would affect the average hourly wages of the american middle class. he refused to answer. he never wrote back. all that the proponents in the white house have said about this deal is that it would increase production and jobs in the export industries. but exporting is such a small part of american industry production. they don't mention how many jobs would be lost by the increased imports into our country. dan dimicco, the ceo emeritus of nucor steel, which operates steel plants all over the nation, wrote in his recent book: the world says one thing about open markets and free trade but does another. whatever sharp cultural or political or language differences may separate the japanese from the chinese, or the germans from the french, this much they all have in common: they know how to advance and protect their economic interests. mr. president, has my time lapsed? the presiding officer. the senator from alabama, there is a 10-minute time limit. mr. sessions. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes to wrap up. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. sessions. they know how to advance their interests, and we have not been effective in advancing ours. it is time to take tpp off the fast track, take this off the fast track and get busy defending the interests of the american people. dimicco writes: in principle, any industrial policy would begin by saying the business of creating, making, and building things must be at the heart of any overreaching economic strategy. this agreement is not just about promoting trade; it is about creating a framework for a transnational union which supersedes the authority of congress. finally, if it were truly about opening markets to u.s. producers, the united states would simply have negotiated bilateral agreements with the countries we need to talk to. we are the world's greatest market for worldwide products that are made, and right now we give open access, incredibly, to foreign imports. just look at those containerships on the pacific coast stacked to the top. it is not working for jobs in america, it is not working for wages in america, and it is not working for manufacturing. we have to make things. moving to a services economy would be failure. of course we want trade. of course we want to purchase items from abroad. i am not saying we shouldn't. what i am asking is, are we, in negotiating this trade agreement, giving even broader access to our markets without getting enough in return? that is the problem. america must make things. consumption in america should be for americans and for export. our competitors want the opposite, and they have been winning, but they need us more than we need them; thus, we have great power to reverse this course. figuratively speaking, some of our politicians will be pushing up daisies if they don't listen to what the american people are saying. they must listen to the sound, common sense of the people who hold the ultimate power. they expect us to make sure their interests are legitimately defended. i don't believe this trade agreement does that, and we will talk more about it as time goes by. i thank the chair and yield the floor. the presiding officer. the senator from north carolina. ____________________",14408

Mr. President, I have the sad duty to report to the Senate the passing of the first lady of North Carolina, Dorothy ``Dot'' Helms. Mrs. Helms was known to many in this body as the ever gracious wife of my illustrious predecessor, Senator Jesse Helms. In fact, I chose to stand at this desk because it is the desk he stood behind for the many years as he served the United States and the great State of North Carolina in the Senate. For 66 years Dot Helms was the rock upon which the Helms legacy was built. Long before she met her future husband, Dot Helms was a trailblazer in North Carolina. She was the first woman to graduate from the University of North Carolina school of journalism in 1940, where she rubbed elbows with the likes of fellow Tar Heels, Edward R. Murrow and friend and classmate David Brinkley. While a reporter for the legendary owner-editor of the Raleigh News and Observer, Joseph Daniels, she met a young man on the sports desk named Jesse Helms, and the rest is history. [[Page S7897]] Mrs. Helms was a leader in Christian causes, such as her sponsorship of the interdenominational children's camp Willow Run at Lake Gaston. While in Washington, she taught at Gallaudet University and actually wrote a book on great Americans who happened to be deaf. In the Senate, she was the leader of the Senate Ladies Bible Study, the Congressional Wives Prayer Group, and the U.S. Senate chapter of the Red Cross. She was a confidante and pillar for many friends on both sides of the aisle, including Elizabeth Dole, Erma Byrd, Beryl Bentsen, and Linda Johnson Robb. Politically, she was a close friend of Ronald and Nancy Reagan. In 1976, she took the unusual step of campaigning tirelessly across the State of North Carolina in support of then-Governor Reagan's insurgent Presidential candidacy. Needless to say, the Governor carried the North Carolina primary against a sitting President in no small part due to the work of Dot Helms. Two years ago, Gov. Pat McCrory awarded Dorothy Helms the Order of the Long Leaf Pine for her contributions to the civic and religious life of the Tar Heel State. Fittingly, the Governor honored her with the official North Carolina State toast: Here's to the land of the long leaf pine, The summer land where the sun doth shine, Where the weak grow strong and the strong grow great, Here's to ``Down Home,'' the old North State! ``Where the strong grow great. . . . '' Dot Helms and North Carolina are one and the same. For her family and friends and a grateful nation, we can turn in comfort to the Second Book of Timothy: ``I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, and I have kept the faith.'' Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the obituary of Mrs. Helms from the Jesse Helms Center Foundation in Monroe, NC, be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Dorothy Coble Helms 1919-2015 Dorothy Coble Helms, wife of former U.S. Senator Jesse Helms, passed away on November 6, 2015. She was the daughter of the late Jacob Lonnie and Coral Beaty Coble. Mrs. Helms was born in Raleigh, N.C. on March 25, 1919. She was graduated from Hugh Morson High School in Raleigh in 1936. She attended Meredith College from 1936 to 1938 before transferring to UNC-Chapel Hill, where she was graduated in 1940 with a degree in journalism. She and her roommate, Doris Goerch Horton, were the first two women graduates to receive degrees in journalism from UNC. Both women were reporters for The Daily Tarheel, the school newspaper. Dot, as she was called by her friends, was the first president of The McIver Dormitory for Women and served on The Women's Council. She loved to write and wrote many short stories beginning when she was a teenager. Later in life, she delighted her family by telling ghost stories, and it was an especially fun time when she shared her stories at night on the porch at the family cottage at Topsail Beach. After graduating from UNC, Mrs. Helms worked at The Raleigh News and Observer as a city reporter and later as society editor. It was while working at The News and Observer that she met her future husband, a member of the sports department. They were married on October 31, 1942, at the First Baptist Church in Raleigh. One summer during the Second World War, while her husband was on recruiting duty for the Navy in the eastern part of North Carolina, she edited three weekly newspapers which were published in Ahoskie, NC: The Hertford County Herald, The Gates County Index, and The Bertie-Ledger Advance. Mrs. Helms also worked part time at The Star News when her husband was stationed in Wilmington, NC. Back in Raleigh after her husband's discharge from the U.S. Navy, Mrs. Helms was active in the Women's Missionary Union of Hayes Barton Baptist Church. She was also active in the Colonel Polk Chapter, DAR and served as regent for two years. In the early 1960s, Mrs. Helms and Mrs. Armistead Maupin (Diana) were instrumental in founding the Wake County SPCA. The Helms moved to Arlington, Virginia after Senator Helms was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972. While living there, Mrs. Helms was active in The Spouses of the Senate and in the Senate Ladies Bible Study. She was a volunteer at Gallaudet College for the Deaf and wrote a series of stories entitled ``Interesting Deaf Americans''. Some of the stories were used in English classes at Gallaudet and others were used in publications of schools for the deaf The Helms shared a deep interest in Camp Willow Run, a youth camp for Christ on the shores of Lake Gaston in North Carolina, and Mrs. Helms later wrote a history of the camp. Dot loved politics, and she backed many candidates through the years. She always kept up with what was going on in the world and was never without an opinion on an issue. She was instrumental in the formation of The Jesse Helms Center Foundation in Wingate, N.C. and served on the Board of Directors for many years. She was also involved with The Helms School of Government at Liberty University. Dorothy was the rock of her family. She will be missed so much, but the family rejoices that they had her for so long. She was predeceased by her husband, U.S. Senator Jesse Helms; her parents; her brother, Jack Coble, and her nephew Jack Coble, Jr. She is survived by her children, Jane Knox (Charlie), Nancy Helms, and Charles Helms (Kathleen). She is also survived by her seven grand-children, Rob Knox (Krystin), Jennifer Knox (Shields Carstarphen), Mike Stuart (Rachel Foster), Ellen Stuart Gaddy (Will), Katie Stuart Power (Andy), Amelia Helms, and Julie Helms; and six great grandchildren, Maggie McGuire, Ryan Knox, Cooper Knox- Carstarphen, Alex Knox-Carstarphen, Beatrix Gaddy, and Conrad Power.

Fittingly, the Governor honored her with the official North Carolina State toast: Here's to the land of the long leaf pine, The summer land where the sun doth shine, Where the weak grow strong and the strong grow great, Here's to ``Down Home,'' the old North State! ``Where the strong grow great. . . . '' Dot Helms and North Carolina are one and the same. For her family and friends and a grateful nation, we can turn in comfort to the Second Book of Timothy: ``I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, and I have kept the faith.'' Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the obituary of Mrs. Helms from the Jesse Helms Center Foundation in Monroe, NC, be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Dorothy Coble Helms 1919-2015 Dorothy Coble Helms, wife of former U.S. Senator Jesse Helms, passed away on November 6, 2015. She was the daughter of the late Jacob Lonnie and Coral Beaty Coble. Mrs. Helms was born in Raleigh, N.C. on March 25, 1919. She was graduated from Hugh Morson High School in Raleigh in 1936. She attended Meredith College from 1936 to 1938 before transferring to UNC-Chapel Hill, where she was graduated in 1940 with a degree in journalism. She and her roommate, Doris Goerch Horton, were the first two women graduates to receive degrees in journalism from UNC. Both women were reporters for The Daily Tarheel, the school newspaper. Dot, as she was called by her friends, was the first president of The McIver Dormitory for Women and served on The Women's Council. She loved to write and wrote many short stories beginning when she was a teenager. Later in life, she delighted her family by telling ghost stories, and it was an especially fun time when she shared her stories at night on the porch at the family cottage at Topsail Beach. After graduating from UNC, Mrs. Helms worked at The Raleigh News and Observer as a city reporter and later as society editor. It was while working at The News and Observer that she met her future husband, a member of the sports department. They were married on October 31, 1942, at the First Baptist Church in Raleigh. One summer during the Second World War, while her husband was on recruiting duty for the Navy in the eastern part of North Carolina, she edited three weekly newspapers which were published in Ahoskie, NC: The Hertford County Herald, The Gates County Index, and The Bertie-Ledger Advance. Mrs. Helms also worked part time at The Star News when her husband was stationed in Wilmington, NC. Back in Raleigh after her husband's discharge from the U.S. Navy, Mrs. Helms was active in the Women's Missionary Union of Hayes Barton Baptist Church. She was also active in the Colonel Polk Chapter, DAR and served as regent for two years. In the early 1960s, Mrs. Helms and Mrs. Armistead Maupin (Diana) were instrumental in founding the Wake County SPCA. The Helms moved to Arlington, Virginia after Senator Helms was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972. While living there, Mrs. Helms was active in The Spouses of the Senate and in the Senate Ladies Bible Study. She was a volunteer at Gallaudet College for the Deaf and wrote a series of stories entitled ``Interesting Deaf Americans''. Some of the stories were used in English classes at Gallaudet and others were used in publications of schools for the deaf The Helms shared a deep interest in Camp Willow Run, a youth camp for Christ on the shores of Lake Gaston in North Carolina, and Mrs. Helms later wrote a history of the camp. Dot loved politics, and she backed many candidates through the years. She always kept up with what was going on in the world and was never without an opinion on an issue. She was instrumental in the formation of The Jesse Helms Center Foundation in Wingate, N.C. and served on the Board of Directors for many years. She was also involved with The Helms School of Government at Liberty University. Dorothy was the rock of her family. She will be missed so much, but the family rejoices that they had her for so long. She was predeceased by her husband, U.S. Senator Jesse Helms; her parents; her brother, Jack Coble, and her nephew Jack Coble, Jr. She is survived by her children, Jane Knox (Charlie), Nancy Helms, and Charles Helms (Kathleen). She is also survived by her seven grand-children, Rob Knox (Krystin), Jennifer Knox (Shields Carstarphen), Mike Stuart (Rachel Foster), Ellen Stuart Gaddy (Will), Katie Stuart Power (Andy), Amelia Helms, and Julie Helms; and six great grandchildren, Maggie McGuire, Ryan Knox, Cooper Knox- Carstarphen, Alex Knox-Carstarphen, Beatrix Gaddy, and Conrad Power. Dot also leaves behind many other family members, including the wonderful people who are forever members of the Helms Senate family. ____________________",package_114_41.csv,7166,7166,7238,"[congressional record volume 161, number 167 (tuesday, november 10, 2015)] [senate] [pages s7896-s7897] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] remembering dorothy ``dot'' helms mr. tillis. mr. president, i have the sad duty to report to the senate the passing of the first lady of north carolina, dorothy ``dot'' helms. mrs. helms was known to many in this body as the ever gracious wife of my illustrious predecessor, senator jesse helms. in fact, i chose to stand at this desk because it is the desk he stood behind for the many years as he served the united states and the great state of north carolina in the senate. for 66 years dot helms was the rock upon which the helms legacy was built. long before she met her future husband, dot helms was a trailblazer in north carolina. she was the first woman to graduate from the university of north carolina school of journalism in 1940, where she rubbed elbows with the likes of fellow tar heels, edward r. murrow and friend and classmate david brinkley. while a reporter for the legendary owner-editor of the raleigh news and observer, joseph daniels, she met a young man on the sports desk named jesse helms, and the rest is history. [[page s7897]] mrs. helms was a leader in christian causes, such as her sponsorship of the interdenominational children's camp willow run at lake gaston. while in washington, she taught at gallaudet university and actually wrote a book on great americans who happened to be deaf. in the senate, she was the leader of the senate ladies bible study, the congressional wives prayer group, and the u.s. senate chapter of the red cross. she was a confidante and pillar for many friends on both sides of the aisle, including elizabeth dole, erma byrd, beryl bentsen, and linda johnson robb. politically, she was a close friend of ronald and nancy reagan. in 1976, she took the unusual step of campaigning tirelessly across the state of north carolina in support of then-governor reagan's insurgent presidential candidacy. needless to say, the governor carried the north carolina primary against a sitting president in no small part due to the work of dot helms. two years ago, gov. pat mccrory awarded dorothy helms the order of the long leaf pine for her contributions to the civic and religious life of the tar heel state. fittingly, the governor honored her with the official north carolina state toast: here's to the land of the long leaf pine, the summer land where the sun doth shine, where the weak grow strong and the strong grow great, here's to ``down home,'' the old north state! ``where the strong grow great. . . .

CREC-2015-11-10-pt1-PgS7897-2,CREC-2015-11-10,114,VETERANS DAY AND THE GI BILL,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7897-S7899] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VETERANS DAY AND THE GI BILL Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, tomorrow is Veterans Day, and it is a special day for all of us who serve here and for all of our colleagues down the hall in the House of Representatives. It is a special day for veterans across the country and around the world and their families and for a lot of Americans who value the service and sacrifice of our veterans. Veterans Day is not Memorial Day. On Memorial Day we mourn and salute those who have given their all in service to our country. Veterans Day is really for all veterans, not just for those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice. I was privileged to go to college. I won a Navy ROTC scholarship and went to Ohio State. I studied a little economics--my professors would say not enough--graduated and went off to Pensacola and became a naval flight officer in the late 1960s. I ended up with Patrol Squadron 40 out of naval air station, Moffett, CA. I joined my colleagues there for several tours of duty in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. When we came back to the States from overseas, I resigned my regular commission and took a reserve commission and moved from California over to Delaware to enroll in the University of Delaware's Business School and earned an MBA. Literally the first week I was in Delaware, in September of 1973, I got in my Volkswagen Karmann Ghia with a rebuilt engine and drove up Route 2, Kirkwood Highway, to north Delaware to the VA hospital in Elsmere, which is about halfway between Newark and Wilmington in northern Delaware. I took my DD Form 214 in with me to present it to the folks at the hospital to see if I was eligible for any veterans benefits, and as it turned out I was eligible for benefits. Some of the benefits actually have their roots going all the way back to the end of World War II when FDR signed--I think in 1944--legislation creating the original GI bill. Among the things I was eligible for was a home loan in which the VA would guarantee a portion of my loan so I could buy a house sometime later, and I did. I was also eligible for some medical benefits, including dental benefits. I didn't realize it at the time, but the VA hospital there was a World War II relic of a hospital. The morale was not good and the quality of service was not [[Page S7898]] good. If people in the central or southern part of our State needed access to a VA medical facility and they didn't have it there, they would have to somehow make their way up to northern Delaware. It is not like driving from one end of California to the other, but it is a hike. We didn't have any community-based, out-patient clinics in Delaware or any other States either at the time. That fall, those of us who were enrolled in school who were Vietnam War veterans, and in some cases other wars, were eligible for some benefits. The GIs who served in the Vietnam war, including me, were eligible for a GI bill benefit which was about $250 a month. It may not sound like a lot of money today, but I was happy to get every penny of it. I continued to fly with a new squadron at the naval air station in Willow Grove, PA--the P-3 Squadron--and continued to track Soviet nuclear submarines in oceans all over the world as a ready reservist. I am one of a number of people in my family who have benefited from the GI bill. My father's generation served in World War II. He was a chief petty officer. His brother and my other uncle served in World War II. One of them never made it home. He was 19 years old in 1944 and assigned to the USS Suwannee. The aircraft carrier was in the Pacific Ocean when it came under attack by Japanese kamikaze planes, and he lost his life. His body was never recovered and neither were the bodies of a number of other people who I guess were on the deck of the carrier when the attacks occurred. Other members of my family in my Dad's generation were able to take advantage of the very first GI bill, which was signed into law in 1944 by President Roosevelt. What happened in the wake of World War II was a very generous GI bill. At the time, you could go to Harvard on the GI bill, and it was basically fully paid for, plus you had a housing and living allowance. It was an incredible deal, and a lot of people took advantage of that, which is good. A lot of the folks went to colleges and universities, but others went to trade schools. I never really talked to my dad about this, but I am told that he learned how to do body work and to repair cars that had been wrecked. He went to some kind of private school or trade school and learned how to do that and ended up working at Burleson Oldsmobile in Beckley, WV, where my sister and I were born. He was able to somehow do a good job there and ended up working as a claims adjuster for Nationwide Insurance and ended up running the national school for claims adjusters for Nationwide Insurance. He was a guy with a high school degree from Shady Spring High School in Beckley, WV, and ended up, with the help of the Navy and the GI bill, with a wonderful career at Nationwide Insurance. He is sort of a poster child for those who were able to take that benefit and do something positive with it for their lives and for their families. In the wake of World War II, there was also an emergence of for- profit colleges and universities and for-profit trade schools. They called them proprietary trade schools, and they did not always have the best interests of the GI at heart. They were not always interested in making sure that the GI man or woman got the training and the help they needed to qualify for jobs, to go out there in that day and age and be gainfully employed and provide for themselves and their families. Some of the nonprofits that operated were very good and did a great job, others not so much. They took advantage of the GIs, and ultimately they took advantage of taxpayers. Over a period of time, back then and in the years since then, on the heels of the Korean and Vietnam wars, there emerged an effort on the part of the Federal Government to try to make sure we put in place some market forces to ensure that the for-profit schools, or proprietary schools, that were offering the benefits of colleges or universities-- that that college or university would treat the GI fairly, the way we would want to be treated, and to make sure they got the benefits that they wanted and that the taxpayers deserved. I think on the heels of World War II, there was an 85-15 rule that said if you happen to be a proprietary school and you were using the GI bill to pay for benefits for somebody--say you had 100 students; out of the 100, no more than 85 of them could be there on the Federal dime. The other 15 GIs, if you will, had to be there on their own or pay for it some way other than through the Federal Government. That was an early way to introduce market forces into the benefits that were being provided so we would end up with schools that were working and providing training certificates or degrees that were worth the paper they were written on. More recently, something emerged called the 90-10 rule. The GI bill had come and gone. For those who got into wars in Korea and Vietnam and more recently in the Persian Gulf in Iraq and now Afghanistan--the benefits that are offered to folks who literally served and applied for the GI bill I think after 2007 or 2008--that is a very generous GI bill. We sent off about 300 Delaware Guard men and women 2 months ago from Delaware to go serve in some cases in Afghanistan and in other cases maybe in Kuwait and at different duty stations around the world. But I told them when they went off to deploy that when they came back at the end of their 6, 7, 8 months--whatever it will be--that they will come back to the best GI bill in the history of the country. Here is what they come back to if they have served for, I think, 3 years. If they have served time in those parts of the world, they come back to a GI bill and if they went to a public college or university-- the University of Delaware, Delaware State, Wilmington University, Delaware Tech or a community college in my State or public colleges and universities across the country--they can go to those schools for free--pretty good, free. We got 250 bucks a month. They can go for free. Their tuition is paid for, books are paid for, fees are paid for, tutoring is paid for, and they get a $1,500 housing allowance. That is pretty good--very good. Just to make sure that we have some market forces in place to ensure that these for-profit colleges and universities are really doing a good job and not just taking advantage of the GIs or of the taxpayers, we have in place something called the 90/10 rule. It has been around for a while. The 90/10 rule says that no college or university--for-profit college or university, proprietary school, for-profit proprietary school or training school--can get more than 90 percent of their revenues from the Federal Government. But the 90 percent does not necessarily cover--it can cover Pell grants and things other than the GI bill. But the GI bill--a school can get all of their money from Pell grants, and students who are on the Federal dime and continue--Mr. President, I am not sure what is wrong with the public address system. I will try another mic. That is better. There we go. Today we have a loophole in the 90/10 rule that allows a college, university or a proprietary for-profit school to get 100 percent of their revenues from the Federal Government. It doesn't count the money they get from the GI bill. It covers Pell grants and other Federal aid but not the GI bill and not something called tuition assistance to Active-Duty personnel. I suggest that is something we need to fix. That is a loophole that needs to be plugged. No college or university should make 100 percent of their revenues off the Federal Government. The 90/10 rule is well-intentioned to make sure that market forces work, but I am sure that people getting their education from a source other than the Federal Government would ensure that the diploma they are getting--the certificate they are getting--is worth something and they are able to translate that into gainful employment. Several of us, including myself and Senator Blumenthal, have offered legislation to close the 90/10 rule and to really go back to the original intent--to say that no for-profit college or university or trade school can get more than 90 percent of the revenues from the Federal Government. You can add in the GI bill or you can add in Pell grants, tuition assistance for Active-Duty personnel, but that cannot exceed 90 percent--and educational entities' revenues. We need to restore that market force, that governing, if you will, to better ensure the integrity of these programs. So I would just say to my colleagues as we approach this Veterans Day, it is [[Page S7899]] great that we are able to offer a benefit that provides free--I don't care whether a person is from North Carolina or from Utah; they can go to college free and get a housing allowance for $1,500 a month. But I want to make sure that when a GI--I don't care if it is Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines or whatever--gets their certificate or diploma, it is worth the paper it is written on and that they will in some cases be able to go on to graduate school or further their learning, but almost in any case that it enables them to go on to a job that enables them to be self-sufficient. With that, I am going to yield the floor to the chairman of the Finance Committee, on which I am privileged to serve, and to say to both of my colleagues on the floor here: My best wishes to you and your constituents and have a wonderful Veterans Day. I will see you all next week. Thank you. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate the work of the Senator from Delaware on our committee. He is one of the good people around here. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7897-S7899] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VETERANS DAY AND THE GI BILL Mr. CARPER.

It doesn't count the money they get from the GI bill. It covers Pell grants and other Federal aid but not the GI bill and not something called tuition assistance to Active-Duty personnel. I suggest that is something we need to fix. That is a loophole that needs to be plugged. No college or university should make 100 percent of their revenues off the Federal Government. The 90/10 rule is well-intentioned to make sure that market forces work, but I am sure that people getting their education from a source other than the Federal Government would ensure that the diploma they are getting--the certificate they are getting--is worth something and they are able to translate that into gainful employment. Several of us, including myself and Senator Blumenthal, have offered legislation to close the 90/10 rule and to really go back to the original intent--to say that no for-profit college or university or trade school can get more than 90 percent of the revenues from the Federal Government. You can add in the GI bill or you can add in Pell grants, tuition assistance for Active-Duty personnel, but that cannot exceed 90 percent--and educational entities' revenues. We need to restore that market force, that governing, if you will, to better ensure the integrity of these programs. So I would just say to my colleagues as we approach this Veterans Day, it is [[Page S7899]] great that we are able to offer a benefit that provides free--I don't care whether a person is from North Carolina or from Utah; they can go to college free and get a housing allowance for $1,500 a month. But I want to make sure that when a GI--I don't care if it is Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines or whatever--gets their certificate or diploma, it is worth the paper it is written on and that they will in some cases be able to go on to graduate school or further their learning, but almost in any case that it enables them to go on to a job that enables them to be self-sufficient. With that, I am going to yield the floor to the chairman of the Finance Committee, on which I am privileged to serve, and to say to both of my colleagues on the floor here: My best wishes to you and your constituents and have a wonderful Veterans Day. I will see you all next week. Thank you. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate the work of the Senator from Delaware on our committee. He is one of the good people around here. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7897-S7899] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VETERANS DAY AND THE GI BILL Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, tomorrow is Veterans Day, and it is a special day for all of us who serve here and for all of our colleagues down the hall in the House of Representatives. It is a special day for veterans across the country and around the world and their families and for a lot of Americans who value the service and sacrifice of our veterans. Veterans Day is not Memorial Day. On Memorial Day we mourn and salute those who have given their all in service to our country. Veterans Day is really for all veterans, not just for those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice. I was privileged to go to college. I won a Navy ROTC scholarship and went to Ohio State. I studied a little economics--my professors would say not enough--graduated and went off to Pensacola and became a naval flight officer in the late 1960s. I ended up with Patrol Squadron 40 out of naval air station, Moffett, CA. I joined my colleagues there for several tours of duty in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. When we came back to the States from overseas, I resigned my regular commission and took a reserve commission and moved from California over to Delaware to enroll in the University of Delaware's Business School and earned an MBA. Literally the first week I was in Delaware, in September of 1973, I got in my Volkswagen Karmann Ghia with a rebuilt engine and drove up Route 2, Kirkwood Highway, to north Delaware to the VA hospital in Elsmere, which is about halfway between Newark and Wilmington in northern Delaware. I took my DD Form 214 in with me to present it to the folks at the hospital to see if I was eligible for any veterans benefits, and as it turned out I was eligible for benefits. Some of the benefits actually have their roots going all the way back to the end of World War II when FDR signed--I think in 1944--legislation creating the original GI bill. Among the things I was eligible for was a home loan in which the VA would guarantee a portion of my loan so I could buy a house sometime later, and I did. I was also eligible for some medical benefits, including dental benefits. I didn't realize it at the time, but the VA hospital there was a World War II relic of a hospital. The morale was not good and the quality of service was not [[Page S7898]] good. If people in the central or southern part of our State needed access to a VA medical facility and they didn't have it there, they would have to somehow make their way up to northern Delaware. It is not like driving from one end of California to the other, but it is a hike. We didn't have any community-based, out-patient clinics in Delaware or any other States either at the time. That fall, those of us who were enrolled in school who were Vietnam War veterans, and in some cases other wars, were eligible for some benefits. The GIs who served in the Vietnam war, including me, were eligible for a GI bill benefit which was about $250 a month. It may not sound like a lot of money today, but I was happy to get every penny of it. I continued to fly with a new squadron at the naval air station in Willow Grove, PA--the P-3 Squadron--and continued to track Soviet nuclear submarines in oceans all over the world as a ready reservist. I am one of a number of people in my family who have benefited from the GI bill. My father's generation served in World War II. He was a chief petty officer. His brother and my other uncle served in World War II. One of them never made it home. He was 19 years old in 1944 and assigned to the USS Suwannee. The aircraft carrier was in the Pacific Ocean when it came under attack by Japanese kamikaze planes, and he lost his life. His body was never recovered and neither were the bodies of a number of other people who I guess were on the deck of the carrier when the attacks occurred. Other members of my family in my Dad's generation were able to take advantage of the very first GI bill, which was signed into law in 1944 by President Roosevelt. What happened in the wake of World War II was a very generous GI bill. At the time, you could go to Harvard on the GI bill, and it was basically fully paid for, plus you had a housing and living allowance. It was an incredible deal, and a lot of people took advantage of that, which is good. A lot of the folks went to colleges and universities, but others went to trade schools. I never really talked to my dad about this, but I am told that he learned how to do body work and to repair cars that had been wrecked. He went to some kind of private school or trade school and learned how to do that and ended up working at Burleson Oldsmobile in Beckley, WV, where my sister and I were born. He was able to somehow do a good job there and ended up working as a claims adjuster for Nationwide Insurance and ended up running the national school for claims adjusters for Nationwide Insurance. He was a guy with a high school degree from Shady Spring High School in Beckley, WV, and ended up, with the help of the Navy and the GI bill, with a wonderful career at Nationwide Insurance. He is sort of a poster child for those who were able to take that benefit and do something positive with it for their lives and for their families. In the wake of World War II, there was also an emergence of for- profit colleges and universities and for-profit trade schools. They called them proprietary trade schools, and they did not always have the best interests of the GI at heart. They were not always interested in making sure that the GI man or woman got the training and the help they needed to qualify for jobs, to go out there in that day and age and be gainfully employed and provide for themselves and their families. Some of the nonprofits that operated were very good and did a great job, others not so much. They took advantage of the GIs, and ultimately they took advantage of taxpayers. Over a period of time, back then and in the years since then, on the heels of the Korean and Vietnam wars, there emerged an effort on the part of the Federal Government to try to make sure we put in place some market forces to ensure that the for-profit schools, or proprietary schools, that were offering the benefits of colleges or universities-- that that college or university would treat the GI fairly, the way we would want to be treated, and to make sure they got the benefits that they wanted and that the taxpayers deserved. I think on the heels of World War II, there was an 85-15 rule that said if you happen to be a proprietary school and you were using the GI bill to pay for benefits for somebody--say you had 100 students; out of the 100, no more than 85 of them could be there on the Federal dime. The other 15 GIs, if you will, had to be there on their own or pay for it some way other than through the Federal Government. That was an early way to introduce market forces into the benefits that were being provided so we would end up with schools that were working and providing training certificates or degrees that were worth the paper they were written on. More recently, something emerged called the 90-10 rule. The GI bill had come and gone. For those who got into wars in Korea and Vietnam and more recently in the Persian Gulf in Iraq and now Afghanistan--the benefits that are offered to folks who literally served and applied for the GI bill I think after 2007 or 2008--that is a very generous GI bill. We sent off about 300 Delaware Guard men and women 2 months ago from Delaware to go serve in some cases in Afghanistan and in other cases maybe in Kuwait and at different duty stations around the world. But I told them when they went off to deploy that when they came back at the end of their 6, 7, 8 months--whatever it will be--that they will come back to the best GI bill in the history of the country. Here is what they come back to if they have served for, I think, 3 years. If they have served time in those parts of the world, they come back to a GI bill and if they went to a public college or university-- the University of Delaware, Delaware State, Wilmington University, Delaware Tech or a community college in my State or public colleges and universities across the country--they can go to those schools for free--pretty good, free. We got 250 bucks a month. They can go for free. Their tuition is paid for, books are paid for, fees are paid for, tutoring is paid for, and they get a $1,500 housing allowance. That is pretty good--very good. Just to make sure that we have some market forces in place to ensure that these for-profit colleges and universities are really doing a good job and not just taking advantage of the GIs or of the taxpayers, we have in place something called the 90/10 rule. It has been around for a while. The 90/10 rule says that no college or university--for-profit college or university, proprietary school, for-profit proprietary school or training school--can get more than 90 percent of their revenues from the Federal Government. But the 90 percent does not necessarily cover--it can cover Pell grants and things other than the GI bill. But the GI bill--a school can get all of their money from Pell grants, and students who are on the Federal dime and continue--Mr. President, I am not sure what is wrong with the public address system. I will try another mic. That is better. There we go. Today we have a loophole in the 90/10 rule that allows a college, university or a proprietary for-profit school to get 100 percent of their revenues from the Federal Government. It doesn't count the money they get from the GI bill. It covers Pell grants and other Federal aid but not the GI bill and not something called tuition assistance to Active-Duty personnel.

CREC-2015-11-10-pt1-PgS7899,CREC-2015-11-10,114,RELIGIOUS LIBERTY,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7899-S7901] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RELIGIOUS LIBERTY Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak once again on the topic of religious liberty. This is the fifth in a series of addresses I have given on this vitally important subject. In my previous remarks, I have discussed why religious liberty matters, why it is important, and why it deserves special protection from government interference. I have also detailed the history of religious liberty in the United States in order to show that the desire for religious freedom was central to our Nation's founding and to the very idea of America. From the beginning, religious liberty has been a preeminent value in American life. Government accommodates religion--not the other way around. Lastly, in my previous remarks, I have sought to explain how religion has always had a robust public role in our society and to rebut the wrongheaded, ahistorical view that religion is a purely private matter that should be kept out of the public domain. Today I turn to the status of religious liberty in contemporary American life. My argument is straightforward. In ways that are both surprising and unprecedented, religious liberty is under attack here in the United States. I speak not merely of attacks on particular practices but also of attacks on the very idea of religious liberty itself--on the idea that there should be room in society for believers to live and to worship in ways that differ from prevailing orthodoxy. The campaign against religious liberty has three prongs: the courts, the Obama administration, and State legislatures. My goal today is to explain how each of these institutions is undermining the vitality of religious life in our country and why what they are doing is wrong. Many Americans are unaware of the substantial threats religious liberty faces here in the United States. They look abroad to the Middle East or to Africa, where Islamist regimes are killing Christians and other dissenters from religious orthodoxy, and suppose that by comparison, things are not so bad here in the United States. While it is true that religious minorities in America do not face death or serious physical harm for choosing to live their faith, we must not blind ourselves to the ways in which our government institutions are undermining religious liberty itself. We must instead come to recognize that powerful forces in our society are working actively to restrict the ability of religious believers to live out their faith and to foist upon them government mandates that are flatly inconsistent with our most deeply held beliefs. I begin with the courts, which I identified as the first front in the fight against religious liberty. For a number of years now there has been a steady stream of cases in which everyday Americans have been sanctioned--sometimes severely--for adhering to religious tenants that conflict with current political orthodoxy. The examples are myriad. A photographer in New Mexico was fined $7,000 for declining to photograph a same-sex commitment ceremony on the grounds that her religious beliefs teach that marriage is a union between one man and one woman and that she could not in good conscience lend her services to the event. A florist in Washington State was fined $1,000 for declining to provide flower arrangements for a same-sex wedding. And a couple in Oregon who owned a cake shop were ordered to pay $135,000 for telling a same-sex couple that they could not provide a cake for their wedding ceremony because the shop owners adhere to the traditional, biblically based view of marriage. The message that these court cases send is clear: If you are a religious individual with religiously rooted views that differ from the current policies of the State, you follow your beliefs at your own peril. Even those who don't endorse the view that it is appropriate for businesses to deny service to customers on the basis of deeply held beliefs must concede that the fines and other sanctions in these cases present a direct threat to religious liberty. Note that there was no suggestion in any of these cases that the defendant's refusal to provide services actually prevented the same-sex couple from obtaining the desired items. In each case, other photographers, florists, and bakers without religious or moral objections stood ready to assist. The State was not stepping in to ensure that the couple had access to needed goods and services. Rather, the injury to the couple in each case was that the defendant would not sanction their ceremony. The State did not like the message the defendant's religious beliefs conveyed and so ordered the defendant to pay a potentially ruinous fine. The notion that government can override or punish individuals for deeply held religious beliefs merely because those beliefs deviate from prevailing views strikes at the very heart of religious liberty. Religious liberty is the right of an individual to practice his or her beliefs even in the face of government, social or community opposition. If all that is needed for government to override a person's deeply held beliefs is a disagreement over whether the person's beliefs send the right message, then religious liberty is weak indeed. It is no longer a preferred value that government must make room for but rather a common, run-of-the-mill interest that government can override essentially at will. Recent court cases have undermined religious liberty and threaten the integrity of our religious institutions in other ways as well. One case, decided by the Supreme Court about 5 years ago, held that schools can require student religious groups to accept nonbelievers as leaders, even though doing so could undermine the group's mission and install as leaders individuals who do not share the group's core beliefs. Other cases have sown confusion about students' ability to express religious conviction in school settings. Teachers and school administrators have barred students from wearing religious imagery, from affirming their faith in essays and speeches, and from performing religious music because they fear running afoul of judicial prohibitions on State establishment of religion. Other officials have denied religious groups access to State facilities to worship or to hold meetings, again fearing potential lawsuits. But courts are not the only places where religious liberty is under attack. I am sorry to say that the current administration has done much to weaken religious freedom and to undermine the rights of conscience. Certainly, the most notorious instance of the administration's efforts to undermine religious liberty is the ObamaCare contraception mandate. This provision requires employers to provide their employees access to contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs even when the employer has profound moral objections to such drugs. There is a narrow exemption for houses of worship, but countless other religious employers--including religious schools, hospitals, and charities--must either comply with the mandate in violation of their religious beliefs or pay substantial financial penalties. The administration has also stripped funding from religious groups that refuse as a matter of conscience to toe the administration's line on abortion and contraception. In a remarkable and shortsighted move, the administration [[Page S7900]] revoked funding for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' relief program for victims of human trafficking because the conference declined on religious grounds to refer victims for abortion or contraceptives. So not only is the administration using the threat of financial loss to pressure religious groups to violate their beliefs, but it is also harming trafficking victims by hindering the ability of religious groups that differ from the administration on matters of conscience to aid victims. The administration, too, has put Federal contractors that subscribe to traditional views on marriage and sexuality on the horns of a terrible dilemma. Last year the President issued an Executive order prohibiting contractors from taking into account sexual orientation or gender identity when hiring employees. The order contains no exemptions for contractors with religious affiliations. Under the President's order, a contractor with a religious mission may be forced to hire an individual who holds views that run counter to that mission in order to remain eligible for Federal contracts. The President's order thus creates the very real possibility that religiously affiliated contractors will have to choose between impairing the integrity of their organization and competing for Federal funds. In addition to pursuing these troubling policies, the administration has also taken extreme and unsupportable positions in court filings that if adopted would undermine religious freedom. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to finish these remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HATCH. Before the Supreme Court, the administration made the remarkable claim that Federal law authorizes the Federal Government to involve itself in the hiring and firing of church ministers. Specifically, the administration said that Federal antidiscrimination laws override the First Amendment right of churches to select whomever they wish as ministers and instead allow the administration to actually sue a church if it believes a particular hiring or firing was improper. This radical position would allow the Federal Government to insert itself into some of the most important decisions churches make regarding religious doctrine and governance. Thankfully, the Supreme Court rejected the administration's position unanimously. Indeed, in a striking rebuke, the Court called the administration's claim that the First Amendment provides no more protection to a church in selecting its leader than it does to a ``labor union or a social club . . . remarkable.'' The fact that the administration felt comfortable making this argument, and apparently thought it was a correct argument, speaks volumes regarding this administration's dim view of religious liberty. More recently, the administration has signaled that the forced legalization of same-sex marriage will present religious schools and institutions with significant challenges in reconciling school standards with Federal antidiscrimination laws. At oral argument in the Obergefell case, one of the Justices asked the Solicitor General whether a religious school that opposed same-sex marriage would lose its tax-exempt status. The Solicitor General responded that ``it's certainly going to be an issue.'' With those seven words, the Solicitor General made clear that religious institutions that adhere to traditional views regarding marriage and sexuality--such as by providing housing only to opposite-sex couples-- will face potentially staggering financial consequences for their commitment to their religious convictions. The third front in the fight against religious liberty happens to be the State legislatures. In many ways what we are seeing at the State level is a mirror of what the administration has been doing at the Federal level. Just as the administration has stripped funding from religious organizations that refused to follow the administration's liberal social policies, States have withdrawn funding and licenses from groups that adhere to traditional religious views. Massachusetts, for example, passed a law requiring State-licensed adoption agencies to place children with same-sex couples. As a result, Catholic Charities, which had operated adoption services in the State for over 100 years, was forced to shut down its adoption program. That is outrageous. Catholic Charities affiliates in Illinois were similarly forced to close after the State announced it would no longer provide funding to adoption agencies that declined to place children with same-sex couples. Other religiously affiliated groups and schools have lost contracts, faced loss of accreditation, and have been denied permission to use public facilities because of their doctrinally based views on family, marriage, and sexuality. The mayor of Houston even went so far as to subpoena internal church communications as part of an intimidation campaign against churches that opposed a city nondiscrimination ordinance. Far from treating religious liberty as a preeminent value, many States and localities have thrust it aside in favor of other goals. Another disturbing trend at the State level has been the growing opposition to State religious freedom laws. Over 20 years ago I helped lead a broad bipartisan effort in Congress to pass the Religious Freedom Restoration Act or RFRA. RFRA sought to undo a misguided Supreme Court decision that authorized Congress and the States to abridge religious freedom so long as their actions did not specifically target religion. RFRA says that government may not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion unless doing so is necessary to further a compelling government interest. The coalition that helped pass RFRA included Members as ideologically diverse as Ted Kennedy, Pat Leahy, Strom Thurmond, and Phil Gramm. Groups from across the political spectrum such as the ACLU, People For the American Way, the Traditional Values Coalition, and the Christian Legal Society strongly supported the bill. Given this broad ideological support, RFRA passed the House without recorded opposition and passed the Senate 97 to 3--nearly unanimous. For a major piece of legislation like RFRA to pass Congress with only three recorded ``no'' votes was nearly unprecedented and indicated the breadth of support at the time for the view that religious liberty deserves special protection. Twenty years later, however, the consensus in favor of robust protection for religious liberty has splintered. Whereas the Federal RFRA was able to pass Congress almost without opposition--the whole Congress, that is--recent efforts to enact State level RFRAs have run into substantial resistance. Efforts in Indiana and Arizona are two good examples. They ignited media firestorms and generated strong pushback from groups who mistakenly viewed the measures as discriminatory. It should be emphasized both bills were modeled after the Federal RFRA, but the political dynamics have changed so dramatically over the last 20 years that protecting religious freedom has gone from being the rare issue on which all sides agree to becoming a political hot potato. Some groups that supported the Federal RFRA have even taken the position that future RFRAs must contain carve-outs for particular groups or particular issue areas. Many of these same groups endorsed an effort by Senate Democrats last year to exempt from the Federal RFRA all Federal laws and regulations related to health care. Of course any carve-outs in religious liberty protections undermine those protections because they limit the field on which religious liberty has full effect. For this reason the Federal RFRA contains no such carve-outs. Indeed, opposition to carve-outs was a key element in both assembling and maintaining the RFRA coalition two decades ago. Even if Members had varying views on the merits of certain practices, the one thing all could agree on is that religious liberty is a fundamental universal value that should apply equally to everyone, but the price of admission for many groups today is a willingness to cut back on religious liberty in instances where religious belief conflicts with progressive social goals. Twenty years ago this sort of hostage-taking was nowhere on the agenda, but religious liberty has now become a secondary goal or worse, an impediment, for many liberal groups that [[Page S7901]] value what they call progressive social policy over protecting the rights of believers. I hate the use of that word ``progressive'' because it is anything but. This backtracking by many stalwart defenders of religious liberty represents one of the most serious ways religious freedom is under attack in this great country. I will note one other political sea change that is undermining religious liberty in the United States. For many years, groups on the left have been advocating for laws to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. I am in general agreement with such laws and do not believe that sexual orientation should be grounds for discrimination or mistreatment. Many of the groups advocating for these laws have previously been willing to include exemptions for religious organizations that hold traditional views on marriage and sexuality. I believe such exemptions are appropriate and strike the right balance by protecting rights to nondiscrimination while enabling religious organizations to hold true to their beliefs. Indeed, I believe it is essential for nondiscrimination laws to properly accommodate religious liberty, and I would actively oppose any such law that fails to account for the rights of religious believers. Unfortunately, many groups that were previously willing to support religious exemptions in nondiscrimination laws have reversed course. For example, many groups that supported last Congress's Federal Employment Nondiscrimination Act or ENDA, which would prohibit discrimination in the workplace on the basis of sexual orientation, have withdrawn their support for the act because it contains a robust exemption for religious organizations. This Congress, they are instead supporting the Equality Act, which contains no religious exemption at all. I supported ENDA because I believed it reflected the right balance between nondiscrimination and religious liberty. I took some criticism for doing so. I still believe it does reflect the right balance, but many groups on the left have indicated they are willing to cast religious liberty aside in furtherance of other goals. For these groups, religious liberty no longer deserves special protection. It is no longer a preeminent value. Rather, it should be accommodated only so far as it is convenient and does not interfere with other objectives. This is a sea change and one that bodes ill for the future vitality of religious freedom. I said at the outset that religious liberty is under attack in America in ways that are both surprising and unprecedented. Certainly the willingness of former defenders of religious freedom to turn their backs on believers is both. I would like to close by returning to the New Mexico photographer case I mentioned earlier, for that case contains perhaps the most surprising and unprecedented feature of all. In a concurring opinion, one of the judges in the case called the requirement to violate one's religious beliefs when they conflict with State social policy ``the price of citizenship.'' That statement represents a complete inversion of the relationship between government authority and religious liberty in America. When we are born or become American citizens, we do not surrender our rights of conscience to the government. We do not pledge our allegiance to a secular God. We retain our right to religious liberty. Indeed, not only do we retain our right; our government guarantees our right to freely practice our faith in accordance with the dictates of our own conscience. As the Declaration of Independence instructs, all men--and women--are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, and it is the fundamental purpose of government to secure those rights. If there is a price we pay as American citizens, it is not that we give up our God-given rights, first and foremost of which is the right of religious liberty, it is that we agree to work together to promote the common good of our country. Subjugating religious beliefs to government decrees is not the price of citizenship. To the contrary, respecting and honoring the fundamental rights of all Americans is the price our government pays in order to enjoy the continued consent of the American people. Those who attack religious liberty and seek to devalue its place in society fundamentally misunderstands this key point. Unfortunately, too many in America today, from the courts to the Obama administration, to the State legislatures, undervalue religious freedom and view it at best as a secondary goal. People of good will in Congress and across our Nation need to recognize that religious liberty is under attack and that unless we stand up and vocally support the rights of believers to live their faith, we will find much of what we have fought for and much of what our forebears fought for swept away. We must fortify the rights of believers to follow their conscience even when their fellow citizens or elected officials would prefer a different course. I will have much more to say on this topic in future remarks, but with that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7899-S7901] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] RELIGIOUS LIBERTY Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak once again on the topic of religious liberty. This is the fifth in a series of addresses I have given on this vitally important subject. In my previous remarks, I have discussed why religious liberty matters, why it is important, and why it deserves special protection from government interference. I have also detailed the history of religious liberty in the United States in order to show that the desire for religious freedom was central to our Nation's founding and to the very idea of America. From the beginning, religious liberty has been a preeminent value in American life. Government accommodates religion--not the other way around. Lastly, in my previous remarks, I have sought to explain how religion has always had a robust public role in our society and to rebut the wrongheaded, ahistorical view that religion is a purely private matter that should be kept out of the public domain. Today I turn to the status of religious liberty in contemporary American life. My argument is straightforward. In ways that are both surprising and unprecedented, religious liberty is under attack here in the United States. I speak not merely of attacks on particular practices but also of attacks on the very idea of religious liberty itself--on the idea that there should be room in society for believers to live and to worship in ways that differ from prevailing orthodoxy. The campaign against religious liberty has three prongs: the courts, the Obama administration, and State legislatures. My goal today is to explain how each of these institutions is undermining the vitality of religious life in our country and why what they are doing is wrong. Many Americans are unaware of the substantial threats religious liberty faces here in the United States. They look abroad to the Middle East or to Africa, where Islamist regimes are killing Christians and other dissenters from religious orthodoxy, and suppose that by comparison, things are not so bad here in the United States. While it is true that religious minorities in America do not face death or serious physical harm for choosing to live their faith, we must not blind ourselves to the ways in which our government institutions are undermining religious liberty itself. We must instead come to recognize that powerful forces in our society are working actively to restrict the ability of religious believers to live out their faith and to foist upon them government mandates that are flatly inconsistent with our most deeply held beliefs. I begin with the courts, which I identified as the first front in the fight against religious liberty. For a number of years now there has been a steady stream of cases in which everyday Americans have been sanctioned--sometimes severely--for adhering to religious tenants that conflict with current political orthodoxy. The examples are myriad. A photographer in New Mexico was fined $7,000 for declining to photograph a same-sex commitment ceremony on the grounds that her religious beliefs teach that marriage is a union between one man and one woman and that she could not in good conscience lend her services to the event. A florist in Washington State was fined $1,000 for declining to provide flower arrangements for a same-sex wedding. And a couple in Oregon who owned a cake shop were ordered to pay $135,000 for telling a same-sex couple that they could not provide a cake for their wedding ceremony because the shop owners adhere to the traditional, biblically based view of marriage. The message that these court cases send is clear: If you are a religious individual with religiously rooted views that differ from the current policies of the State, you follow your beliefs at your own peril. Even those who don't endorse the view that it is appropriate for businesses to deny service to customers on the basis of deeply held beliefs must concede that the fines and other sanctions in these cases present a direct threat to religious liberty. Note that there was no suggestion in any of these cases that the defendant's refusal to provide services actually prevented the same-sex couple from obtaining the desired items. In each case, other photographers, florists, and bakers without religious or moral objections stood ready to assist. The State was not stepping in to ensure that the couple had access to needed goods and services. Rather, the injury to the couple in each case was that the defendant would not sanction their ceremony. The State did not like the message the defendant's religious beliefs conveyed and so ordered the defendant to pay a potentially ruinous fine. The notion that government can override or punish individuals for deeply held religious beliefs merely because those beliefs deviate from prevailing views strikes at the very heart of religious liberty. Religious liberty is the right of an individual to practice his or her beliefs even in the face of government, social or community opposition. If all that is needed for government to override a person's deeply held beliefs is a disagreement over whether the person's beliefs send the right message, then religious liberty is weak indeed. It is no longer a preferred value that government must make room for but rather a common, run-of-the-mill interest that government can override essentially at will. Recent court cases have undermined religious liberty and threaten the integrity of our religious institutions in other ways as well. One case, decided by the Supreme Court about 5 years ago, held that schools can require student religious groups to accept nonbelievers as leaders, even though doing so could undermine the group's mission and install as leaders individuals who do not share the group's core beliefs. Other cases have sown confusion about students' ability to express religious conviction in school settings. Teachers and school administrators have barred students from wearing religious imagery, from affirming their faith in essays and speeches, and from performing religious music because they fear running afoul of judicial prohibitions on State establishment of religion. Other officials have denied religious groups access to State facilities to worship or to hold meetings, again fearing potential lawsuits. But courts are not the only places where religious liberty is under attack. I am sorry to say that the current administration has done much to weaken religious freedom and to undermine the rights of conscience. Certainly, the most notorious instance of the administration's efforts to undermine religious liberty is the ObamaCare contraception mandate. This provision requires employers to provide their employees access to contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs even when the employer has profound moral objections to such drugs. There is a narrow exemption for houses of worship, but countless other religious employers--including religious schools, hospitals, and charities--must either comply with the mandate in violation of their religious beliefs or pay substantial financial penalties. The administration has also stripped funding from religious groups that refuse as a matter of conscience to toe the administration's line on abortion and contraception. In a remarkable and shortsighted move, the administration [[Page S7900]] revoked funding for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' relief program for victims of human trafficking because the conference declined on religious grounds to refer victims for abortion or contraceptives. So not only is the administration using the threat of financial loss to pressure religious groups to violate their beliefs, but it is also harming trafficking victims by hindering the ability of religious groups that differ from the administration on matters of conscience to aid victims. The administration, too, has put Federal contractors that subscribe to traditional views on marriage and sexuality on the horns of a terrible dilemma. Last year the President issued an Executive order prohibiting contractors from taking into account sexual orientation or gender identity when hiring employees. The order contains no exemptions for contractors with religious affiliations. Under the President's order, a contractor with a religious mission may be forced to hire an individual who holds views that run counter to that mission in order to remain eligible for Federal contracts. The President's order thus creates the very real possibility that religiously affiliated contractors will have to choose between impairing the integrity of their organization and competing for Federal funds. In addition to pursuing these troubling policies, the administration has also taken extreme and unsupportable positions in court filings that if adopted would undermine religious freedom.

The administration, too, has put Federal contractors that subscribe to traditional views on marriage and sexuality on the horns of a terrible dilemma. Last year the President issued an Executive order prohibiting contractors from taking into account sexual orientation or gender identity when hiring employees. The order contains no exemptions for contractors with religious affiliations. Under the President's order, a contractor with a religious mission may be forced to hire an individual who holds views that run counter to that mission in order to remain eligible for Federal contracts. The President's order thus creates the very real possibility that religiously affiliated contractors will have to choose between impairing the integrity of their organization and competing for Federal funds. In addition to pursuing these troubling policies, the administration has also taken extreme and unsupportable positions in court filings that if adopted would undermine religious freedom. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to finish these remarks. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. HATCH. Before the Supreme Court, the administration made the remarkable claim that Federal law authorizes the Federal Government to involve itself in the hiring and firing of church ministers. Specifically, the administration said that Federal antidiscrimination laws override the First Amendment right of churches to select whomever they wish as ministers and instead allow the administration to actually sue a church if it believes a particular hiring or firing was improper. This radical position would allow the Federal Government to insert itself into some of the most important decisions churches make regarding religious doctrine and governance. Thankfully, the Supreme Court rejected the administration's position unanimously. Indeed, in a striking rebuke, the Court called the administration's claim that the First Amendment provides no more protection to a church in selecting its leader than it does to a ``labor union or a social club . . . remarkable.'' The fact that the administration felt comfortable making this argument, and apparently thought it was a correct argument, speaks volumes regarding this administration's dim view of religious liberty. More recently, the administration has signaled that the forced legalization of same-sex marriage will present religious schools and institutions with significant challenges in reconciling school standards with Federal antidiscrimination laws. At oral argument in the Obergefell case, one of the Justices asked the Solicitor General whether a religious school that opposed same-sex marriage would lose its tax-exempt status. The Solicitor General responded that ``it's certainly going to be an issue.'' With those seven words, the Solicitor General made clear that religious institutions that adhere to traditional views regarding marriage and sexuality--such as by providing housing only to opposite-sex couples-- will face potentially staggering financial consequences for their commitment to their religious convictions. The third front in the fight against religious liberty happens to be the State legislatures. In many ways what we are seeing at the State level is a mirror of what the administration has been doing at the Federal level. Just as the administration has stripped funding from religious organizations that refused to follow the administration's liberal social policies, States have withdrawn funding and licenses from groups that adhere to traditional religious views. Massachusetts, for example, passed a law requiring State-licensed adoption agencies to place children with same-sex couples. As a result, Catholic Charities, which had operated adoption services in the State for over 100 years, was forced to shut down its adoption program. That is outrageous. Catholic Charities affiliates in Illinois were similarly forced to close after the State announced it would no longer provide funding to adoption agencies that declined to place children with same-sex couples. Other religiously affiliated groups and schools have lost contracts, faced loss of accreditation, and have been denied permission to use public facilities because of their doctrinally based views on family, marriage, and sexuality. The mayor of Houston even went so far as to subpoena internal church communications as part of an intimidation campaign against churches that opposed a city nondiscrimination ordinance. Far from treating religious liberty as a preeminent value, many States and localities have thrust it aside in favor of other goals. Another disturbing trend at the State level has been the growing opposition to State religious freedom laws. Over 20 years ago I helped lead a broad bipartisan effort in Congress to pass the Religious Freedom Restoration Act or RFRA. RFRA sought to undo a misguided Supreme Court decision that authorized Congress and the States to abridge religious freedom so long as their actions did not specifically target religion. RFRA says that government may not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion unless doing so is necessary to further a compelling government interest. The coalition that helped pass RFRA included Members as ideologically diverse as Ted Kennedy, Pat Leahy, Strom Thurmond, and Phil Gramm. Groups from across the political spectrum such as the ACLU, People For the American Way, the Traditional Values Coalition, and the Christian Legal Society strongly supported the bill. Given this broad ideological support, RFRA passed the House without recorded opposition and passed the Senate 97 to 3--nearly unanimous. For a major piece of legislation like RFRA to pass Congress with only three recorded ``no'' votes was nearly unprecedented and indicated the breadth of support at the time for the view that religious liberty deserves special protection. Twenty years later, however, the consensus in favor of robust protection for religious liberty has splintered. Whereas the Federal RFRA was able to pass Congress almost without opposition--the whole Congress, that is--recent efforts to enact State level RFRAs have run into substantial resistance. Efforts in Indiana and Arizona are two good examples. They ignited media firestorms and generated strong pushback from groups who mistakenly viewed the measures as discriminatory. It should be emphasized both bills were modeled after the Federal RFRA, but the political dynamics have changed so dramatically over the last 20 years that protecting religious freedom has gone from being the rare issue on which all sides agree to becoming a political hot potato. Some groups that supported the Federal RFRA have even taken the position that future RFRAs must contain carve-outs for particular groups or particular issue areas. Many of these same groups endorsed an effort by Senate Democrats last year to exempt from the Federal RFRA all Federal laws and regulations related to health care. Of course any carve-outs in religious liberty protections undermine those protections because they limit the field on which religious liberty has full effect. For this reason the Federal RFRA contains no such carve-outs. Indeed, opposition to carve-outs was a key element in both assembling and maintaining the RFRA coalition two decades ago. Even if Members had varying views on the merits of certain practices, the one thing all could agree on is that religious liberty is a fundamental universal value that should apply equally to everyone, but the price of admission for many groups today is a willingness to cut back on religious liberty in instances where religious belief conflicts with progressive social goals. Twenty years ago this sort of hostage-taking was nowhere on the agenda, but religious liberty has now become a secondary goal or worse, an impediment, for many liberal groups that [[Page S7901]] value what they call progressive social policy over protecting the rights of believers. I hate the use of that word ``progressive'' because it is anything but. This backtracking by many stalwart defenders of religious liberty represents one of the most serious ways religious freedom is under attack in this great country. I will note one other political sea change that is undermining religious liberty in the United States. For many years, groups on the left have been advocating for laws to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. I am in general agreement with such laws and do not believe that sexual orientation should be grounds for discrimination or mistreatment. Many of the groups advocating for these laws have previously been willing to include exemptions for religious organizations that hold traditional views on marriage and sexuality. I believe such exemptions are appropriate and strike the right balance by protecting rights to nondiscrimination while enabling religious organizations to hold true to their beliefs. Indeed, I believe it is essential for nondiscrimination laws to properly accommodate religious liberty, and I would actively oppose any such law that fails to account for the rights of religious believers. Unfortunately, many groups that were previously willing to support religious exemptions in nondiscrimination laws have reversed course. For example, many groups that supported last Congress's Federal Employment Nondiscrimination Act or ENDA, which would prohibit discrimination in the workplace on the basis of sexual orientation, have withdrawn their support for the act because it contains a robust exemption for religious organizations. This Congress, they are instead supporting the Equality Act, which contains no religious exemption at all. I supported ENDA because I believed it reflected the right balance between nondiscrimination and religious liberty. I took some criticism for doing so. I still believe it does reflect the right balance, but many groups on the left have indicated they are willing to cast religious liberty aside in furtherance of other goals. For these groups, religious liberty no longer deserves special protection. It is no longer a preeminent value. Rather, it should be accommodated only so far as it is convenient and does not interfere with other objectives. This is a sea change and one that bodes ill for the future vitality of religious freedom. I said at the outset that religious liberty is under attack in America in ways that are both surprising and unprecedented. Certainly the willingness of former defenders of religious freedom to turn their backs on believers is both. I would like to close by returning to the New Mexico photographer case I mentioned earlier, for that case contains perhaps the most surprising and unprecedented feature of all. In a concurring opinion, one of the judges in the case called the requirement to violate one's religious beliefs when they conflict with State social policy ``the price of citizenship.'' That statement represents a complete inversion of the relationship between government authority and religious liberty in America. When we are born or become American citizens, we do not surrender our rights of conscience to the government. We do not pledge our allegiance to a secular God. We retain our right to religious liberty. Indeed, not only do we retain our right; our government guarantees our right to freely practice our faith in accordance with the dictates of our own conscience. As the Declaration of Independence instructs, all men--and women--are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, and it is the fundamental purpose of government to secure those rights. If there is a price we pay as American citizens, it is not that we give up our God-given rights, first and foremost of which is the right of religious liberty, it is that we agree to work together to promote the common good of our country. Subjugating religious beliefs to government decrees is not the price of citizenship. To the contrary, respecting and honoring the fundamental rights of all Americans is the price our government pays in order to enjoy the continued consent of the American people. Those who attack religious liberty and seek to devalue its place in society fundamentally misunderstands this key point. Unfortunately, too many in America today, from the courts to the Obama administration, to the State legislatures, undervalue religious freedom and view it at best as a secondary goal. People of good will in Congress and across our Nation need to recognize that religious liberty is under attack and that unless we stand up and vocally support the rights of believers to live their faith, we will find much of what we have fought for and much of what our forebears fought for swept away. We must fortify the rights of believers to follow their conscience even when their fellow citizens or elected officials would prefer a different course. I will have much more to say on this topic in future remarks, but with that, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio. ____________________",package_114_41.csv,21204,21204,21276,"[congressional record volume 161, number 167 (tuesday, november 10, 2015)] [senate] [pages s7899-s7901] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] religious liberty mr. hatch. mr. president, i rise today to speak once again on the topic of religious liberty. this is the fifth in a series of addresses i have given on this vitally important subject. in my previous remarks, i have discussed why religious liberty matters, why it is important, and why it deserves special protection from government interference. i have also detailed the history of religious liberty in the united states in order to show that the desire for religious freedom was central to our nation's founding and to the very idea of america. from the beginning, religious liberty has been a preeminent value in american life. government accommodates religion--not the other way around. lastly, in my previous remarks, i have sought to explain how religion has always had a robust public role in our society and to rebut the wrongheaded, ahistorical view that religion is a purely private matter that should be kept out of the public domain. today i turn to the status of religious liberty in contemporary american life. my argument is straightforward. in ways that are both surprising and unprecedented, religious liberty is under attack here in the united states. i speak not merely of attacks on particular practices but also of attacks on the very idea of religious liberty itself--on the idea that there should be room in society for believers to live and to worship in ways that differ from prevailing orthodoxy. the campaign against religious liberty has three prongs: the courts, the obama administration, and state legislatures. my goal today is to explain how each of these institutions is undermining the vitality of religious life in our country and why what they are doing is wrong. many americans are unaware of the substantial threats religious liberty faces here in the united states. they look abroad to the middle east or to africa, where islamist regimes are killing christians and other dissenters from religious orthodoxy, and suppose that by comparison, things are not so bad here in the united states. while it is true that religious minorities in america do not face death or serious physical harm for choosing to live their faith, we must not blind ourselves to the ways in which our government institutions are undermining religious liberty itself. we must instead come to recognize that powerful forces in our society are working actively to restrict the ability of religious believers to live out their faith and to foist upon them government mandates that are flatly inconsistent with our most deeply held beliefs. i begin with the courts, which i identified as the first front in the fight against religious liberty. for a number of years now there has been a steady stream of cases in which everyday americans have been sanctioned--sometimes severely--for adhering to religious tenants that conflict with current political orthodoxy. the examples are myriad. a photographer in new mexico was fined $7,000 for declining to photograph a same-sex commitment ceremony on the grounds that her religious beliefs teach that marriage is a union between one man and one woman and that she could not in good conscience lend her services to the event. a florist in washington state was fined $1,000 for declining to provide flower arrangements for a same-sex wedding. and a couple in oregon who owned a cake shop were ordered to pay $135,000 for telling a same-sex couple that they could not provide a cake for their wedding ceremony because the shop owners adhere to the traditional, biblically based view of marriage. the message that these court cases send is clear: if you are a religious individual with religiously rooted views that differ from the current policies of the state, you follow your beliefs at your own peril. even those who don't endorse the view that it is appropriate for businesses to deny service to customers on the basis of deeply held beliefs must concede that the fines and other sanctions in these cases present a direct threat to religious liberty. note that there was no suggestion in any of these cases that the defendant's refusal to provide services actually prevented the same-sex couple from obtaining the desired items. in each case, other photographers, florists, and bakers without religious or moral objections stood ready to assist. the state was not stepping in to ensure that the couple had access to needed goods and services. rather, the injury to the couple in each case was that the defendant would not sanction their ceremony. the state did not like the message the defendant's religious beliefs conveyed and so ordered the defendant to pay a potentially ruinous fine. the notion that government can override or punish individuals for deeply held religious beliefs merely because those beliefs deviate from prevailing views strikes at the very heart of religious liberty. religious liberty is the right of an individual to practice his or her beliefs even in the face of government, social or community opposition. if all that is needed for government to override a person's deeply held beliefs is a disagreement over whether the person's beliefs send the right message, then religious liberty is weak indeed. it is no longer a preferred value that government must make room for but rather a common, run-of-the-mill interest that government can override essentially at will. recent court cases have undermined religious liberty and threaten the integrity of our religious institutions in other ways as well. one case, decided by the supreme court about 5 years ago, held that schools can require student religious groups to accept nonbelievers as leaders, even though doing so could undermine the group's mission and install as leaders individuals who do not share the group's core beliefs. other cases have sown confusion about students' ability to express religious conviction in school settings. teachers and school administrators have barred students from wearing religious imagery, from affirming their faith in essays and speeches, and from performing religious music because they fear running afoul of judicial prohibitions on state establishment of religion. other officials have denied religious groups access to state facilities to worship or to hold meetings, again fearing potential lawsuits. but courts are not the only places where religious liberty is under attack. i am sorry to say that the current administration has done much to weaken religious freedom and to undermine the rights of conscience. certainly, the most notorious instance of the administration's efforts to undermine religious liberty is the obamacare contraception mandate. this provision requires employers to provide their employees access to contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs even when the employer has profound moral objections to such drugs. there is a narrow exemption for houses of worship, but countless other religious employers--including religious schools, hospitals, and charities--must either comply with the mandate in violation of their religious beliefs or pay substantial financial penalties. the administration has also stripped funding from religious groups that refuse as a matter of conscience to toe the administration's line on abortion and contraception. in a remarkable and shortsighted move, the administration [[page s7900]] revoked funding for the u.s. conference of catholic bishops' relief program for victims of human trafficking because the conference declined on religious grounds to refer victims for abortion or contraceptives. so not only is the administration using the threat of financial loss to pressure religious groups to violate their beliefs, but it is also harming trafficking victims by hindering the ability of religious groups that differ from the administration on matters of conscience to aid victims. the administration, too, has put federal contractors that subscribe to traditional views on marriage and sexuality on the horns of a terrible dilemma. last year the president issued an executive order prohibiting contractors from taking into account sexual orientation or gender identity when hiring employees. the order contains no exemptions for contractors with religious affiliations. under the president's order, a contractor with a religious mission may be forced to hire an individual who holds views that run counter to that mission in order to remain eligible for federal contracts. the president's order thus creates the very real possibility that religiously affiliated contractors will have to choose between impairing the integrity of their organization and competing for federal funds. in addition to pursuing these troubling policies, the administration has also taken extreme and unsupportable positions in court filings that if adopted would undermine

CREC-2015-11-10-pt1-PgS7901,CREC-2015-11-10,114,SUPPORTING OUR VETERANS,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7901-S7902] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SUPPORTING OUR VETERANS Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this week we honor the men and women who serve our Nation with honor and their families who also sacrifice--whom we do not remember enough--who sacrifice so much for the servicemembers they love and for all of us in our country. The sacrifice of our veterans demands that we fulfill the promises we have made. This body is always willing to spend more dollars in armaments and on weapons, but when it comes time to fulfill our obligations to veterans, too many in this body are not generous enough. I am the only Ohioan ever to serve a full term on the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. I take that duty very seriously. I know the Presiding Officer, Senator Tillis from North Carolina, does too. That means working to end the VA backlog. It means putting a better system in place. It means ensuring that our veterans have a roof over their heads and a place to call home. It means providing veterans with health care and the educational opportunities they deserve and which they have earned. Too many veterans face mental health challenges that can end in tragedy. More than 8,000 veterans each year take their own lives--154 a week, 22 a day. Hundreds of thousands of veterans struggle with invisible injuries. Nearly 300,000 have been diagnosed with post- traumatic stress, and 300,000 have faced traumatic brain injuries--all because of the service they gave to us. Earlier this year we passed the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act. It is a good start yet not enough. We need to make sure that when servicemembers return home, they have the educational and the employment opportunities they need, not only to survive but to thrive. The GI bill's educational benefits are critical, but veterans, unfortunately, have a limited amount of time before their GI benefits expire. In crowded colleges--whether in North Carolina, Oklahoma or Ohio--general education requirements and prerequisites often fill up quickly. Many colleges and universities in my State offer priority registration to veterans. All of our colleges and universities need to follow Ohio's lead. That is why I worked with Senator Tillis, the Presiding Officer, on legislation to ensure that all veterans and servicemembers and their qualifying dependents can use their GI benefits to their full potential and be guaranteed priority registration. The Senator from North Carolina and I also introduced the Fry Scholarship Enhancement Act, which would expand eligibility for the VA's Yellow Ribbon Program to help students avoid out-of-pocket tuition and fees for programs that cost more than the allowance set by the post-9/11 GI bill. Sadly, for too many veterans, they are far from the goal where they should be. They struggle just to find a place to call home. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, some 50,000 veterans were homeless during a survey conducted on a single night in January 2014. That is 50,000 too many. It is a disgrace that after serving our country with honor, thousands of veterans are left without a roof over their heads. [[Page S7902]] Earlier this month I visited the Joseph House in Cincinnati, where Nathan Pelletier and his team of dedicated staff and volunteers provide addiction treatment and traditional housing. A group of us meeting there, mostly veterans who are homeless or were homeless, listened to Britton Carter, who was formerly homeless. He completed his treatment program in the Joseph House. He now works as a case manager there helping other struggling veterans. Veterans such as Mr. Carter have served our country with honor. We owe them support, and we owe them counseling when they return home. That is why I joined my colleagues in introducing the Veteran Housing Stability Act of 2015, which would make meaningful improvements to services for homeless veterans that would give veterans more access to permanent housing opportunities. We know in the Veterans' Affairs Committee a number of things. We know that the unemployment rate of veterans is generally higher than society's unemployment rate. We know that veterans' suicide rate is higher than society's suicide rate. We know that veterans' drug addiction is higher than society's drug addiction rate. We know that veterans have suffered from PTSD and traumatic brain injury in numbers much higher than the general population. That is why we owe them so much. We in this body so rarely think about the cost of war. We, as I said earlier, are willing to send more money to buy more weapons, to spend more money in armaments. We are not so generous when it comes time to take care of our veterans. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7901-S7902] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SUPPORTING OUR VETERANS Mr. BROWN.

More than 8,000 veterans each year take their own lives--154 a week, 22 a day. Hundreds of thousands of veterans struggle with invisible injuries. Nearly 300,000 have been diagnosed with post- traumatic stress, and 300,000 have faced traumatic brain injuries--all because of the service they gave to us. Earlier this year we passed the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act. It is a good start yet not enough. We need to make sure that when servicemembers return home, they have the educational and the employment opportunities they need, not only to survive but to thrive. The GI bill's educational benefits are critical, but veterans, unfortunately, have a limited amount of time before their GI benefits expire. In crowded colleges--whether in North Carolina, Oklahoma or Ohio--general education requirements and prerequisites often fill up quickly. Many colleges and universities in my State offer priority registration to veterans. All of our colleges and universities need to follow Ohio's lead. That is why I worked with Senator Tillis, the Presiding Officer, on legislation to ensure that all veterans and servicemembers and their qualifying dependents can use their GI benefits to their full potential and be guaranteed priority registration. The Senator from North Carolina and I also introduced the Fry Scholarship Enhancement Act, which would expand eligibility for the VA's Yellow Ribbon Program to help students avoid out-of-pocket tuition and fees for programs that cost more than the allowance set by the post-9/11 GI bill. Sadly, for too many veterans, they are far from the goal where they should be. They struggle just to find a place to call home. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, some 50,000 veterans were homeless during a survey conducted on a single night in January 2014. That is 50,000 too many. It is a disgrace that after serving our country with honor, thousands of veterans are left without a roof over their heads. [[Page S7902]] Earlier this month I visited the Joseph House in Cincinnati, where Nathan Pelletier and his team of dedicated staff and volunteers provide addiction treatment and traditional housing. A group of us meeting there, mostly veterans who are homeless or were homeless, listened to Britton Carter, who was formerly homeless. He completed his treatment program in the Joseph House. He now works as a case manager there helping other struggling veterans. Veterans such as Mr. Carter have served our country with honor. We owe them support, and we owe them counseling when they return home. That is why I joined my colleagues in introducing the Veteran Housing Stability Act of 2015, which would make meaningful improvements to services for homeless veterans that would give veterans more access to permanent housing opportunities. We know in the Veterans' Affairs Committee a number of things. We know that the unemployment rate of veterans is generally higher than society's unemployment rate. We know that veterans' suicide rate is higher than society's suicide rate. We know that veterans' drug addiction is higher than society's drug addiction rate. We know that veterans have suffered from PTSD and traumatic brain injury in numbers much higher than the general population. That is why we owe them so much. We in this body so rarely think about the cost of war. We, as I said earlier, are willing to send more money to buy more weapons, to spend more money in armaments. We are not so generous when it comes time to take care of our veterans. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7901-S7902] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] SUPPORTING OUR VETERANS Mr. BROWN.

Mr. President, the last point I wish to make before turning to the Senator from Oklahoma is something that we call Honor Flights. One of the great things that have come out of the National World War II Memorial is that men and women who have served in World War II are now getting the opportunity to go to visit this National World War II Memorial. Retired Air Force Capt. Earl Morse, who worked in a VA clinic in Springfield, OH, would often talk with his World War II veteran patriots. He realized that for most of these veterans, their dream of seeing the memorial built on the National Mall would never come true. So one day in 2004, Captain Morse, a pilot and a member of the air club at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, asked one of his patients if he could personally fly him to Washington free of charge. The veteran, Mr. Loy, broke down in tears and accepted Earl's offer. Soon Earl was offering to fly other World War II veterans to visit the memorial and soliciting help from other pilots. Eleven pilots from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base volunteered. In May 2005, the first Honor Flight took off from Springfield, OH. A decade later, the Honor Flight Network is a national nonprofit that has flown 100,000 veterans, usually 40 or 50 or 60 at a time in a charter flight--always with a caretaker because these veterans are never young. They are World War II veterans. They have been out of the service now for 70 years at least. The Honor Flight Program is in 41 States. I have had the honor of meeting a number of them. Toledo, OH, seems to be one which has particularly excelled and is encouraging local people, raising local money and getting every single veteran from northwest Ohio who was able to and wanted to join these Honor Flights. I will quote one of these volunteers. Jim Salamon works for the Honor Flight Program in Dayton. He told me of a volunteer who goes by Ace and who works at an Arby's in Maryland and provides discounted meals for Honor Flight Program attendees. Jim said: Ace is part of Honor Flight Dayton's family. We rely on Ace and he has not let us down. Over the last nine years Ace has saved us more than $30,000 [because of Arby's donating these meals], which pays the cost of transporting 92 veterans. With an average of 800 World War II veterans dying each day, the mission of the Honor Flight Program is more important now than ever. I am thankful to those who have helped Honor Flight. I am thankful to those veterans and their families who have done so much. I remind my colleagues, as they are always eager to vote for more money for weapons, that we should understand and think about the cost of war and take care of our returning servicemembers. I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S7902] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] HONOR FLIGHTS Mr. BROWN.

CREC-2015-11-10-pt1-PgS7903,CREC-2015-11-10,114,VETERANS DAY AND CLIMATE CHANGE,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7903-S7905] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VETERANS DAY AND CLIMATE CHANGE Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, tomorrow is Veterans Day, and on Veterans [[Page S7904]] Day it is important that we thank America's veterans and their families for their service to our Nation. Veterans Day is a time to honor all those brave men and women who put themselves in harm's way so we may enjoy the tremendous freedoms and personal liberties that make our Nation the greatest in the world. Such bravery deserves our unending gratitude. We have an obligation to honor them all year-round by fighting to ensure they have the resources, the support, and the protections which they have earned. They fought for us, and now we need to fight for them. When we send our men and women in uniform abroad, we can be confident they will do their utmost to complete their missions. Our mission, as Senators, is to minimize the need to send our armed services members into harm's way. The root causes of overseas conflict are complex and diverse, from religious divisions to natural resource allocations, to democratic yearnings. Increasingly, in the modern era, climate change is straining the strands of stability until they snap. When I was chairman of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, I held a 2007 hearing where one U.S. general told the story of Somalia, how drought in Somalia had caused a famine and how that famine had ultimately then led to and encouraged a conflict. The pattern in Somalia is the same pattern that we see in other countries: drought leading to famine, leading to fights between different tribes or peoples who otherwise had no reason to fight. Aid came in from the United States, warlords started to fight over it, and that is how 18 U.S. service people lost their lives in what we now call ``Black Hawk Down.'' In 2010, terrible droughts in Russia and China and floods in Pakistan decimated wheat harvests and created a global shortage. The price of wheat increased dramatically. The Middle East, home to the world's top nine wheat importers, felt it severely, especially since the region's farmers struggled with their own parched fields. Much of Syria was gripped with the worst drought it had ever experienced. The price of bread skyrocketed across the region and demands for regime change were not far behind. As we look around the world, we can see, hear, and feel how climate change is a threat multiplier and a catalyst for conflict today. While we have to deal with the consequences of climate change that are already apparent, there is still time to prevent future catastrophes. That is why President Obama has been using the tool he has in the Clean Air Act to reduce carbon pollution. He has used it to increase the fuel efficiency of America's cars and trucks, and now he has released the Clean Power Plan, but Republicans want to undo it with the Congressional Review Act. Starting next Monday in this Chamber, Senate Republicans can bring the resolution to the Senate floor at any time to dismantle the Clean Power Plan. Undoing it would be bad for our economy, bad for our health, and bad for our national security. Now, 2014 was the hottest year in global history. Records go back all the way to 1880--the warmest year. The first half of this year is now the hottest January to June in that same record. The Clean Power Plan captures the scientific urgency and the economic opportunity necessary to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. The Clean Power Plan provides flexibility to the States to find the solutions to reducing carbon pollution that works best for their situations, unleashing a clean energy revolution in every single State in the Union. It will create jobs and save consumers billions on their electricity bills. It will avert almost 100,000 asthma attacks and prevent thousands of premature deaths. The climate and health benefits of the rule are estimated to save $34 billion to $54 billion per year by the year 2030. Using the Clean Air Act to reduce carbon pollution is grounded in the Supreme Court's 2007 decision that confirmed the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases as pollutants under the Act. The Supreme Court has reaffirmed that authority in two subsequent cases, and we have used that authority to set carbon pollution standards for vehicles. These standards, along with increasing the fuel economy of our Nation's cars and trucks, are reducing pollution, saving drivers money, and sparking innovation. We will see similar benefits coming from the Clean Power Plan. Some of my colleagues in the Senate say it can't be done. Some will say it will raise electricity bills. Some will say it will kill jobs. The problem for them is their claims are just not true. The Clean Power Plan is a plan to create jobs and to grow our economy. It is a signal to the marketplace to invest in clean energy--in wind, in solar, and other renewable energy resources. That is the 21st century. Too many people on the Senate floor keep looking at the future in a rearview mirror. They keep looking backward instead of ahead, unleashing the technologies of the 21st century. The green generation, the young people in our country, they know we can do this. They know renewables are the technologies of the 21st century. If we do it, it will be a signal to the rest of the world that the United States is going to lead the effort to reduce greenhouse gases, while unleashing a job-creating renewable energy revolution not just for our own country but for the entire planet. Just 2 months ago, in September, Congress had the honor of hearing from Pope Francis, who shared his message of action. He told us the American people can do it. He said: I call for a courageous and responsible effort to redirect our steps and to avert the most serious effects of the environmental deterioration caused by human activity. I am convinced we can make a difference and I have no doubt that the United States--and this Congress--have an important role to play. Now is the time for courageous actions and strategies. He is right. The Pope is right. This is the time for action from Congress--not denial, not obstructionism. Now is the time for the United States, for this Senate, to be the leader in finding the global solutions to this threat of dangerous climate change. So what the Pope did was take the message of Christ and not deliver a ``Sermon on the Mount,'' he delivered a sermon on the Hill--a sermon on the Hill to the Members of the House and the Senate to do everything they can to reduce dangerous greenhouse gases. In saying that to us, he said it as someone who taught high school chemistry, as someone who knows this issue--a Pope who taught chemistry. The Pope did not believe that science is at odds with religion. The Pope believes science and technology is the answer to our prayers, and he called upon us to unleash a technological revolution to reduce these dangerous greenhouse gases. Why do we know that we can do this? It is a moral imperative. The Pope basically said three things: No. 1, the planet is dangerously warming and the science confirms that; No. 2, human activity is largely contributing to the warming of the planet and the science confirms that; and, No. 3, since human beings are causing this problem, they have a moral responsibility and a moral imperative to do something about it. We are the United States of America. We are the global leader in technology. We are the revolution. So let's see how far we have come in a very brief period of time. In 2005, we installed 79 megawatts of solar in the United States. Solar technology had been around for generations. Einstein actually won his Nobel Prize for breakthroughs in solar research. Yet this is where we were in 2005; a tiny 79 megawatts was all we were able to install. Then we began to change policies in the United States. We began to have States across the country, 30 States, which said we are going to have more renewable electricity in our States. We put tax breaks on the books, and look what happened in that very brief period of time. By 2014, nearly 7,000 megawatts in solar were installed in 1 year, up from 79, 100 times more solar, after not doing anything for generations. Policies were put on the books. All the deniers, all those doubters-- all of a sudden everything they said about how solar wasn't practical, solar couldn't solve the problem--were confronted with this reality. This year nearly 8,000 megawatts are going to be installed; next year, 12,000 megawatts of solar. We are going to have 40,000 megawatts of solar installed by the end of next year in the United States-- 40,000--and we were doing 79 [[Page S7905]] total in 2005. That is how rapidly it is changing. That is how many new jobs are being created in America. The same thing is happening in wind. Wind is going to be producing 20,000 new megawatts in just 2015 and 2016. So here is the good news, and it is incredibly great. There will be 300,000 jobs in the wind and solar sector by the end of next year, 300,000 people working. There will only be 65,000 coal miners, but we will have 300,000 people with these incredible jobs in wind and solar. That is a revolution that wasn't on the books just 10 years ago. All the experts said it can't happen, it won't work, and it will never be successful. So these revolutions are the things on which we have to continue to be the leaders to ensure that we put on the books and keep on the books so that we are successful. There is a technological imperative that we lead, there is an economic imperative that we lead because these jobs get created, and there is a moral responsibility that the United States has because we were the leading polluter for 100 years on the planet. China has now caught up to us, but a lot of that CO 2 is red, white, and blue. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MARKEY. So here is where we are: The President is going to use all of his legal authority to reach a deal in Paris. He will do it pursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that was signed by President George Herbert Walker Bush and ratified by the Senate in 1992, so everything he is doing in Paris is completely pursuant to a treaty that was agreed to by this body. He is doing the Clean Power Plan to reduce greenhouse gases by 30 percent by the year 2030 in the electric utility sector, by the Clean Air Act of 1990, a law passed by the Senate. He increased the fuel economy standards to 54.5 miles per gallon by the year 2025, still the largest reduction of greenhouse gas in the world's history, pursuant to a law passed in 2007 by the U.S. Senate. Underlying it all is an authority given to him by the Supreme Court in 2007, in Massachusetts versus the EPA, which mandated the EPA had to act if they found there was an endangerment of an environment. All of this is legal, all of it is authority the President is using, and all of it is working to create a new era of clean energy jobs all across our country so that we are no longer preaching temperance from a barstool to the rest of the world. We can now say to China and to India: You too must put your reductions on the books. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7903-S7905] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] VETERANS DAY AND CLIMATE CHANGE Mr. MARKEY.

So here is the good news, and it is incredibly great. There will be 300,000 jobs in the wind and solar sector by the end of next year, 300,000 people working. There will only be 65,000 coal miners, but we will have 300,000 people with these incredible jobs in wind and solar. That is a revolution that wasn't on the books just 10 years ago. All the experts said it can't happen, it won't work, and it will never be successful. So these revolutions are the things on which we have to continue to be the leaders to ensure that we put on the books and keep on the books so that we are successful. There is a technological imperative that we lead, there is an economic imperative that we lead because these jobs get created, and there is a moral responsibility that the United States has because we were the leading polluter for 100 years on the planet. China has now caught up to us, but a lot of that CO 2 is red, white, and blue. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Mr. MARKEY. So here is where we are: The President is going to use all of his legal authority to reach a deal in Paris. He will do it pursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that was signed by President George Herbert Walker Bush and ratified by the Senate in 1992, so everything he is doing in Paris is completely pursuant to a treaty that was agreed to by this body. He is doing the Clean Power Plan to reduce greenhouse gases by 30 percent by the year 2030 in the electric utility sector, by the Clean Air Act of 1990, a law passed by the Senate. He increased the fuel economy standards to 54.5 miles per gallon by the year 2025, still the largest reduction of greenhouse gas in the world's history, pursuant to a law passed in 2007 by the U.S. Senate. Underlying it all is an authority given to him by the Supreme Court in 2007, in Massachusetts versus the EPA, which mandated the EPA had to act if they found there was an endangerment of an environment. All of this is legal, all of it is authority the President is using, and all of it is working to create a new era of clean energy jobs all across our country so that we are no longer preaching temperance from a barstool to the rest of the world. We can now say to China and to India: You too must put your reductions on the books. Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska. ____________________",package_114_41.csv,11612,11612,11684,"[congressional record volume 161, number 167 (tuesday, november 10, 2015)] [senate] [pages s7903-s7905] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] veterans day and climate change mr. markey. mr. president, tomorrow is veterans day, and on veterans [[page s7904]] day it is important that we thank america's veterans and their families for their service to our nation. veterans day is a time to honor all those brave men and women who put themselves in harm's way so we may enjoy the tremendous freedoms and personal liberties that make our nation the greatest in the world. such bravery deserves our unending gratitude. we have an obligation to honor them all year-round by fighting to ensure they have the resources, the support, and the protections which they have earned. they fought for us, and now we need to fight for them. when we send our men and women in uniform abroad, we can be confident they will do their utmost to complete their missions. our mission, as senators, is to minimize the need to send our armed services members into harm's way. the root causes of overseas conflict are complex and diverse, from religious divisions to natural resource allocations, to democratic yearnings. increasingly, in the modern era, climate change is straining the strands of stability until they snap. when i was chairman of the house select committee on energy independence and global warming, i held a 2007 hearing where one u.s. general told the story of somalia, how drought in somalia had caused a famine and how that famine had ultimately then led to and encouraged a conflict. the pattern in somalia is the same pattern that we see in other countries: drought leading to famine, leading to fights between different tribes or peoples who otherwise had no reason to fight. aid came in from the united states, warlords started to fight over it, and that is how 18 u.s. service people lost their lives in what we now call ``black hawk down.'' in 2010, terrible droughts in russia and china and floods in pakistan decimated wheat harvests and created a global shortage. the price of wheat increased dramatically. the middle east, home to the world's top nine wheat importers, felt it severely, especially since the region's farmers struggled with their own parched fields. much of syria was gripped with the worst drought it had ever experienced. the price of bread skyrocketed across the region and demands for regime change were not far behind. as we look around the world, we can see, hear, and feel how climate change is a threat multiplier and a catalyst for conflict today. while we have to deal with the consequences of climate change that are already apparent, there is still time to prevent future catastrophes. that is why president obama has been using the tool he has in the clean air act to reduce carbon pollution. he has used it to increase the fuel efficiency of america's cars and trucks, and now he has released the clean power plan, but republicans want to undo it with the congressional review act. starting next monday in this chamber, senate republicans can bring the resolution to the senate floor at any time to dismantle the clean power plan. undoing it would be bad for our economy, bad for our health, and bad for our national security. now, 2014 was the hottest year in global history. records go back all the way to 1880--the warmest year. the first half of this year is now the hottest january to june in that same record. the clean power plan captures the scientific urgency and the economic opportunity necessary to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. the clean power plan provides flexibility to the states to find the solutions to reducing carbon pollution that works best for their situations, unleashing a clean energy revolution in every single state in the union. it will create jobs and save consumers billions on their electricity bills. it will avert almost 100,000 asthma attacks and prevent thousands of premature deaths. the climate and health benefits of the rule are estimated to save $34 billion to $54 billion per year by the year 2030. using the clean air act to reduce carbon pollution is grounded in the supreme court's 2007 decision that confirmed the environmental protection agency's authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases as pollutants under the act. the supreme court has reaffirmed that authority in two subsequent cases, and we have used that authority to set carbon pollution standards for vehicles. these standards, along with increasing the fuel economy of our nation's cars and trucks, are reducing pollution, saving drivers money, and sparking innovation. we will see similar benefits coming from the clean power plan. some of my colleagues in the senate say it can't be done. some will say it will raise electricity bills. some will say it will kill jobs. the problem for them is their claims are just not true. the clean power plan is a plan to create jobs and to grow our economy. it is a signal to the marketplace to invest in clean energy--in wind, in solar, and other renewable energy resources. that is the 21st century. too many people on the senate floor keep looking at the future in a rearview mirror. they keep looking backward instead of ahead, unleashing the technologies of the 21st century. the green generation, the young people in our country, they know we can do this. they know renewables are the technologies of the 21st century. if we do it, it will be a signal to the rest of the world that the united states is going to lead the effort to reduce greenhouse gases, while unleashing a job-creating renewable energy revolution not just for our own country but for the entire planet. just 2 months ago, in september, congress had the honor of hearing from pope francis, who shared his message of action. he told us the american people can do it. he said: i call for a courageous and responsible effort to redirect our steps and to avert the most serious effects of the environmental deterioration caused by human activity. i am convinced we can make a difference and i have no doubt that the united states--and this congress--have an important role to play. now is the time for courageous actions and strategies. he is right. the pope is right. this is the time for action from congress--not denial, not obstructionism. now is the time for the united states, for this senate, to be the leader in finding the global solutions to this threat of dangerous climate change. so what the pope did was take the message of christ and not deliver a ``sermon on the mount,'' he delivered a sermon on the hill--a sermon on the hill to the members of the house and the senate to do everything they can to reduce dangerous greenhouse gases. in saying that to us, he said it as someone who taught high school chemistry, as someone who knows this issue--a pope who taught chemistry. the pope did not believe that science is at odds with religion. the pope believes science and technology is the answer to our prayers, and he called upon us to unleash a technological revolution to reduce these dangerous greenhouse gases. why do we know that we can do this? it is a moral imperative. the pope basically said three things: no. 1, the planet is dangerously warming and the science confirms that; no. 2, human activity is largely contributing to the warming of the planet and the science confirms that; and, no. 3, since human beings are causing this problem, they have a moral responsibility and a moral imperative to do something about it. we are the united states of america. we are the global leader in technology. we are the revolution. so let's see how far we have come in a very brief period of time. in 2005, we installed 79 megawatts of solar in the united states. solar technology had been around for generations. einstein actually won his nobel prize for breakthroughs in solar research. yet this is where we were in 2005; a tiny 79 megawatts was all we were able to install. then we began to change policies in the united states. we began to have states across the country, 30 states, which said we are going to have more renewable electricity in our states. we put tax breaks on the books, and look what happened in that very brief period of time. by 2014, nearly 7,000 megawatts in solar were installed in 1 year, up from 79, 100 times more solar, after not doing anything for generations. policies were put on the books. all the deniers, all those doubters-- all of a sudden everything they said about how solar wasn't practical, solar couldn't solve the problem--were confronted with this reality. this year nearly 8,000 megawatts are going to be installed; next year, 12,000 megawatts of solar. we are going to have 40,000 megawatts of solar installed by the end of next year in the united states-- 40,000--and we were doing 79 [[page s7905]] total in 2005. that is how rapidly it is changing. that is how many new jobs are being created in america. the same thing is happening in wind. wind is going to be producing 20,000 new megawatts in just 2015 and 2016. so here is the good news, and it is incredibly great. there will be 300,000 jobs in the wind and solar sector by the end of next year, 300,000 people working. there will only be 65,000 coal miners, but we will have 300,000 people with these incredible jobs in wind and solar. that is a revolution that wasn't on the books just 10 years ago. all the experts said it can't happen, it won't work, and it will never be successful. so these revolutions are the things on which we have to continue to be the leaders to ensure that we put on the books and keep on the books so that we are successful. there is a technological imperative that we lead, there is an economic imperative that we lead because these jobs get created, and there is a moral responsibility that the united states has because we were the leading polluter for 100 years on the planet. china has now caught up to us, but a lot of that co 2 is red, white, and blue. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute. the presiding officer. without objection, it is so ordered. mr. markey. so here is where we are: the president is going to use all of his legal authority to reach a deal in paris. he will do it pursuant to the united nations framework convention on climate change that was signed by

CREC-2015-11-10-pt1-PgS7902-5,CREC-2015-11-10,114,KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7902-S7903] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, but I have to say this last weekend, as I was going through all the different news and the many things that we track, I was quite surprised last Friday afternoon at the way the President addressed something that this Nation has [[Page S7903]] discussed for 7 years--a pipeline permit, a permit called the Keystone XL Pipeline. It is not a revolutionary thing. Quite frankly, I wish to show you something. These are all the pipelines that currently exist in the United States. Right now, there are 19 international crossings of pipelines already coming into the United States, either from Canada into the northern part of the United States or from Mexico and from the South. There are already 19 of them. This would just be a 20th pipeline. There is nothing different about that. There are 60,000 miles of crude oil pipelines in the United States right now. There are about 63,000 miles of refined product pipelines. If you want to go to natural gas, there are about 300,000 miles of natural gas pipelines already in the United States. Yet this pipeline is treated like some radical and new invention--as if we have never considered a pipeline before. But what surprised me so much wasn't the 2,600-plus days that this pipeline request sat on the President's desk. What surprised me was his reason for actually deciding not to do then the permits. That was the surprising part. Quite frankly, last Friday afternoon as I heard the reasons, I went back, read the transcript, and these were the three reasons the President gave. He said: No. 1, ``the pipeline wouldn't make a meaningful long-term contribution to our economy,'' and he encouraged us to pass a highway bill instead because it would provide more jobs. I don't remember ever discussing and saying: This pipeline is going to provide as many jobs as highways. That has never been discussed on this floor. It is apples and oranges. A highway bill is public funding. It is the taxpayers that actually fund transportation, and we should do highways in transportation. This is a private project that was never intended to have as many jobs as a highway. It is a pipeline. So he said it is not going to provide enough jobs, and so he is not going to permit it. The second reason he gave is this: ``The pipeline would not lower gas prices for American consumers.'' He said gasoline prices are already low, and so we don't need this pipeline--as if gasoline prices don't rise and fall and we shouldn't plan forward for the future. Do you want to know why gasoline prices are low right now? It is because over the decades, Americans have done this, and we have an efficient system of moving energy. By the way, the pipeline is the safest and least expensive way to move energy around our country. So what the President is saying is this: What we have is enough. I don't want to plan for the future anymore. I don't want to look for what is going to help our children. Our prices are low enough. I don't care what our children pay in the future days. Well, that is absurd. But, quite frankly, the third one is the one that was the most jarring to me, so I want to be able to say this statement to you. This is reason No. 3 the President gave: ``Shipping crude oil into our country from unstable countries would not increase America's energy security.'' Let me read that to you again because I was so stunned by it. This is exactly from the President's speech off of the White House site. This is what the President said off this statement. He will not permit the Keystone Pipeline coming from Canada into the United States. He said shipping dirtier crude oil into our country would not increase America's energy security. He said: What has increased America's energy security is our strategy over the past several years to reduce our reliance on dirty fossil fuels from unstable parts of the world. Now, as I heard the President say that, I was a little taken aback because I don't remember any other President referring to Canada as an unstable part of the world from which we don't want to get our energy-- an unstable country, and saying Canada was that country. So I kept reading it and rereading it, thinking maybe he was implying something else, but the problem with that is he either means that Canada is an unstable country and we don't want to be reliant on them to get energy or he is saying the Middle East and other countries are unstable and we don't want to rely on them, so maybe we should buy from Canada instead. Either way it makes absolutely no sense. But in its context--as I read it and read it and read it--the President stated that we don't need to have a Keystone Pipeline because Canada is unstable and we don't want to buy from unstable countries. I would tell you that since the War of 1812 we have gotten along with Canada pretty well. We seem to have settled our differences about 1815, and they have been a very stable trading partner for us. It seems nonsensical to hear the President say: Because it doesn't produce enough jobs, I am not going to permit it. Because it won't affect the price of gasoline today, I won't permit it. And because Canada is unstable as a trading partner, I am not going to permit it. The President can choose to do whatever he chooses to do, but answers like this make no sense to the American people and they make no sense to energy country when we understand full well the actual facts on the ground. In recent days, we have actually started an energy swap with Mexico. Many people may not even know that. You see, all oil is not the same. Heavier crude oil is preferred by many of our refineries in the United States. Quite frankly, our refineries are capable of separating out more of the different minerals and such that are within heavy crude or what is often called sour crude. Our refineries prefer the heavier crude, much like what Canada produces and many parts of the United States and Mexico produces. Many of the refineries in Mexico actually prefer the light sweet crude. We actually have more light sweet crude in America than we can use and what our refineries would prefer to have. So in the past couple of months, Mexico and the United States have worked a swap from pipelines, where they are picking up about 75,000 barrels of light sweet and swapping us 75,000 barrels of heavier crude because they have a commodity we want and we have a commodity they want. That is how we could solve some of our energy issues, to actually look for what is the most efficient, whether it is purchasing it from a pipeline from Canada, which makes great economic sense to us, or exporting our oil anywhere else around the world, whether to Mexico or any other country. This body knows full well the United States cannot sell our oil on the world market because we have a statute in place that would have us believe we are running out of oil rather than having a tremendous amount, which is factually true, and we have particular types of oil that like sweet crude many refineries around the world want. We actually have more of it than we can use. We should sell that. We should put that on the open market. It is cleaner, it is easier to refine, and it is a way to be able to stabilize jobs in the United States. I have been in front of this body time after time with a simple statement: We can sell unleaded around the world, we can sell diesel around the world, we can sell coal around the world, and we can sell natural gas around the world, but for whatever reason we can't sell crude oil around the world. That makes absolutely no sense and we should fix it. Tens of thousands of Americans have lost their jobs because this body has not acted on something as simple as being able to sell a product the world wants and we have on the world market. It is fixable. It is not about environmental disaster. The world is going to use oil. Even the administration and quite frankly even the President in his own speech made this statement last week: The truth is the United States will continue to rely on oil and gas. And so will the world. Until some other solution is out there, which no one sees currently on the horizon, we are going to continue to use oil and gas. Why don't we do it the cleanest way possible and why don't we provide American jobs while we are doing it? It is fixable. It shouldn't be divisive. It is about putting Americans back to work and about helping our economy. With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). The Senator from Massachusetts. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7902-S7903] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE Mr. LANKFORD.

So in the past couple of months, Mexico and the United States have worked a swap from pipelines, where they are picking up about 75,000 barrels of light sweet and swapping us 75,000 barrels of heavier crude because they have a commodity we want and we have a commodity they want. That is how we could solve some of our energy issues, to actually look for what is the most efficient, whether it is purchasing it from a pipeline from Canada, which makes great economic sense to us, or exporting our oil anywhere else around the world, whether to Mexico or any other country. This body knows full well the United States cannot sell our oil on the world market because we have a statute in place that would have us believe we are running out of oil rather than having a tremendous amount, which is factually true, and we have particular types of oil that like sweet crude many refineries around the world want. We actually have more of it than we can use. We should sell that. We should put that on the open market. It is cleaner, it is easier to refine, and it is a way to be able to stabilize jobs in the United States. I have been in front of this body time after time with a simple statement: We can sell unleaded around the world, we can sell diesel around the world, we can sell coal around the world, and we can sell natural gas around the world, but for whatever reason we can't sell crude oil around the world. That makes absolutely no sense and we should fix it. Tens of thousands of Americans have lost their jobs because this body has not acted on something as simple as being able to sell a product the world wants and we have on the world market. It is fixable. It is not about environmental disaster. The world is going to use oil. Even the administration and quite frankly even the President in his own speech made this statement last week: The truth is the United States will continue to rely on oil and gas. And so will the world. Until some other solution is out there, which no one sees currently on the horizon, we are going to continue to use oil and gas. Why don't we do it the cleanest way possible and why don't we provide American jobs while we are doing it? It is fixable. It shouldn't be divisive. It is about putting Americans back to work and about helping our economy. With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). The Senator from Massachusetts. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7902-S7903] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, but I have to say this last weekend, as I was going through all the different news and the many things that we track, I was quite surprised last Friday afternoon at the way the President addressed something that this Nation has [[Page S7903]] discussed for 7 years--a pipeline permit, a permit called the Keystone XL Pipeline. It is not a revolutionary thing. Quite frankly, I wish to show you something. These are all the pipelines that currently exist in the United States. Right now, there are 19 international crossings of pipelines already coming into the United States, either from Canada into the northern part of the United States or from Mexico and from the South. There are already 19 of them. This would just be a 20th pipeline. There is nothing different about that. There are 60,000 miles of crude oil pipelines in the United States right now. There are about 63,000 miles of refined product pipelines. If you want to go to natural gas, there are about 300,000 miles of natural gas pipelines already in the United States. Yet this pipeline is treated like some radical and new invention--as if we have never considered a pipeline before. But what surprised me so much wasn't the 2,600-plus days that this pipeline request sat on the President's desk. What surprised me was his reason for actually deciding not to do then the permits. That was the surprising part. Quite frankly, last Friday afternoon as I heard the reasons, I went back, read the transcript, and these were the three reasons the President gave. He said: No. 1, ``the pipeline wouldn't make a meaningful long-term contribution to our economy,'' and he encouraged us to pass a highway bill instead because it would provide more jobs. I don't remember ever discussing and saying: This pipeline is going to provide as many jobs as highways. That has never been discussed on this floor. It is apples and oranges. A highway bill is public funding. It is the taxpayers that actually fund transportation, and we should do highways in transportation. This is a private project that was never intended to have as many jobs as a highway. It is a pipeline. So he said it is not going to provide enough jobs, and so he is not going to permit it. The second reason he gave is this: ``The pipeline would not lower gas prices for American consumers.'' He said gasoline prices are already low, and so we don't need this pipeline--as if gasoline prices don't rise and fall and we shouldn't plan forward for the future. Do you want to know why gasoline prices are low right now? It is because over the decades, Americans have done this, and we have an efficient system of moving energy. By the way, the pipeline is the safest and least expensive way to move energy around our country. So what the President is saying is this: What we have is enough. I don't want to plan for the future anymore. I don't want to look for what is going to help our children. Our prices are low enough. I don't care what our children pay in the future days. Well, that is absurd. But, quite frankly, the third one is the one that was the most jarring to me, so I want to be able to say this statement to you. This is reason No. 3 the President gave: ``Shipping crude oil into our country from unstable countries would not increase America's energy security.'' Let me read that to you again because I was so stunned by it. This is exactly from the President's speech off of the White House site. This is what the President said off this statement. He will not permit the Keystone Pipeline coming from Canada into the United States. He said shipping dirtier crude oil into our country would not increase America's energy security. He said: What has increased America's energy security is our strategy over the past several years to reduce our reliance on dirty fossil fuels from unstable parts of the world. Now, as I heard the President say that, I was a little taken aback because I don't remember any other President referring to Canada as an unstable part of the world from which we don't want to get our energy-- an unstable country, and saying Canada was that country. So I kept reading it and rereading it, thinking maybe he was implying something else, but the problem with that is he either means that Canada is an unstable country and we don't want to be reliant on them to get energy or he is saying the Middle East and other countries are unstable and we don't want to rely on them, so maybe we should buy from Canada instead. Either way it makes absolutely no sense. But in its context--as I read it and read it and read it--the President stated that we don't need to have a Keystone Pipeline because Canada is unstable and we don't want to buy from unstable countries. I would tell you that since the War of 1812 we have gotten along with Canada pretty well. We seem to have settled our differences about 1815, and they have been a very stable trading partner for us. It seems nonsensical to hear the President say: Because it doesn't produce enough jobs, I am not going to permit it. Because it won't affect the price of gasoline today, I won't permit it. And because Canada is unstable as a trading partner, I am not going to permit it. The President can choose to do whatever he chooses to do, but answers like this make no sense to the American people and they make no sense to energy country when we understand full well the actual facts on the ground. In recent days, we have actually started an energy swap with Mexico. Many people may not even know that. You see, all oil is not the same. Heavier crude oil is preferred by many of our refineries in the United States. Quite frankly, our refineries are capable of separating out more of the different minerals and such that are within heavy crude or what is often called sour crude. Our refineries prefer the heavier crude, much like what Canada produces and many parts of the United States and Mexico produces. Many of the refineries in Mexico actually prefer the light sweet crude. We actually have more light sweet crude in America than we can use and what our refineries would prefer to have.

CREC-2015-11-10-pt1-PgS7905,CREC-2015-11-10,114,STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S7905] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening to talk about two issues that are of particular importance to me. When most look at me now, they think about energy and more typically about Alaskan energy. I am not going to disappoint tonight. I would like to speak to that, but I would also like to speak this evening about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the SPR. We have been talking about it a lot of late. It has been viewed as a source of revenue--a pay-for, if you will--with certain measures that we have seen of late, whether it be the transportation measure that we have in front of us, the budget deal that was executed a couple weeks ago, or other measures. I want to take a few minutes this evening to talk about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. I will start by first addressing what I will call the flagship SPR. It is the very important stuff, if you will, within the Reserve, and that is the crude oil. I call this the flagship because there are five product petroleum reserve sites in the Northeast. We have product reserve sites for gasoline, distillate, and home heating oil, but these are relatively small reserve sites. There are about 2 million barrels total. I think their effectiveness is probably more controversial. But the flagship SPR is truly--when we think about the impact, the import to our economy and to a level of stability, the flagship Strategic Petroleum Reserve occupies giant underground caverns along the gulf coast. I had the opportunity to visit the site of one of our Strategic Petroleum Reserves. It holds some 695 million barrels, and they are ready to cover our Nation's net imports for several months if global energy markets should spiral out of control. The comforting reality about these flagship SPRs is that, through thick and thin, these reserves are rarely ever tapped. They have offered a measure of security and stability that I think is unique in the history of global commerce. Amid higher levels of domestic production and lower levels of imports, a number of reforms are being considered for the SPR by the Department of Energy now. There has been a lot of discussion. There is a study underway by the DOE, and a discussion about upgrading the distribution capacity of the SPR is underway, and it clearly has merit. The North American energy landscape has changed so quickly and so dramatically that the volume of oil we can pump out of the Reserve is greater and potentially much greater than the volume of oil we can actually move to refineries. This is something we need to understand and study more, but it is something that--we have congested waterways, we can look at reversed pipelines and so on, ways that we can figure out how we can move this oil more readily if we so need it. In the measure we have just executed with the budget proposal, there is funding set aside for Strategic Petroleum Reserve maintenance and life extension, hopefully for marine terminals, but effectively recognizing that we need to make sure that our SPR actually functions as it is intended. That study is underway. We will learn more, hopefully in the spring, but the imperative to have a functioning, workable SPR is one that goes to national security, really, from an overall stability argument. I remain opposed to suggestions by some that we should use the Reserve to pay for completely unrelated programs or that we simply sell off the entire stockpile, as some have suggested. As I wrote in my July report of this year called ``A Turbulent World,'' we have drawn down SPR only on a limited number of occasions. In the entire history of the Reserve itself, only approximately 166 million barrels have ever left the storage sites for any reasons. So 166 barrels have been sold off over the course of the life of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for exchanges, emergencies, tests, deficit reductions. Everything that we have ever done that has involved a sale of the SPR totals just about 166 million barrels. That is this graph over here. Over here are the new proposed sales to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. If we add up the barrels this Congress--the 114th Congress-- has already committed to sell for SPR modernization, the Bipartisan Budget Act, the DRIVE Act, the Transportation bill, and then a bill over on the House side, the 21st Century Cures Act, we are looking at a total of 279 million barrels to be sold off. That is 40 million for SPR modernization, 58 million for the Bipartisan Budget Act, 21st Century Cures Act is 80 million, and the highway bill is 101 million. We would be selling off 279 million barrels total. Think about that--in the entire life of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, 166 million barrels sold off. In one Congress, what we are proposing is 279 million barrels. It is quite eye-catching. These numbers matter. The SPR is designed to provide 90 days of net import protection. It is a pretty simple math equation we are dealing with. If we import more, we need more in storage; if we import less, we need less. Currently, net imports are about 5 million barrels per day. Therefore, the bare minimum we need in storage is 450 million barrels. So if we execute all of the sales the 114th Congress has either approved or is considering, we dip below the bare minimum that is required--the 450 million barrels--by the end of the 10-year window. I am going to be releasing another report on the cumulative impact of all these sales on the integrity of the Reserve, so we should be seeing that in a few days. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S7905] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE Ms. MURKOWSKI.

As I wrote in my July report of this year called ``A Turbulent World,'' we have drawn down SPR only on a limited number of occasions. In the entire history of the Reserve itself, only approximately 166 million barrels have ever left the storage sites for any reasons. So 166 barrels have been sold off over the course of the life of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for exchanges, emergencies, tests, deficit reductions. Everything that we have ever done that has involved a sale of the SPR totals just about 166 million barrels. That is this graph over here. Over here are the new proposed sales to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. If we add up the barrels this Congress--the 114th Congress-- has already committed to sell for SPR modernization, the Bipartisan Budget Act, the DRIVE Act, the Transportation bill, and then a bill over on the House side, the 21st Century Cures Act, we are looking at a total of 279 million barrels to be sold off. That is 40 million for SPR modernization, 58 million for the Bipartisan Budget Act, 21st Century Cures Act is 80 million, and the highway bill is 101 million. We would be selling off 279 million barrels total. Think about that--in the entire life of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, 166 million barrels sold off. In one Congress, what we are proposing is 279 million barrels. It is quite eye-catching. These numbers matter. The SPR is designed to provide 90 days of net import protection. It is a pretty simple math equation we are dealing with. If we import more, we need more in storage; if we import less, we need less. Currently, net imports are about 5 million barrels per day. Therefore, the bare minimum we need in storage is 450 million barrels. So if we execute all of the sales the 114th Congress has either approved or is considering, we dip below the bare minimum that is required--the 450 million barrels--by the end of the 10-year window. I am going to be releasing another report on the cumulative impact of all these sales on the integrity of the Reserve, so we should be seeing that in a few days.

the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] strategic petroleum reserve ms. murkowski. mr. president, i come to the floor this evening to talk about two issues that are of particular importance to me. when most look at me now, they think about energy and more typically about alaskan energy. i am not going to disappoint tonight. i would like to speak to that, but i would also like to speak this evening about the strategic petroleum reserve, the spr. we have been talking about it a lot of late. it has been viewed as a source of revenue--a pay-for, if you will--with certain measures that we have seen of late, whether it be the transportation measure that we have in front of us, the budget deal that was executed a couple weeks ago, or other measures. i want to take a few minutes this evening to talk about the strategic petroleum reserve. i will start by first addressing what i will call the flagship spr. it is the very important stuff, if you will, within the reserve, and that is the crude oil. i call this the flagship because there are five product petroleum reserve sites in the northeast. we have product reserve sites for gasoline, distillate, and home heating oil, but these are relatively small reserve sites. there are about 2 million barrels total. i think their effectiveness is probably more controversial. but the flagship spr is truly--when we think about the impact, the import to our economy and to a level of stability, the flagship strategic petroleum reserve occupies giant underground caverns along the gulf coast. i had the opportunity to visit the site of one of our strategic petroleum reserves. it holds some 695 million barrels, and they are ready to cover our nation's net imports for several months if global energy markets should spiral out of control. the comforting reality about these flagship sprs is that, through thick and thin, these reserves are rarely ever tapped. they have offered a measure of security and stability that i think is unique in the history of global commerce. amid higher levels of domestic production and lower levels of imports, a number of reforms are being considered for the spr by the department of energy now. there has been a lot of discussion. there is a study underway by the doe, and a discussion about upgrading the distribution capacity of the spr is underway, and it clearly has merit. the north american energy landscape has changed so quickly and so dramatically that the volume of oil we can pump out of the reserve is greater and potentially much greater than the volume of oil we can actually move to refineries. this is something we need to understand and study more, but it is something that--we have congested waterways, we can look at reversed pipelines and so on, ways that we can figure out how we can move this oil more readily if we so need it. in the measure we have just executed with the budget proposal, there is funding set aside for strategic petroleum reserve maintenance and life extension, hopefully for marine terminals, but effectively recognizing that we need to make sure that our spr actually functions as it is intended. that study is underway. we will learn more, hopefully in the spring, but the imperative to have a functioning, workable spr is one that goes to national security, really, from an overall stability argument. i remain opposed to suggestions by some that we should use the reserve to pay for completely unrelated programs or that we simply sell off the entire stockpile, as some have suggested. as i wrote in my july report of this year called

CREC-2015-11-10-pt1-PgS7905-2,CREC-2015-11-10,114,PETROLEUM ADMINISTRATION FOR DEFENSE DISTRICT 5,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7905-S7906] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PETROLEUM ADMINISTRATION FOR DEFENSE DISTRICT 5 Ms. MURKOWSKI. Now, Mr. President, I would like to turn quickly to a Department of Energy proposal to construct a new petroleum product reserve [[Page S7906]] on the west coast. We call this PADD 5, short for Petroleum Administration for Defense District 5. PADD 5 is important because it consumes 17 percent of the Nation's gasoline, 13 percent of its diesel fuel, and 30 percent of its jet fuel. At the same time, PADD 5 is geographically isolated, according to the Energy Information Administration. The approximately 30 refineries operating on the west coast are responsible for supplying nearly all of its petroleum products. The argument for a product reserve is relatively straightforward. Because PADD 5 is separated from the rest of the country by the Rocky Mountains and from the world by the Pacific Ocean, a stockpile of refined fuel should be established. That is the argument that is out there. I don't oppose a study of this concept, but I can see the pitfalls out there. PADD 5 imports over 1 million barrels of crude oil and petroleum products each day, suggesting that it really is not cut off from the world in the first place. And bear in mind the size of the district that we are talking about. Any stockpile would have to be really enormous to have significant impact. Finally, would Federal gasoline reserves supplement or replace commercial stocks? That is a question that needs to be asked. So perhaps the solution is not a refined product reserve at all but instead a return to basics, and that basic is crude oil. After all, there are reasons we chose crude oil instead of the products when we first created the Reserve. By and large, that rationale hasn't changed. First, oil is better suited, chemically and economically, for long-term storage underground, we don't have seasonal specifications on oil as we do on gasoline, and oil can be processed into an array of products while gasoline cannot. Very quickly, taking this back to Alaska, a gasoline reserve on the west coast of any size would be small potatoes when compared to the incredible resource base we have in Alaska. For decades now, tankers have shipped North Slope crude to the line of refineries that stretch from Anacortes, WA, down to Los Angeles. Drivers up and down the coast fuel their cars with gasoline that is refined from this Alaskan oil every day. Alaska North Slope crude oil is chemically similar to the kinds of oil stored in the SPR. In fact, according to the Department of Energy, over 30 million barrels of Alaskan oil have been stored in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. West coast refineries are optimized to run Alaskan crude. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System is only pumping about 500,000 barrels per day, down from 2 million barrels per day at its peak. So there is plenty of room in our already built, already operating pipeline. The problem is--and you have heard me say this before--the Federal Government controls some 60 percent of the land in our State. More than 10 billion barrels of oil are buried under our onshore Federal lands alone, to say nothing of what is held in our offshore waters but remain almost universally inaccessible to American explorers and producers. That includes about 10 billion barrels in the nonwilderness portion of ANWR, where we are asking for permission to develop 2,000 acres or 0.01 percent of the surface of the refuge. That is all we are asking to access. Beyond our ANWR resources, we have at least another 900 million barrels in our National Petroleum Reserve, which is an area that is specifically reserved for development. The estimate on the 900 million barrels there is that it is likely far too low. For the record, I would add that Alaskans overwhelmingly support development of both of these areas. More than 70 percent of Alaskans want development, understanding the significant economic benefits it will bring and the strong record of environmental stewardship we have in the State. We have an opportunity. We have an opportunity to develop our resources in order to create jobs, generate revenues, and bolster our Nation's security and competitiveness. By doing this, we can actually address not just one but two threats: First, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline is just one-third full; in large part because of the anti-energy decisions made by this administration and the west coast is more vulnerable to supply disruptions as a result of falling production. You think about a crisis situation in the Middle East. The west coast will need more oil. Its refineries are ready to run Alaskan crude and Alaskans are ready to ship it, but there is nothing to ship because the oil is still in the ground and there is no way to transport it from the North Slope to the terminals along the southern coast of the State. I am not talking about keeping our oil in pristine condition, never to be used. Energy is not fine china that you keep up on a shelf. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is not a petroleum preserve. Our strategic stocks, barrels ready to go, should rarely be tapped, but Alaskan resources are already part of the daily life of Californians, Hawaiians. The resource must be accessible, though, but first they need to be accessed. Opening Alaska's resources now would ensure that more oil is transported through TAPS. A healthy pipeline would ensure that oil can be shipped from Alaska to fuel the west coast refineries when they need it and help ensure that energy remains affordable for the west coast. Instead of constructing an entirely new product reserve, as some are contemplating, perhaps what we should do is preserve the infrastructure we have already built and leverage it to boost our energy security. Why would we want to build a reserve when you can prevent a shortage in the first place by letting a State that wants to produce oil go ahead and produce the oil? To me that is sound, strategic thinking. That would be a policy that benefits us instead of simply costing more money that we don't have. That is the kind of thinking that I believe our Nation and our future generations should have. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7905-S7906] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PETROLEUM ADMINISTRATION FOR DEFENSE DISTRICT 5 Ms. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, on the eve of Veterans Day and the 240th Birthday of the United States Marine Corps, I rise to speak about the fiscal year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA. This legislation has taken a circuitous route to get to where it is today. The President correctly vetoed the original bill as it was a flawed product. It was flawed in the sense that it unfairly exempted the defense budget from the same draconian budget caps on nondefense programs by utilizing the overseas contingency operations, OCO. While this approach would have funded the defense bill, it neglected our economic security and left unaddressed important national priorities including law enforcement, education, transportation and community development, and medical research. A strong economy and strong communities are the backbone of our national security, and we should not divide our country into two Americas--defense on one side and everyone else on the other. That is not the way Congress should be doing business, and that is why our military leaders, led by Secretary of Defense Carter, opposed the earlier versions of this year's NDAA. The bill, which we passed 91-3 today, comes after passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act, which provides balanced relief from cuts to ensure we have a strong defense and a strong economy. I supported this revised bill. While it was not a perfect bill, it is the result of a bipartisan compromise by the Congress. The fiscal year 2016 NDAA provides the men and women of our Armed Forces with the resources and equipment they need to defend our Nation and protect its interests. I commend Chairman McCain and Ranking Member Reed for their leadership on the Senate Armed Services Committee in creating and shepherding this vital legislation through this chamber. The outstanding and bipartisan efforts of committee members will allow the defense authorization bill to become law for the 54th consecutive year. I am proud to serve alongside Chairman Wicker as ranking member of the Seapower Subcommittee and want to thank him for leading the subcommittee which helps ensure that our Navy and Marine Corps forces are trained and equipped to conduct the vital missions they are tasked to complete. A strong and prepared Navy and Marines is absolutely essential to our national security strategies in the Asia-Pacific region, and this bill supports those efforts. This NDAA includes a number of provisions that reaffirm the importance of the rebalance to the Asia-Pacific; support the men and women who serve in our military and the Hawaii National Guard; invest in Hawaii's military bases, schools, and facilities and those that assess the ballistic missile capabilities of rouge nations and the current capacity to defend Hawaii against missile threats. Our support of the rebalance to the Asia-Pacific is critical. Maintenance of stability in this region cannot be underestimated. Continued engagement and partnership with our friends and allies in the region is invaluable. By extending the State Partnership Program, we not only hone the capabilities and readiness of our National Guard, but we gain the dual benefit of enhancing our partnerships and the capacity of regional neighbors. However, I do have some concerns with the final bill that I intend to work on going forward. While my colleagues and I continue to work to reduce redundancy and increase efficiencies with in our military, I would have serious concerns if across-the-board reductions to headquarters operations were made by the Department of Defense implementing this bill. In talking with military commanders, I know that cuts at command headquarters to include U.S. Pacific Command, U.S. Pacific Fleet, U.S. Marine Corps Forces, Pacific, U.S. Army Pacific and Pacific Air Forces, which are all based in Hawaii, would impact our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. We need to ensure that any reductions are carefully thought out and take into account the assigned missions and right sizing of headquarters to adequately support the demands we place on our operational forces. I will closely monitor the Pentagon's implementation of these provisions going forward. In addition, I want to ensure that the men and women of the Department who travel for extended periods of time on official business are reimbursed for food and lodging at appropriate levels. Last year the Department changed how these workers are reimbursed, and the bill passed today directs the Government Accountability Office, GAO, to review the issue and report back to Congress. I will be tracking the GAO report on this important issue, as well as the Department's implementation of their extended Temporary Travel Duty, TDY, policy. While the passage of this legislation is critical, it still contains misguided provisions I have long disagreed with and that negatively affect our security, as well as the men and women who defend this Nation. An area I strongly disagree with is in regard to the restrictions on transferring prisoners from Guantanamo Bay. These harm our security interests and continue to undermine our leadership on human rights. We need to work towards a solution to close this facility. Despite these concerns, this legislation is a product of a sincere bipartisan and bicameral effort to provide the men and women of our military the tools and resources it needs to defend our great Nation. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S7908] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, on the eve of Veterans Day and the 240th Birthday of the United States Marine Corps, I rise to speak about the fiscal year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA. This legislation has taken a circuitous route to get to where it is today. The President correctly vetoed the original bill as it was a flawed product. It was flawed in the sense that it unfairly exempted the defense budget from the same draconian budget caps on nondefense programs by utilizing the overseas contingency operations, OCO. While this approach would have funded the defense bill, it neglected our economic security and left unaddressed important national priorities including law enforcement, education, transportation and community development, and medical research. A strong economy and strong communities are the backbone of our national security, and we should not divide our country into two Americas--defense on one side and everyone else on the other. That is not the way Congress should be doing business, and that is why our military leaders, led by Secretary of Defense Carter, opposed the earlier versions of this year's NDAA. The bill, which we passed 91-3 today, comes after passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act, which provides balanced relief from cuts to ensure we have a strong defense and a strong economy. I supported this revised bill. While it was not a perfect bill, it is the result of a bipartisan compromise by the Congress. The fiscal year 2016 NDAA provides the men and women of our Armed Forces with the resources and equipment they need to defend our Nation and protect its interests. I commend Chairman McCain and Ranking Member Reed for their leadership on the Senate Armed Services Committee in creating and shepherding this vital legislation through this chamber. The outstanding and bipartisan efforts of committee members will allow the defense authorization bill to become law for the 54th consecutive year.

CREC-2015-11-10-pt1-PgS7906,CREC-2015-11-10,114,INTERNET SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES USAGE RULES,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7906-S7908] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] INTERNET SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES USAGE RULES Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I wish to inform all Senators that on November 9, 2015, the Committee on Rules and Administration adopted the U.S. Senate Internet Services and Technology Resources Usage Rules which will supersede and replace the U.S. Senate Internet Services Usage Rules and Policies previously adopted in 2008. Given the many advances in technology since the last regulations were adopted, an update was required to facilitate the use of modern communication tools. The new regulations modernize our rules so Senate offices can utilize new technologies, such as third-party social networking sites and data analytics, to more effectively communicate with constituents. While in some cases, outmoded restrictions on these technologies have been eased, certain restrictions necessarily remain in place including prohibitions on campaign content or links on official sites, for example. The regulations should be reviewed carefully to see where new methods have been authorized as well as what restrictions remain. These rules are effective immediately. I hope Senate offices will be able to make use of the new technologies and methods they authorize to enhance constituent communications. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the rules as adopted be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: U.S. Senate Internet Services and Technology Resources Usage Rules Adopted by the Committee on Rules and Administration on November 9, 2015 1.0 definitions For purposes of these Rules, the following terms shall have the meaning specified-- 1.1 Senate Office.

The new regulations modernize our rules so Senate offices can utilize new technologies, such as third-party social networking sites and data analytics, to more effectively communicate with constituents. While in some cases, outmoded restrictions on these technologies have been eased, certain restrictions necessarily remain in place including prohibitions on campaign content or links on official sites, for example. The regulations should be reviewed carefully to see where new methods have been authorized as well as what restrictions remain. These rules are effective immediately.

CREC-2015-11-10-pt1-PgS7909,CREC-2015-11-10,114,ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEATH OF KEN SARO-WIWA,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S7909] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEATH OF KEN SARO-WIWA Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today marks a dark milestone on the long road to environmental justice. Twenty years ago, Nigerian environmental and human rights activist Ken Saro-Wiwa was hanged, along with eight fellow defendants, following an internationally denounced military tribunal. Saro-Wiwa was a well-known author and television producer in his native Nigeria before he chose to devote himself full time to the causes of the Ogoni, a minority ethnic group of about 500,000 farmers and fishermen who hail from the Niger Delta. As president of the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People--MOSOP--he fought against the exploitation of Ogoni lands and the Ogoni people themselves by the oil drilling operations of Royal Dutch Shell. As the oil industry grew to represent the main source of revenue for the Nigerian Government, the delta landscape was ravaged by oil spills and acid rain. Fertile farmland turned to oil-soaked wasteland. The region's fish and wildlife were wiped out--along with the livelihood of the Ogoni. Out of the entire 5,000-person workforce employed by Shell in Nigeria, less than 100 were Ogoni. Under Ken Saro-Wiwa's leadership, MOSOP organized hundreds of thousands of Ogoni to demand environmental remediation, compensation for past damages, and a share in oil revenues. The regime of dictator General Sani Abacha responded with a brutal campaign of occupation, mass arrest, rape, execution, and the burning of Ogoni villages. In May 1994, Saro-Wiwa was abducted from his home and brought up on charges in connection with the murder of four Ogoni leaders. He was tried and convicted by a military tribunal that governments and human rights organizations worldwide condemned as fraudulent. On November 10, 1995, Ken Saro-Wiwa was put to death. ``The only crime he and his colleagues had committed,'' reads Saro- Wiwa's citation for the prestigious Godman Environmental Prize, ``was to demand sound environmental practices and to ask for compensation for the devastation of Ogoni territories.'' A human rights lawsuit brought by Saro-Wiwa's son and other victims' families in U.S. Federal court alleged that Shell bribed at least two witnesses in the 1995 tribunal and that Shell's manager in Nigeria offered Saro-Wiwa's brother, another jailed activist, release from captivity in exchange for abandoning the movement. That suit was settled by Shell for $15.5 million, just days before going to trial in 2009, following a protracted legal battle. The Ogoni cause has been taken up by other Ogoni, both within Nigeria and living in exile, including Saro-Wiwa's sons. The struggle and death of Ken Saro-Wiwa serve as a lasting inspiration to people of all nations who seek relief from corporate abuse, government corruption, and environmental ruin. We will remember his noble fight for the basic right of a people to live in harmony with the Earth. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S7909] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEATH OF KEN SARO-WIWA Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Mr. President, I wish to commemorate Veterans Day and to thank all those who have served our country for their extraordinary bravery and sacrifice. As many of my colleagues know, President Woodrow Wilson first established this holiday--originally known as Armistice Day--on November 11, 1919, to honor the brave Americans who fought and died in World War I. After the end of World War II, Armistice Day was expanded to honor all veterans of our military services, and the holiday's name was changed to Veterans Day. My home State of Maryland has a long and proud military tradition dating to the first militiamen who set foot in the Maryland Colony in 1634; to the [[Page S7909]] War of 1812, where our soldiers famously held Fort McHenry and our national anthem, the ``Star-Spangled Banner,'' was penned; through both world wars; Korea; Vietnam; the Persian Gulf war; and our most recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Maryland's veterans and troops represent the best of our State and our Nation. Earlier this year, I had an opportunity to help present a Congressional Gold Medal to former Tuskegee Airman William A. Colbert, Jr., a lifelong Marylander. Mr. Colbert enlisted in the Army Air Force in 1943 and achieved the rank of flight officer at the Tuskegee Army Air Field. While Mr. Colbert never saw combat, he learned to fly with the best and became a full-fledged Red Tail. And as part of the first all-Black combat unit in the U.S. Armed Forces, Mr. Colbert and his fellow servicemen broke through racial barriers without any expectation of fame or fanfare. Their distinguished service and enduring courage played a critical role in the later desegregation of our Nation's military. Mr. Colbert always considered his contribution to the Tuskegee Airmen and his service to our country simply as what he was called to do as a citizen. Mr. Colbert passed away in early June but not before we were finally able to thank him for his extraordinary service to our Nation. While we were able to honor Mr. Colbert, there are thousands of other veterans who remain nameless. That is why on August 5, 2015, I introduced the Korean War Veterans Memorial Wall of Remembrance Act of 2015, S. 1982, along with the senior Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Boozman. Our legislation authorizes the addition of a Wall of Remembrance to the existing Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC. The Wall of Remembrance would list the names of members of the Armed Forces of the United States who died in theater in the Korean war, as well as the number of servicemembers who were wounded in action, are listed as missing in action, or who were prisoners of war during the Korean war. Authorizing a wall of remembrance here in the United States is just one way we can help ensure that those who gave the ultimate sacrifice while serving our country in the ``forgotten war'' are no longer forgotten. As America celebrates Veterans Day, we stand united in honoring the acts of selfless service from our Nation's veterans. Our veterans and military men and women and their families need to know that we remember them not just on Veterans Day but every single day of the year. Our veterans have protected our country and defended our values. These Americans are the bravest among us, and we applaud the innumerable sacrifices that they and their loved ones have made for this great country. As we celebrate Veterans Day, our thoughts and prayers are also with ``veterans to be''--the men and women who are currently serving our country, especially those in harm's way. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7908-S7909] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] OBSERVING VETERANS DAY Mr. CARDIN.

In 1974, a small group of citizens in the Charleston area wanted to address the lack of opportunity for persons with disabilities. The Palmetto Goodwill of South Carolina has answered the call of service by becoming a part of the United States AbilityOne Commission network with their Champions Program. The Palmetto Goodwill has successfully implemented the Champions Program which aims to empower citizens of South Carolina that are blind or possessing a disability. Through providing employment opportunities, the Palmetto Goodwill is making strides to continue the mission of National Disability Employment Awareness Month throughout the year.

Mr. President, I wish to honor the service and retirement of one of my dear friends and most respected employees, Melissa Kaltenbach. Melissa has served me and the people of Michigan with infinite loyalty and dedication for the past 27 years. Melissa began working for me in the Michigan House of Representatives and continued her service with me in the State Senate, U.S. House, and now in the U.S. Senate as my director of constituent services. In so many ways, Melissa's job is one of if not the most important jobs on my staff. That is because her work impacts people where it matters most--in their daily lives. Her compassion toward the people of Michigan and understanding of the problems they face has been instrumental in setting the high standards for constituent services in my office and throughout the State of Michigan. She has a unique ability to listen and understand the needs of people, and she demonstrates grace and respect for the dignity of others, even in the most stressful times and most difficult circumstances. She has gone above and beyond in so many ways-- incredible empathy, unwavering loyalty, and infinite patience. [[Page S7910]] There really aren't enough words to describe Melissa's contributions to my office and to my success in serving the people of Michigan over these many years. She has been the go-to person on my team to mentor new staff, handle challenging cases, and answer those questions that don't seem to fall into anyone else's job description. We all wish Melissa continued success and happiness with her family as she begins this new chapter in her life, joining her husband, Tim, in full-time retirement. Her friendship and commitment to me and to the people of Michigan have been immeasurable, as is my gratitude for her decades of service. While my staff and I will miss her presence in our office, she will forever be an invaluable member and leader of ``Team Stabenow.'' ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7909-S7910] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO MELISSA KALTENBACH Ms. STABENOW.

CREC-2015-11-10-pt1-PgS7910-3,CREC-2015-11-10,114,WELCOMING RITCHIE COUNTY VETERANS TO THE NATION'S CAPITAL,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S7910] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WELCOMING RITCHIE COUNTY VETERANS TO THE NATION'S CAPITAL Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize with, overwhelming pride, a group of courageous veterans from Ritchie County, WV, who are visiting our Nation's Capital this Thursday. On behalf of our State and Nation, it is a true honor and privilege to recognize these heroic men and women and their families for their brave service and sacrifice as they tour the memorials built in their honor. I have always said that West Virginia is one of the most patriotic States in this great Nation, and we are so proud of the number of veterans and Active-Duty members who have served our country with honor and distinction. The 20 veterans and their family members who are traveling to Washington, DC, embody our State's history and contributions to the freedom of this Nation. They may represent different generations of warriors, but no matter the war or the era, no matter the rank, each and every one of them courageously answered the call of duty to defend our Nation and protect the freedoms we enjoy as Americans. In our time of need, they stepped forward and said, ``I'll do it--I'll protect this country.'' This trip will be a truly moving and special experience for these veterans, many of whom have never been to the memorials that were built for their service. It will include wreath-laying ceremonies at the monuments that commemorate the wars in which many have served, including the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Korean War Veterans Memorial, and the National World War II Memorial. They will also be touring Arlington National Cemetery and have private time for a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Mr. President, it is also tremendously important to recognize that this visit would not have been possible without the hard work and determination of an inspirational young Ritchie County native, Kirsten Seese. Kirsten is a Ritchie County High School senior who aspires to be a nurse one day. She was inspired to coordinate this trip as her prenursing senior project after hearing about a group of veterans that had recently traveled to Washington, DC, to visit the memorials sponsored by their community. Kirsten wasted no time. She went to businesses in Ritchie County with the goal of organizing a 100 percent free veterans appreciation tour. In just 3 weeks, Kirsten raised enough money for 20 veterans, their family members, and local volunteers to visit to Washington, DC, absolutely free. They will not have to pay for any meals or refreshments and will receive a commemorative shirt and a hat. The funding will also go towards the wreaths for the ceremonies that will be held at each memorial and a group photo at the Capitol to commemorate their special day. I am so proud of Kirsten. She has truly set an extraordinary example for her generation by giving back to those who have served this country and those who have protected our freedoms. It is the devotion and drive of young people like Kirsten that bring our communities together. I wish her the best of luck in her future endeavors, and I commend her for making an enormous impact on the lives of our veterans through this veterans appreciation tour. Mr. President, I am filled with pride every time I meet the patriots who have served our country, and I am so pleased to welcome West Virginia's most courageous veterans who are all heroes to Washington, DC. I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in saluting them. They truly inspire us all as we are reminded of their selfless service. It is because of their bravery that all Americans enjoy the greatest liberties and freedoms in the world. We whole heartedly thank them. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Page S7910] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] WELCOMING RITCHIE COUNTY VETERANS TO THE NATION'S CAPITAL Mr. MANCHIN.

CREC-2015-11-10-pt1-PgS7910-4,CREC-2015-11-10,114,TRIBUTE TO JUDGE GEORGE HEALY,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7910-S7911] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO JUDGE GEORGE HEALY Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a Rhode Islander whom I have known and admired for nearly 30 years: George Healy, chief judge of our State's Workers' Compensation Court, who retired in July after 24 years on the bench. A number of George's colleagues will be gathering on November 19 to honor his years of service, and it is indeed my honor to say a few words about him today. I first came to know George Healy amidst a genuine crisis in Rhode Island: the near-collapse of our State's workers' compensation system in 1991. Here is how a 1991 report by the Rhode Island Department of Economic Development summed up the situation. The financial burden borne by employers had simply become too great. Insurers had begun to exit the Rhode Island marketplace. And, most importantly, the financial protection required for our state's injured workers was being placed in jeopardy. Indeed, when compared with our New England neighbors, our average claim costs were through the roof. In 1990, the average claim in Rhode Island was $12,638, more than three times higher than the average claim in Vermont and significantly higher than Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Hampshire, which collectively had average claim costs in the range of $6,000 to $7,000. This was simply unsustainable. Enter George Healy who until that time had been a civil litigator and workers' compensation practitioner. Our Governor at the time, Bruce [[Page S7911]] Sundlun, appointed George and a handful of other stakeholders to a task force that was given a bold directive: Reduce the cost of the system without reducing benefits. As Governor Sundlun's legal counsel at the time, I had the honor of leading the task force, but I relied greatly on George for his expertise on the system. Working together with our colleagues, we were able to develop a plan that protected workers, reduced costs, eliminated pending rate increases, stabilized the workers' compensation market, eliminated fraud, and prevented a collapse of the system. One of the hallmarks of the reform was the creation of the Workers' Compensation Court, which hears and decides all disputes involving an injured employee and an employer relating to workers' compensation benefits. Governor Sundlun appointed George to be among the inaugural class of the court's judges after its creation in 1991. George was then appointed chief judge by Governor Don Carcieri in 2004. Now, as George Healy looks back on his career, I hope he will rule it a success. I certainly do. The reforms he helped lead reduced average claim costs in Rhode Island from $12,638 in 1991 to just $5,179 in 2007. The reduction came about not from benefit cuts but from system reforms, quick court action, injury prevention, and getting people quickly back to work. A 2009 report by the International Workers' Compensation Foundation put it this way: ``When both claim frequency and severity are considered (taking into account all employees, whether or not injured) . . . Rhode Island stands out as the state with the lowest average medical cost per employee per year in the entire country.'' Because of George's work, Rhode Island is now a model system for the rest of the country. In short, thanks in large part to George's hard work and his years of service on the bench, Rhode Island workers can rest assured that, if they get hurt on the job, their State's insurance program will be there for them. That is a proud and meaningful legacy to leave behind. In addition to all of George's accomplishments on the bench, I will always remember him for his humility, gentle demeanor, and respect toward those who appeared before him. I will also be grateful for his friendship through the years, and I hope George enjoys many peaceful years of retirement, knowing that his efforts have improved the lives of countless others. I wish him the best as he enjoys much deserved family time with his lovely wife Ruth, his son Tim and his wife Jewel, his son Paul and his wife Meghan, and George's three grandchildren, Quinn, Jack, and Charlotte. Godspeed, my friend. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7910-S7911] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] TRIBUTE TO JUDGE GEORGE HEALY Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

(3) nearing the end of World War II, the United States Army began using helicopters for medical evacuation and years later, during the Korean War, these helicopter air ambulances were responsible for transporting 17,700 United States casualties; (4) during the Vietnam War, with the use of helicopter air ambulances, United States Army Dust Off crews pioneered the concept of dedicated and rapid medical evacuation and rescued almost 900,000 United States, South Vietnamese, and other allied sick and wounded, as well as wounded enemy forces; (5) helicopters proved to be a revolutionary tool to assist those injured on the battlefield; (6) highly skilled and intrepid, Dust Off crews were able to operate the helicopters and land them on almost any terrain in nearly any weather to pick up wounded, after which the Dust Off crews could provide care to these patients while transporting them to ready medical facilities; (7) the vital work of the Dust Off crews required consistent combat exposure and often proved to be the difference between life and death for wounded personnel; (8) the revolutionary concept of a dedicated combat life- saving system was cultivated and refined by United States Army Dust Off crews during 11 years of intense conflict in and above the jungles of South Vietnam; (9) innovative and resourceful Dust Off crews in Vietnam were responsible for taking the new concept of helicopter medical evacuation, born just a few years earlier, and revolutionizing it to meet and surpass the previously unattainable goal of delivering a battlefield casualty to an operating table within the vaunted ``golden hour''; (10) some Dust Off units in Vietnam operated so efficiently that they were able to deliver a patient to a waiting medical facility on an average of 33 minutes from the receipt of the mission, which saved the lives of countless personnel in Vietnam, and this legacy continues for modern-day Dust Off crews; (11) the inherent danger of being a member of a Dust Off crew in Vietnam meant that there was a 1 in 3 chance of being wounded or killed; (12) many battles during the Vietnam War raged at night, and members of the Dust Off crews often found themselves searching for a landing zone in complete darkness, in bad weather, over mountainous terrain, and all while being the target of intense enemy fire as they attempted to rescue the wounded, which caused Dust Off crews to suffer a rate of aircraft loss that was more than 3 times that of all other types of combat helicopter missions in Vietnam; (13) the 54th Medical Detachment typified the constant heroism displayed by Dust Off crews in Vietnam, over the span of a 10-month tour, with only 3 flyable helicopters and 40 soldiers in the unit, evacuating 21,435 patients in 8,644 missions while being airborne for 4,832 hours; (14) collectively, the members of the 54th Medical Detachment earned 78 awards for valor, including 1 Medal of Honor, 1 Distinguished Service Cross, 14 Silver Star Medals, 26 Distinguished Flying Crosses, 2 Bronze Star Medals for valor, 4 Air Medals for valor, 4 Soldier's Medals, and 26 Purple Heart Medals; (15) the 54th Medical Detachment displayed heroism on a daily basis and set the standard for all Dust Off crews in Vietnam; (16) 5 members of the 54th Medical Detachment are in the Dust Off Hall of Fame, 3 are in the Army Aviation Hall of Fame, and 1 is the only United States Army aviator in the National Aviation Hall of Fame; (17) Dust Off crew members are among the most highly decorated soldiers in American military history; (18) in early 1964, Major Charles L. Kelly was the Commanding Officer of the 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance), Provisional, in Soc Trang, South Vietnam; (19) Major Kelly helped to forge the Dust Off call-sign into history as one of the most welcomed phrases to be heard over the radio by wounded soldiers in perilous and dire situations; (20) in 1964, Major Kelly was killed in action as he gallantly maneuvered his aircraft to save a wounded American soldier and several Vietnamese soldiers and boldly replied, after being warned to stay away from the landing zone due to the ferocity of enemy fire, ``When I have your wounded.''; (21) General William Westmoreland, Commander, Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (1964-1968), singled out Major Kelly as an example of ``the greatness of the human spirit'' and highlighted his famous reply as an inspiration to all in combat; (22) General Creighton Abrams, Westmoreland's successor (1968-1972), and former Chief of Staff of the United States Army, highlighted the heroism of Dust Off crews, ``A special word about the Dust Offs . . . Courage above and beyond the call of duty was sort of routine to them. It was a daily thing, part of the way they lived. That's the great part, and it meant so much to every last man who served there. Whether he ever got hurt or not, he knew Dust Off was there.''; (23) Dust Off crews possessed unique skills and traits that made them highly successful in aeromedical evacuation in Vietnam, including indomitable courage, extraordinary aviation skill and sound judgment under fire, high-level medical expertise, and an unequaled dedication to the preservation of human life; (24) members of the United States Armed Forces on the ground in Vietnam had their confidence and battlefield prowess reinforced knowing that there were heroic Dust Off crews just a few minutes from the fight, which was instrumental to their well-being, willingness to fight, and morale; (25) military families in the United States knew that their loved ones would receive the quickest and best possible care in the event of a war-time injury, thanks to the Dust Off crews; (26) the willingness of Dust Off crews to also risk their lives to save helpless civilians left an immeasurably positive impression on the people of Vietnam and exemplified the finest American ideals of compassion and humanity; and (27) Dust Off crews from the Vietnam War hailed from every State in the United States and represented numerous ethnic, religious, and cultural backgrounds. SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL. (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate shall make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on behalf of Congress, of a single gold medal of appropriate design in honor of the Dust Off crews of the Vietnam War, collectively, in recognition of their heroic military service, which saved countless lives and contributed directly to the defense of our country.

(3) nearing the end of world war ii, the united states army began using helicopters for medical evacuation and years later, during the korean war, these helicopter air ambulances were responsible for transporting 17,700 united states casualties; (4) during the vietnam war, with the use of helicopter air ambulances, united states army dust off crews pioneered the concept of dedicated and rapid medical evacuation and rescued almost 900,000 united states, south vietnamese, and other allied sick and wounded, as well as wounded enemy forces; (5) helicopters proved to be a revolutionary tool to assist those injured on the battlefield; (6) highly skilled and intrepid, dust off crews were able to operate the helicopters and land them on almost any terrain in nearly any weather to pick up wounded, after which the dust off crews could provide care to these patients while transporting them to ready medical facilities; (7) the vital work of the dust off crews required consistent combat exposure and often proved to be the difference between life and death for wounded personnel; (8) the revolutionary concept of a dedicated combat life- saving system was cultivated and refined by united states army dust off crews during 11 years of intense conflict in and above the jungles of south vietnam; (9) innovative and resourceful dust off crews in vietnam were responsible for taking the new concept of helicopter medical evacuation, born just a few years earlier, and revolutionizing it to meet and surpass the previously unattainable goal of delivering a battlefield casualty to an operating table within the vaunted ``golden hour''; (10) some dust off units in vietnam operated so efficiently that they were able to deliver a patient to a waiting medical facility on an average of 33 minutes from the receipt of the mission, which saved the lives of countless personnel in vietnam, and this legacy continues for modern-day dust off crews;

(13) the 54th medical detachment typified the constant heroism displayed by dust off crews in vietnam, over the span of a 10-month tour, with only 3 flyable helicopters and 40 soldiers in the unit, evacuating 21,435 patients in 8,644 missions while being airborne for 4,832 hours;

(15) the 54th medical detachment displayed heroism on a daily basis and set the standard for all dust off crews in vietnam; (16) 5 members of the 54th medical detachment are in the dust off hall of fame, 3 are in the army aviation hall of fame, and 1 is the only united states army aviator in the national aviation hall of fame; (17) dust off crew members are among the most highly decorated soldiers in american military history; (18) in early 1964, major charles l. kelly was the commanding officer of the 57th medical detachment (helicopter ambulance), provisional, in soc trang, south vietnam; (19) major kelly helped to forge the dust off call-sign into history as one of the most welcomed phrases to be heard over the radio by wounded soldiers in perilous and dire situations; (20) in 1964, major kelly was killed in action as he gallantly maneuvered his aircraft to save a wounded american soldier and several vietnamese soldiers and boldly replied, after being warned to stay away from the landing zone due to the ferocity of enemy fire, ``when i have your wounded.''; (21) general william westmoreland, commander, military assistance command, vietnam (1964-1968), singled out major kelly as an example of ``the greatness of the human spirit'' and highlighted his famous reply as an inspiration to all in combat; (22) general creighton abrams, westmoreland's successor (1968-1972), and former chief of staff of the united states army, highlighted the heroism of dust off crews, ``a special word about the dust offs . . . courage above and beyond the call of duty was sort of routine to them. it was a daily thing, part of the way they lived. that's the great part, and it meant so much to every last man who served there. whether he ever got hurt or not, he knew dust off was there.'';

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to provide enhanced safety in pipeline transportation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleagues Senators Fischer, Booker, and Peters to introduce the Securing America's Future Energy: Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety, SAFE PIPES, Act, reauthorizing the Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration, PHMSA. Safe and secure pipeline infrastructure is critical to our nation, and is especially important to Montanans--for economic opportunity and environmental protection. We had a great bipartisan group of Senators working on this legislation. I [[Page S7917]] would like to thank Senator Fischer for traveling to Billings, Montana to chair the first in a series of hearings on pipeline safety and coordinating efforts to write this important legislation. Additionally, I thank Senators Booker and Peters for their work drafting this legislation. In Montana, we have some of the country's most pristine wild spaces along with an abundance on natural resources. Montana produces approximately 30 million barrels of crude oil, 63 billion cubic feet of natural gas, and 42 million short tons of coal annually. We export 60 percent of this energy. The oil and gas industries support the employment of over 43,000 Montanans. Likewise, Montana's unspoiled mountains and streams is the main motivator for many visiting Montana. The tourism industry supports the employment of over 53,000 Montanans. It is needless to say, but it is imperative that both jobs are protected. This legislation does just that, by improving pipeline inspection report turnaround times, increasing focus on pipeline river crossings, helping fill vacant inspector positions, facilitating communications between PHMSA and State agencies, and enabling PHMSA to conduct safety research with industry experts. I look forward to continue my work, along with my colleagues, on enhancing pipeline safety, protecting our economic and environmental resources, and shepherding this legislation across the finish line. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7915-S7917] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Mr. Manchin): S. 2268.

(3) nearing the end of World War II, the United States Army began using helicopters for medical evacuation and years later, during the Korean War, these helicopter air ambulances were responsible for transporting 17,700 United States casualties; (4) during the Vietnam War, with the use of helicopter air ambulances, United States Army Dust Off crews pioneered the concept of dedicated and rapid medical evacuation and rescued almost 900,000 United States, South Vietnamese, and other allied sick and wounded, as well as wounded enemy forces; (5) helicopters proved to be a revolutionary tool to assist those injured on the battlefield; (6) highly skilled and intrepid, Dust Off crews were able to operate the helicopters and land them on almost any terrain in nearly any weather to pick up wounded, after which the Dust Off crews could provide care to these patients while transporting them to ready medical facilities; (7) the vital work of the Dust Off crews required consistent combat exposure and often proved to be the difference between life and death for wounded personnel; (8) the revolutionary concept of a dedicated combat life- saving system was cultivated and refined by United States Army Dust Off crews during 11 years of intense conflict in and above the jungles of South Vietnam; (9) innovative and resourceful Dust Off crews in Vietnam were responsible for taking the new concept of helicopter medical evacuation, born just a few years earlier, and revolutionizing it to meet and surpass the previously unattainable goal of delivering a battlefield casualty to an operating table within the vaunted ``golden hour''; (10) some Dust Off units in Vietnam operated so efficiently that they were able to deliver a patient to a waiting medical facility on an average of 33 minutes from the receipt of the mission, which saved the lives of countless personnel in Vietnam, and this legacy continues for modern-day Dust Off crews; (11) the inherent danger of being a member of a Dust Off crew in Vietnam meant that there was a 1 in 3 chance of being wounded or killed; (12) many battles during the Vietnam War raged at night, and members of the Dust Off crews often found themselves searching for a landing zone in complete darkness, in bad weather, over mountainous terrain, and all while being the target of intense enemy fire as they attempted to rescue the wounded, which caused Dust Off crews to suffer a rate of aircraft loss that was more than 3 times that of all other types of combat helicopter missions in Vietnam; (13) the 54th Medical Detachment typified the constant heroism displayed by Dust Off crews in Vietnam, over the span of a 10-month tour, with only 3 flyable helicopters and 40 soldiers in the unit, evacuating 21,435 patients in 8,644 missions while being airborne for 4,832 hours; (14) collectively, the members of the 54th Medical Detachment earned 78 awards for valor, including 1 Medal of Honor, 1 Distinguished Service Cross, 14 Silver Star Medals, 26 Distinguished Flying Crosses, 2 Bronze Star Medals for valor, 4 Air Medals for valor, 4 Soldier's Medals, and 26 Purple Heart Medals; (15) the 54th Medical Detachment displayed heroism on a daily basis and set the standard for all Dust Off crews in Vietnam; (16) 5 members of the 54th Medical Detachment are in the Dust Off Hall of Fame, 3 are in the Army Aviation Hall of Fame, and 1 is the only United States Army aviator in the National Aviation Hall of Fame; (17) Dust Off crew members are among the most highly decorated soldiers in American military history; (18) in early 1964, Major Charles L. Kelly was the Commanding Officer of the 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance), Provisional, in Soc Trang, South Vietnam; (19) Major Kelly helped to forge the Dust Off call-sign into history as one of the most welcomed phrases to be heard over the radio by wounded soldiers in perilous and dire situations; (20) in 1964, Major Kelly was killed in action as he gallantly maneuvered his aircraft to save a wounded American soldier and several Vietnamese soldiers and boldly replied, after being warned to stay away from the landing zone due to the ferocity of enemy fire, ``When I have your wounded.''; (21) General William Westmoreland, Commander, Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (1964-1968), singled out Major Kelly as an example of ``the greatness of the human spirit'' and highlighted his famous reply as an inspiration to all in combat; (22) General Creighton Abrams, Westmoreland's successor (1968-1972), and former Chief of Staff of the United States Army, highlighted the heroism of Dust Off crews, ``A special word about the Dust Offs . . . Courage above and beyond the call of duty was sort of routine to them. It was a daily thing, part of the way they lived. That's the great part, and it meant so much to every last man who served there. Whether he ever got hurt or not, he knew Dust Off was there.''; (23) Dust Off crews possessed unique skills and traits that made them highly successful in aeromedical evacuation in Vietnam, including indomitable courage, extraordinary aviation skill and sound judgment under fire, high-level medical expertise, and an unequaled dedication to the preservation of human life; (24) members of the United States Armed Forces on the ground in Vietnam had their confidence and battlefield prowess reinforced knowing that there were heroic Dust Off crews just a few minutes from the fight, which was instrumental to their well-being, willingness to fight, and morale; (25) military families in the United States knew that their loved ones would receive the quickest and best possible care in the event of a war-time injury, thanks to the Dust Off crews; (26) the willingness of Dust Off crews to also risk their lives to save helpless civilians left an immeasurably positive impression on the people of Vietnam and exemplified the finest American ideals of compassion and humanity; and (27) Dust Off crews from the Vietnam War hailed from every State in the United States and represented numerous ethnic, religious, and cultural backgrounds. SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL. (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate shall make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on behalf of Congress, of a single gold medal of appropriate design in honor of the Dust Off crews of the Vietnam War, collectively, in recognition of their heroic military service, which saved countless lives and contributed directly to the defense of our country.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to provide enhanced safety in pipeline transportation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleagues Senators Fischer, Booker, and Peters to introduce the Securing America's Future Energy: Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety, SAFE PIPES, Act, reauthorizing the Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration, PHMSA. Safe and secure pipeline infrastructure is critical to our nation, and is especially important to Montanans--for economic opportunity and environmental protection. We had a great bipartisan group of Senators working on this legislation. I [[Page S7917]] would like to thank Senator Fischer for traveling to Billings, Montana to chair the first in a series of hearings on pipeline safety and coordinating efforts to write this important legislation. Additionally, I thank Senators Booker and Peters for their work drafting this legislation. In Montana, we have some of the country's most pristine wild spaces along with an abundance on natural resources. Montana produces approximately 30 million barrels of crude oil, 63 billion cubic feet of natural gas, and 42 million short tons of coal annually. We export 60 percent of this energy. The oil and gas industries support the employment of over 43,000 Montanans. Likewise, Montana's unspoiled mountains and streams is the main motivator for many visiting Montana. The tourism industry supports the employment of over 53,000 Montanans. It is needless to say, but it is imperative that both jobs are protected. This legislation does just that, by improving pipeline inspection report turnaround times, increasing focus on pipeline river crossings, helping fill vacant inspector positions, facilitating communications between PHMSA and State agencies, and enabling PHMSA to conduct safety research with industry experts. I look forward to continue my work, along with my colleagues, on enhancing pipeline safety, protecting our economic and environmental resources, and shepherding this legislation across the finish line. ____________________","Congressional Record, Volume 161 Issue 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015) [Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7915-S7917] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Mr. Manchin): S. 2268.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to provide enhanced safety in pipeline transportation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleagues Senators Fischer, Booker, and Peters to introduce the Securing America's Future Energy: Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety, SAFE PIPES, Act, reauthorizing the Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration, PHMSA. Safe and secure pipeline infrastructure is critical to our nation, and is especially important to Montanans--for economic opportunity and environmental protection. We had a great bipartisan group of Senators working on this legislation. I [[Page S7917]] would like to thank Senator Fischer for traveling to Billings, Montana to chair the first in a series of hearings on pipeline safety and coordinating efforts to write this important legislation. Additionally, I thank Senators Booker and Peters for their work drafting this legislation. In Montana, we have some of the country's most pristine wild spaces along with an abundance on natural resources. Montana produces approximately 30 million barrels of crude oil, 63 billion cubic feet of natural gas, and 42 million short tons of coal annually. We export 60 percent of this energy. The oil and gas industries support the employment of over 43,000 Montanans. Likewise, Montana's unspoiled mountains and streams is the main motivator for many visiting Montana. The tourism industry supports the employment of over 53,000 Montanans. It is needless to say, but it is imperative that both jobs are protected. This legislation does just that, by improving pipeline inspection report turnaround times, increasing focus on pipeline river crossings, helping fill vacant inspector positions, facilitating communications between PHMSA and State agencies, and enabling PHMSA to conduct safety research with industry experts. I look forward to continue my work, along with my colleagues, on enhancing pipeline safety, protecting our economic and environmental resources, and shepherding this legislation across the finish line. ____________________",package_114_41.csv,19182,19182,19254,"[congressional record volume 161, number 167 (tuesday, november 10, 2015)] [senate] [pages s7915-s7917] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] statements on introduced bills and joint resolutions by mr. cornyn (for himself and mr. manchin): s. 2268. a bill to award a congressional gold medal to the united states army dust off crews of the vietnam war, collectively, in recognition of their extraordinary heroism and life-saving actions in vietnam; to the committee on banking, housing, and urban affairs. mr. cornyn. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the record. there being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the record, as follows: s. 2268 be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled, section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ``dust off crews of the vietnam war congressional gold medal act''. sec. 2. findings. the congress finds that-- (1) a united states army dust off crewman is a helicopter crew member who served honorably in the vietnam war aboard a helicopter air ambulance under the radio call sign ``dust off''; (2) dust off crews performed aeromedical evacuation for united states, vietnamese, and allied forces inside south vietnam from may 1962 through march 1973. (3) nearing the end of world war ii, the united states army began using helicopters for medical evacuation and years later, during the korean war, these helicopter air ambulances were responsible for transporting 17,700 united states casualties; (4) during the vietnam war, with the use of helicopter air ambulances, united states army dust off crews pioneered the concept of dedicated and rapid medical evacuation and rescued almost 900,000 united states, south vietnamese, and other allied sick and wounded, as well as wounded enemy forces; (5) helicopters proved to be a revolutionary tool to assist those injured on the battlefield; (6) highly skilled and intrepid, dust off crews were able to operate the helicopters and land them on almost any terrain in nearly any weather to pick up wounded, after which the dust off crews could provide care to these patients while transporting them to ready medical facilities; (7) the vital work of the dust off crews required consistent combat exposure and often proved to be the difference between life and death for wounded personnel; (8) the revolutionary concept of a dedicated combat life- saving system was cultivated and refined by united states army dust off crews during 11 years of intense conflict in and above the jungles of south vietnam; (9) innovative and resourceful dust off crews in vietnam were responsible for taking the new concept of helicopter medical evacuation, born just a few years earlier, and revolutionizing it to meet and surpass the previously unattainable goal of delivering a battlefield casualty to an operating table within the vaunted ``golden hour''; (10) some dust off units in vietnam operated so efficiently that they were able to deliver a patient to a waiting medical facility on an average of 33 minutes from the receipt of the mission, which saved the lives of countless personnel in vietnam, and this legacy continues for modern-day dust off crews; (11) the inherent danger of being a member of a dust off crew in vietnam meant that there was a 1 in 3 chance of being wounded or killed; (12) many battles during the vietnam war raged at night, and members of the dust off crews often found themselves searching for a landing zone in complete darkness, in bad weather, over mountainous terrain, and all while being the target of intense enemy fire as they attempted to rescue the wounded, which caused dust off crews to suffer a rate of aircraft loss that was more than 3 times that of all other types of combat helicopter missions in vietnam; (13) the 54th medical detachment typified the constant heroism displayed by dust off crews in vietnam, over the span of a 10-month tour, with only 3 flyable helicopters and 40 soldiers in the unit, evacuating 21,435 patients in 8,644 missions while being airborne for 4,832 hours; (14) collectively, the members of the 54th medical detachment earned 78 awards for valor, including 1 medal of honor, 1 distinguished service cross, 14 silver star medals, 26 distinguished flying crosses, 2 bronze star medals for valor, 4 air medals for valor, 4 soldier's medals, and 26 purple heart medals; (15) the 54th medical detachment displayed heroism on a daily basis and set the standard for all dust off crews in vietnam; (16) 5 members of the 54th medical detachment are in the dust off hall of fame, 3 are in the army aviation hall of fame, and 1 is the only united states army aviator in the national aviation hall of fame; (17) dust off crew members are among the most highly decorated soldiers in american military history; (18) in early 1964, major charles l. kelly was the commanding officer of the 57th medical detachment (helicopter ambulance), provisional, in soc trang, south vietnam; (19) major kelly helped to forge the dust off call-sign into history as one of the most welcomed phrases to be heard over the radio by wounded soldiers in perilous and dire situations; (20) in 1964, major kelly was killed in action as he gallantly maneuvered his aircraft to save a wounded american soldier and several vietnamese soldiers and boldly replied, after being warned to stay away from the landing zone due to the ferocity of enemy fire, ``when i have your wounded.''; (21) general william westmoreland, commander, military assistance command, vietnam (1964-1968), singled out major kelly as an example of ``the greatness of the human spirit'' and highlighted his famous reply as an inspiration to all in combat; (22) general creighton abrams, westmoreland's successor (1968-1972), and former chief of staff of the united states army, highlighted the heroism of dust off crews, ``a special word about the dust offs . . . courage above and beyond the call of duty was sort of routine to them. it was a daily thing, part of the way they lived. that's the great part, and it meant so much to every last man who served there. whether he ever got hurt or not, he knew dust off was there.''; (23) dust off crews possessed unique skills and traits that made them highly successful in aeromedical evacuation in vietnam, including indomitable courage, extraordinary aviation skill and sound judgment under fire, high-level medical expertise, and an unequaled dedication to the preservation of human life; (24) members of the united states armed forces on the ground in vietnam had their confidence and battlefield prowess reinforced knowing that there were heroic dust off crews just a few minutes from the fight, which was instrumental to their well-being, willingness to fight, and morale; (25) military families in the united states knew that their loved ones would receive the quickest and best possible care in the event of a war-time injury, thanks to the dust off crews; (26) the willingness of dust off crews to also risk their lives to save helpless civilians left an immeasurably positive impression on the people of vietnam and exemplified the finest american ideals of compassion and humanity; and (27) dust off crews from the vietnam war hailed from every state in the united states and represented numerous ethnic, religious, and cultural backgrounds. sec. 3. congressional gold medal. (a) presentation authorized.--the speaker of the house of representatives and the president pro tempore of the senate shall make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on behalf of congress, of a single gold medal of appropriate design in honor of the dust off crews of the vietnam war, collectively, in recognition of their heroic military service, which saved countless lives and contributed directly to the defense of our country.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to provide enhanced safety in pipeline transportation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleagues Senators Fischer, Booker, and Peters to introduce the Securing America's Future Energy: Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety, SAFE PIPES, Act, reauthorizing the Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration, PHMSA. Safe and secure pipeline infrastructure is critical to our nation, and is especially important to Montanans--for economic opportunity and environmental protection. We had a great bipartisan group of Senators working on this legislation. I [[Page S7917]] would like to thank Senator Fischer for traveling to Billings, Montana to chair the first in a series of hearings on pipeline safety and coordinating efforts to write this important legislation. Additionally, I thank Senators Booker and Peters for their work drafting this legislation. In Montana, we have some of the country's most pristine wild spaces along with an abundance on natural resources. Montana produces approximately 30 million barrels of crude oil, 63 billion cubic feet of natural gas, and 42 million short tons of coal annually. We export 60 percent of this energy. The oil and gas industries support the employment of over 43,000 Montanans. Likewise, Montana's unspoiled mountains and streams is the main motivator for many visiting Montana. The tourism industry supports the employment of over 53,000 Montanans. It is needless to say, but it is imperative that both jobs are protected. This legislation does just that, by improving pipeline inspection report turnaround times, increasing focus on pipeline river crossings, helping fill vacant inspector positions, facilitating communications between PHMSA and State agencies, and enabling PHMSA to conduct safety research with industry experts. I look forward to continue my work, along with my colleagues, on enhancing pipeline safety, protecting our economic and environmental resources, and shepherding this legislation across the finish line. ____________________","[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7916-S7917] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] By Mrs. FISCHER (for herself, Mr. Booker, Mr. Daines, and Mr. Peters): S. 2276.

CREC-2015-11-10-pt1-PgS7954-2,CREC-2015-11-10,114,PRO BONO WORK TO EMPOWER AND REPRESENT ACT OF 2015,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7954-S7955] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] PRO BONO WORK TO EMPOWER AND REPRESENT ACT OF 2015 Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 2280, introduced earlier today. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title. The legislative clerk read as follows: A bill (S. 2280) to promote pro bono legal services as a critical way in which to empower survivors of domestic violence. There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill. Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table. The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The bill (S. 2280) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, was read the third time, and passed, as follows: S. 2280 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the ``Pro bono Work to Empower and Represent Act of 2015'' or ``POWER Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds the following: (1) Extremely high rates of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking exist at the local, State, and national levels and such violence or behavior harms the most vulnerable members of our society. (2) According to a study commissioned by the Department of Justice, nearly 25 percent of women suffer from domestic violence during their lifetime. (3) Proactive efforts should be made available in all forums to provide pro bono legal services and eliminate the violence that destroys lives and shatters families. (4) A variety of factors cause domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, and a variety of solutions at the local, State, and national level are necessary to combat such violence or behavior. (5) According to the National Network to End Domestic Violence, which conducted a census including almost 1,700 assistance programs, over the course of 1 day in September 2014, more than 10,000 requests for services, including legal representation, were not met. (6) Pro bono assistance can help fill this need by providing not only legal representation, but also access to emergency shelter, transportation, and childcare. (7) Research and studies have demonstrated that the provision of legal assistance to victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking reduces the probability of such violence or behavior reoccurring in the future and can help survivors move forward. (8) Legal representation increases the possibility of successfully obtaining a protective order against an attacker, preventing further mental and physical injury to a victim and his or her family, demonstrated by a study that found that 83 percent of victims represented by an attorney were able to obtain a protective order compared to 32 percent of victims without an attorney. (9) The American Bar Association Model Rules include commentary that ``every lawyer, regardless of professional prominence or professional workload, has a responsibility to provide legal services to those unable to pay, and personal involvement in the problems of the disadvantaged can be one of the most rewarding experiences in the life of a lawyer''. (10) As representatives of the Department of Justice, the duty of United States Attorneys is to present ``equal and impartial justice to all its citizens,'' which should include, especially, survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking who might not otherwise know how to seek advice and protection. (11) As Federal leaders who have knowledge of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking in their localities, United States Attorneys should encourage lawyers to provide pro bono resources in an effort to help victims of such [[Page S7955]] violence or behavior to escape the cycle of abuse. (12) A dedicated army of pro bono attorneys focused on this mission will inspire others to devote efforts to this cause and will raise awareness of the scourge of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking throughout the country. (13) Communities, by providing awareness of pro bono legal services and assistance to survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, will empower those survivors to move forward with their lives.

(2) according to a study commissioned by the department of justice, nearly 25 percent of women suffer from domestic violence during their lifetime. (3) proactive efforts should be made available in all forums to provide pro bono legal services and eliminate the violence that destroys lives and shatters families. (4) a variety of factors cause domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, and a variety of solutions at the local, state, and national level are necessary to combat such violence or behavior. (5) according to the national network to end domestic violence, which conducted a census including almost 1,700 assistance programs, over the course of 1 day in september 2014, more than 10,000 requests for services, including legal representation, were not met. (6) pro bono assistance can help fill this need by providing not only legal representation, but also access to emergency shelter, transportation, and childcare. (7) research and studies have demonstrated that the provision of legal assistance to victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking reduces the probability of such violence or behavior reoccurring in the future and can help survivors move forward. (8) legal representation increases the possibility of successfully obtaining a protective order against an attacker, preventing further mental and physical injury to a victim and his or her family, demonstrated by a study that found that 83 percent of victims represented by an attorney were able to obtain a protective order compared to 32 percent of victims without an attorney. (9) the american bar association model rules include commentary that ``every lawyer, regardless of professional prominence or professional workload, has a responsibility to provide legal services to those unable to pay, and personal involvement in the problems of the disadvantaged can be one of the most rewarding experiences in the life of a lawyer''. (10) as representatives of the department of justice, the duty of united states attorneys is to present ``equal and impartial justice to all its citizens,'' which should include, especially, survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking who might not otherwise know how to seek advice and protection. (11) as federal leaders who have knowledge of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking in their localities, united states attorneys should encourage lawyers to provide pro bono resources in an effort to help victims of such [[page s7955]] violence or behavior to escape the cycle of abuse. (12) a dedicated army of pro bono attorneys focused on this mission will inspire others to devote efforts to this cause and will raise awareness of the scourge of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking throughout the country. (13) communities, by providing awareness of pro bono legal services and assistance to survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, will empower those survivors to move forward with their lives. sec. 3. u.s. attorneys to promote empowerment events. (a) in general.--not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this act, and not less often than once each year thereafter, each united states attorney, or his or her designee, for each judicial district shall lead not less than 1 public event, in partnership with a state, local, tribal, or territorial domestic violence service provider or coalition and a state or local volunteer lawyer project, promoting pro bono legal services as a critical way in which to empower survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking and engage citizens in assisting those survivors. (b) districts containing indian tribes and tribal organizations.--during each 3-year period, a united states attorney, or his or her designee, for a judicial district that contains an indian tribe or tribal organization (as those terms are defined in section 4 of the indian self- determination and education assistance act (25 u.s.c. 450b)) shall lead not less than 1 public event promoting pro bono legal services under subsection (a) in partnership with an indian tribe or tribal organization with the intent of increasing the provision of pro bono legal services for indian or alaska native victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.

Res. 302 Whereas Israel is a democratic ally and major strategic partner of the United States, as codified by the United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-296), and cooperation between Israel and the United States continues to increase in importance with a swiftly shifting security situation in the Middle East and North Africa; Whereas Jerusalem is an undivided city, eternal capital of Israel, holiest city for the Jewish people, central to the worship of three monotheistic religions, and unique in the Middle East region as a city of religious tolerance where Israel guarantees access, security, and respect for the three monotheistic religions to worship in peace at holy sites; Whereas, upon Israel securing control of Jerusalem in 1967, it has maintained a policy of keeping the Haram Al Sharif specifically open for Muslim prayer, welcoming over 3,500,000 regular worshipers annually; Whereas the Government of Israel upholds the 1994 Treaty of Peace Between the State of Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, which states in Article Nine that each party ``will provide freedom of access to places of religious and historical significance,'' as well as ``act together to promote interfaith relations among the three monotheistic religions, with the aim of working toward religious understanding, moral commitment, freedom of religious worship, and tolerance and peace''; Whereas Yasser Arafat, Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), committed in his exchange of letters with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on September 9, 1993, that ``the PLO renounces the use of terrorism and other acts of violence and will assume responsibility over all PLO elements and personnel in order to assure their compliance,'' and under the subsequent 1995 Oslo II Accord, the Palestinians pledged to ``abstain from incitement, including hostile propaganda . . . [and to] take legal measures to prevent such incitement by any organizations, groups or individuals within their jurisdiction''; Whereas the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, wrongly announced during the tenth anniversary of Yasser Arafat's death in November 2014 that Israel has no claim to Jerusalem, that the Temple Mount will not be allowed to be ``contaminated'' by Jews, and that Jewish prayer on the Temple Mount would lead to a ``devastating religious war''; Whereas President Abbas falsely claimed during his address to the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015 that the Government of Israel has used ``brutal force to impose its plans to undermine the Islamic and Christian sanctities in Jerusalem'' and announced that the Palestinian Authority is no longer bound by the Oslo Accords; Whereas Israel has in recent weeks been subjected to an alarming wave of terrorism directed against innocent civilians by Palestinians armed with knives, meat cleavers, guns, and cars; Whereas there have been approximately 69 such attacks since the beginning of October 2015, leaving 11 Israelis dead and another 145 wounded; Whereas United States citizens have lost their lives as a result of these terrorist attacks, including Richard Lakin and Eitam Henkin; Whereas these random, gruesome attacks are intended to instill a sense of fear among the people of Israel leading their normal lives, and also destabilize security for both Palestinians and Israelis; Whereas President Barack Obama condemned in the strongest terms Palestinian violence against innocent Israeli citizens and expressed his ``strong belief that Israel has not just the right, but the obligation to protect itself''; Whereas Israel, Jordan, and the United States have reached an agreement regarding the installation of surveillance cameras on the Temple Mount in accordance with the respective responsibilities of the Israeli authorities and the Jordanian Waqf; Whereas President Abbas has helped to fuel the current violence in recent weeks by falsely casting Israel as the brutal aggressor in multiple public speeches, refusing to condemn the lethal terror attacks, and failing to acknowledge Israel's right to self-defense; Whereas President Abbas' statements are part of a pattern of incitement among Palestinian leaders that includes denial of the Jewish heritage of Jerusalem, paying monthly salaries to the families of imprisoned Palestinian terrorists, praising slain terrorists as martyrs, demonizing Jews in official Palestinian Authority media, and encouraging attacks on social media; and Whereas Palestinian leaders have repeatedly threatened to suspend cooperation and further encouraged violence by blaming Israel for killing Palestinian perpetrators of these heinous crimes: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the Senate-- (1) condemns these brutal attacks in the harshest terms possible; (2) welcomes Israel's commitment to the continued maintenance of the status quo on the Temple Mount; (3) urges the international community to join in forcefully condemning these Palestinian terror attacks; (4) clarifies that there is no justification for these types of attacks and that there is a direct correlation between the recent upsurge in violence and Arab incitement regarding the Temple Mount; (5) stands with the people of Israel during these difficult days; (6) supports Israel's right to self-defense and rejects any suggestion of the moral equivalence of Israeli security personnel protecting its citizens from senseless violence and terrorists intent to deliberately take innocent lives; (7) supports the agreement reached to install surveillance cameras on the Temple Mount according to the arrangements to be determined between the parties; (8) calls upon President Abbas to stop all incitement by Palestinian officials and by Palestinian media, to strongly and unequivocally demand an end to the violence, and to take all steps necessary to halt these attacks; (9) expresses support and admiration for individuals and organizations working to encourage cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians; (10) encourages President Abbas to continue strengthening and maintaining security cooperation with Israel; (11) reiterates that Palestinian political goals will never be achieved through violence; and (12) calls on all parties to return to the negotiating table immediately and without preconditions, as direct discussions remain the best avenue to ending the Israeli- Palestinian conflict. ____________________",package_114_41.csv,8463,8463,8535,"[congressional record volume 161, number 167 (tuesday, november 10, 2015)] [senate] [pages s7955-s7956] from the congressional record online through the government publishing office [ www.gpo.gov ] supporting israel and condemning palestinian terror attacks ms. murkowski. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the senate proceed to the immediate consideration of calendar no. 292, s. res. 302. the presiding officer. the clerk will report the resolution by title. the legislative clerk read as follows: a resolution (s. res. 302) expressing the sense of the senate in support of israel and in condemnation of palestinian terror attacks. there being no objection, the senate proceeded to consider the resolution. ms. murkowski. mr. president, i ask unanimous consent that the blumenthal amendment to the resolution be agreed to;

CREC-2015-11-10-pt1-PgS7956-3,CREC-2015-11-10,114,FIFTH CIRCUIT COURT DECISION,"[Congressional Record Volume 161, Number 167 (Tuesday, November 10, 2015)] [Senate] [Pages S7956-S7957] From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [ www.gpo.gov ] FIFTH CIRCUIT COURT DECISION Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we had a very important court of appeals ruling last night. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reviewed the injunction that had been issued by Judge Hanen in Texas, that blocked the President's determination to carry out his DAPA Executive amnesty plan. The court found it improper and unlawful, and ordered it to be stopped. It recalls for us the fact that when the President announced he was going to do this no matter what--before the election--great public outcry arose. Then he said--for political reasons, obviously--well, I am not going to do it before the election, but I will do it after the election. That is when I will issue this Executive amnesty and give lawful presence and Federal benefits and Social Security cards and work authorization to millions of people--4.3 million here in the country illegally. It is a dramatic thing. So the country was in an uproar about it. It was a big [[Page S7957]] factor in the Republicans winning a huge majority in the House and a surging majority in the Senate. So what was this all about? Well, Judge Hanen found that this was wrong. The President didn't have authority to take people Congress has said are here illegally and give them food stamps, health care, Medicaid, and work authorization. It went against the law. He couldn't do that. And he found that this was such an egregious action that it needed to be stopped now through an injunction before the trial even completed. So it was that injunction, that blocking of the President's amnesty, that went up on appeal to the Fifth Circuit, and they upheld Judge Hanen's decision. First, 26 States--over half the States--participated in this litigation against the President's order, and they were found to have legal standing. Then the court found this critical legal fact: They found that the States that were objecting to the President's order were likely to succeed in the final court ruling and on appeal. They found that it would likely succeed. And they noted this, referring to the Secretary of Homeland Security: At its core, this case is about the Secretary's decision to change the immigration classification of millions of illegal aliens on a class-wide basis. The Court went on to say: DAPA would make 4.3 million otherwise removable aliens eligible for lawful presence, employment authorization, and associated benefits, and we must be guided to a degree by common sense as to the manner in which Congress is likely to delegate a policy decision of such economic and political magnitude to an administrative agency. They basically were saying that they see no evidence that such a huge event would be delegated to the administrative bureaucrats at the Department of Homeland Security. Congress, in fact, I believe--and the court went on to say--explicitly laid out how we deal with this. The Fifth Circuit rejected President Obama's claim that he could issue employment documents--the right to work in America--to persons illegally here in any way he sees fit. That is what the administration argued. The court condemned that interpretation, saying: The interpretation of those provisions that the Secretary advances would allow him to grant lawful presence and work authorization to any illegal alien in the United States--an untenable position in light of the Immigration and Nationality Act's intricate system of immigration classifications and employment eligibility. Even with ``special deference'' to the Secretary, the INA flatly does not permit the reclassification of millions of illegal aliens as lawfully present and thereby make them newly eligible for a host of federal and state benefits, including work authorization. That is an absolute refutation of the President's position, as well it should be, because anybody who is familiar with that debate last year knew that it was bogus. The American people knew that argument was bogus, and the court affirmed it just last night with clarity and consistency. They said: Well, historically, the Secretaries have done some of these things. The court doubted that. Quote: Historical practice that is so far afield from the challenged program sheds no light on the Secretary's authority to implement DAPA. Indeed, as the district court recognized, the President explicitly stated that ``it was the failure of Congress to enact such a program that prompted him . . . to `change the law.' '' He asked for this. He asked for legislation to do this, and the House of Representatives said no. And he did it anyway. And the court of appeals slapped that down as being above the powers of the President of the United States, as indeed it is. The court found that this DAPA Program is foreclosed by Congress's careful plan. Quote: ``The program is `manifestly contrary to statute' and therefore was properly enjoined.'' The President of the United States has a duty to the law, a duty to enforce the law whether he likes it or not, and he has a duty to carry out the law. That is his oath. He is the Chief Executive. He is the person responsible for ensuring that the laws of the United States are carried out, and he breached his duty and took steps to absolutely eviscerate law passed by Congress. And being unhappy that Congress refused to change it as he wished it to be changed, he just did it anyway. And that is wrong. The court has slapped him down, as they should. I hope the American people understand that somewhere in this system there is a commitment to law and to propriety and to the right of Congress. Congress is going to have to continue to work on this. It should boldly assert its prerogative to pass laws and its prerogative not to fund Executive amnesties, or any other program we don't think is worthy of being funded.

Mr. President, we had a very important court of appeals ruling last night. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reviewed the injunction that had been issued by Judge Hanen in Texas, that blocked the President's determination to carry out his DAPA Executive amnesty plan. The court found it improper and unlawful, and ordered it to be stopped. It recalls for us the fact that when the President announced he was going to do this no matter what--before the election--great public outcry arose. Then he said--for political reasons, obviously--well, I am not going to do it before the election, but I will do it after the election. That is when I will issue this Executive amnesty and give lawful presence and Federal benefits and Social Security cards and work authorization to millions of people--4.3 million here in the country illegally. It is a dramatic thing. So the country was in an uproar about it. It was a big [[Page S7957]] factor in the Republicans winning a huge majority in the House and a surging majority in the Senate. So what was this all about? Well, Judge Hanen found that this was wrong. The President didn't have authority to take people Congress has said are here illegally and give them food stamps, health care, Medicaid, and work authorization. It went against the law. He couldn't do that. And he found that this was such an egregious action that it needed to be stopped now through an injunction before the trial even completed. So it was that injunction, that blocking of the President's amnesty, that went up on appeal to the Fifth Circuit, and they upheld Judge Hanen's decision. First, 26 States--over half the States--participated in this litigation against the President's order, and they were found to have legal standing. Then the court found this critical legal fact: They found that the States that were objecting to the President's order were likely to succeed in the final court ruling and on appeal. They found that it would likely succeed. And they noted this, referring to the Secretary of Homeland Security: At its core, this case is about the Secretary's decision to change the immigration classification of millions of illegal aliens on a class-wide basis.
